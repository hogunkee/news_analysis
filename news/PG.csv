0,PG,"Unilever (UN) shares tumbled early Thursday as the consumer goods giant reported sales in the third quarter were weaker than expected, while rival Nestle (NSRGY) warned restructuring costs would weigh on profit margins.Unilever, the owner of iconic brands such as Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream, said sales grew 2.6% in Q3 from a year ago. Analysts had projected a sales gains of 3.9%. The Anglo-Dutch company cited competition from smaller and more nimble players, as well as natural disasters in global markets, for weakening sales.Shares dived 6.1% to close at 57.65 on the stock market today, tumbling through their 50-day moving average. Unilever technically is back in buy range from a July breakout of 57.83, but the high-volume move through the 50-day should make investors wary.While Swiss rival Nestle grew sales in Q3, it cautioned Thursday that restructuring charges of 400 million to 500 million Swiss francs ($410 million to $512 million) would eat into profit margins in 2017, reports said.Unilever rejected a $143 billion bid by packaged foods giant Kraft Heinz (KHC) earlier this year, and an analyst told Reuters that lower ad and promotional spending since then may have hurt its sales.Meanwhile, U.S. consumer giant Procter & Gamble (PG) reports Friday and investors are bracing for tepid results.The analyst consensus view is for EPS of $1.07, up 4% vs a year ago, on revenue of $16.64 billion, up less than 1%, according to Zacks Investment Research.P&G narrowly won a proxy fight last week vs. Nelson Peltz, who is challenging the results. Peltz, who runs Trian Fund Management, wanted the Dow component to focus more on innovative brands and less on legacy, core products.Nestle shares dipped 0.3% to 86.03 within a flat base with an 89.50 buy point Thursday. Procter & Gamble shed 0.5% to 91.59, undercutting a 92.10 buy point. Kraft Heinz lost 0.8%, hitting its lowest levels since early 2016.The consumer goods sector has cooled this year as tastes swing away from the largest players and toward niche and alternative brands.

1,PG,"The stock market loved reports that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) held (now-inactive) talks to sell its studio, TV and international assets to Walt Disney (DIS). But amid the enthusiasm, there's also some serious skepticism surrounding a possible union of Mouse and Fox — not just from analysts, but from some fans.XThe benefits of a deal are immediately visible: Disney would gain another powerful tentacle in movie studio 20th Century Fox, adding a slew of titles to its already enormous library of content. Disney's studio arm has had the sheen of invincibility in recent years as its hit machine cranks out flick after flick, and enveloping Fox's blockbuster franchises like ""Alien"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" surely wouldn't hurt. (Plus, Wolverine fans would be happy to have Fox's ""X-Men"" reunited with the Marvel family at Disney — fingers crossed for some crossover action.)Disney ""is arguably the best content engine in the world in our view and FOXA potentially offers an opportunity to fill in some key gaps,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall. ""If acquired, we think the resultant DIS would be the global content king.""And in an age of powerful streaming platforms like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN), Disney is potentially better positioned to compete with its arsenal of intellectual property than its budding stand-alone streaming service, which doesn't even go live until 2019.You'll recall that the Mouse delivered a couple of not-insignificant blows to Netflix's library by deciding to pull its movies off the platform's roster. Netflix, for its part, lured away ""Scandal"" creator Shonda Rhimes from Disney-owned ABC Studios. But even Netflix's planned $7 billion to $8 billion in content spending will have to contend with the deep bench at Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Walt Disney Animation and ABC Studios.Shares of Disney closed up 1% on the stock market today after rallying 2% Monday. Fox added 1.1% after surging 10% yesterday. Netflix fell 2.1%, and Amazon edged up 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: On the search for even more stocks with actionable trading opportunities? Check out our Stock Lists page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more. Barclays analysts note that an acquisition of Fox's studio and TV assets would help Disney's streaming efforts down the line, bolstering RBC's recent argument that Disney's studio and theme parks segments are strong enough to continue liking the stock, despite concerns about ESPN's subscriber-growth struggles and the greater media network segment.Some of the eyebrow-raising, then, comes from the idea that Disney should avoid more TV troubles.Cowen's Doug Creutz, not bothering to hide his incredulity, says he ""can't believe this is serious"" and that the reported deal ""makes zero sense."" (Unlike Marvel fans, he sees less use in bringing ""X-Men"" into the fold.)""Investors who are bullish on Disney like it for the non-TV assets,"" he wrote. ""So why would Disney want to increase its exposure to TV? Disney already has plenty of scale, so adding scale isn't that helpful (and it makes the business more difficult to manage for whoever Iger's successor is).""And a Fox company that's left with just broadcast, cable news and sports networks is arguably worth a lot less than it would be in its current state.""In a world where content is getting more valuable, but networks are being devalued, this seems like it would be suicide,"" said Creutz.Movie buffs have their own concerns, in terms of creative output. Movie site Collider notes that Disney's apparent aversion to R-rated films could affect 20th Century Fox, which has released more adult flicks such as ""Logan"" and the Amy Schumer comedy ""Snatched.""""If Disney purchases Fox, what happens to Fox's slate? Do they stop making 'Deadpool' or do they try to make it PG-13 so that it fits with the rest of the Marvel Studios brand?"" asks Collider writer Matt Goldberg.Expect more chatter about this on Fox's and Disney's earnings calls, this Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.RELATED:8 Key Facts: What Disney's Rogue Move Means For Netflix SubscribersStreaming Content May Become King, But Who Will Wear The Crown?

13,PG,"Pro golfer George Archer was a living example of how being an expert in one field in no way means you will be well versed, let alone an expert, in another.XPut another way, you might be a master in medicine, an ace in engineering, or an eagle of law. But do not for a moment believe that stock investing, even in bullish times like 2017, will be easy-breezy.Long-term trading and investing success in the stock market stems not from being born in a certain area code, or having the right contacts or friends.It's about learning how the market really works. It's about understanding why fundamentals matter — from earnings and sales to profit margins and return on equity to a company's standing within its industry — and how investor psychology drives major price trends. It's about applying sound rules in both buying and selling to temper and tame one's ego.Back to Archer. The San Mateo High School grad began skipping basketball practice on Mondays so he could show up for caddie golf day at the Peninsula Golf & Country Club in northern California. The club pro at PG&CC, Bud Ward, gave him a few swing tips. Archer was hooked. And the rest was golfing history.In 1969, five years after turning pro in the sport, the 6-foot-6 athlete towered over the field in Augusta National, winning the Masters championship with a one-stroke victory over Tom Weiskopf, Billy Casper and George Knudson.""His deft putting stroke, developed by putting for quarters hour after hour on the Lincoln Park putting green, held up under The Masters pressure of the final few holes,"" Mike Jamieson, PG&CC club historian, told IBD. ""For the rest of his life he was considered to be one of the best putters in golf.""IBD'S TAKE: Charts give an investor an edge. The reason: They help you read the signals that institutional investors are eager to crowd into a stock. A sudden increase in demand by mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, pensions and the like produces breakouts from bases including the flat base, a launchpad for big breakouts and tremendous price gains. Learn the elements of this bullish pattern via this Investor's Corner column.Archer went on to capture wins in 13 regular PGA events and 19 official victories on the newly formed PGA Senior Tour, now known as the PGA Champions Tour.""He had stopped at 999 Tour starts because he thought it was cooler than 1,000,"" Jamieson said.In total, Archer (1939-2005) bagged 44 titles in his 40-year professional career before passing away in 2005. And yet the well-liked man never learned to read or write beyond 3rd grade level. Archer tried to improve. He bought and used instructional tapes and worked hard at it. But Archer could never get to an adult-reading level.""He had navigated the world on a weekly basis, driving, flying, playing the Tour, and had hid his secret from everyone, even his closest friends,"" Jamieson said. One reason: to avoid getting heckled by fans.Clearly, a pro-level golfer can fix hitches in his swing or attain new techniques with the help of an instructor. No reading or writing necessary. But what if Archer could have read magazine articles on the sport? What if he could have picked up a copy of that 1957 classic, ""Ben Hogan's Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf,"" written by the winner of nine majors? Could Archer himself have bagged a few more majors?The George Archer Memorial Foundation for Literacy, founded by Archer's wife Donna soon after his death, seeks to quash illiteracy. It has raised nearly $750,000 in net proceeds that are used to help promote tutoring programs at local libraries in Northern California. This coming Monday, the foundation hosts its 10th annual pro-am golf tournament at PG&CC, the sole course designed in California by the legendary Donald Ross.Every individual has a right to education, especially so in investing.

The small-cap Russell 2000 fell nearly 0.5%. Volume in the stock market today was running slightly higher on the NYSE and solidly higher on the Nasdaq.XBlue chips were mostly down, and two stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average sank sharply. Goldman Sachs (GS) dropped 1.8%, and Caterpillar (CAT)  1.4%.On the upside in the 30-component Dow, Procter & Gamble (PG) advanced 0.8%. P&G will report quarterly results before the open July 27. Recently Procter & Gamble has been in the news because of hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz's efforts to get a seat on the board. Peltz told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" that P&G is a ""suffocating bureaucracy""  that is ""structured improperly.""Peltz's Trian Partners hedge fund hasn't made clear what changes the fund would like to see at P&G. The mega-cap company is a slow grower and a consistent dividend payer. Procter & Gamble has increased its dividend for 61 consecutive years. The current dividend yield is 3.2%. P&G is up about 5% so far this year, trailing the roughly 10% gain in the S&P 500.In the Nasdaq 100, top gainers for the day included Netflix (NFLX), up about 12%; China-based internet retailer JD.com (JD), up 2.5%; Priceline Group (PCLN), up 1.9%; and Tesla (TSLA), up 1.1%.Netflix broke out, with the opening price of 176.12 serving as a buy point in the gap-up move. Priceline remains in the 5% buy zone from a recent breakout. Priceline's buy point is 1927.23 and the buy zone is capped at 2023.59.Banks disappointed the bulls Tuesday. IBD's money-center group fell almost 1% despite a continued trend of good but imperfect earnings reports within the group. The Republican's inability to unite around a fix for ObamaCare is adding uncertainty for the entire pro-business agenda. Other items high on the list for business — such as the 9,000 pages of regulations in the Dodd-Frank law — also are in doubt.RELATED:TD Ameritrade Breaks Out On Quarterly ResultsWhy Harley-Davidson's Stock Price Plunged

26,PG,"WPP (WPPGY) shares are plunging after the world's largest advertising company cut its full-year revenue forecast amid lower spending by customers, in particular consumer-goods manufacturers.WPP said like-for-like revenue growth is expected to be 0% and 1% in 2017. That's down from an earlier 2% forecast.  The stock fell as much as 12 percent in London, the worst drop in 17 years. U.S. shares fell 11% to 91 in morning trade on the stock market today in New York.Advertising companies worldwide are being hit as big clients like Unilever (UN) and Procter & Gamble (PG) focus on cost-cutting to cope with sluggish global economic growth and technological disruption. London-based WPP singled out ad spending on consumer goods — items such as laundry detergent and toothpaste that make up about one-third of its revenue  — as coming under particular pressure.Consumer-goods giant Unilever, one of WPP's biggest customers, said earlier this year that it would cut ad output by 30% and halve the number of creative agencies it works with to 1,500 from 3,000. That followed a failed takeover bid by Kraft Heinz (KHC), which was the ""seminal"" moment in the first quarter, according to WPP Chief Executive Officer Martin Sorrell.""That sent a shockwave through the industry,"" Sorrell said by phone. ""It obviously had an effect in terms of people spending, particularly in the packaged goods sector.""WPP, which also works for brands such as Ford (F) and Marks & Spencer, had already seen its shares fall 12% this year through Tuesday amid a difficult economic climate and pressure on its businesses in North America. It's now down more than 20% year-to-date in London. Its biggest rivals, including Interpublic Group (IPG), Publicis Groupe and Omnicom (OMC), are each down more than 8% this year.Publicis dropped 2.9% in Paris, while IPG and Omnicom were down more than 4% in U.S. trading. Shares of European television companies including TF1, ProSiebenSat.1 Mediaand ITVc declined as well.In March, WPP had its biggest drop since the financial crisis when WPP gave its initial forecast for 2% growth, the slowest pace since 2009.In the second quarter, WPP's like-for-like net sales fell 0.5% with July declining 2.6%, and North America and Western Continental Europe were the poorest performing regions.""Some of the weakness was expected, however this is still an incremental disappointment,"" Tamsin Garrity, an analyst at Jefferies Group, said in a research note.WPP said that it didn't experience any significant loss in revenue from clients or of data from a cyberattack it suffered in June. The attack took down WPP's website and caused disruptions across businesses including the creative agency Ogilvy and Mather, a person familiar with the matter said at the time.The attack cost WPP about $10 million, $5 million of which was covered by insurance, Sorrell said. The company will spend about $10 million to $15 million annually on increased protection against future attacks, he said.

30,PG,"Utility stocks ran at the top and the bottom of the S&P 500 in an unusual session Monday. Sempra Energy (SRE) soared 15%, spurred by interest from activist hedge fund Elliott Management. PG&E (PCG) tanked almost 5% on liability concerns related to last year's Northern California wildfires.Both are diversified utilities, dealing with both power generation and natural gas. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit Stock Market Today.)Only one other utility stock in the 34-stock diversified industry group, Allete (ALE), moved more than 2%. Duluth, Minn.-based Allete dropped 2.5%. The result left the overall Utility-Diversified group up 0.4% for the day.A letter from Paul Singer's Elliott Management to Sempra's board outlined changes that the activist investor would like to see in order for the company to unlock investor value. Those changes included replacing six board members, as well as launching a strategic review of operations and assets.Elliott Management is a hedge fund with $34 billion in assets under management. The fund had played a key role in guiding Sempra, based in San Diego, to pay $9.45 billion to acquire Energy Futures Holdings. EFH held an 80% stake in Dallas-based power producer Oncor.At the time of the sale, Oncor reported more than 11 million customers. That lifted Sempra's total to more than 43 million. Elliott Associates, Elliott International and partner Bluescape Resources reportedly hold a 4.9% stake in Sempra. The letter to Sempra estimates that the utility can unlock between $11 billion and $16 billion in value. That would translate roughly to a $139 to $159 per share boost to the utility stock.In San Francisco, PG&E said Monday that it anticipates a ""significant liability"" after a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection report released Friday found PG&E equipment had caused at least 12 of the 24 blazes that tore through California's wine country in October. The fires killed 44 people and caused an estimated $10 billion in damage.The state is still investigating the Tubbs Fire. The largest fire in California's history, Tubbs was part of the overall October conflagration, responsible for 24 deaths. PG&E claims that fire was started by a power line installed and owned by a private property owner.Uncertainty over liabilities led PG&E to suspend its dividend in December. On Monday, Wells Fargo kept its market perform rating on the stock, and lowered the price target to 46, from 48. Investment research firm CFRA carved its price target to 36, from 46, and downgraded the stock to strong sell, from hold.PG&E dived more than 8% in opening trade, then eased to a 4% loss. That put shares down 45% since September 15.RELATED:This Tool Is An Investor's Best Friend; Do You Know How To Use It?Mining Giant Makes These Big Moves On Car Battery MetalsThis Stock May Go Totally Bonkers When Earnings Come Out LateRussia Hacks U.S. Nuclear Plants, Infrastructure 'Hundreds Of Thousands Of Times A Day'Energy Future Holdings, One Of The Largest-Ever Energy Bankruptcies, Nears Finish

Wal-Mart (WMT), down 2% after its quarterly report, also weighed on the Dow.Among sector funds, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) lost 1% each. Both are shaping bases and finding support at their 50-day moving average lines. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) slid 0.8%.Banks, construction and health care plays also lagged. The few gainers included REIT and real estate.Gold funds were mostly higher as the precious metal's price rose 0.6% to $1,290.10. Oil ETFs were mixed; West Texas intermediate crude prices slipped 0.1% to $46.72 a barrel.Utilities are typically thought of as a defensive play with high yields. But these two utility ETFs are not only outpacing the S&P 500 this year, they're also getting close to buy points.The biggest such offering in terms of assets, Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), is just shy of a 54.73 buy point of a flat base. It advanced 4% from a cup-with-handle breakout in May to the start of the current base.Launched in December 1998, the $7.5 billion fund provides broad exposure to high-yielding utilities, which are considered a defensive play. Its top holdings as of Aug. 15 included NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK), PG&E (PCG) and Sempra Energy (SRE).XLU owns 28 stocks; the top 10 names accounted for 60% of assets. NextEra, PG&E and Sempra were among five utilities named as favorites by Morgan Stanley, according to Barron's. The investment bank cited three catalysts for the utility sector: tax reform, further declines in renewable energy costs, and potential efforts by the current administration to support coal and nuclear power.The ETF has a dividend yield of 3.2%, well ahead of the S&P 500's average 1.91% payout. It carries a 0.14% expense ratio. XLU is up 13.7% year-to-date through Aug. 15, vs. the S&P 500's 11.5% gain, according to Morningstar.Vanguard Utilities Index Fund ETF Shares (VPU) is also close to triggering a flat-base buy point — the entry would be 120. It has advanced 13.3% this year.The 13-year-old fund, which tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Index/Utilities 25/50, has gathered $2.62 billion. VPU's top 10 holdings also include the same four names as XLU, but is a bigger portfolio with 76 stocks. The top 10 make up just over half of assets.VPU offers a 3.13% dividend yield and has a 0.10% expense ratio.Wednesday's picks, iShares Russell 3000 (IWV) and Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI), remain just above their respective 50-day moving average lines after finding recent support.RELATED:Dow Up As Retail Rises, Oil Slides; Are These 2 Apple Plays A Buy?Retail Leads Broad Stock Sell-Off; Will Biotechs Find Support?2 Sectors Avoid Sell-Off; Is Apple Or Microsoft Better Value Play?

32,PG,"Two large-cap funds are among those setting up for potential breakouts as the stock market remains near all-time highs.XFirst up is iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA (USMV), which is just shy of a 50.13 flat-base buy point. It briefly cleared a prior flat-base entry in late April, pulled back below the buy point, and bounced off its 50-day moving average en route to a 4% gain.The $13.5 billion fund tracks the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index, which comprises domestic stocks that tend to be less volatile than the broader U.S. equity market. It carries a 0.15% expense ratio.USMV's biggest sector weighting was health care as of July 31, at just over 19% of assets. Information technology followed at nearly 19%, consumer staples 13% and financials 11%. Health care names accounted for half the top 10: Becton Dickinson (BDX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Stryker (SYK), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).The fund's top 10 names made up less than 15% of total assets. USMV also helps limit volatility by keeping each holding to about 1.5% or less and has a relatively low annual turnover of 28%.Its year-to-date gain of 11.5% through July 31 is in line with the S&P 500, according to Morningstar Inc. The ETF outpaced the benchmark index over the past three years at 13.1% vs. 10.9%, and slightly underperformed the past five years at 13.5% vs. 14.8%. It has a dividend yield of 2.05%.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF), which tracks the Northern Trust Quality Dividend Index, is near a 41.85 buy point of a flat base.The fund, which launched in December 2012, targets stocks with a sustainable yield. That leads to profitable companies that should have the ability to keep paying dividends. Top holdings as of July 28 included Procter & Gamble (PG), Boeing (BA), Pfizer (PFE), Apple (AAPL) and Merck (MRK).Its top 10 stocks accounted for about 27% of assets; annual turnover is 85%. QDF has lagged the S&P 500 this year and over the past three years. That's despite an annualized yield of 3%, which is well above the benchmark index's 1.91% average yield. Its expense ratio is 0.37%.Tuesday was a good day for many foreign ETFs, including WisdomTree International Equity Fund (DWM) and iShares MSCI Hong Kong (EWH). DWM is still in buy range from a 53.51 entry and EWH from a 24.32 flat-base buy point.The stock market pared early gains Wednesday, leaving only the Dow Jones industrial average in positive territory.Despite a 5% earnings-fueled jump by Apple (AAPL), SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) held only a 0.15% gain. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) slipped 0.2% and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) edged 0.1% lower.Stocks sold off across the board with telecom, retail and real estate leading the decline. SPDR S&P Telecom (XTL) fell 1.5%, slipping below its 50-day line for the first time in two weeks.But VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) reversed to a 0.1% advance.

33,PG,"McCormick (MKC) agreed to acquire Reckitt Benckiser Group's food business for $4.2 billion, adding French's mustard and Frank's RedHot sauce to its lineup of spices and seasonings.XThe deal brings a stable of well-known condiments to Sparks, Maryland-based McCormick. For Reckitt Benckiser, unloading the products continues an overhaul that began with an expansion into baby formula through the British company's acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.The transaction price equates to 20 times the division's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, ""which feels to us like a very high price for a U.S.-oriented ambient food business,"" James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note. He expects the transaction to dilute RB's earnings per share by about 1%.The deal comes as speculation swirls about the next round of consolidation in the packaged-food business. In February, Kraft Heinz (KHC) was spurned in a blockbuster bid to take over Unilever (UL), the British-Dutch maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr soup. In the aftermath, Unilever was cited by analysts as a possible bidder for the Reckitt business.Nestle SA, the world's largest food company, is also shaking up its portfolio. Under activist pressure to improve results, it's considering selling its U.S. candy operations. Investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management this week set its sights on Procter & Gamble (PG), the U.S. giant that competes with Unilever in personal care.Led by Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor, Reckitt said it was looking to unload its food business in April, when the Slough, England-based company described the division as ""non-core."" With 411 million pounds ($536 million) in sales last year, French's Foods accounted for 4% of Reckitt's total revenue.French's and Frank's RedHot will become McCormick's second- and third-largest brands, respectively, CEO Lawrence E. Kurzius said in a statement late Tuesday. McCormick's pro forma 2017 annual net sales are expected to be approximately $5 billion, with significant margin growth, according to the statement.In acquiring Reckitt's food business, McCormick faced a large group of potential rivals. Bloomberg reported in May that the sale was expected to draw interest from Post Holdings (POST) and Conagra Brands (CAG). Other possible bidders included JM Smucker (SJM), Campbell Soup (CPB), Pinnacle Foods (PF) and Ajinomoto, people familiar with the situation said at the time.In addition to selling yellow mustard and hot sauce, the division makes ketchup, onion flavorings and other products. Hot sauce will continue to see robust growth, with opportunities for expansion, McCormick said. The company said it plans to expand the global presence of Frank's RedHot and French's products, whose sales are now concentrated in the U.S.McCormick dates to 1889, when founder Willoughby McCormick began selling flavors and extracts door to door. The company went after another U.K. business in 2016, when it considered buying Premier Foods. But the suitor walked away from takeover talks in April of that year, saying that Premier was demanding too high a price. McCormick's Kurzius said at the time that Premier was just one of the company's M&A ideas.Credit Suisse Group AG is serving as the financial adviser to McCormick on the RB Foods transaction, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP is legal counsel. Morgan Stanley acted as lead financial adviser to Reckitt and the company also received advice from Robey Warshaw.The deal is expected to be completed in the third or fourth quarter of McCormick's fiscal 2017, pending regulatory approvals. McCormick plans to fund the deal with a combination of equity and debt, and said it has obtained committed bridge financing.

46,PG,"Consumer staples have been slumping lately, and key exchange traded funds tracking the sector are down from 6% to 13% this year, through Tuesday's close.So what's the culprit? One of the key reasons: higher interest rates. The 10-year Treasury is now yielding about 3.08%, up sharply from around 2.4% at the beginning of the year. That makes bonds more attractive than dividends.Consumer staples stocks are considered a defensive play because people need these products no matter how the economy is doing, and the companies often offer steady dividends. When bond yields are low, dividend stocks look more compelling. But when bond yields rise, dividend stocks can look less attractive.Add to the sector's woes are a stronger dollar and weaker emerging-markets currencies, where consumer staples giants like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL) generate a sizable percentage of sales.

47,PG,"To make money in the stock market, you have to start with big money, right?Well, no. Contrary to conventional wisdom, you don't need to have a hefty trust fund or ultradeep pockets like mutual funds and other institutional players to start investing.""If you're a typical working person or a beginning investor, you should know that it doesn't take a lot of money to start,"" IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks."" ""You can begin with as little as $500 to $1,000 and add to it as you earn and save more money.""In fact, O'Neil started his investing career at the ripe old age of 21 years with just a five-share purchase of Procter & Gamble (PG).What's more important than how much money you have to invest is learning how to pick the best stocks. Stocks have the potential for big gains if you know which ones to pick at the right time. There are two components to the right time: the stock itself and the overall market.A stock could sport top-notch fundamentals, such as high Composite, Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength ratings. Use Stock Checkup as a guide. The company may clearly be a leader in its field, but it's prudent to wait until the stock is breaking out from a sound base in rising volume.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTo further raise the odds of a big run-up after a breakout, it's best to buy when the market is in a confirmed uptrend. Three of four stocks will eventually follow the market's direction, so it doesn't make sense to buy during a correction or when the market is under pressure.Let's say you have $500 or $1,000 to invest. Don't try to reduce risk by buying 10 stocks. Concentrate instead on one or two potential winners. With $10,000, stick with three or four good stocks instead of a basket of names.Suppose you have $10,000 and invested $5,000 of it in Facebook (FB) at its July 2013 breakout from a first-stage base. If you had bought shares near the correct buy point at 32.61 and held the position through mid-April in 2016, you would have gained 240%, or $12,000. Not a bad gain.How about putting another $2,500 to work in Reynolds American as it cleared a base — a saucer base with a 52.67 buy point — in March 2014? With an 85% profit (excluding dividends), that wad grew to $4,625 just a little more than two years later.If the remaining $2,500 went to the airline operator Hawaiian Holdings (HA) at its Oct. 22, 2014, breakout past a 16.18 buy point in a superb double bottom base, shares would have soared 210% to $7,750 less than two years later.That initial $10,000 would now be worth $29,375. If you kept your losses in other stocks at no more than 7%-8% for each trade, you would be able to keep a lot of those profits. Always practice the golden rule of investing.It's never too early to start saving or learning to invest. The younger you are, the greater the chances to grow even a modest amount exponentially, as explained in this  Investor's Corner column.(A version of this column was first published on April 15, 2016.

49,PG,"Key index funds were mixed in the stock market today as the Trump administration's plans to impose tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada, Europe and Mexico renewed trade war fears.That weighed heavily on the Dow industrials, sending SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) down nearly 1% Thursday afternoon. The ETF is trying to hold support above its 50-day moving average. The biggest losers included Caterpillar (CAT), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Procter & Gamble (PG), which fell about 2% each.Only four of the Dow's 30 stocks bucked the decline. But that underscores the beauty of owning an index fund, instead of an individual stock. Because several blue chips are up and others' declines aren't as steep, DIA is down 0.9% instead of, say, 2.4% for Procter & Gamble.An exchange traded fund offers a simple, low cost and tax efficient way to invest. It also lowers individual-stock risk, since you're buying a basket of stocks.

55,PG,"The market's back in a confirmed uptrend, which raises the potential for more successful breakouts by stocks and ETFs alike.Today we'll highlight two dividend plays that may soon be ripe for the picking. First up is iShares Core Dividend Growth (DGRO), which tracks the Morningstar U.S. Dividend Growth Index. The $1.7 billion fund is just below a 31.19 buy point of a 12-week flat base.It advanced 5% from its prior flat-base breakout in early February to the start of the current pattern. And in November, DGRO gained 4% after clearing a previous flat base.Not surprisingly, the fund's top holdings are all blue chip components from the Dow Jones industrial average. Representing the latter group is Apple (AAPL), which started paying dividends in 2012. The iPhone maker currently pays an annualized 1.6% yield; its shares have rallied north of 30% this year.Microsoft (MSFT), which began offering a payout in 2003, yields 2.2%. Shares were up 13% this year through Tuesday's close. Other top holdings include S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (companies that have raised their annual payout for 25 consecutive years) such as Coca-Cola (KO), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Procter & Gamble (PG). Apple and Coca-Cola were among billionaire investor Warren Buffett's top holdings in Q1. DGRO's annualized return is 2.1%, slightly ahead of the S&P 500's average payout of 1.9%. It launched June 10, 2014.Schwab Dividend Equity (SCHD), which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, has also been building a flat base for about 12 weeks. The ideal buy point is 45.48, or 10 cents above the left-side high. The $5.5 billion ETF shows similar action to DGRO, with small gains after breakouts in November and February.SCHD's top three holdings as of May 26 were Microsoft, Coca-Cola and Home Depot (HD), according to Morningstar Inc. The fund has a five-year average return of 14.2%, close to the S&P 500's 15.3%. The ETF's annualized dividend is 2.9%.Of the two ETFs spotlighted early Tuesday, iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA (LRGF) edged closer to a 28.72 buy point, while iShares Russell Mid-Cap (IWR) dipped slightly but remained near a 190.98 entry.RELATED:Which 2 ETFs On Breakout Watch Own Nvidia As Top Holding?Like Big Dividends?

FANG stocks such as Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) were mostly higher.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 inched up less than 0.1% and barely above break-even respectively, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. The small cap Russell 2000 echoed the 0.1% gains. Volume in the stock market today was down on both major exchanges.The Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its May 2 and 3 meeting at 2 p.m. ET. The Street will be looking for clues on rate hikes in the minutes, but expectations are widespread for a rate hike in June.In early action Wednesday, blue chips were nearly evenly divided between winners and losers. Losers in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average included Home Depot (HD), which fell 1%. On the upside, Coca-Cola (KO) and Procter & Gamble (PG) rose 0.7% and 0.5% respectively.Building products retailer Lowe's (LOW) dropped 3% shortly after the open. The home improvement retailer reported quarterly results that missed on earnings by about 3% and fell short on earnings by 1%. Lowe's also offered weaker-than-expected guidance for the full year.In April, Lowe's cleared a 84.10 buy point in a flat pattern within a larger consolidation. After a 2.5% gain, the stock rolled over, falling under the buy point and on Tuesday under its 50-day moving average line.In the Nasdaq 100, electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) popped 1% higher in fast trade. The stock is holding above its 50-day line and is moderately extended from an April breakout.Meanwhile, the popular FANG stocks were mostly up. Facebook advanced 1% in strong volume.

57,PG,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) hiked its stake in Apple (AAPL) by more than 125% to 129.4 million shares in the first quarter, and made modest changes to its airlines holdings while avoiding Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP), which went public in March.Meanwhile, Soros Fund Management bought 1.7 million shares of Snap, joining David Tepper's Appaloosa Management and Dan Loeb's Third Point. Soros also dissolved his firm's positions in Amazon.com (AMZN) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and added to its stake in Facebook (FB), according to filings late Monday.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital trimmed its Apple holdings to 4.2 million shares from 6.1 million in Q4, while more than quadrupling its stake in General Motors (GM) to 55 million shares from 13 million.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) stake to 49.3 million shares, up 8.4% vs. the previous quarter, and its investment in Southwest Airlines (LUV) to 47.7 million, up 10.4%. It trimmed its position in Delta to 55 million shares, down 8.3%, while keeping its holdings in United Airlines (UAL) steady at 28.9 million.The regulatory filing confirmed news from early May that Berkshire's Buffett busily dumped tech giant IBM (IBM) in Q1. It had 64.6 million shares left at quarter-end, down 20%. (Even IBM Retirement Fund's unloaded 70,000 shares of IBM, leaving it with 12,451 IBM shares in Q1, according to the fund's 13F filing on May 10.)Meanwhile, the conglomerate's massive long-term stakes in Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) were left basically unchanged.Buffett had already said Berkshire more than doubled its Apple holdings in Q1, giving it a 2.5% stake in the iPhone maker's outstanding shares. Berkshire initiated a position in Apple, worth $1.1 billion, in Q1 2016 and doubled down on Apple as the year progressed.By contrast, Appaloosa Management slashed its stake in 2017's best-performing Dow component Apple by a third, to 300,000 shares, and trimmed Facebook by 12.6%, to 1.9 million shares in Q1, according to filings from Friday. The company also scooped up 100,000 shares of Snap, which tanked 17.5% last week on a dismal debut earnings reports following its March IPO.Similarly, Third Point exited its 1.85 million-share stake in Apple during Q1, while buying 2.25 million shares of Snap.Shares of Berkshire closed up 0.3% at 163.76 on the stock market today. Apple dipped 0.3%, down from Friday's fresh record high, and Snap rallied 8.4%, after last week's plunge. Facebook eased 0.1%, and IBM added 0.7%.Among Appaloosa's other notable moves, the fund entirely liquidated its massive stakes in two troubled stocks: chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and retailer J.C. Penney (JCP).Appaloosa added a 1.6 million-share stake in Symantec (SYMC), which was leading a cybersecurity stock rally Monday on the heels of a global ransomware attack. Appaloosa also raised its Western Digital (WDC) stake by 16.1% to 1.3 million shares.But the hedge fund's biggest bet seems to be on an American industrial renaissance. It opened positions of roughly half a million shares each in AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE), while upping ArcelorMittal (MT) by more than 410%, to nearly 5 million shares.Other hefty new positions included Bank of America (BAC) and CBS (CBS) (8.8 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively).Third Point's other moves include adding to positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).The fund closed a small stake in Goldman Sachs (GS), and reduced holdings in Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Late Friday, Trian Fund Management also disclosed bigger positions in General Electric (GE) and Procter & Gamble (PG) and a smaller stake in DuPont (DD).RELATED:What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

It ended the day just off its intraday and all-time high of 190.37, reached just minutes before the close.The Cupertino, Calif.-based company now has a market value of about $960 billion. Some Wall Street analysts say it is on pace to become the first company with a market cap of $1 trillion.The nine-session winning streak for Apple stock would be the longest one since last July, when it also rose for nine straight trading days.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAfter last summer's nine-day rally, shares fell for the next three days, finding support at their 50-day moving average. Apple then rose 0.9% on Aug. 1 ahead of its fiscal third-quarter earnings report later that same day. The next day Apple soared 4.7% after delivering a beat-and-raise financial report the night before. The stock broke out of an 11-week flat base to record heights.Since 2004, Apple shares have risen nine consecutive days on six occasions, including the latest. On the previous occasions, the stock usually formed a base for about a month before resuming its move higher.Apple stock also has risen for 10 consecutive days twice since 2004, most recently in October 2010. Those are the longest winning streaks it has had in that time period.It has rallied lately on news that investment firm Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), led by Warren Buffett, has been increasing its stake in the iPhone maker.Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White on Thursday pounded the table for Apple. He rates the stock as buy with a price target of 235.""We believe Apple is on a path to surpass the $1 trillion market capitalization milestone in the coming months,"" he said in a report. He pointed to Apple's strong earnings report last week and Buffett's positive comments and investment for his confidence.If Apple traded at the average price-earnings multiple of other consumer-related stocks such as Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Colgate Palmolive (CL), Apple would already have a market cap north of $1 trillion, he said.RELATED:Apple Within Spitting Distance Of $1 Trillion Market Cap

Not only because of a stout dividend yield of 3.7% but also because of strong performance of new drugs.The best dividend stocks often show a consistent track record of dividend payouts. Pfizer (PFE) certainly passes muster here.Earlier this month, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 34 cents a share. The dividend is payable June 1 to shareholders of record May 11. It's Pfizer's 318th consecutive quarterly dividend.Long known for its blockbuster drugs like Lipitor, Viagra and Xanax, Pfizer's fourth-quarter earnings report showed strong performance from other drugs.In the company's Innovate Health unit, strength was driven by Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. The three drugs showed sales increases of 11%, 46% and 47%, respectively.Ibrance is a breast cancer treatment. Eliquis is used to prevent strokes and blood clots in people with irregular heartbeats. Xeljanz is a rheumatoid arthritis treatment.Innovative Health delivered total sales of $8.2 billion, making up about 60% of total sales.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The partnership will help Pfizer compete with Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in advanced cancer treatments using CAR-T therapy. CAR-T therapy is when patients' own immune cells are used to treat their cancer.

62,PG,"In a rapid turnaround, Allergan (AGN) said late Thursday it doesn't intend to bid on Shire (SHPG) — leaving thrice-rebuffed Takeda Pharmaceuticals alone in the race for the rare disease drugmaker.The entire saga erupted early Thursday when reports emerged Allergan might be interested in buying Shire. About the same time, Shire confirmed it had rejected three bids from Takeda with one worth north of $61 billion.Allergan first said it was in the early stages of a potential bid on Shire. Hours — and a stock plunge later — Allergan said it definitively won't make an offer to take over Shire. Meanwhile, it's still ""evaluating a full range of potential strategic options,"" Allergan said in a news release.Shares of Allergan closed down 4.2%, at 158.59, and were flat in after-hours trading on the stock market today. Shire sank 1.1%, to 160.74 at the closing bell.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeculation about a Shire-Takeda merger has been swirling since late March. Since then, Takeda has made three bids on Shire. In each case, Shire's board determined the bids ""significantly undervalue"" the firm's growth prospects and pipeline.Takeda confirmed it put forth a buyout bid for Shire worth about $66 per share, comprised of cash and stock. Both firms say they are willing to continue negotiating. Still, Takeda is confident it ""remains well positioned"" even if negotiations fall through.""Building on Takeda's existing momentum, the acquisition of Shire would accelerate its transformation and result in a global, value-based R&D-driven biopharmaceutical leader headquartered in Japan,"" Takeda said in a prepared statement.The short-lived interest from Allergan came as a surprise, Leerink analyst Etzer Darout said in a note. The firm has said it could become acquisitive and is looking at strategic options.""A combination with Shire introduces some growth challenges in out-years, which are reflected in the negative stock reaction,"" he said.Shire is likely to face erosion of attention deficit hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse beginning in 2023 and significant erosion of its hemophilia business as it competes with rival Roche (RHHBY). Allergan would have had to justify the bid to its shareholders, he said.The Shire interest comes amid a flurry of biotech acquisitions that kicked off earlier this year when Celgene (CELG) announced its plan to buy Juno Therapeutics and Sanofi (SNY) unveiled plans to acquire Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).Novartis (NVS) sold its share of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) consumer health unit for $13 billion and used part of the proceeds to fund its $8.7 billion plan to acquire AveXis (AVXS). Merck KGaA agreed to sell its over-the-counter unit to Proctor & Gamble (PG), days after it was rumored Mylan (MYL) might buy it.Earlier this week, Shire said it would sell it cancer unit to France's Servier for $2.4 billion.Analysts have speculated that Celgene could also be on the lookout for more acquisitions with Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) and Jounce Therapeutics (JNCE) as potential targets. Amgen (AMGN) also has a huge war chest and is facing competition for its older medicines.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

63,PG,"Welcome to the Dow Jones industrial average. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the newest stock on the blue-chip index, is the worst Dow Jones stock in the first half of 2018.General Electric (GE), which tanked 22% through June 30, is no longer a Dow Jones stock. That leaves Walgreens stock leading Dow laggards, followed by 3M (MMM), Procter & Gamble (PG), Caterpillar (CAT) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Each booked a double-digit loss through June. The Dow Jones index overall fell 1.8% over the same period, lagging a 1.7% advance for the S&P 500 index and an 8.8% gain for the Nasdaq composite.On a brighter note, the best-performing Dow Jones stocks of 2018 so far boast impressive gains.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe retail pharmacist took the Dow Jones seat that the embattled GE vacated Tuesday, but faces deep problems of its own.""Walgreens has struggled to cope with a rapidly changing pharmaceutical market with pressured reimbursement, massive consolidation, and increasing competition for prescription volume,"" according to Morningstar.Walgreens Boots Alliance faces increasing and direct competition from grocery chains and retailers. On Thursday, Amazon (AMZN) agreed to buy PillPack, making a decisive, long-rumored move into the pharmacy space.Walgreens, which reportedly sought the online pharmacy for itself, tumbled on the news, along with other drug stores and other pharmacy-related stocks.Walgreens stock peaked in January, then sank after Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) struck a healthcare partnership. The move potentially threatens Walgreens, which also manages prescription-drug plans and provides health care to store customers.But the pharmacy chain now counts on roughly 10,000 stores — after acquiring thousands of Rite-Aid (RAD) locations — to return to earnings growth.Shares of Walgreens dived 17.4% in the first six months of 2018.Industrial conglomerate 3M must reckon with a continued shift away from a manufacturing economy to a service economy, analysts say.That macroeconomic trend coincided with a severe downturn in its key power market. The company may now sell its gas-turbines unit, after earlier shedding rail, wind and health assets.3M stock sank April 24 after the company lowered its 2018 earnings guidance. It has yet to recover, sitting 26% below a January high of 259.77.Talk of trade wars and steel tariffs also contributed to the decline. Roughly 60% of 3M's revenue comes from abroad.But the company, well regarded for its R&D expertise, continues to scout for growth. It capitalized on automakers' quest to build profitable electric cars by announcing in June that it will invest in a battery factory.Shares tumbled 16.4% in the first half of this year.A household name, P&G's tepid top-line growth has come amid massive shifts in the consumer goods sector.Consumers increasingly choose niche, alternative brands over well-known names, while groceries and supermarkets have shifted from branded products toward more upscale, private labels. The Amazon-Whole Foods deal is set to further disrupt grocery aisles.This multinational also faces intense competition from local companies in emerging markets.However, P&G scored a victory in a recent proxy fight with Trian Fund Management. The Nelson Peltz fund wanted this Dow giant to focus more on innovative brands and less on legacy products.P&G shares dropped 15% in the first half of 2018.Caterpillar's woes just grew beyond volatile commodity prices, an uncertain outlook for global infrastructure and construction spending — and loose-lipped execs.It's among companies that face potentially higher negative impact from a Trump trade war that is expanding in scope and reach, research firm CFRA said last week.Caterpillar, a top construction and equipment maker, operates around the globe. China's crackdown on emissions is a potential headwind, but there are other risks.""As urbanization slows or Chinese central planners decide to de-emphasize construction, Caterpillar's resources business could suffer,"" analysts at Morningstar say. But they add restructuring efforts are starting to pay off and heavy equipment demand is starting to recover.Caterpillar stock tanked 6% April 24 after its CFO described Q1 operating margins as a ""high watermark"" for the year. The company later tried to walk back those remarks, but the damage was done.Caterpillar stock lost 13.9% in the first half of this year, with losses accelerating in the last few weeks.The investment banking giant saw trading activity roar back to life in the first quarter, helped by market volatility. But Goldman Sachs stock skidded in March after reports of CEO Lloyd Blankfein's looming departure. Losses accelerated in April after management shared plans to put share buybacks on hold.Late Thursday, the Federal Reserve let most U.S. banking giants announce big stock buybacks and dividend hikes after passing the second round of stress tests. But Goldman and investment bank peer Morgan Stanley (MS) will have to keep shareholder payouts around current levels due to a capital shortfall.Bank stocks, in general, have suffered recently from a flattening yield curve and ebbing consumer confidence. Their 2017 rally, fueled by tax overhaul and rising rates, seems a distant memory now.In May, Goldman Sachs analysts said Amazon (AMZN) has an ""opportunity to expand in financial services,"" but is unlikely to launch a standalone bank.This Dow Jones stock sank 13.4%.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Futures Rise With These 2 Tech Titans In Buy ZoneStock Market Forecast For The Next Six Months: What Can You Expect?If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersWhat Is The Dow Jones Industrial Average And What Does It Measure?

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average was well-positioned with nine stocks poised for breakouts.X The Nasdaq and S&P 500 added 0.1%. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was up a fraction.Volume in the stock market today was running below the previous session's pace.Blue chips were mostly up. In the 30-component Dow, moves were restrained.Apple (AAPL), for instance, led the pack but the gain was only 0.6%.Dow stocks that are near possible breakouts include Microsoft (MSFT) (trying to climb back above an 86.30 entry), DowDuPont (DWDP), Procter & Gamble (PG), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Intel (INTC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Coca-Cola (KO), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Apple.Each of the nine stocks are within 3% of a buy point. The Street expects three to deliver earnings growth above 15% in 2018. DowDuPont's estimated growth is 25% for 2018. Apple's growth in fiscal 2018 ending in September is pegged at 24%. Exxon's is 16%. Estimates for DowDuPont and Exxon represent upward revisions.

65,PG,"General Electric (GE) could be left out in the cold while other U.S. companies, including fellow industrial conglomerates, benefit from a tax windfall, according to an analyst.X The GOP tax package that President Trump signed into law Friday cuts the current corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. But Deutsche Bank says GE could end up a ""significant net loser"" because the plan also calls for a 15.5% repatriation rate on earnings held offshore as cash, and 8% if overseas profits are invested in nonliquid assets, such as plants and equipment. The repatriation tax would be mandatory.As a result, GE could end up owing up to $9 billion in new taxes, or an average of $1.1 billion for the next eight years, on $82 billion in foreign earnings reinvested abroad, according to Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch.""GE's substantial tax bill would come at a difficult time for the company given GE's ongoing cash squeeze from weak cash generation that recently forced the company to cut its dividend in half,"" Inch wrote Dec. 20.GE's quarterly dividend is now 12 cents a share, a 50% cut, allowing the company to save about $4 billion a year.Additionally, Inch noted, $4.5 billion of GE's overseas cash hoard, as of Sept. 30, was held in countries that may restrict or limit the return of funds.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point may have the wind at their backs.GE has long enjoyed an ultralow tax rate, the result of ""aggressive"" tax planning that leverages both GE's position as a multinational and GE Capital's ability to move funds around the world for tax advantages, the Deutsche Bank note added.This year, the firm forecasts GE Industrial's tax rate to be less than 5%. By comparison, GE's multi-industry peers on average pay rates from the mid- to high 20s.Companies had held off on paying income taxes on foreign earnings until those funds are returned, or repatriated, to the U.S. The 35% domestic rate has led several companies to stockpile profits abroad, leading to charges of tax avoidance.Several profitable U.S. companies paid an effective tax rate far less than 35% between 2008 and 2015, due to the tax loopholes and special breaks they enjoy, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.In fact, 18 companies, including GE, Priceline (PCLN) and PG&E (PCG), paid no federal income taxes at all over that eight-year period despite consistently churning out profits, it added.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHere Are The Latest Stocks Joining The Bitcoin FrenzyTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info Tech

66,PG,"As we move through May, the old Wall Street adage ""Sell in May and go away"" comes to mind, a reminder that stocks historically tend to underperform during the May-to-October period.But does that mean ETF investors should liquidate their holdings, take the summer (and a few extra months) off, and resume buying stocks in November?That's one investment strategy. But, as with most old sayings, it doesn't have to be taken literally. Even if the market's return tends to be bigger in the November-April period, investors sitting out the other six months miss out on intermediate rallies and on the power of reinvesting dividends and compounding returns.That's why Oliver Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management, doesn't think the adage proves advantageous for most investors.""It is at best unreliable and inconsistent and amounts to market timing,"" he told IBD. ""When taking into account possible tax consequences, missed dividends and trading commission, the math doesn't bear out.""But Pursche, who oversees the New York-based firm's investment banking and wealth management divisions, thinks May is a good time for investors to reassess their portfolios.Click Here To See A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Bruderman Asset Management is a registered investment advisor (RIA) with more than $1 billion in assets under management.Here are Pursche's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:""Sell in May and walk away"" is not a strategy we feel is particularly smart or beneficial to investors. However, as we enter the summer months and the second half of the year, there is a need for investors to revisit their investment thesis and potentially reallocate their portfolios. After a solid double-digit run by the S&P 500 since Mr. Trump was elected president, a portfolio risk assessment is certainly due. Investors should expect a continuation of the current positive sentiment, even though the Trump administration is unlikely to pass any major legislation, in particular tax reform. Nonetheless, there are several key factors that are benefiting our economy and consequently, corporate earnings.The United States economy, as well as the world as a whole, is benefiting from a cyclical rebound in growth and consumer demand that is helping drive corporate earnings higher, and could help boost U.S. GDP growth by 4% or more in the second quarter. One phenomenon that has been interesting to observe in the current earnings cycle is the strength of earnings coming from outside the United States. Of the companies within the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, those companies that earn more than 50% of their revenues offshore have seen EPS growth of nearly 20%, while companies that derive all of their earnings domestically are experiencing low- to middle-single-digit EPS growth.One last note: Expect a correction at some point, but don't let that change your long-term investment strategy. The ETFs named above should perform well if the current environment persists through the end of the year and into 2018, as we expect it to.RELATED:This ETF Is Knocking The 'Socks' Off The Tech Sector

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also shredded their gains, the Nasdaq ending flat and the S&P 500 down less than 0.1%.All the indexes remained firmly positive for the week.Compared to busy sessions Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday's action was comparatively quiet, with preliminary data showing trade slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.At either end of the Dow industrials, United Technologies (UTX) rose nearly 2% and Procter & Gamble (PG) dropped 2%, both on quarterly results. United Tech remained in a buy range, 3% above a flat base buy point of 114.54. More than half of the Dow's stocks traded higher, with Verizon (VZ), Home Depot (HD) and Travelers (TRV) also posting gains of around 1%.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) easily led the S&P 500, pulsing more than 10% higher after reporting that strength in U.S. heart-valve replacements helped power a 32% first-quart earnings gain and a 27% rise in sales. Both numbers clobbered analyst expectations. The move hoisted shares back above the 40-week moving average as Edwards works on the right side of a six-month consolidation.Gains were more modest on the Nasdaq, led by a 3% advance by Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH). The gain put shares narrowly above a 52.60 buy point in two-month long a flat base.The low end of the Nasdaq was a different story, with Seagate Technologies (STX) gouging out a 16% loss. The maker of computer hard drives posted a 400% EPS gain, above analyst targets. But a 3% revenue advance stopped short of expectations.

According to a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, Apple is unlikely to develop its own radio frequency chips , which could spare Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) from being displaced. Shares of Broadcom declined 3%, while Qorvo and Skyworks dropped 2% each.Despite the market's fall, FANG stocks continued to act well in midday trading. Netflix (NFLX) initially led the way with a 0.5% gain, but those gains have now disappeared. The video streaming company will report its Q1 earnings on Monday after the close. The other three FANG members -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) -- edged slightly lower.Among other leading stocks, Tesla (TSLA) dropped 1.8% amid a report that Tesla is under pressure to add an independent director to its board of directors. The investors group behind the push said five of six board members have a personal or professional connection to CEO Elon Musk. Shares of the electric-auto maker remain about 5% above a 287.49 entry. Alibaba (BABA), a Leaderboard member, advanced 0.3% and is extended from a 104.67 cup-with-handle entry, but near a three-weeks-tight entry at 110.55.Action within the IBD 50 was predominantly negative in midday trading as leading growth stocks tracked the general market lower, but there were several bright spots. On the upside, Momo (MOMO) added 1.1% to notch a new high, while Radian Group (RDN) moved up 1% as shares attempted to recapture the 50-day.

P&G missed its top-line estimates in its Q3 release, causing the stock to fall even further below its 50-day line.Boeing reported mixed Q1 results early Wednesday that saw revenue missing its target. Shares of the airplane maker are extended from a 160.17 flat-base entry, but are forming a new flat base with a potential 185.81 entry. Chipotle (CMG) continued its recent string of gains after exceeding the Street's Q1 earnings and revenue targets. The burrito maker traded 1.8% higher on Wednesday and shares are about 12% above a 434.79 flat-base buy point.Disk drive maker Seagate Technologies (STX) plunged over 14%, triggering a sell signal, after missing revenue estimates early Wednesday. The stock broke out of a cup with handle with a 49.57 entry on Monday. Competitor Western Digital (WDC) dropped 2.9%, but remains about 3% above an 81.77 flat-base entry.U.S. Steel's (X) surprise Q1 loss late Tuesday caused its shares to plummet more than 25%, creating a brief ripple effect throughout the industry. Fellow steelmakers Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) fell in unison in early trading, but recovered to move slightly higher. Earnings releases were not particularly kind to leading growth stocks on Wednesday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Evercore Partners (EVR), PRA Health Sciences (PRAH), and Mercury Systems (MRCY) all fell after their quarterly earnings reports.Macom dropped 6.7%, triggering the 8%-loss-cutting sell signal from a 52.32 cup-with-handle entry.

74,PG,"Following ""intensified"" dialogue with activist investor Trian Fund Management, Dow member General Electric (GE) on Wednesday said it would tailor this year's bonus program to the industrial giant's ability to meet profit targets and a new cost-cutting goal.Earlier this month, Fox Business reported that Nelson Peltz, who runs Trian, was unhappy with GE's results and was considering undertaking ""corporate activism"" and, possibly, pressing CEO Jeffrey Immelt into early retirement.General Electric's announcement, which follows a year marked largely by slow growth and sales hurt by weak commodities markets, appears to have put Trian at ease.""Over the past month, Trian has intensified its dialogue with senior management regarding new initiatives to help ensure that GE can meet its financial commitments,"" Trian said in a statement on Wednesday.

The industrial structural costs exclude the impact from acquisitions and other costs.The company also forecast operating profit for the segment of $17.2 billion this year.Also as a result of those discussions, GE modified its 2017 executive bonus program to be based on whether the company meets the profit and cost targets. Bonuses will go up by 20% if both the profit and cost goals are met, down by 20% if neither are met, and will be unchanged if only one of those goals is met.For 2018, GE said it would review its compensation framework to ""further align incentives around the most critical financial metrics driving long-term shareowner value.""Trian Partners also recently disclosed a big new stake in another Dow stock, Procter & Gamble (PG), spurring speculation P&G may accelerate cost-cutting and brand-focusing efforts.RELATED:Big CEOs' Optimism Soars On Trump, Joins Small Business, Consumers DOJ Asks GE, Baker Hughes For More Merger Information

80,PG,"Business software, internet, chip and FANG stocks got pummeled on Tuesday as the Nasdaq composite suffered the worst of the stock market's decline. The more broadly diversified Dow Jones industrial average fell less.With less than an hour to go in the session, the tech-driven Nasdaq sank 3%, essentially wiping out nearly all of Monday's strong rebound. The Nasdaq 100 reversed from session highs to fall nearly 3.7%.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average, generally a lagging market index, resisted the stock market sell-off for much of the session, but was down more than 1.5% heading into the close.

The Trump Administration's order blocking an attempted takeover of Qualcomm by Singapore based Broadcom (AVGO) sent Qualcomm sprawling and Broadcom down 0.5%. The news initially sent Intel (INTC) up 4%, but gains fizzled to 0.2% by the close. News reports Friday said Intel was considering a takeover of Broadcom, in order to avert the competitive threat of a Broadcom/Qualcomm combination.It is difficult to tell how prominent other events in Washington were in investors minds Tuesday. The White House's sudden, though not unexpected, replacement of Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, the break between GOP and Democrats in the House Intelligence Panel's release of findings in its Russia probe, and the Senate's progress toward Dodd-Frank banking oversight reforms may all have weighed on the stock market today.The result showed the Dow clearly stymied at its 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 again met resistance at the 2800 level and the Nasdaq pulled back to test support at the level of its recent high, from Jan. 26.On the Dow, General Electric dived more than 4% after JPMorgan slashed its price target, with Microsoft (MSFT) and American Express (AXP) each booking losses of more than 2%.Among medical stocks, hospital operators Community Health System (CYH) and software developer Tabula Rasa Healthcare (TRHC) each skidded 7% lower.

Silicon Motion (SIMO) and Cavium (CAVM) dived more than 4% each.Fang stocks took one on the muzzle, with Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) falling more than 2%, and Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) off more than 1% each. Apple (AAPL) briefly scored a new high during the session, only to reverse course and end with a 1.1% loss.It's often not a good sign for markets when defensive plays such as utilities show strength, and PG&E (PCG) took the top spot among S&P 500 stocks, rising more than 7% in above-average trade. Xerox (XRX) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) were close behind, however, rising 6% and 4%, respectively. So the market's tone was not predominantly defensive.On the upside, IBD 50 stock LGI Homes (LGIH) jumped more than 4% in soft trade. The gain left shares 21% above an early march low as the homebuilder continues to rebound from support at its 40-week moving average.

93,PG,"Looking for some ideas for your portfolio? Want to boost the octane in your retirement account? Then check out how American Funds and Fidelity Investments — the second- and third-largest mutual fund complexes after Vanguard as of Dec. 31, according to Morningstar Inc. — were allocating their shareholders' money.The main lesson for individual investors? Even the smart money, in the form of these two fund families, can disagree about some key decisions.The three sectors in which their stock fund weightings differed from each other the most were information technology, consumer staples and energy.Fidelity's stock funds overall had 26% of their shareholders' money in tech, the group's largest sector weighting, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research for research firm CFRA.American Funds was well below that, with just 18% in tech.American Funds had more in consumer staples, 9% vs. only 7% for Fidelity.And American Funds had more in energy, 10% vs. just 6% for Fidelity.We recently dissected recent big buys by Fidelity, so here's a look at some big fourth-quarter buys by American Funds, whose 64 stock mutual funds were up 4.90% year-to-date as of Feb. 28, according to Morningstar Inc. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, was up 5.94%.American Funds boosted its share count in chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) by a whopping 43%.Analog Devices has a top-notch 98 Composite Rating from IBD, a peg under the highest possible on a scale from 1-99. The stock's earnings per share rose 6%, 2% and 68% in the past three quarters. Share price is up 14% this year going into Monday.Drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was another stock in which American Funds made a big increase in its share count, adding 40% more to its stake.Bristol-Myers has a weak 61 Composite Rating. Share price has been trending lower since mid-July. Shares are down 2% this year but have rallied 22% since Jan. 26, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' consensus view and cut its 2017 guidance.One reason for Bristol-Myers' rally is that its cancer drug Opdivo recently won approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer. It got a similar green light in Europe last year.American Funds jacked up its number of shares in Facebook (FB) by a net 39% in Q4. The stock has a good 92 Comp Rating. Shares have climbed 19% so far this year.Alphabet (GOOGL) is another name in which American Funds raised its bet, by 16% in the social-media giant's case. Share price is up 7% so far this year.Additional tech-oriented bellwethers were among the stocks in which American Funds made net new buys, including consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL), chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) and software titan Microsoft (MSFT).But the big fund family hedged its bets in some other tech titans, including net redemptions in chipmaker Intel (INTC) and Amazon (AMZN). It also trimmed big-box building products chain Home Depot (HD).Trims did not mean that individual mutual funds within the family had lost faith totally with individual stocks. Home Depot, a Q4 trim, remained a top-10 position in some of American Funds' largest portfolios.Home Depot was a top-10 holding by $84.9 billion Fundamental Investors (ANCFX), whose 10 biggest positions also included Amazon. Three net new buys — Broadcom, Microsoft and energy equipment and field services company Schlumberger (SLB) — were also top-10 positions in the fund, according to Rosenbluth.The $90.6 billion American Funds Washington Mutual Investors (AWSHX) also had top-10 positions in Home Depot, Microsoft and Schlumberger.While Schlumberger was prominent in some individual funds, American Funds overall also made Q4 net big buys in integrated energy giant Chevron (CVX), boosting its share count by 4.8% to 70 million by the end of Q4.The fund group also boosted its share count in Royal Dutch Shell by 7.3% to 96 million.American Funds trimmed its share counts in several consumer-staples stalwarts.

101,PG,"IBM (IBM) has teamed up with the world's largest container shipping company, A.P. Moller-Maersk, to provide a new platform for conducting global trade using blockchain technology.X Blockchain is the underlying technology used for trading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The technology also has been used to develop digital applications across financial services, supply chains, health care management, digital rights enforcement and the internet of things.IBM and Maersk said the aim of the new company will be to offer a digitized platform built on open standards for use by the entire global shipping industry. The technology will provide more transparency and simplicity in the movement of goods across borders and trading zones, the companies said in a press release.More than $4 trillion in goods are shipped each year, and more than 80% of the goods consumers use daily are carried by the ocean shipping industry, it said.Blockchain technology works as a shared public ledger, also called a distributed database, which tracks transactions and ensures that the record of those transactions remains transparent and tamper-proof.IBM and Maersk began a collaboration in June 2016 to build new blockchain and cloud-based technologies. Since then, they said, multiple parties have piloted the platform including DuPont, Dow Chemical, Port Houston and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.IBD'S TAKE: A wave of venture capital investment is pouring into blockchain technology startups, many of them directly involved in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

It advanced 7% from an early September bounce off the line to its Dec. 4 intraday high. SPLV was featured in this ETF column, which was published Sept. 27.The fund, which launched in May 2011, has gathered $7.5 billion in assets. It tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, which comprises the 100 least volatile S&P 500 stocks over the past 12 months. The index also has the ability to respond dynamically to market conditions. So unlike some other low volatility indexes, it can move into better-performing sectors when deemed necessary.Financials account for the biggest sector weighting at nearly 21% of assets. Utilities make up about 20%, industrials 19%, and information technology and consumer staples roughly 10% each. The top 10 holdings as of Jan. 10 included Honeywell International (HON), Coca-Cola, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), PepsiCo (PEP) and Republic Services (RSG).Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's holding company, owned Coca-Cola as one of its biggest positions in Q3.

You can learn how at IBD University.Buffett tends to own some big dividend payers. For instance, Coca-Cola yields an annualized 3.2%, P&G offers 3.1%. SPLV's 12-month dividend is just north of 2%, above the S&P 500's average 1.7% payout. And it has a dividend growth rate of 7% vs. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY)'s 12%.SPLV is up 0.2% this year through Jan. 10, lagging the S&P 500's 2.9% gain. Its average annual returns of 10.2% and 13.6% over the past three and five years also slightly trail the benchmark index, which returned a respective 12.7% and 15.7%.Generally, SPLV tends to perform better if the stock market declines and low-volatility stocks fall less than growth stocks. It carries a 0.25% expense ratio.Thursday's pick, Robo Global Robotics & Automation (ROBO), hit a new high but remains in a buy zone from a 42.69 flat-base entry.

""This means that if a utility's equipment is found to have been a substantial cause of the damage in an event such as a wildfire — even if the utility has followed established inspection and safety rules — the utility may still be liable for property damages and attorneys' fees associated with that event.""PG&E faces lawsuits tied to the wildfires in California's wine country and has lowered its earnings guidance for the year over the disaster.

115,PG,"U.S. stock indexes recovered nicely, trimming the day's losses as the market struggled with the Trump factor.The Nasdaq ended flat, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1% and 0.5%, respectively. The small-cap S&P 600 rose more than 0.8%. Volume in the stock market today was running slightly higher on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.President Trump has shaken the Street with his apparent willingness to risk a trade war and his aggressive immigration policies. The top items on the Street's wish list include lower corporate taxes and a rollback on regulations that slow economic growth. Any focus on anything other than economic growth could be regarded as wasted political capital.Still, the recent 1.5% pullback in the major indexes and almost 4.5% pullback in the small cap S&P 600 might be nothing more than a small decline after a decent run. The Nasdaq rose as much as 9% after Election Day, and the small cap S&P 600 thrust as much as 18%.On Tuesday, savings and loan BofI Holdings (BOFI) popped 4% in heavy volume. The stock recently found support and bounced off its 50-day moving average.Biotech stock Incyte (INCY) added 2.5% in above-average volume. The stock broke out Jan. 9 in twice its usual volume. Incyte's gap-up entry was the opening price of 113.55. The stock is 7% above that buy point.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's big losers included airfreight, steel and cement stocks. Gold miners and medical stocks were among the day's gainers.Apple (AAPL) faded 0.3% in brisk volume as the market awaited the iPhone maker's quarterly report after the close. The Street expected Apple to report earnings of $3.22 a share but results came in at $3.36. Revenue was pegged at $77.38 billion, but Apple delivered $78.4 billion. After hours, Apple rose 2.8%.In the blue chip Dow industrials, Procter & Gamble (PG) posted one of the biggest gains, up 1% in average trade. The megacap has added a handle to its cup base.

116,PG,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care? We think tonight's Berkshire Hathaway 13F will go a long way to attract sector interest.""RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticJPMorgan Sets Fresh High, Goldman Hits Highest Since 2007 On Yellen

117,PG,"U.S. stock indexes headed toward their seventh straight gain Wednesday afternoon, as the bulls rode unexpectedly strong data on retail sales and New York manufacturing.The Nasdaq advanced 0.6%, while the S&P 500 added 0.4%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average scored a 0.5% gain, mostly due to two stocks — Procter & Gamble (PG) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Goldman rose 0.8%, but it has the strongest presence in the price-weighted Dow. P&G popped 3%, but it's middle of the pack in Dow weighting.Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.Apple (AAPL) staged a negative reversal, rising 0.9% in the first half-hour of trade and then retreating to almost flat. Volume was strong early in the day but dropped to about 10% above average, the early fast trade perhaps pointing to some profit-taking. Apple hit the 15% profit level Wednesday morning from its January breakout past a 118.12 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: How does Apple rate in Stock Checkup at Investors.com?In the IBD 50, a list comprised of the best stocks by fundamentals and technicals, winners led losers by a 5-2 ratio. On the blue chip Dow, advancing issues led by a 7-4 ratio.Economic news was mixed, but generally more positive than negative.Retail sales for December were revised upward from an initial 0.6% reading to 1.0%. For January, sales rose 0.4%, which was higher than any estimate in the range. Less gasoline and autos, the month-over-month pop was 0.7% — also above the highest estimate in the range.President Trump met with retail executives Wednesday and told them that his yet-to-be unveiled ""massive"" tax cut plan would be coming soon. He said the package would include lower rates for businesses and middle-income families. The changes also would simplify the tax code, Trump said.Meanwhile, the New York Fed's gauge on manufacturing in the Empire State blew up the gauge. The bullish reading came in at 18.7, smashing the consensus for 7.5 and the highest estimate for 9.0. The survey involves 175 manufacturing businesses in New York.On the negative side, two reports came in weaker than expected. Industrial production in January fell 0.3% vs. the consensus for a flat reading. The National Association of Home Builders' report for February rolled in at 65, missing the consensus view for 68.In a second day of testimony before Congress, Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen conceded that U.S. economic growth ""has been quite disappointing."" However, she insisted that the Fed's policies are correct and that the U.S. is doing better than Europe.A secondary indicator for stocks continues to flash warning signs. Investors Intelligence's sentiment gauge found bullishness among financial advisors at 61.8%, a level sometimes associated with market tops. Last week, the gauge reached 62.7%, the highest since December 2004. A nearly 14% correction in the Nasdaq followed, but the pullback was only about half that for the S&P 500.After the close, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Applied Materials (AMT) and TripAdvisor (TRIP) will report quarterly results. For growth investors, the biggest expectations surround Applied Materials. The Street expects earnings to rise 154% to 66 cents a share on a year-over-year basis. Revenue is expected to jump 44.9% to $3.27 billion.Coming up Thursday: Economic reports are expected on housing starts, jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed business outlook.RELATED:Soda Stream Pops On Quarterly ResultsHow Much Higher Can The Banks Go?

Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital also increased its stake in Apple by 11% to more than 5.8 million shares.After long steering clear of the industry, Buffett also continued to load up on shares of airlines, adding 23.8 million to his American Airlines (AAL) stake, 53.7 million to Delta Air Lines (DAL) and 24.4 million to United Airlines (UAL) as well as taking a new, 43.2 million-share stake in Southwest Airlines (LUV).He cut all but 928 shares worth of his stake in Verizon, and cut his stake in Wal-Mart from about 15 million shares to around 1.4 million shares.Apple is the top performing stock on the Dow Jones industrial average in 2017. Verizon is the Dow's worst performer in 2017 and over the last six months. Wal-Mart is the second worst-performer on the Dow in the past six months.Apple edged up 0.2% late, after setting a new all-time high in the stock market today. Shares dipped in Q4 but jumped early this month as strong iPhone sales last quarter eased some concerns about waning demand. American climbed 2.3% after hours, United rose 1.7%, Delta gained 1.9% and Southwest added 1.5%. Verizon dipped 0.2%, and Wal-Mart lost 0.1%. Berkshire's B shares were up 0.1% late, after closing up 0.7% at 166.95, near a buy point of 167.35.Berkshire also took a new, 8 million-share stake in agricultural giant Monsanto (MON), which is being bought by Bayer, and a new 167 million-share stake in Sirius XM (SIRI). Sirius jumped 3% after the bell, while Monsanto added 0.9%.Buffett dissolved his stake in Deere (DE), which has struggled as the impact of low crop prices filters through to farmers' spending on equipment.Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble (PG) climbed 2.9% on news that activist investor Trian had taken a stake of more than $3 billion in the consumer-care products giant. Procter & Gamble has been a middling Dow performer in 2017 as the company slashes costs and focuses on core brands.RELATED:What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Apple, Nike, Visa Among Dow's Top 5 Gainers So Far This Year

The U.S. House is expected to vote early in the afternoon. The bill would cut taxes by $1.4 trillion over 10 years. The corporate tax rate would be slashed from 35% to 20%.Even if the legislation clears the House, a different version is alive in the U.S. Senate.

128,PG,"""Wait and see"" is the mantra of ETF investors as Donald Trump assumes the reins of the highest office in the land. Will his ambitious campaign proposals translate to policy or get lost in translation?""The U.S. equity markets have enjoyed a classic 'buy the rumor' rally,"" built around Trump's promises, said David Haviland of Beaumont Capital, an expert at investing in exchange traded funds. ""The question is, what will be the news that causes the sell?""Haviland is one of two money managers who spoke to IBD recently about their stock market outlook as well as their best ETF investment ideas for the year ahead. For the moment, Haviland is making some bullish bets.One of Haviland's picks, O'Shares FTSE U.S. Quality Dividend (OUSA) holds stocks that could rocket if Trump delivers fiscal stimulus as promised and allows U.S. companies to bring home their offshore cash.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Henry Ma of Julex Capital, another investing pro, expects two postelection rotation trades — from bonds to equities and from high yield to growth — to continue. His ETF picks, too, reflect an overall optimism.Still, both Haviland and Ma have eyes wide open to downside risks. Like many other investors, they straddle hope and caution as the White House welcomes its newest resident.Here they are in their own words:David Haviland is managing partner and portfolio manager at Beaumont Capital Management, a Needham, Mass.-based asset manager offering ETF-based growth strategies with defensive capabilities since 2009; assets under management and advisement: $3.7 billion as of September 2016.After the Nov. 8 election, the U.S. equity markets have enjoyed a classic ""buy the rumor"" rally. The rally has focused on the promises made during the election and the prospects for beneficial change.Specifically, some of the key topics include a $1 trillion, 10-year Federal stimulus package to improve infrastructure, the reworking of the federal corporate tax system to make our tax code more competitive, the renegotiation of several trade agreements that currently induce the exportation of jobs, and the likelihood of large amounts of repatriation of U.S. multinational foreign profits.All of these items should serve to stimulate growth and reflation here in the U.S. The question is, what will be the news that causes the sell? Investors tend to buy the rumor and sell the news.Here are four ETFs that should do well in 2017. These ETFs are currently owned or could be purchased at any time within BCM strategies.In a low-interest-rate environment, the baby boomers need income from their portfolio to live off of. O'Shares has distilled the universe of large-cap equities down to a portfolio of 151 companies across all sectors that should provide better long-term, risk-adjusted returns.Examples of these portfolio companies with superior balance sheets include Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Procter & Gamble (PG). (Editor's note: OUSA has a 2.32% 12-month yield.)To be included, at least 50% of a company's sales and revenue must come from the internet. The ETF also uses a more limited screening process for liquidity and size. The top holdings include the ""FANG"" stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and (Google parent) Alphabet (GOOGL).Over one-third of humanity currently lives without clean water. The infrastructure required for this most important resource will be massive here in the U.S. as well as across the globe in both developed and emerging markets.The ETF should benefit from Trump's infrastructure build here in the U.S. We do not currently own this ETF but we have in the past, and it could make its way back into the portfolio in 2017.Top positions in the fund include Danaher (DHR), London-based Wolseley, Switzerland-based Geberit and France-based Veolia Environmental, which illustrates the global reach.(Editor's note: While the ETF has relatively low average trading volume, a large asset manager like BCM can access the underlying liquidity of the stocks in the index through the create/redeem process.)In a rising-rate environment, Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) tend to perform better than regular bonds given their yield plus inflation construct — the principal rises with inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, while the yield is fixed.This ETF also uses a short duration, currently 2.4 years, as added protection against rising rates. It yields 0.89%.Henry Ma is president and chief investment officer at Julex Capital Management, an SEC-registered quantitative investment management firm based in Boston. The firm's tactical unconstrained investment solutions aim to limit downside risks while maximizing upside potential; total client assets as of September 2016: $358 million.As we enter 2017, we may be witnessing major shifts of economic policies, which could have significant impacts on financial markets. The new year is likely to see a continuing rise of protectionism, which is evidenced notably in the Brexit referendum and the U.S. presidential election.This trend could undermine global growth, but there will be winners and losers. The export-dependent sectors have the most to lose.After eight years of monetary stimulus, policymakers among the developed countries have realized that loose monetary policies are no longer effective and fiscal policies are needed to spur economic growth. In the U.S., President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to reduce taxes and spend $1 trillion on infrastructure.These potential fiscal expansion programs have improved growth prospects, fueling higher inflation expectations, pushing bond yields upward, and causing losses for bond holders. We will see more rotation from bonds to equities in this reflationary environment. Within the equity markets, the yield-seeking trade has run its course as investors rotate from high-yielding sectors to growth sectors. We expect these two rotation trades to continue, and recommend three ETFs that could outperform in 2017.The Fed is likely to raise interest rates to 1.25%-1.50% at the end of 2017. This higher rate will certainly boost the profit margin for financial stocks. The potential appeal or revision of financial regulations such as Dodd-Frank by the Trump administration will also help improve their profitability and earnings growth.As we expect the U.S. economy to grow above 3% in 2017, the tech sector will benefit from increasing demand and higher revenue growth. The valuation is still attractive as the sector is traded at a slightly lower forward PE ratio than the S&P 500 index.Potentially protectionist trade policies and fiscal expansion programs will generate more domestic demand for small companies' products. The trailing PE ratio of IWM is 21.4, which is close to the PE ratio of the S&P 500 Index (20.4). Better growth prospects will provide small-cap stocks with more upside potential.(Editor's note: These ETFs are currently owned/were recently owned by Julex Capital strategies and could be purchased at any time within their client portfolios.)RELATED:High Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver All-Weather Income With Low Risks6 Best ETFs For When You're Both Bullish And Cautious About The Markets

As part of a restructuring, the company will shift its focus to three markets: aviation, power and health care.Home Depot (HD), McDonald's (MCD) and Procter & Gamble (PG) picked up the slack in the Dow, with gains of around 1%.Home Depot is getting support at the 50-day moving average ahead of its earnings report Tuesday before the open.Many of the session's strong movers hailed from China — not exactly a new story. Leaderboard name 58.com (WUBA) soared nearly 8%, but it's too late to buy the stock after a breakout in July and a couple of visits to the 50-day moving average.Quarterly profit at 58.com nearly doubled expectations. Sales rose 34% to $409.9 million.Meanwhile, China-based online retailer JD.com (JD) broke out over a trend line (found by connecting the stock's recent highs), giving an early entry for aggressive traders. The stock is still 13% off its high but is back above the 50-day moving  average.Before the open, the company reported a 360% surge in profit, more than double expectations. Sales increased 40% to $12.6 billion.Inside the IBD 50, Monster Beverage (MNST) extended gains after a breakout last week over a 57.35 buy point. Shares initially slumped 3% Thursday even as Monster reported its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth, but the stock reversed higher, ending with a gain of 1.2%. Shares of Monster were recently trading around 62.21, up 1.7%.Strong performers from IBD's exclusive Sector Leaders screen Monday included LGI Homes (LGIH), Align Technology (ALGN) and Ichor (ICHR).

130,PG,"Stocks rattled off an unequivocal up day Friday.The gains were not huge, with the Dow ending up 0.7%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite notched a 0.4% win. But the advance came despite some possibly worrisome political events expected over the weekend in Spain, and an election in Japan — the kind of thing which, if investors were feeling nervous, would be enough to send stocks ducking for cover.XInstead, the Dow industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all clocked another set of new highs. The Dow turned its best performance in more than a month.Preliminary data showed volume mixed, up on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq, despite options expirations that normally drive volume sharply higher.More than a half-dozen Dow industrials closed with gains of better than 1%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led the ascent, up more than 2% to breakout past a 200.09 buy point in a flat base. The stock was still in a buy range at the closing bell.Procter & Gamble (PG) tumbled nearly 4% after beating fiscal first-quarter earnings expectations by a penny, but stopping just short of targets on the revenue line. The fall stabbed below the stock's 40-week moving average, dealing the chart a serious setback.General Electric (GE) managed a minor miracle, erasing an early 6% sell-off to close 1.1% higher. The multi-industrial heavyweight missed analysts' Q3 earnings targets, then chopped back its full year earnings guidance and halved expectations for cash flow. But plans to offload $20 billion of the company's business portfolio within two years appeared to buoy some investors' spirits.It was a big week for IPOs. Internet content provider Sea Ltd. (SE) jumped 8% in its first day of trade on Friday. MongoDB (MDB) pulled back 4% Friday, giving back a small piece of the 32% gained in its opening day of trade Thursday.China-based Qudian (QD) dropped 5% for the day, but ended 36% above Wednesday's IPO price.On the IBD 50 list, Atlassian (TEAM) was the clear champion. The project-management software developer soared 25% after reporting a solid beat with its fiscal first-quarter report late Thursday. The move left shares 27% above a 39.35 buy point, a signal for investors to lock in a portion of their profit.RELATED: Looking For The Next Nvidia?

135,PG,"Dreaming of a better future comes naturally to ambitious, goal-driven strivers. It's fun and exciting to envision what you can achieve as long as you commit to a bold course of action.But there's another, often overlooked ingredient that goal seekers need: courage. It takes bravery and resilience to pursue lofty dreams, especially when you must veer far outside your comfort zone.Mustering the courage to stay on track requires steely determination and the ability to conquer short-term fear to reap long-term rewards. Follow these tips to demonstrate valor in the face of danger:Put fear in perspective. You can react to fear by succumbing to it or pummeling it into submission. It depends on how badly you want to attain your dream and whether you're mentally ready to undergo harrowing challenges.""Dreaming involves risk, so you need to be courageous as you venture into the unknown,"" said Jeremy Cage, a strategy and marketing consultant in Darien, Conn. ""To act courageously, you have to win the battle in your mind.""Weigh risk and reward. If you exaggerate the level of fear you feel, it can dampen your courage. Instead, acknowledge fears swirling around you without letting them overtake you.Cage, 52, spent 16 years at Procter & Gamble (PG). The company asked him to consider moving to Venezuela early in his career to take a new position. During a week of touring Caracas and meeting prospective colleagues, Cage learned about the city's violent crime. He even spotted bullet holes in an elevator.Despite his concerns, he liked the P&G team in Venezuela, welcomed the job opportunity and marveled at the beautiful scenery and year-round good weather.

139,PG,"Investors have long turned to the utility sector for steady returns. Rich yields in recent years also have drawn investors to master limited partnerships, which trade publicly like stocks and typically hold assets in stable businesses like energy pipelines.A different strategy might be in order for 2017 with interest rates likely to get off their historical lows and start rising. Both areas of the market will continue to attract the attention of income investors, but they do not come without risk.How fast rates rise likely will have a big impact on returns. Most analysts expect small, gradual increases. How should utilities and MLPs be played in such a scenario? What would happen if rates suddenly jump?Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingAbove-average yields have helped Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) and iShares U.S. Utilities ETF (IDU) post annual average returns of 7.2% and 7.6% over the last 15 years. These performances have outpaced ETFs tracking the S&P 500. SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) have returned annual averages of 6.5% over the same period.Rising interest rates have the potential to make these investments less attractive than fixed-income investments and eat into utility and MLP profits as borrowing costs creep up. To mitigate the risk of spikes in interest rates, investors may need to be more selective and tactical. Valuations and debt-to-equity ratios become increasingly important and dollar-cost averaging can help to tamp down portfolio volatility.Utility stocks have pulled back since a summer run-up, yet remain on track to post healthy returns for 2016. ""The fundamentals for the sector are still pretty good,"" said Ryan Hedrick, a utilities analyst for T. Rowe Price. ""Valuations for purely regulated utilities have corrected to a 7% to 8% discount to the market multiple. When we consider the total return algorithm of dividend yield plus earnings growth, the sector becomes more reasonably valued.""Over the long term, Hedrick expects utility companies to benefit from growing capital investment opportunities. ""There is room for ongoing capital investment to modernize grid infrastructure and to replace aging gas pipelines,"" he said. ""There is also a need to add transmission and distribution infrastructure to accommodate renewables while maintaining reliability.""Click Here To See A Table Of Top Yielding Utility StocksHedrick points out that utilities may face near-term resistance from higher interest rates. ""There is less to worry about, presumably today, at these prices than there was in the middle of the summer around Brexit when the 10-year Treasury was under 1.5%,"" he said. ""It is still a persistent risk for the sector however.""Dividend growth leaders may be better positioned to mitigate this risk. ""We look for very strong companies that are multiyear winners,"" Hedrick said. ""At the margin, I do have a bias for companies with strong dividend growth that tend to perform better in rising rate environments.""One dividend grower that Hedrick believes can capitalize on infrastructure upgrade efforts is PG&E Corp. (PCG) ""Substantial investments will be required to modernize their gas and electric system and ultimately help implement California's low-carbon-energy policies, which will increase renewable penetration,"" he said. ""We see a multiyear runway for attractive earnings growth and slightly faster dividend growth.""Shares of PG&E are up 10% year-to-date and carry a dividend yield of 3.3%.MLPs may have a place in the portfolios of investors with a greater appetite for risk. ""Having a small tactical allocation to MLPs probably makes sense for more aggressive income investors,"" said David Fabian, managing partner of FMD Capital Management. ""Historically, these companies have been turned to by income investors to enhance portfolio yields.""Fabian cautions investors against becoming overcommitted to MLPs. ""In my experience and in talking to various income investors, when people get into trouble is when they have too much of one thing in their portfolio,"" he said. ""When people start putting 20%, 30% or 40% of their portfolios in MLPs, they are overweighting their portfolios toward an asset class that can have a high degree of volatility.""The direction of oil and natural gas prices has been a major source of the volatility that Fabian references. ""MLPs are going to be highly correlated to what is happening in the commodity space,"" he said. ""Income investors need to be very cognizant of that risk.""Fabian emphasizes the significance of cost basis in buying MLPs. ""You have to be very tactical about when you purchase them,"" he said. ""If you want to purchase a full position in MLPs, maybe you break it up into two or three trades so you can average your way into it.""Choosing between an ETF or individual MLPs is also an important consideration. ""I typically recommend that investors purchase a diversified basket of MLPs through a vehicle like the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) or something similar,"" Fabian said. ""You get highly transparent and very liquid access to the sector. There are probably 10 ETFs or ETNs that are very viable investment vehicles to be able to play the space.""AMLP, which is up 2.2% for the year, has 27 holdings and a yield of 8.4%. Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP) is the largest position in the fund.

142,PG,"U.S. stocks stepped back near midday Tuesday as economic data delivered mixed signals.The Nasdaq sliced off 0.4%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was running about 15% above Monday's pace but up only 2% on the Nasdaq.Most secondary indexes were down. Two exceptions were NYSE energy sector, up 0.1%, and the Dow Jones utility average, up 0.4%.Among blue chips, Procter & Gamble (PG) showed strength. The personal care products provider gapped up more than 4% in heavy volume. Procter & Gamble reported quarterly earnings 5% higher than expected. Revenue was flat but slightly above the Street's consensus view.IBD'S TAKE: Lesser known stocks can sometimes outperform the big names. A small software stock is in a buy zone.Procter & Gamble has been selling off low-profit units, and the strategy appears to be paying off. Margin after tax was 17.6% for  the quarter, matching the best result in at least 19 quarters. The company's brands include Crest toothpaste, Dawn dishwashing liquid, Bounty paper towels, Gillette razors, Pampers diapers and Tide detergent.Procter & Gamble's stock chart ran into trouble recently. The stock broke out in June and advanced steadily until falling in six consecutive sessions through Monday, stopping at the 200-day line. However, all six sessions came in meek volume.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, three issues fell for every one that rose.Economic reports were a mixed bag.

143,PG,"Procter & Gamble (PG), which has spent years paring down its sprawling consumer-products empire, is finally returning to growth mode.Organic sales — a measure that excludes the effects of currency exchange-rate fluctuations as well as acquisitions and divestitures — rose in all five of P&G's product divisions units last quarter, leading to a 3% gain companywide. And while total revenue still fell, it was the smallest decrease since 2014.The results signal that P&G's strategy of divesting nonessential brands to focus on its main household and personal-care businesses is starting to pay off. P&G completed the sale of more than 40 beauty brands to Coty (COTY) this month, a move that Chief Executive Officer David Taylor called ""the last major step"" in P&G's transformation of its portfolio. The company is now focusing all of its attention on categories where it holds leading positions, he said.Tuesday's results show the efforts are gaining traction.""P&G is making solid progress in improving share trends,"" Mark Astrachan, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., said in a note. He recommends buying the shares.Profit was $1.03 a share, excluding some items, in PG's fiscal first quarter, which ended Sept. 30. Analysts estimated 98 cents, on average. Revenue slipped less than 0.1% to $16.5 billion, Cincinnati-based P&G said in a statement Tuesday. That roughly matched analysts' projections.IBD'S TAKE: P&G has worked hard to stay above water in a tough global environment for consumer products firms. But it's a lot more profitable to work hard in a growth sector. New Oriental Education broke out to a new high Tuesday after the Chinese education firm reported solid earnings as enrollment jumped 31%.P&G shares rose as much as 4.4% to 87.77 on the stock market today, the biggest intraday increase in a year and trying to retake its 50-day line. P&G already had gained 5.9% this year through Monday.Organic sales advanced 3% in the grooming business, which includes Gillette shaving products. Sales by that measure climbed 3% in the beauty unit, which sells Pantene shampoo and Olay skin care products. The health care division, the maker of Crest toothpaste and Prilosec heartburn medicine, had the biggest organic sales increase at 7%.The fabric and home care unit posted a 4% organic sales gain, while the baby, feminine and family care business had a 2% advance.The companywide organic sales increase of 3% topped analysts' consensus expectation of a 2% gain, Astrachan said. Sales volumes rose 3%, marking the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014, he said.P&G maintained its forecasts that organic sales would grow about 2% and adjusted earnings would increase at a mid-single-digit percentage rate in its current fiscal year.

146,PG,"Two days after a historic U.S. presidential election, the country still appears to show deep divisions.On Wednesday, fellow Americans in some cities took to the streets, and even closed some highways, to protest Tuesday's election victory by Donald Trump. Why? In a vitriol-infused campaign, the president-elect raised the ire of many citizens and Mexicans with blunt talk about immigrants and women.Trump's harsh rhetoric intensified the spotlight on issues of economic, racial, gender and social inequality. The Twitter hashtag #BlackLivesMatter became a rallying cry over allegations of racial profiling and reports of unfair treatment by law enforcement. The past two years have been epochal in terms of successful campaigning in some states to raise minimum wages.What does all of this have to do with stock investing?Markets work. They provide equality of opportunity.Anyone who puts in the time and effort to learn how the market really works, and why certain stocks go up more than others, can invest in the market. No matter how much or how little money an investor has, he or she gains the right to succeed financially.Consider William O'Neil, who founded Investor's Business Daily in 1984 after running a successful equity research investment firm and brokerage since the 1960s. His first purchase in the stock market was a few shares in Procter & Gamble (PG). Despite some early mistakes, O'Neil never quit.In the market, when you push the buy button, no one knows or cares what your skin color is, how much or how little school education you've had, what is your street address, or whether you are a man, woman or transgender human being. The market is blind. It works because the stock market is ruled by the law of supply and demand.Some may say, ""Well, don't you need a million dollars to make a million in the stock market?""Sure, if your goal is to make a million, it may take less time by starting with $1,000,000 than with $1,000. But human ego, ignorance and bad decisions can easily shrink that initial wad of big cash.Far more important: Take all of these steps and stay committed. Consistently save some of your income; get educated about the stock market through programs such as the free IBD University online courses; read about business trends; follow the daily action of the market itself and the major indexes; make some investments and learn from your mistakes; and stick with solid buy, hold and sell rules.""The vast majority of our children are financially illiterate when they graduate from high school, and no better educated about money after going through college,"" Jim Cramer wrote in the 1999 book, ""Jim Cramer's Stay Mad for Life.""Contrast the stock market with other markets in this country.In the book ""Phishing for Phools,"" George A. Akerlof and Robert J. Shiller wrote about a 1990s study in which a group of individuals went  to an auto dealership to ask for car price quotes. They were all age 28 to 32, had three to four years of postsecondary education, wore similar ""yuppie"" clothes, and drove similar rental cars to the dealers.So, what did the two lawyer-economists Ian Ayres and Peter Siegelman find?""In the final negotiated offer, Ayres and Siegelman found that white women were given a quote of $246 (inflation-adjusted) more than the white men; black women, $773 more; and black men, $2,026 more,"" Akerlof and Shiller wrote. ""It suggests that, much more generally, beyond the auto showroom, black men and black women are likely to get bad deals.""Never forget that the stock market doesn't operate that way. Stock quotes are blind to race, gender and religion.(Editor's Note: ""Phishing for Phools"" was published in 2015 by Princeton University Press.)RELATED:The Kid's Way To Wealth: Get A Job, Save And Invest

150,PG,"As Walt Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger's scheduled retirement date looms closer, the entertainment giant's search for his replacement remains low-profile, a departure from the open process it previously employed.It's been seven months since heir apparent Tom Staggs' abrupt departure left Iger without a clear-cut successor. The top executive recruiting firms say they haven't been hired by Disney, and Iger hasn't moved members of his executive team into newer or more prominent roles to audition them for the top spot. The company has said only that there is a process in place that the board is following, which will include evaluating internal and external candidates.While there's still time to conduct a search before Iger's contract ends in June 2018, the quiet nature of the current succession planning stands in sharp contrast to the widely watched, five-year bake-off from which Staggs emerged as the leading contender for the job. That's fueling speculation that the board could request that Iger, 65, stay on longer than his scheduled retirement date, something it has already asked of him twice before.""I don't think anyone — employee, investor or director — would be hesitant in granting him a new contract,"" said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. ""That could happen quickly and easily. Why hasn't it happened already? That's a fair question.""Iger said on a May conference call with investors that he didn't have any plans to stick around past the current date.""The board is very actively engaged in a succession process, as it has been actually for some time,"" he said. ""It believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company.""A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment further. Disney board members on the governance and nominating committee, including former Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Orin Smith, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook (FB) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and former Clorox (CLX) Chairman Robert Matschullat, didn't respond or declined to comment.Typically it takes a big public company six to seven months to complete a search once the board begins to contact and interview prospective candidates, though additional time is required before that, said Peter Crist, chairman of Crist Kolder Associates, a boutique search firm outside Chicago. ""We do lots of mapping projects with the company that take months"" about the qualities it wants and needs in a new CEO, Crist said.At Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) executive recruiter Spencer Stuart began consulting with directors about what the company needed in a new leader and who they should consider about a year before Doug McMillon was named the retailer's CEO in November 2013, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to talk publicly. The board narrowed its search to two internal candidates, McMillon and former head of U.S. operations Bill Simon, about six months before making its final decision.At Procter & Gamble (PG), directors first started talking about replacing then-CEO Bob MacDonald in July 2012 and then asked A.G. Lafley to return as CEO and chairman in May 2013. Lafley, who'd already served as CEO at P&G from 2000 until 2009, immediately reorganized the company into four businesses, each headed by a president who was considered a contender for the CEO post. One of the four, David Taylor, was named global president of home care and subsequently also took charge of P&G's beauty business.In July 2015, Lafley and P&G's other directors named Taylor the consumer giant's new CEO, concluding the two-year process.Iger himself was promoted in 2005 after a six-month search by the board. The executive, who had led Disney's TV operations and international business and had served as president for five years, was evaluated against external candidates with help from Heidrick & Struggles, directors said at the time. He got the top job only after a high-profile campaign by some shareholders to oust then-CEO Michael Eisner. Former directors in a long-running feud with the company still criticized Iger's selection as hasty, but the board said it had been thorough and careful.Until this year, it looked as if Disney's choice for Iger's successor would be more orderly, with a seasoned executive waiting in the wings in the COO position. Staggs had risen to the No. 2 spot at the company after a five-year period in which he and another senior manager, Jay Rasulo, competed with each other to become Iger's successor. The two even switched jobs to give Staggs more experience operating a business and Rasulo exposure to the executive suite. Rasulo, then serving as chief financial officer, left the company last year after Staggs' promotion to COO.Staggs' exit, after failing to gain the full backing of Iger and the board, left no other internal candidate with both operational experience and a corporate role.Of the six CEOs since Disney's founding in 1923, only Eisner came from the outside. Eisner, who served from 1984 to 2005, joined the company from Paramount Pictures, where he was president.While the board contemplates who will lead the company after June 2018, Iger remains active in planning how to shape Disney's future. In recent weeks, he considered buying Twitter, but decided to pass, partly because of price and partly because of concern about bullying on the social-media site, people familiar with the matter said last month.At an October event in Boston, Iger said it wasn't enough for the company to own key brands like ABC, ESPN and Pixar. Disney needs to have a direct connection to consumers through mobile devices, he said.""What we're thinking about a lot is what role does technology have in distributing from us to the consumer?"" he said. ""How must we invest in that?""In its search for Iger's replacement, Disney's board should be casting a wide net, looking for candidates inside and outside the company, particularly ones with high-tech chops, said Paul Winum, a senior partner at the management consulting firm RHR International and co-author of ""Inside CEO Succession.""""The landscape is changing so rapidly, technology is opening up new distribution platforms, overseas markets will be  huge opportunities,"" he said. ""The leadership skills have changed dramatically just in the last two years.""When a CEO succession plan unravels, as it did at Disney, the company usually starts thinking about the next, younger generation of executives inside, giving them bigger and different kinds of experience to prepare them for the top job, said Joseph L. Bower, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied succession planning. Disney hasn't made any major changes recently to suggest it's grooming anyone internally, however.""Disney isn't in trouble and currently has a strong CEO in place,"" Bower said. ""But you don't want someone to come in at the last minute to take over.""

151,PG,"Indexes weakened in afternoon trading Tuesday, as earnings reports caused a tumble for General Motors (GM) and for home-improvement stocks.The Nasdaq was down 0.5% and the S&P 500 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average did a little better, down 0.2% as components Procter & Gamble (PG) and Merck (MRK) rose following earnings reports.Volume was running higher on the Nasdaq and NYSE.The building products industry and other home-improvement stocks were rattled in a combination of weak earnings reports and a poor outlook from a major appliance maker. Air conditioning and heating, construction products, wood products, paints and appliances were industry groups down 2% to 6%.Masco (MAS) plunged nearly 10% in heavy trading, falling below the long-term 200-day moving average. The stock had been forming a base-on-base pattern, but is now seriously damaged. Masco missed third-quarter profit expectations, and sales growth of 2% continued a trend of flat or low single-digit gains dating back to 2015. Masco — which makes doors, windows, plumbing fixtures and other construction products — is exiting its lower-margin cabinet business.BMC Stock Holdings (BMCH) fell 5% in rapid trade. The supplier of lumber and other building products has been trading below the 200-day moving average for about two weeks. It's been below the 50-day line since Sept. 9.Whirlpool (WHR) gapped down to a loss of more than 11% in the highest volume since at least April 26, where there was a similar earnings-related sell-off. The appliance manufacturer missed profit and sales estimates and it cut its full-year earnings outlook. Whirlpool expects to earn $14 to $14.25 a share in 2016, down from an earlier forecast of as high as $14.75. The company cited soft demand in the U.S. and the U.K. and the weakening of the British pound.General Motors skidded 4% in heavy volume. The stock dipped below its 50-day moving average but shares remained in a long sideways pattern. The automaker beat profit and sales expectations and it forecast full-year earnings at the high end of $5.50-$6; that's above analysts' consensus of $5.85. But GM warned it may miss its 2016 European profit target due to Brexit. It also saw a softening in the U.S. auto market.Waters (WAT) gapped down to a loss of nearly 12% in huge volume after it reported Q3 profit that met the consensus estimate. The maker of products for drug development reported adjusted earnings of $1.57 a share, up 11%, on sales of $526.8 million, a 5% increase. Waters had been a leading stock, mounting a 15% gain from a 140.80 buy point. It was forming a new base, but Tuesday's crash has roiled the pattern.Metals stocks were leading the market, and a high-rated part of that sector made a breakout.Ternium (TX) jumped nearly 5% as it topped the 23.69 buy point of a cup-without-handle base. Volume was running four times the average, leaving little doubt that a stampede of institutional investors was buying shares. The Luxembourg-based steel producer is in talks to acquire a steel plant in Brazil from Germany's ThyssenKrupp, according to reports.RELATED:GM Sinks On Europe Warning; United Tech Ups View; Cat, 3M Guide LowApple Earnings After The Close: What To ExpectLockheed Martin Soars On Outlook But F-35 Contract Talks Drag On

153,PG,"A future with slow-growing productivity — and by extension, slow-growing incomes — seems close to becoming conventional wisdom. But the strides that Wal-Mart (WMT) is making with technology that streamlines everything from tracking inventory to simplifying check-out suggest a brighter outlook.The retail giant was considered a prime force behind the last productivity boom (think bar codes, scanners and retailer-supplier data links) and the subsequent productivity bust (heavier reliance on temps and part-time workers come to mind).But facing competitive threats from Amazon (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST), and the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own wage scale, Wal-Mart is re-engineering virtually every aspect of its business. New technologies and strategies have been tested, sending drones flying through warehouses, equipping shoppers with their own scanners and putting apps in the hands of efficiency-seeking store managers. Now sales are on the upswing, though profits have yet to follow, as the pace of change at Wal-Mart is accelerating.The payoff for investors won't be immediate. On Oct. 6, Wal-Mart cut its profit outlook again as it invests heavily to improve operations in stores and online. The stock has a lousy 19 Composite Rating out of 99, which means the stock only outperforms 19% of all other stocks based on earnings, share price performance and other key criteria. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group is No. 190 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart, like many retailers and companies in other modest-wage industries, have seen profit margins pressured amid intense competition and rising wage pressures. But some have thrived. On Thursday, Ulta Beauty predicted earnings growth above 20% through 2019. Read this Investor's Corner primer on profit margins.The good news for consumers is that the retail giant is sharing some of its efficiency gains via lower prices, which means you can expect its efficiency measures to spread to other companies. Amazon may be the most disruptive force in retail, but Wal-Mart's sheer scale still gives it an outsized influence on the economy. Kroger (KR), Target and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts, the companies have hinted at and analysts have signaled in recent weeks. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.Here's a look at some technology programs underway at Wal-Mart and how they could change the productivity paradigm for retailers and the broader economy.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is the best stock in its sector, but its Retail-Major Discount Chains group is ranked 190 out of 197 by IBD based on stock performance and Wal-Mart shares aren't near a buy point. For a primer on how to find stocks to buy at the right time, visit IBD University.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said on the Aug. 16 earnings call that the company will roll out its new self-scan-and-pay technology at all Sam's Clubs this fall, letting members of the discount warehouses ""skip the checkout line.""Customers can use the ""Scan & Go"" app to ring up items as they put them in their shopping cart and see a running receipt total on their phones. The app also handles payment, so customers just show their receipts to greeters on the way out.The technology has been a long time in development. In 2014, the company pulled the plug on a year-old Scan & Go pilot program at 200 Wal-Marts using an app that was only compatible with Apple (AAPL) iPhones.But the company isn't reserving its latest innovations for Sam's Club customers. In June, Wal-Mart rolled out mobile payment technology at all of its 4,600 U.S. locations. It is testing out customer handheld scanning devices provided by the store in a number of Wal-Mart locations, but management has noted the logic of offering the same self-scan capability via smartphone that it's doing at Sam's Club.Scanning items as you put them in your cart relieves one of the frustrations of people who prefer the self-checkout lane. But like shoppers who check out with the help of a cashier, they still face another frustration: Finding bar codes slows everything down.Wal-Mart is experimenting with a technology called digital watermarking that, in the words of McMillon via Instagram in June 2015, ""could transform the way our customers check out.""Digimarc (DMRC), which subsequently confirmed that its bar code technology was the subject of McMillon's post, invisibly embeds bar code information repeatedly over retail packaging so there's no need to locate it or reorient the merchandise before scanning.Adoption of this next-generation bar code, if broad adoption is to occur, must proceed in steps. Bar code scanners must be designed to read the digital watermarking, and Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Datalogic are now equipping their scanners to do so.Regional grocer Wegmans has begun using digital watermarking on its private-label packaging in a logical first step before broader adoption by consumer packaging companies. Wegmans, which has 89 stores, expects $2 million in annual savings for every extra item scanned per minute vs. the usual 21, noted Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone in a recent research report.The next big breakthrough would be for major producers like Procter & Gamble (PG) to update their packaging. A push from Wal-Mart could certainly provide an impetus, but there's another important catalyst: By mid-2018, food labels of large manufacturers must meet new standards, making nutrition information easier to read, Stone notes.Eventually, Digimarc has said, shopping carts equipped with scanners could read its bar codes when customers put items in the cart.Wal-Mart said in June that it will start using drones to take inventory in its warehouses by late 2016 or early 2017, identifying when stocks are misplaced or running low. The drones will make a one-day job out of work that now takes employees a month to complete, while reducing the risk of accidents, Wal-Mart says.The drones are part of a larger push to manage inventories more efficiently. Wal-Mart, like other retailers including Home Depot (HD), Target and Kohl's (KSS), has been making a big push to keep inventories to a minimum and improve efficiency by rationalizing product selection (such as three sizes of salad dressing instead of six) and having more frequent supplier deliveries. Wal-Mart also is keeping more inventory in distribution centers to facilitate e-commerce shipping. One goal is simply limiting the number of times merchandise has to be moved by an employee from the time Wal-Mart receives a supplier shipment to final purchase.The latest U.S. economic data show that inventories at general merchandise stores fell 0.6% from a year earlier in July. In the short term, better inventory management may hold down economywide output and make productivity look awful, even if it's actually a partial result of retailers making efficiency gains. In the second quarter, leaner inventories subtracted 1.16 percentage points from GDP.Over time, though, inventory efficiencies reduce costs and permit lower prices and, possibly, better product selection. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.Now every member of Wal-Mart's in-store management team has a My Productivity smartphone app to request restocking of certain items and check sales trends while they roam the aisles and assist customers.""Prior to My Productivity, management associates were spending thousands of hours in the backrooms of our stores annually,"" wrote Mark Ibbotson, Wal-Mart executive vice president, in a June blog post introducing the new technology. ""That simply cannot be in today's world.""Wal-Mart's latest move to improve productivity, like many of its efficiency gains, involved using old technology in a new way. In early September, the company said it was cutting 7,000 cash accounting and invoicing jobs in its U.S. stores. Instead, the company will use cash recycler machines to count money and will handle invoicing at a central office.Wal-Mart also has been dreaming up new ideas for fixing the age-old problem of unused shopping carts left in the parking lot or cluttering the shopping aisles. This year, Wal-Mart filed a patent for a robot that collects unused shopping carts. A related idea would let customers hail a shopping cart via smartphone.While there's no telling how long it may take that burst of creativity to materialize in stores, the key point is that Wal-Mart is leaving no stone unturned or idea unconsidered to drive productivity and improve the customer experience. On Oct. 6, the company hosted a few dozen companies out of 250 original applicants in a ""Technology Innovation Open Call."" The winners got to pitch their technology solutions for retail, logistics, big data, security and social media.Wal-Mart's efficiency moves have swept through the economy before. An influential McKinsey & Co. study on productivity in the second half of the 1990s found that the retail sector accounted for nearly one-fourth of the U.S. rise, adding that ""more than half of the productivity acceleration in the retailing of general merchandise can be explained by only two syllables: Wal-Mart.""Big information technology breakthroughs, such as bar codes, wireless scanning guns and electronic data interchange with suppliers, came long before productivity took off. Wal-Mart's efficiency gains in that era were as much due to managerial efforts, McKinsey found. The key was that its tech and management changes were both geared toward achieving ""everyday low prices."" Wal-Mart reached a scale that compelled its business partners and rivals to follow suit or risk being left behind.U.S. output per work hour at general merchandise stores, excluding department stores, soared by nearly 150% from 1995 to 2007.But over the past eight years through the end of 2015, productivity in this sector has risen just 3%.What went wrong? A sluggish economic recovery, modest wage gains, and an overabundance of stores as Amazon gained market share. Wal-Mart, which opted to close 154 U.S. stores at the start of 2016, went through a six-quarter string of same-store sales declines through mid-2014 as its customer-satisfaction rankings tumbled.Retailers and other modest-wage employers such as fast-food chains took what might be viewed as profit shortcuts. Wal-Mart reportedly boosted its temp workforce and had understaffed stores. Other employers boosted their ranks of part-timers clocking fewer than 30 hours per week to dodge paying for health insurance or facing a fine under the ObamaCare employer mandate.Wal-Mart's penny pinching hurt sales and productivity, ultimately spurring lower profits and a change in strategy.As the economy nears full employment and employers recognize that cutting corners hasn't paid off, wage gains are picking up as companies try to raise their game. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront, raising its own base wage to $10 an hour, pushing other modest-wage employers to follow suit or suffer low morale and high turnover.Yet whatever productivity gains Wal-Mart is seeing from initiatives launched in the past year or two have yet to catch up to its extra spending on wages and on technology to improve customer satisfaction and narrow the gap with Amazon. While sales rose 3.1% from a year ago at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores in the second quarter, expenses rose 8.3% and operating income fell 6.2%.The company warned last week that it won't turn the corner on earnings growth until 2018, forecasting roughly flat per-share profits next year, prompting some analysts to reel in their price target for Wal-Mart shares. Wal-Mart also said it would scale back plans to grow its U.S. store base, adding just 55 stores in the next fiscal year, compared with 135 this year, while building more distribution centers for online orders.Ultimately, consumers will decide with their feet and their wallets how productive Wal-Mart investments turn out to be. On that score, Wal-Mart's 1.2% same-store increase in customer traffic last quarter looked like a good sign, even as fewer people were shopping at rivals Target and Dollar General.Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip Cashier Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

155,PG,"U.S. stocks advanced confidently for solid gains Tuesday, closing near session highs.The Nasdaq rose 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6% and 0.7% respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running modestly higher but that was on an easy comparison. Volume declined for three sessions in a row through Monday.Monday night's uneventful presidential debate gave the market little reason to react in fear or greed. Economic news Tuesday and at least one technical factor might have been the bigger influences on the day's action.The PMI Services Flash survey came in at 51.9, up from August's 50.9 reading. Meanwhile, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index trampled the Street's 98.8 consensus estimate with 104.1 for September, which was higher than any estimate in the range.A technical factor also may have improved the market's mood. The put-call ratio closed at 1.08 Monday, a level that sometimes hints at a short-term bottom. The last time the ratio was in that neighborhood was Sept. 9 and 13, with readings of 1.14 and 1.11. The Nasdaq formed a bottom and began to rise around that time.If the presidential candidates managed to get through Monday night's debate without disturbing the market, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer also kept trouble at arm's length. Fischer spoke at Howard University on Tuesday and said he did not want to raise interest rates ""too much"" and added that he wasn't sure when it should happen. On Aug. 26, Fischer upset the market a bit when he suggested two rate hikes this year would be ""consistent"" with Fed Chair Janet Yellen's remarks.IBD'S TAKE: A diverse mix of gainers Tuesday was a good sign for the stock market. But there's nothing wrong with long-time big leaders: Facebook is retaking a buy point, at least intraday.Individual stocks were finding different reasons to advance Tuesday, a good sign. Catalysts varied from divestitures, regulatory approval and a new price target to earnings and industry conditions.For example, Procter & Gamble (PG) popped about 0.6% in very heavy volume. The company is close to wrapping up a deal to transfer 41 brands to Coty (COTY). Procter & Gamble has been divesting weaker units for the past two years. Analysts say the Coty move completes P&G's divestiture program. The Street expects P&G to grow EPS 6% in fiscal 2017 ending in June and then 9% in fiscal 2018. The 9% growth would be the best in 10 years.Abiomed (ABMD) gained Japan's regulatory go-ahead for the Massachusetts company's heart pump device. The midcap stock thrust 2% in above-average volume to a 52-week high. The Street expects Abiomed to grow earnings 38% in fiscal 2017 ending in March and then 54% the following year.Amazon.com (AMZN) rode 2% to a new high after JPMorgan & Chase raised its price target from 925 to 1,000 and kept shares at an overweight rating.Thor Industries (THO) gapped up 3.5% on quarterly results and a strong rating for the group. Volume was running more than 500% above average.RV shipments industrywide have been running strong. The tally came in at 35,946 in August, which was the best August total since 1977. The August total represented a 31% year over year gain, according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association.Other RV stocks also are doing well. Drew Industries (DW) bounced off its 50-day moving average line Tuesday, as the stock gained more than  3% in slightly below-average volume. Patrick Industries (PATK) rumbled more than 4% higher as it retook its 50-day line.

156,PG,"Total dividends in the S&P 500 reached a near record in the second quarter, although the pace of dividend growth continues to slow.Aggregate dividends in the S&P 500 totaled $105.8 billion in Q2, a figure that was topped only by the total of this year's first quarter. The second quarter also was the 10th straight quarter that the trailing 12-month composite per-share dividend for the S&P 500 hit a new high, according to a study by FactSet.Breaking it down by sector, information technology and consumer staples led in rewarding shareholders. The IT sector ended Q2 with dividend payments of $16.4 billion and $64.7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. In consumer staples, $14.3 billion was paid out in dividends and $56 billion in the trailing 12 months.Procter & Gamble (PG), Philip Morris (PM) and Wal-Mart (WMT) -- companies with a reputation for dependable dividends -- were the top payers in the sector. Philip Morris is in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, as the stock forms a new base with a 104.30 buy point. Its annualized dividend yield exceeds 4%.But while dividends continue to expand, FactSet also found they increased 6.1% in Q2. That's well below the 10.8% average of the past three years. Also, Q2 dividend growth was at a single-digit pace for the third consecutive quarter.Future gains are likely to slow further. Analysts expect the S&P's dividends to rise only 4.7% over the next 12 months. (Three months ago, the estimate was for a 4.9% increase.)""This slowing growth has been an ongoing trend in the S&P 500 for over a year,"" the FactSet report said, but it didn't elaborate on the reasons.The trailing 12-month dividend yield of the S&P 500 was 2.07% at the end of Q2, and that also showed a decline, from 2.5% a year ago.There's a softening trend also in yield-rich stocks. FactSet notes that in the first six months of 2016, the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) had risen more than 10%. The S&P 500 utilities and telecom sectors were each up more than 21%. Over the same time period, the S&P 500 index climbed less than 3%. But since the end of June, the Dividend Aristocrats ETF has lagged the S&P 500 by about 3 percentage points. The utilities and telecom sectors have underperformed the S&P by even larger margins.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and General Electric (GE) came out on top when combining dividend payments and share buybacks over the trailing 12 months. Apple dividends totaled $3.19 billion. Combined with $10.9 billion in buybacks, Apple's contribution to shareholders was more than $14 billion, FactSet says.Microsoft's combined dividend and buyback spending was $6.4 billion and GE's $9.8 billionRELATED:Don't Give Up On These Utility Leaders Just YetHow Apple, Amazon, Alibaba Could Disrupt Google's Mobile Ad Business

157,PG,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Apple (AAPL) led all S&P 500 companies in stock dividends paid in the second quarter, says a new report from FactSet Research.Exxon Mobil paid $3.13 billion in dividends in Q2, barely edging Apple at $3.12 billion. But Apple dominated the field in dividends and share buybacks in Q2 combined, totaling $14 billion, followed by General Electric (GE), then Microsoft (MSFT), says FactSet.FactSet said aggregate quarterly dividends for the S&P 500 amounted to $105.8 billion in Q2, an increase of 0.8% from Q2 2015. It was the second-largest dividend total in at least 10 years, following Q1 2016. Firms in the S&P 500 also spent $125.1 billion on share buybacks during Q2, the smallest quarterly total since Q3 2013.IBD'S TAKE: A dividend is a payment made by a company to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profit, in order to return wealth. Dividends put cash in shareholders' hands, while stock buybacks are also a popular way to return capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings. Current and annual earnings are keys to IBD's CAN SLIM.At the sector level, companies in information technology led all 10 S&P industry groups in terms of aggregate dividends paid during Q2, at $16.4 billion. Over the trailing 12-month period, the IT sector paid out dividends totaling $64.7 billion, led by Apple, Microsoft and IBM (IBM). The consumer staples sector was second, with $56 billion in dividend distribution over the 12-month period, led by Procter & Gamble (PG), Philip Morris International (PM) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).The total dividend payout for the 12 months ending in Q2 amounted to $427.5 billion, up 7.1% year over year and the largest total in at least 10 years. It also marked the 10th consecutive quarter that the trailing 12-month dividend payout for the S&P 500 index hit a new high.Apple stock rose nearly 1% in the stock market today, to 114.62. Exxon Mobil stock rose a fraction, to 83.54.

158,PG,"Stocks still logged mild losses at lunchtime in New York on Monday. But Tesla Motors (TSLA) defied the decline after the leader in electric vehicles posted a much better than expected 70% boost in third-quarter deliveries.Tesla shares romped more than 4% higher to 212.79 and got as high as 215.67. Watch to see if the stock can now retake its 200-day moving average, which has been falling gradually since January.A continued strong move by Tesla would also send the stock above its midterm 50-day moving average and give bears some more chills. Typically, a great stock will trade above both the 50- and 200-day lines in preparing for a sound breakout and a big move.Tesla has shown it needs more time to digest its monster gains since initially breaking out to 52-week highs in the spring of 2013 near 40.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell 0.5% while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.4%. Volume was running lower on both main exchanges. The Nasdaq has scored three up weeks in a row.Procter & Gamble (PG) was among three Dow industrials components to fall 1 point or more, but the soap and shampoo giant is acting fine after clearing an 83.97 flat-base pattern at the end of June.Other vehicle makers also advanced. RV maker Winnebago Industries (WGO) did a wheelie of its own, spiking 25% to a multiyear high in huge volume, while peer Thor Industries (THO) gained nearly 1%. The former is acquiring towable recreational vehicle firm Grand Design in a $500 million cash and stock deal. Winnebago also announced preliminary earnings above analyst forecasts.Elsewhere in the stock market today, payrolls processor Paychex (PAYX) continued to struggle after last week's 3.4% slide, which was the stock's worst week since a 10% thrashing in the first week of the year. Shares fell more than 1% to 57.15. The stock is clearly in basing mode after posting weak bottom-line growth of just 3% in the August-ended fiscal first quarter. The stock is still holding on to a gain of nearly 9% since it broke out of a cup-with-handle pattern at 54.67 on June 2.It's critical in the CAN SLIM investment strategy to never let a decent gain — read 10% or higher — turn into a loss.Apple (AAPL) dipped 0.4% to 112.55, holding on to a gain of nearly 2% since its high-volume breakout past a 110.33 cup-with-handle entry on Sept. 14.A proper handle must form over a minimum five trading days; in Apple's case, the handle began with a mild reversal on Aug. 16 after hitting an intraday high of 110.23. Then it drifted lower over the next 17 sessions, falling just 7% in price. Notice how that decline not only met the maximum 12% drop permitted in a good handle, but that the decline was far less than the 20% correction of the cup portion of the pattern.The typical cup base among top winners researched by IBD shows a decline of around 20% to 25% from the cup's left-side high, but can extend as far as 30% to 35%.Apple's RS Rating continues to improve, yet is not quite at a level usually shown by the best stock markets leaders. As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple's RS Rating is 66 — below the average of 87 among top stocks at the start of their breakouts — yet that 66 is good enough for Apple to rank No. 5 for RS within the Telecom-Consumer Products industry group.RELATED:Will Tesla Form A Bottoming Base?Why Apple's Breakout Is Holding UpWhy Tesla Shares Look Healthiest In WeeksTesla's Q3 Orders Beat The Street; Musk Seeks More Cash

160,PG,"Could Walt Disney (DIS) really acquire Twitter (TWTR)?Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Salesforce (CRM) have all been reported as possible buyers. Now Wall Street pros are weighing in — often on Twitter — on Monday's reports that Disney is interested in the social network.Monness, Crespi, Hardt analyst James Cakmak noted that Disney is the likeliest of the names being bounced around, according to MarketWatch, reportedly citing Disney's distribution needs. Cakmak told Bloomberg on Monday that the House of Mouse is ""investing in technology for distribution — and this would give them the platform to reach audiences around the world.""Investors and analysts alike have made no small fuss about Disney's ESPN subscriber losses amid the growth of Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Video and other streaming channels.

161,PG,"Dividend equities exert a magnetic attraction when the stock markets are rough, and they have grabbed ETF investors' hearts and wallets this year.In the world of exchange traded funds, two popular indexing subsets are dividend achievers and dividend aristocrats. Both invest in stock royalty -- household names like AT&T (T) and Procter & Gamble (PG) that have strong and consistent track records of dividend growth. So what's the difference between the indexes?Achievers have not missed a dividend increase in 10 years or more.Aristocrats have not skipped a dividend increase in 25 years or more.Click Here To See A List Of Top Performing ETFs In 2016In either case, it's no mean feat. Few companies on the stock market today can boast the same. Such a dividend history is often the mark of a quality company, with revenue, profits and cash flow to match.But whether an index holds dividend achievers or dividend aristocrats can have a big effect on a fund's profile.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more.They're both top-notch funds in their category, but VIG offers greater diversification, while NOBL may offer a shot at owning companies more likely to continue increasing dividends in the future.SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 13.9% year to date through Sept. 14.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. market, is up 5.6% in the same period.The former has also produced better annual average gains over the past three-, five- and 10-year periods.IBD'S TAKE: Income investors would do well to understand the nuances of dividend yield, dividend growth and dividend stability, as explored in this story about steady AT&T.This year's best-performing dividend ETF is ProShares S&P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats (REGL).REGL has gained 19.9% through Sept. 14. The fund launched in February 2015 and has grown to $169.5 million in assets. It's the first ETF to tap the dividend-growing companies in its parent midcap index.The underlying S&P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats Index holds a minimum of 40 equal-weighted stocks and rebalances quarterly. Each holding must have increased dividends each year for at least 15 straight years.Dividend growers have been able to withstand repeated market turmoil and still deliver strong returns with lower volatility, according to ProShares.REGL yields a mere 1.35% -- less than SPY's 12-month yield of 2.01%. Like many dividend growth funds, it's less of a play for dividend income and more of a play for quality companies whose stock prices are likely to appreciate over time, while giving investors a smoother ride than the broad market.VIG yields 2.08%, SDY 2.29% and NOBL 1.79%.6 Best ETF Picks for Q4: Seizing Global GrowthChoosing An ETF For Your Portfolio Made Easy

162,PG,"There's a way to eat spaghetti with less mess and it involves a spoon, or if you're from the old country, an artful twirl with the fork. Choosing the right ETF for your portfolio is a similarly underappreciated art.That's more true now than ever. Out of 1,923 exchange traded products listed on U.S. exchanges on the stock market today, roughly 160 have launched in 2016 so far.Some new funds are truly helpful, thoughtfully executed ideas — such as the international counterpart to Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG). Other newfangled products betray a wild-eyed grab for attention and profits, offering up yet another novel asset class that investors never asked for and probably will never need.The mushrooming number of products has consequences for the investing public, says Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar.""The asset-management industry has blasted its spaghetti cannon, with investors playing the role of the wall,"" he wrote over the summer. Extending the metaphor further, Johnson noted that ""many investors have displayed a nonstick coating,"" batting away the likes of Sprott Buzz Social Media Insights (BUZ) and Global X Millennials Thematic (MILN). But, he cautioned, ""that won't keep the industry from firing volley after volley, trying to get something to stick.""Investors in ETFs are looking for ways to sift through the bewildering array of choices. So IBD reached out to the big-money pros for whom investing in funds is the cornerstone of daily business. We asked them how they go about choosing an ETF for client portfolios, both what they look for and what they look to avoid.Click Here To See A List Of Top Performing ETFs In 2016 Their ideas may help you become successful investors too. How a fund performs is important, of course, but evaluating funds for performance can be nuanced in the ETF context, as a money manager we interviewed said.Astor's Bryan Novak recommends scrutinizing both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of an ETF to make sure it matches your investment objective. Bill Roach of Globalt outlines his routine for filtering the masses of ETF choices down to a more manageable list.Todd Rosenbluth, the funds guru at S&P Global, highlights an often-overlooked, but critical, aspect of ETF selection.Here's what they have to say:Bryan Novak is senior managing director at Astor Investment Management, a $1.8 billion registered investment advisor that provides investment solutions using proprietary macroeconomic analysis. Astor has been utilizing ETFs for almost two decades to manage client portfolios across multiple asset classes. The firm's investing philosophy centers on the belief that economic fundamentals matter and its objective is to protect client assets from wealth-destroying events by providing the right allocation strategy.The proliferation of exchange traded funds has made these investment vehicles the ultimate asset-allocation tool, for individual investors and institutions alike. ETFs offer the ability to achieve exposure with one click to a variety of asset classes and risk exposures — broad U.S. equity, specific industrial sectors, large and small caps, international, fixed income, and much more.
"
163,PG,"ETFs offer several advantages: They trade throughout the day like stocks and offer relative tax efficiency vs. the mutual fund. These advantages make the decision to use ETFs fairly easy. The question then becomes which ones to select for your portfolio. This part of the process takes some thought.Following the example of institutional investors, retail investors can become more educated and empowered when choosing ETFs to achieve a first-class portfolio to pursue their goals.Over time, we've watched the ETF space expand, making many more choices and varieties of these investment vehicles available. While having more choice is good, it also necessitates having a due diligence process to find the right ETFs to efficiently address portfolio objectives. For retail investors, doing a few key assessments can help turn their portfolios from average to top notch.The first consideration is asset allocation or exposure. This process determines where investors want or need exposure, based on their time horizon and risk tolerance. How much equity vs. fixed income? Are they selling some stock holdings for tax purposes, but want to maintain market exposure? Once those questions are answered, the next step is selecting the right ETFs to do the job.At Astor, we break this process up into two segments — qualitative and quantitative. In the qualitative part of the process, we examine the characteristics of the ETFs to make sure they match our investment objective. A few questions to ask are:These questions may require some digging, but are worth looking into.The next round of due diligence focuses on the quantitative, or number crunching. Many of the answers to these questions can be found in the ETF prospectus or on common investment-research sites such as Morningstar.By answering these questions, investors can make ""score cards"" as they analyze exchange traded funds. This will enable them to screen ETFs like the pros do and maximize the effectiveness of their portfolio.Bill Roach is president of Globalt Investments, a $1.8 billion registered investment advisor that integrates quantitative, fundamental and technical analysis to construct portfolios. The firm's flagship innovatETF strategies, which launched in early 2003, seek to reduce the impact of market volatility and minimize downside risk:At Globalt, we've been building portfolios of exchange traded funds since 2002, so we have seen the ETF space grow both in terms of assets and the number of funds. Contrary to some, we believe that ETFs are very much still in their early innings and that there is still more innovation to come as the industry matures and the marketplace better understands these products. That being said, not all innovations will be right for us or for our clients.Before we arrive at the portfolio construction phase, there are several steps we take as a team, all stemming from our conviction that asset allocation is the key to long-term performance and best addresses the fiduciary responsibility for managing client assets. Our disciplined investment process identifies outperforming asset classes and only then do we begin the process of investing in ETFs, rather than trying to select the best-performing active manager or funds.Looking at the ETF industry as a whole, it can at first seem like there is an overwhelming amount of choice. However, since we have a very clear understanding of what we're looking to accomplish with each exposure, we are able to dramatically shrink the universe of funds from the approximately 1,900 currently on the market to a much smaller number.We constantly monitor the asset allocation and ETF selection in each of our portfolios. Each ETF holding is an expression of our preference for the asset class, sub-asset class and our specific view regarding what is attractive in that space, driven by our quantitative model and our analysis of qualitative considerations. When our view changes and we wish to change how we express that view through ETF selection, we screen for the available options in that space.We focus on passive funds, meaning a fund must be a rules-based approach with no manager discretion, and eliminate those that do not meet our cost, size and liquidity requirements.For example, many funds being brought to market in recent months seek to ""slice and dice"" different sectors into highly niche sub-sector exposures, introducing concentrations that do not fit with our approach. Hundreds of other ETFs are thinly traded and may only have a few million dollars in assets, which allows us to remove them from consideration given the importance we place on liquidity and tight trading spreads.Once we've taken these initial steps, we then analyze the remaining funds in terms of their rules-based methodology, looking at factors like stock selection, portfolio construction and rebalancing process. From there, we look at the actual resulting portfolio holdings over time, focusing on things like individual position size, sector weights and other portfolio factor characteristics, as well as the performance of a specific fund vs. the benchmark against which we intend to use it.Performance is just one of the things we look at. We do not look at it in the same way that we would evaluate an active manager, where we would be looking for persistent alpha. We are looking to understand if, and under what circumstances, it outperforms or underperforms. For instance, if we take a position in an ETF to hedge exposure to equities, we would not want an ETF that does not behave consistently with its benchmark during equity bear markets. Additionally, an ETF with excessive tracking error would not be considered as it would not consistently provide the desired exposure.In particular, we seek to understand rolling returns, drawdowns and other historical data. As long-term investors, it is important for us to be able to understand how an ETF may respond to a variety of different market scenarios, an understanding that is difficult to achieve with many newer products. Once we've done all that, we select the fund that we believe will be the best fit for expressing our investment view.Todd Rosenbluth is director of ETF and mutual fund research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, a leading provider of financial and industry data, research, news and analytics to investment professionals, government agencies, corporations and universities worldwide. The New York City firm specializes in holdings-based ETF research. ""Past performance is not indicative of future results"" is a phrase long disclosed by asset managers to clients. Investors again have been reminded of this in 2016, with many utilities and consumer-staples ETFs ranking as top U.S. equity performers year to date through July, only to decline in value in August amid concerns that bond yields could move higher as the Federal Reserve contemplates raising rates. S&P Global thinks many investors tend to look for the largest, cheapest or best-performing ETFs without focusing on what holdings are inside. Investors need to understand the holdings inside their exchange traded fund as well as the cost structure, since these factors will be drivers of performance moving forward.As is done with a potential individual stock investment, valuation and risk assessments should be undertaken using an ETF's holdings to ensure that the securities inside are appealing in the current environment. While our research incorporates the full holdings, with many investors focusing on market-cap-weighted ETFs, a review of the top 10 positions can give great insight.For example, 60% of the assets for Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) are spread across its top 10 holdings. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence's qualitative research, five of these 10 are overvalued, including Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Company (SO), compared to just two that are undervalued; the other three are fairly valued. Meanwhile, six have below-average earnings and dividend records, which is a key risk consideration.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) is similarly concentrated in its top 10 holdings, but our research is more favorable on this ETF. Six of these stocks are undervalued to us, including Procter & Gamble (PG) and Wal-Mart (WMT), with just one of its major holdings considered overvalued. In addition, none of the top 10 constituents has a below-average earnings and dividend record.We think XLP is a better investment given prevailing market conditions.Investors also should consider the costs they will incur buying and selling these ETFs. Both XLU and XLP cost 14 basis points annually to hold (or $14 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested). While this is relatively cheap compared to active mutual fund alternatives, this is higher than comparable market-cap weighted ETFs from Vanguard and Fidelity.However, the bid-ask spread, which is the difference between the price to buy and to sell the ETF, for both XLU and XLP is just $0.01. This is much narrower than its peer offerings, offsetting the higher holding costs.While trading costs will matter less for longer-term investors, these sector equity ETFs incur significant volume and as such the costs will matter more to more tactical investors.As the ETF universe continues to expand with similar-sounding smart-beta products focused on single or multiple factors, such as low volatility and quality, investors should look inside the funds because the sector exposures will be different, impacting performance.RELATED:3 ETF Pros On Profiting With Funds And Managing RisksThe Best Places To Invest Among Tough Global MarketsUsing ETF Options To Harvest Income And Manage Risk

"
165,PG,"Procter & Gamble (PG), the world's largest consumer-products company, posted fourth-quarter profit that topped analysts' estimates, helped by rising sales in its health care division and continued cost cuts.Profit was 79 cents a share, excluding some items, in the period ended June 30, Cincinnati-based P&G said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts estimated 74 cents, on average. While revenue fell 2.7% to $16.1 billion, that topped analysts' $15.8 billion average projection.The results underscore that David Taylor, less than a year into his tenure as chief executive officer, is steering a smaller, lower-cost version of the consumer-products giant than existed just a few years ago. While the company has struggled to boost revenue consistently, Taylor's predecessor, A.G. Lafley, slimmed down P&G by cutting expenses and selling off underperforming divisions. Taylor has followed Lafley's productivity initiatives with his own $10 billion cost-cutting program, which he says will make P&G a nimbler competitor.The shares rose 0.8% to 87.10 in early trading in the stock market today. P&G had gained 8.8% this year through Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Procter & Gamble shares cleared a consolidation with a buy point of about 83.10 in late June. The stock had its best close in nearly 18 months on Monday. But earnings and sales are declining, and P&G is ranked 14th in its mediocre Cosmetics/Personal Care group. Focus on leading stocks in leading groups. IBD's biotech group is making a strong comeback, with several highly rated stocks at or near highs. Here are five biotechs to watch.Sales in the health care division, which sells Vicks NyQuil cold medicine and Oral B electric toothbrushes, rose about 6% to $1.8 billion last quarter. Net revenue also gained in the grooming unit, which makes Gillette razors and shaving gels, but declined in the company's other divisions.P&G forecast that revenue in the current fiscal year will rise about 1%. That would equate to sales of almost $66 billion, roughly matching analysts' average estimate. Core earnings per share -- which excludes restructuring charges and other items -- will increase by a mid-single-digit percentage rate from last year's $3.67 a share, P&G said. Analysts project profit by that measure will increase to $3.97, which would be a roughly 8% gain.Taylor, who joined P&G as a production manager in 1980, has said he'll be open to making outside hires at a company known for promoting its own. He'll also work to better align compensation with performance and seek to make P&G's often premium-priced products more distinctive.When he took over in November, Taylor inherited a company that had shed dozens of slower-selling product lines, along with its pet-food and battery businesses. The smaller portfolio will allow P&G to focus on its main brands and invest savings from the cost-cutting programs into research and development, as well as marketing, Taylor has said.While the increased investments may help, P&G needs to take other steps, in particular localizing more decision-making to get ""much closer to the customer,"" said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.""Innovation pipeline, price gaps being out of whack, all of those things can be improved by spending more money,"" Dibadj said. ""The big concern is: Can they fix the culture?""

166,PG,"Stocks were slightly lower near midday Friday, unfazed by July retail sales data that missed expectations and a big rally in bonds. Market leader Nvidia (NVDA) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, helped by strong earnings. Dow leaders included Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Procter & Gamble (PG).The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite eased 0.1% apiece. Volume on the Nasdaq was tracking close to Thursday's levels. NYSE volume was running at a sharply lower pace vs. the same time on Thursday.In economic news, July retail sales data released before the open weren't so hot. Overall, sales were flat when economists expected a 0.4% rise. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.3% vs. estimates for a 0.2% rise. Bonds rallied on the news, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 7 basis points to 1.49%.Department store operators, mining stocks and REITs outperformed. Steel producers and oil drillers lagged.Acacia Communications (ACIA), which was well-extended from a 45.85 buy point ahead of its earnings report, surged 33% to 89.86. Earnings and sales growth in Q2 accelerated nicely from Q1, rising 376% and 101%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Acacia, a new IPO that went public on May 13 at 23 a share, is the outright leader in IBD's fiber optics group, but the group is home to another strong performer. See who it is with IBD Stock Checkup. Also, IBD covered the stock early in its run in an Industry Themes story published in mid-June.Another top-performing new issue, Planet Fitness (PLNT), surged 13% to 22.93 despite an earnings miss. Wall Street seemed to focus on better-than-expected sales, which rose 16% to $91.5 million. Planet Fitness is now extended after a recent breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 19.72 buy point.Leaderboard name Alibaba (BABA) followed through after Thursday's breakout on positive analyst chatter. Shares rose 3% to 94.92. Alibaba was added to Leaderboard Thursday when a weekly call option was exercised at an 87.50 strike price.Twilio (TWLO) also followed through after reclaiming a 44.90 buy point Thursday. The enterprise software name reported Q2 results earlier in the week. It's not profitable yet, as Twilio reported a net loss of 7 cents a share, yet it was a smaller loss than expected. Revenue was impressive again, rising 70% to $64.5 million following a 78% lift in the first quarter.
"
167,PG,"Kimberly-Clark (KMB) topped second-quarter forecasts, but shares fell as the consumer products giant cut its organic sales outlook even as it sees foreign exchange headwinds easing over the full year.Earnings per share rose 8.5% to $1.53, above estimates for $1.48. Sales fell 1% to $4.588 billion, edging past expectations for $4.564 billion.An unfavorable foreign exchange environment, with the dollar strong against other currencies, weighed on revenue for the company, best known for such brands as Kleenex and Huggies diapers.Organic sales, which factor out currency fluctuations, rose 3%.Shares fell 1.5% by the closing bell to 132.59 on the stock market today, trying to find support at their 50-day line. The stock tried to break out from a cup base early this month, but shares have since struggled.Kimberly Clark expects forex to weigh on full-year net sales and operating profits by 4%-5%, down from an earlier forecast for ""the low end of the 5 to 6 percent range"".However, Kimberly-Clark expects organic sales growth to be at the low end of its forecast for 3%-5%, reflecting ""lower expected benefits from selling price increases, primarily due to the improved currency outlook.""Procter & Gamble (PG), which edged up to 85.80, holds its fourth-quarter earnings call on Aug. 2. Unilever (UN), which reported first-half results last week, shaved off 4 cents to 45.88.
"
168,PG,"The consumer stock sell-off intensified and broadened Tuesday, as bad news from General Motors (GM) added to concerns from McDonald's (MCD), Ford Motor (F) and others.The consumer slide fueled a general market retreat. But it's also a warning for the broader U.S. economy.Recent economic data on consumers have been positive. Consumer spending rose at a robust 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, with a Tuesday report showing a 0.4% monthly gain in June. But consumers were a rare bright spot, with business investment falling for a third straight quarter and homebuilding spending also falling. If consumer spending falters, the economy may struggle to match its anemic second-quarter growth of 1.2%.General Motors and Ford reported July U.S. sales that fell vs. a year earlier. Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCAU) eked out a gain, but less than expected. Ford had reported weak earnings last week amid rising incentives spending and stalling U.S. demand. It sees U.S. industry sales falling in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains.General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler shares fell 4.4%, 4.3% and 4%, respectively, on the stock market today.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which has been a top-rated restaurant stock, fell 12.4% Tuesday. The steakhouse chain missed on second-quarter revenue and said same-store sales growth was slowing in the early weeks of the current third quarter. Dave & Buster's (PLAY) dived 5.6%, taking a round trip on its breakout.Those follow weaker demand at McDonald's, which had been a great turnaround story in recent months. But last week McDonald's said U.S. comps in the second quarter fell short of Wall Street forecasts, and cited ""softening industry growth."" Starbucks (SBUX) also reported weak U.S. comps.More generally, analysts have been issuing warnings about the retail sector.McDonald's fell 0.3% Tuesday and Starbucks 1.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Texas Roadhouse and Dave & Buster's have been among the best-rated restaurant stocks in recent weeks. For a complete look at these stocks and other consumer giants, take a look at IBD Stock Checkup.Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) cut its 2016 outlook Tuesday, citing higher fuel costs and the weak British pound following the Brexit vote. Royal Caribbean stock sank 6.3% Tuesday. Carnival (CCL) lost 3.1%.Airlines sold off Tuesday as Delta Air Lines (DAL) said unit revenue fell sharply in July. Also hitting the sector: A Zika virus warning for a Miami neighborhood and  German carrier Lufthansa saying that terror attacks and global unease have had a ""tangible"" impact on demand. Delta Air stock fell more than 7% intraday, while American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell 6%.Department stores were among the biggest losers, with Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) down 8% and Nordstrom (JWN) tumbling 7%.Kroger got a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform, citing the deflationary environment for groceries. Shares are off 4.1%, on track for their lowest close since early January 2015. That follows weak same-store sales from natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM).One relative bright spot for consumer stocks has been consumer products producers such as Procter & Gamble (PG). P&G edged past profit views Tuesday, rising 0.4% to 86.78 for a 52-week high. But Procter & Gamble and other consumer- and food-product giants have been relying on cost cuts to offset declining revenue.
"
169,PG,"Investors tend to seek out stability in an uncertain market. And a great deal of global uncertainty has resulted from last week's surprise Brexit vote. So it's a good time to revisit a Steady Eddie income stock such as Procter & Gamble (PG), which may not necessarily appreciate quickly in price but offers a reliable dividend. The Cincinnati-based consumer products…
"
170,PG,"Stocks showed mild action Friday, but the Dow snapped a four-week winning run. In general, the market maintained a positive bent amid a week jam-packed with earnings reports and a data showing weaker-than-expected growth in the U.S. economy.But the Q2 advance GDP report didn't seem that horrible beyond the headline number. While the overall 1.2% gain far missed the Econoday consensus forecast for an increase of 2.6%, the government also revised the figure for Q1 of 2015 sharply higher from 0.6% growth to 2.0%.Plus, in the latest reading, consumer spending jumped 4.2%, strongly reflecting the positive impact of relatively high employment and lower gas prices in the world No. 1 economy.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped less than 0.1%, lagging gains of nearly 0.3% for both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500. The latter hit a new all-time high, rising as high as 2,177.09 during the stock market today.The Dow's 0.1% loss for the week pales in comparison with gains of 3.2%, 1.1%, 2% and 0.3% in the prior four weeks, respectively. The Nasdaq rallied 1.2% for the week -- a fifth straight weekly advance. The S&P 500 edged lower by fewer than 2 points, or less than 0.1%.Which stocks are performing best in the Dow?One way to view this is by comparing the Relative Strength Rating, which measures a stock's performance over the past 12 months vs. the rest of the stock market. Action over the past three months carries a higher weighting. On that score, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) lead the Dow's 30 components with RS ratings of 83 and 81, respectively.J&J rose 0.6% to 125.23, padding its impressive gains since clearing a long saucer with handle near 105. Even with that large advance, J&J's annualized dividend yield of 2.6% still exceeds the S&P 500's 2% payout.J&J continues to rise after recently posting a third quarter in a row of modest earnings growth. Q3 earnings are seen rising 11% to $1.66 a share, which would be an acceleration from the 2% increase which the medical and personal care products titan saw in the second quarter.For the year, J&J's earnings per share are seen rising 8% on a 3% pick-up in revenue to $72.07 billion.UnitedHealth has had a masterful performance since it broke out of a shallow double-bottom base at 121.19 in late February. The managed care behemoth rose 0.3% to 143.20, up 18% from that proper pivot point.Ranking third in RS Rating among the Dow components is DuPont (DD). The chemicals giant is cozying up to the 70 price level, where it's had trouble piercing higher. Earlier this week, DuPont marked a 14% jump in Q2 earnings, the best result in 10 quarters. Sales slid 8%, however.Investors who seek companies with faster growth need to look at IBD's various high-growth screens, including today's IPO Leaders column. This screen looks for outstanding performers in each aspect of IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm. The latest story highlights China's Yirendai (YRD) (EPS seen rising 65% in 2016), Veeva Systems (VEEV) (EPS seen up 12% in 2016 after a 38% gain in 2015) and IBD 50 stock LGI Homes (LGIH) (EPS seen rising 36% in 2016).IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Stock Spotlight and Sector Leaders columns, located inside IBD Stock Lists at Investors.com, all hunt for companies with above-average fundamentals. Keep an eye out for those companies that offer something new in the form of fantastic new products, a new industry, new market conditions, new management and a stock hitting new highs in price. This is the N in CAN SLIM.Next week, keep an eye out for quarterly results from Big Data software expert Tableau (DATA), CVS Health (CVS) and Procter & Gamble (PG) on Tuesday; Tesla Motors (TSLA), Electronic Arts (EA) and First Solar (FSLR) on Wednesday; and IBD Leaderboard member Monster Beverage (MNST) and Priceline Group (PCLN) on Thursday.
"
171,PG,"Amazon.com (AMZN) on Tuesday said it added more than 50 more brands to its lineup of wireless Dash Buttons, and it said the frequency of Dash orders rose 70% in the past three months.Amazon said Prime members are increasingly using Dash Button to order everyday essentials and that order frequency doubled in the past three months among Prime member who use the service.Research firm Slice Intelligence, however, recently released a study showing that fewer than half the people who have ordered Dash Buttons have actually made an order via the device.Amazon launched the Wi-Fi connected, thumbnail-sized Dash Button in 2015, with 29 brands. There is a separate button for each product. Amazon says it now has more than 150 buttons, across dozens of retail categories from household goods and toys to guitar strings. Brands include Proctor & Gamble (PG), Kimberly-Clark (KMB) and Clorox (CLX). Products include Maxwell House coffee, Tide detergent, Gatorade and Gerber baby food.Dash Buttons are available to Prime members for $4.99, but they're essentially free, since users get a $4.99 credit on their first order. The press of a Dash Button leads to an automatic reorder at Amazon, with free shipping for Prime customers.Amazon stock closed up 2.4% at 707.95 in the stock market today. Amazon appears to have found support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out April 29 on a favorable Q1 earnings report. But there are also signs of heavy institutional selling, as revealed in several recent days when the stock was down and volume spiked for the IBD Leaderboard company.
"
172,PG,"Amazon (AMZN) has gotten a lot of publicity for its Amazon Dash Buttons, small Wi-Fi-connected devices (that is, actual buttons) that let Prime members order staples like Tide detergent, Charmin toilet paper and Doritos chips with the push of that product's button. But it doesn't appear that customers are using the thumb-drive-sized buttons very much.A study by Slice Intelligence has found that fewer than half of people who have a Dash Button have actually made an order using it.The top-selling button is for Tide laundry detergent. The Procter & Gamble (PG) product has accounted for 21% of button orders, followed by Bounty paper towels (18%), also from P&G. Cottonelle toilet paper from Kimberly-Clark (KMB) came in third with 17%, followed by Glad plastic bags (12%) from Glad Products, which is majority owned by Clorox (CLX).The top Dash Button for consumer spending is Gatorade, owned by PepsiCo (PEP). The average shopper has spent $120 on Gatorade since they purchased a Gatorade Dash Button.Other top Dash Buttons for average consumer purchases include Smartwater ($82.52), Bounty ($74.37), Cottonelle ($61.95), Tide ($58.13) and Charmin ($52.11)Slice Intelligence, an e-commerce analytics firm, based its study on data generated from its panel of over 4 million online consumers between March 31, 2015, and June 18, 2016.E-commerce leader Amazon now sells over 100 Dash Buttons for everyday household items, from coffee and snacks to condoms and feminine care products.Dash Buttons are available to Prime members for $4.99 each, and they're essentially free because members get a $4.99 credit to their Amazon account with their first order using the button.When customers are running low on an item, they can simply press a Dash Button to automatically reorder the item and have it delivered with free Prime shipping.Amazon stock fell 1.1%, to 691.36, in the stock market today, on another Brexit beatdown day for stocks. Amazon stock is testing its 50-day line for the first time in three months.
"
173,PG,"Some pockets of the stock market invariably do well when investor optimism is wobbling. Several consumer staples ETFs are making new highs or trading near highs as heightened uncertainty raises the sector's appeal.It's easy to see why it does. Consumers are going to need their soft drinks, bleach, cereal and flour no matter how the economy goes.The consumer staples sector generally outperforms during recessionary periods and, to a lesser extent, late in a market cycle, writes Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough. It tends to underperform in the early innings.""As such, investors interested in this fund should hold a strong belief that the economy is at least headed toward a recessionary environment,"" Goldsborough noted. Unless, of course, it's part of a diversified portfolio where its role is to help limit portfolio volatility.Investors have hardly been dashing for the stock market exits in recent sessions, but Europe is a niggling worry. The fear is that the U.K's vote to leave the European Union could stoke a regional recession and even perhaps a broader economic slowdown.Against that backdrop, Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples (RHS) climbed on the stock market today to its best level in more than two years. This exchange traded fund holds 36 large-cap stocks in the consumer staples sector.As its name implies, the ETF veers away from the traditional weighting of stocks by market capitalization (or, the total value of all a company's shares of stock). Instead, each stock gets an identical weight in the portfolio.Procter & Gamble (PG) accounts for roughly 3% of portfolio assets. So does Whole Foods Market (WFM).By contrast, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP), a cap-weighted rival holding the same stocks, gives a 12% weight to Procter & Gamble, its largest stock holding. It has 0.6% weight in Whole Foods Market, its smallest holding.The top 10 holdings in XLP account for 62% of its portfolio assets vs. 29% in RHS.The equal-weighting method followed by the latter prevents a small handful of stocks from having an unduly large impact on performance.That may sometimes work in an investor's favor. But an investor can be sure they'll always get less of a bias toward large companies and a shot at outperforming traditional, cap-weighted rivals with lower volatility.RHS has delivered on that promise both year to date and over the longer run. It's up 11.7% in 2016 through July 1 -- far outpacing the S&P 500 -- and produced an average annual 17.5% gain over the past five years.By comparison, larger peers XLP and Vanguard Consumer Staples (VDC) gained roughly 10% and an average annual 14.8% over those same periods.VDC holds 101 cap-weighted stocks, including Coca-Cola (KO), tobacco giant Philip Morris (PM) and Monster Beverage (MNST), a top-rated IBD Leaderboard stock.Both XLP and VDC also made new multiyear highs on the stock market today.A potentially stronger dollar post-Brexit could act as a headwind for multinational firms such as Procter & Gamble, whose earnings rely on overseas sales. At the same time, investors are discounting the odds of a near-term rate hike. That should boost this dividend-paying sector.""Consumer staples stocks tend to be sensitive to interest-rate hikes because most experience less earnings growth during economic expansions to offset the negative impact of rising interest rates,"" Goldsborough writes.Guggenheim recently launched the 15th in its equal-weighted ETF suite. Guggenheim S&P 100 Equal Weight (OEW) invests in 100 of the largest and most stable companies in the S&P 500, giving each stock an equal portfolio weight. The cap-weighted S&P 100 Index (OEX) is widely used for derivatives and underlies OEX options.The oldest ETF in this innovative suite, S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP), has, since its 2003 inception, outperformed the cap-weighted S&P 500 in 100% of 10-year monthly rolling periods, 86% of five-year monthly rolling periods, and 81% of three-year monthly rolling periods, according to Guggenheim.Guggenheim's equal-weighted strategies are helped by a disciplined quarterly rebalancing to target weights, which helps them buy stocks low and sell high.

174,PG,"Yahoo (YHOO) revenue and profit are expected to plunge when it reports Q2 results on Monday, but one analyst doesn't rule out the possibility of the web portal walking away from takeover offers just the same.Final bids for Yahoo's core internet and advertising businesses are also due Monday, with Verizon Communications (VZ) in the hunt, along with a group led by Quicken Loans co-founder Dan Gilbert. Verizon would merge Yahoo with AOL, which it acquired in 2015. Gilbert's group has the backing of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).The sales process has dragged on since March. Most reports have cited bids in a range of $4 billion to $6 billion for Yahoo's core internet assets, real estate and patents. AT&T (T) and private equity firm PG Capital also might be in the mix.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that Yahoo's Q2 revenue will fall 13% to $1.08 billion while EPS plummets 40% to 10 cents. While Yahoo seems in dire straits, its Asian investments may provide some leeway, says Robert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.""At some price level, the board may feel it is better to simply spin off the core to shareholders in a taxable transaction,"" Peck said in a July 11 note. ""Recall, in December 2015, Yahoo had stated that it will pursue the spin process in parallel to the sale process.""Yahoo has a market cap near $35 billion, but the vast bulk of its value stems from its big stakes in Alibaba Group (BABA) and Yahoo Japan. Japan's Softbank, which controls Sprint (S), is the biggest shareholder in Yahoo Japan.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook (FB) and Alphabet-owned Google (GOOGL) have stakes in the Yahoo auction outcome, because Verizon could emerge as a serious rival in digital advertising if it merges AOL and Yahoo. Check out Facebook on IBD's Leaderboard.Yahoo shook up its board in April, agreeing to add four new members at the behest of activist investor Starboard Value. Yahoo's three-member Strategic Review Committee, which has been exploring Yahoo's sale, is chaired by Thomas McInerney, former CFO of Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC). It also includes Eric Brandt, a former Broadcom (AVGO) executive. Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith was added to the strategic review committee in April.""Whether the 'core' sells for $5 billion or $7 billion in aggregate, is not that material, when compared to the value that can be unlocked from the Asian investments,"" added Peck in the report. ""However, there are significant tax and legal complexities involved in unwinding these investments, and the multistep process could take 18 months or more.""
"
175,PG,"Jerry Dodson's Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) proves that you can have your socially responsible cake and eat it too.The $1.5 billion mutual fund favors companies that provide employees with ""outstanding workplaces."" So do the five other funds at Parnassus Investments, which Dodson founded in 1984. That includes things like offering workers profit-sharing, time off for working parents, paid time off for volunteer work, fair treatment and clear communication.The investment team at Parnassus, which has $16.5 billion under management, also screen out companies engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing or refining of fossil fuels.None of those criteria have prevented Endeavor from outperforming its peers or the broad market in the past 10 years.It is the top-performing environmental, social and corporate-governance (ESG) fund over the 10 years ended June 30, with an 11.57% average annual return in that decade, says Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 averaged a 7.42% yearly gain in that span.The fund also ranks in the top 1% of all large-cap growth mutual funds in that period and the top 2% over the past five years.And it is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, glowing in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Through Q2, it was ahead of roughly 42% of all U.S. diversified stock funds so far this year.Dodson's affinity for ESG investing has deep roots. He founded Parnassus Investments at the age of 41 with those goals in mind. Earlier work was a harbinger of what was to come: A political science major as UC Berkeley, he got his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1971, then went on to work for a nonprofit outfit that helped minority-owned businesses. He helped organize Continental Savings of America, becoming the president and CEO of the S&L, which developed an innovative product for depositors to invest in solar energy projects.Dodson is lead manager on Parnassus Fund (PARNX) and Parnassus Asia Fund (PAFSX) and sole manager of Endeavor. From his office in San Francisco, 73-year-old Dodson talked with Investor's Business Daily about the ins and outs of his investment approach and how he began to use social screens.IBD: You're juggling two tough tasks: You not only use ESG criteria, you also run a concentrated portfolio. Which is tougher?Dodson: You know, the hard part was getting the philosophy and tweaking it with simulations, which was done over many years. Once we understood the strategy would work, the size of the portfolio just followed.You'll be surprised that we took advice from a journalist (about the size and strategy). I was social friends with Milton Moskowitz, who was writing a news story that started as a book. It was about the 100 best places to work.I looked at the returns of the 50% to 60% that were publicly traded ... and thought I should start a fund based on that. Milton thought I should stick with 100 companies. I disagreed. He said I'd screw it up.Anyway, it took years (of looking for fundamental metrics that correlated to good stock performance). It took about two years of back-testing on paper, then five more years of running the portfolio (before opening it to the public).IBD: Aside from ESG criteria, it looks to me as if you seek large-cap companies with wide moats or strong competitive advantages, and quality management teams that act in the best interests of shareholders. Have I got it right?Dodson: That's it, succinctly.IBD: Information technology is your largest sector, with a 50% weighting as of March 31. Is that a typical exposure to tech?Dodson: It's usually been our largest sector, but not 50%. Normally it's around 30%. The reason is that we know the sector well. Silicon Valley is down the road from us and more and more right here in the city.Also, in terms of workplace, technology companies seem a step ahead in providing a good environment. Google -- Alphabet (GOOGL) now -- has generous maternity leave, a gym where you can work out, days off for doing charitable events.Compared to, say, the steel industry, workplace issues score stronger at tech companies.IBD: Speaking of Alphabet, it's been trending sideways since late April. Do you still like the stock?Dodson: We started buying at 525 in December 2014. Now it's up to (the low 700s). We think it will make more gains. But you're right, it's been pretty flat. We regard it as a long-term holding. It's got a great moat and a good social story.IBD: Why do you think it has more room to run?Dodson: Primarily because of its moat, and it's looking to develop new products. It has a huge cash stake, a talented workforce. Its search engine gives them (revenue and earnings) stability. I don't know what new ideas they're working on, but I know they're looking for new products and they'll find something.IBD: In general, you emphasize some ESG criteria more than others, right?Dodson: We are more focused on the workplace, how a company treats employees. Then the environment. Workplace is a component of ""social.""IBD: How is workplace part of ""social""?Dodson: The word ""social"" covers a lot. For us, it means how a company treats its employees. It can mean safety record, privacy policy, relationship to the community where the company operates, diversity programs and good, clear, honest communication.IBD: Do you ever invest in a stock because its E, S or G features are very attractive, even though its financial performance is not so bright?Dodson: In the past we've done that. I did it before Endeavor Fund, with Parnassus Fund (PARNX). The stock was Control Data (a supercomputer company). They would hire former prisoners, do great social things. But the business strategy was just OK. We invested, and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever had. It cured me of picking for environmental or social reasons alone.IBD: Let's talk about individual holdings as of your latest disclosure. Citrix Systems' (CTXS) earnings per share rose 51% and 82% the past two quarters. A lot of people think the enterprise software developer, specializing in desktop virtualization, lost its focus. It's in a reorganization that has involved layoffs of staff and contractors. How does this situation look to you?Dodson: The reason we invested was because of their GoToMeeting app (which is being spun off). GoToMeeting is similar to Citrix's XenApp. You can be thousands of miles away from your server, doing applications, and you can use it on your smartphone or laptop, and it delivers it safely on your mobile device. That's what makes them successful. People want applications, this company delivers them where you want.IBD: Your stake in Applied Materials' (AMAT) is up. Are you satisfied with their progress?Dodson: It was in the doldrums when we initiated a position in May 2009 at 11.22. Equipment used to make semiconductors tends to be volatile. Sales and earnings are very cyclical. We tried to buy at a time when the stock had fallen off, then ride it up. Now it's (rising). We believe Applied will benefit from significant order growth with its leading etch and deposition tools.IBD: Ciena's (CIEN) earnings per share have slowed from 625% growth three quarters ago to 50% growth and a 3% decline the past two frames. Everything OK there?Dodson: We've owned it quite a while. It's more volatile than we expected. It makes communication glass wires, equipment that moves impulses, whether they are voice or data, along transmission lines. Earnings have been lumpy because any time you have an equipment maker, it has ups and downs. We've held it through cycles. It's more volatile than we expected. But we like the company, and we think it has more upside.IBD: Why do you own C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW)? It's not a tech story. And revenue has declined three quarters in a row.Dodson: It's a freight forwarder, focusing on trucking. You're right. It hasn't done well. That's primarily because shipping has not picked up as much as anticipated. The economy is growing (at an annualized rate of) 2% or less. To get trucking and freight forwarding growing, the economy has to grow more. So it's a play that the economic recovery will accelerate. But our average cost is 55. The stock is in the mid-70s, so we've done well.IBD: Charles Schwab's (SCHW) EPS grow has accelerated for two quarters, but share price has been weak. What's your play here?Dodson: We're tied in to them. We pay Schwab if customers come in through them.But the key? A lot of brokerage firms, including Schwab, collect interest on margin loans. With interest rates so low, they don't make much. But if interest rates increase, then there's a huge earnings increase for Schwab. It's in the mid-20s now. It would go to the 40s.If our economy gets better, rates will go up and Schwab will take off.IBD: Intel's (INTC) EPS growth is speeding up. Where's the growth for their computer chips coming from?Dodson: They make chips for personal computers, smartphones and other applications. They also make chips for servers. Those sales are going up.They've been trying for years to get into the mobile (devices) market. They finally have semiconductors going into the iPhone. They're trying to get more into communications and other growth areas. With this Apple (AAPL) chip and other missions, that's what we're banking on to move Intel higher.IBD: Procter & Gamble (PG) is the classic defensive stock. But revenue per share has declined for eight quarters. Is this what you want?Dodson: You're right about revenue declining. They've got these amazing brands: Crest, Tide, Gillette, Head & Shoulders. But they need a new growth engine. We're looking at it. Does it have growth ahead? We haven't reached a conclusion.IBD: IBM (IBM) EPS is down four straight quarters. Sales are down 16 frames in a row. Why invest in it?
"
176,PG,"Dodson: My only defense is that Warren Buffett owns a lot more than I do. I first bought it at the end of 2013. I expected it to turn around as they cut emphasis on hardware. At some point, growth in (consulting and) software will offset declines in hardware. But it hasn't happened yet. At 10.7 times (forward) earnings, we believe share price is on the bargain table.IBD: Is Buffett selling?Dodson: No. We look when there's a filing, but we've seen no sign of (Buffett selling). I'm sure he's having the same regrets I have.IBD: W.W. Grainger's (GWW) EPS and sales finally notched gains after declining for two quarters. But shares are not making headway.Dodson: Grainger makes everything under the sun (for maintenance). This in some sense is a play on the overall economy. If the U.S. economy can grow fast enough, Grainger will do well because its products touch almost every sector of the economy.IBD: Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EPS and revenue growth have slowed in recent quarters. Do you still like this stock?Dodson: I was expecting sales to increase quite a bit for their hepatitis C product. But they had to cut prices because of competition. Both AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) make therapies for hep C. Gilead is a great lab. They will develop new therapies. In time, the company should do well.IBD: This fund began with a different name. Why the name change, Jerry?Dodson: The way we pick stocks hasn't changed. We started out as the Workplace Fund. We had good performance early on, but the name Workplace Fund was not getting the attention we thought it should.People on our staff said we got strange reactions from brokers and advisors, who weren't sure what the name meant. ""Why not pick a more general name?"" they said. They said that would get more shareholder money, more acceptance.IBD: And why is the fund concentrated?Dodson: Primarily because I can't find enough companies that are undervalued that meet the workplace and social criteria.IBD: The fund has 25 names. How typical is that?Dodson: We would like to have 35 to 40 names. We're looking for more. The last couple years we went down to 25 or so.IBD: The fund had an 11% cash weighting as of May 31. Was that because it's hard to find your kind of stocks?Dodson: That's correct. I try to stay as fully invested as possible.IBD: Jerry, make my day: Before running this fund, did you run a totally non-PC fund -- you know, one that only invests in ammo, tobacco, oil?Dodson: Before Endeavor, I managed each of six (including one that no longer exists) other Parnassus funds prior to finding a manager for each of them. I founded Parnassus Investments in 1984. Prior to that, I worked for six years as president of a small bank in San Francisco. Before that, I spent four years as a foreign service officer with the Department of State, serving in Panama and Vietnam.IBD: What was your investment style before you embraced ESG?Dodson: We've embraced ESG since the firm was founded. It was one of our founding principles.IBD: What got you into ESG?Dodson: My personal philosophy had always revolved around ESG, but I wasn't sure it could be used as a business philosophy. At Continental, I started a program to allow savers to put their money into special savings accounts that would be lent out for solar energy installations. Much to my pleasant surprise, the program was very popular.It convinced me that there was a market out there for investors who wanted to make a positive impact with their money. This led to the founding of Working Assets Money Fund (1983-1984), which took ESG factors into account in investing in money market securities.This, in turn, led to the formation of Parnassus Investments.I took the ESG from my experience, then added the value-oriented philosophy of Benjamin Graham, whose writings I admired. These two strains formed the basis of the Parnassus investment philosophy.IBD: How did you come up with the Parnassus name?Dodson: I lived on a street near Parnassus Avenue in San Francisco. I looked up the mythology around Mount Parnassus in Greece and discovered it was the site of the Oracle of Delphi. I liked the image of the oracle often going against the prevailing wisdom. It fit my contrarian, value-oriented investment philosophy.IBD: Since you're 73, do you have plans to retire?Dodson: I plan to retire as chief executive officer in 2018 at 75. However, I plan to stay on indefinitely as manager of Endeavor until I find someone well-qualified to take over.

177,PG,"Shares of U.S. utility stocks such as Consolidated Edison (ED), Dominion (D), Duke Energy (DUK) and others are climbing as investors seek safe havens in the wake of Britain's decision last week to pull out of the European Union.Utilities were already strong as their steady dividend payments were attractive, with interest rates remaining low. The Dow Jones Utility Average had climbed 18% from the start of the year to Thursday's close, just before the results of the Brexit referendum started to come in.And while they are heavily regulated, they are also classic defensive stocks with steady, domestic demand that changes little during economic swings.Dow utilities surged 1.6% to a new intraday high Monday.Consolidated Edison, a New York-based utility with $12.1 billion in annual sales, provides electricity and natural gas to 3.4 million customers in three states. It has an 83 IBD Composite Rating, meaning its stock has outperformed 83% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Shares rose 1.7% in the stock market today, entering profit-taking territory after breaking out of a base in January.Dominion, based in Richmond, Va., provides utility services to 5 million customers in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest.It's been forming a flat base with a 75.60 buy point for about two months. Its stock has closed higher in 10 of the last 12 trading sessions and rose 1.05% to 74.95 on Monday.Duke Energy, the largest company in IBD's Utility-Diversified group by sales, rose above an elongated 10.5-month cup-with-handle base with an 81.49 buy point on June 10, closing at 81.59. It's continued to rise Monday with a 1.9% gain.Among others in the group, PG&E (PCG), which has about $17 billion annual revenue and boasts an 82 IBD Composite Rating, edged up 0.8%. Dover, Del.-based Chesapeake Utilities (CPK), which has been consolidating for a little more than three months, climbed 2.6% after jumping 8.2% Friday.

178,PG,"The political drama of recent days has left investors feeling shaken, stirred and altogether out of sorts. That's giving another leg up to the asset classes investors favor in turbulent times: gold and long Treasury bonds.Low-volatility stocks, another safety play, have fallen along with the broad market as the Brexit vote's impact continues to be felt. But they're holding up better than the benchmark S&P 500.IShares Edge MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USMV) fell 1.8% on the stock market Friday – or about half the 3.6% decline for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). That price move for USMV came in heavy trade – nearly three times the average daily dollar volume.On Monday, USMV fell 0.5% vs. a 1.7% loss for SPY. Year to date through June 24, USMV is up 7.5% vs. a 0.7% gain for SPY.Friday was a ""perfect example"" of how low volatility exchange traded funds can lower overall risk in a portfolio, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence.""They did exactly what they are supposed to do,"" he added.USMV tracks an index of U.S.-listed companies selected and weighted to create a low volatility portfolio. It holds 177 stocks including AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ) and Procter & Gamble (PG). The strategy studies how holdings interact with one another and limits sector bets – a point of difference from peer PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), which simply invests in the 100 least volatile stocks in the parent index.This choppy year, the USMV strategy has resonated with investors. It has seen $5.91 billion in net inflow year to date, topping every other equity exchange traded fund.Some investing experts point out that low volatility ETFs are starting to look pricey and that late-comers to the party are performance chasing.Rosenbluth thinks investors should be buying them not for their strong record, but for the low risk profile of the securities inside them. That's certainly worth paying up for, he added.With Brexit – Britons' exit from the European Union – adding to the mood of uncertainty, Rosenbluth expects volatility will increase in both the U.S. and international equity markets.Low volatility ETFs give them a way a way to stay in the equity markets with less whipsawing, he added.

179,PG,"I can't remember where I was when Neil Armstrong took his giant leap on the Moon, or when Princess Diana died. But I remember where I was the first time I ever used Google.I was an editorial writer at USA Today, and was telling a friend about how maddening it was to try to find anything on the Internet. For those too young to remember anything PG, online search engines at the time returned pages of worthless results, surrounded by a thousand ads.My friend said, ""Have you tried Google?"" I hadn't, but when I did I was blown away. The home page was Spartan. There were no display ads. And the results were incredibly, almost unbelievably relevant. I've never used another search engine since.Then, yesterday, I discovered that Google (GOOGL) had removed one of the most useful, if little known, features of its search engine -- the ""Custom range"" option -- on mobile devices.For those who don't know, this handy tool lets you limit search results to specific times. To find it, you needed to click on the ""Search tools,"" and then the ""Any time"" tab, which opens a lot of options. If you clicked ""Custom range,"" you could limit the search to specific dates.Say you wanted to find articles about Donald Trump's bankruptcy filings. A generic search for ""Donald Trump bankruptcy"" turns up lots of recent articles about it. But not anything contemporaneous.Limit the results to articles published before 2001, however, and get boat loads written at the time, which provide more details and insights than anything written today.It was, in short, a really handy tool for anyone trying to use Google to do research on increasingly popular mobile devices.On a product forum page where it made this announcement, Google says: ""After much thought and consideration, Google has decided to retire the Search Custom Date Range Tool on mobile. Today we are starting to gradually unlaunch this feature for all users, as we believe we can create a better experience by focusing on more highly-utilized search features that work seamlessly across both mobile and desktop. Please note that this will still be available on desktop, and all other date restriction tools (e.g., ""Past hour,"" ""Past 24 hours,"" ""Past week,"" ""Past month,"" ""Past year"") will remain on mobile.""This makes no sense.As one commenter on the Google announcement page put it: ""TERRIBLE IDEA. In a world where user activity is moving toward mobile, Google should be working to increase the flexibility and utility of its mobile offerings, not to constrain them and push people back toward the desktop.""Another responded: ""I sincerely doubt there was as much thought and consideration as the post claims, because it is blatantly obvious how bad an idea it is. There are zero reasons to remove this functionality -- and tellingly, none are given in the post.""This is a company, mind you, that has blown multiple kings' ransoms on a wide variety of dubious projects -- Google Glass, anyone? -- without batting an eye. Now it claims that the minuscule amount required to provide this feature would starve it of funds needed to ""create a better experience"" for the rest of its users?Give me a break. So, for the first time in 16 years, I am in the market for another search engine. One that cares about providing the best results, no matter what device I'm using, or how obscure or date-specific the request.

184,PG,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) may well become more attractive to the millennial crowd going for a healthy lifestyle with the addition of the eco-friendly and safe Honest Beauty makeup and skin-care line in select stores starting this month.That's one of the points that Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen made in a report this week on Ulta, a one-stop shop for beauty and salon products at a variety of prices.The report follows Ulta's announcement that Honest Beauty's makeup and skin-care collection will be available in 250 Ulta Beauty stores as well as on its Ulta.com website starting this month. The 250 stores comprise around 29% of Ulta's store base, Chen noted.The company describes the Honest Beauty line, created by healthy lifestyle brand The Honest Company, as a collection of ""safe, high-performance"" products that feature naturally derived botanical ingredients such as chamomile, calendula, aloe vera and barbary fig.""We like Ulta's announcement to carry Honest Beauty in select stores and online,"" Chen noted in his report. ""Honest is a growing brand (with) a unique, healthy lifestyle proposition. We believe Honest is a well-known brand with broad appeal to millennials, given the strong brand proposition (and) emphasis on transparency, responsibility and effectiveness. This likely will resonate with both the millennial and post-millennial's personalized, authentic lifestyle.""Chen notes that the near-term upside to same-store sales stemming from the addition of the Honest Beauty line in select Ulta stores will be small at first.He expects Honest Beauty to likely be less than 1% of Ulta's sales, given that Ulta carries 500-plus brands and more than 20,000 products vs. Honest Beauty’s roughly 80-piece collection.""We believe Honest will be a positive traffic driver and underscores Ulta's commitment to carrying the most compelling brands,"" Chen added.Prior to the Ulta launch, the Honest Beauty makeup and skin-care collection was only available on honestbeauty.com and in one retail outlet at The Grove, a Los Angeles shopping venue.""We believe Honest Beauty and The Honest Company could take share from bigger players, as their niche brand proposition continues to gain loyal customers,"" Chen added.He cites those ""bigger players"" as Proctor & Gamble (PG) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB).Ulta offers products ranging from high-priced so-called prestige brands sold in department stores and specialty stores to lower-priced labels sold via the mass channel, including drugstores and discounters.""Securing the initial distribution of Honest Beauty is one more way we believe Ulta can gain market share through their unique balance of prestige, mass and private-label brands,"" Chen added.

185,PG,"“Revolutionary.” “State of the art.” That was how President Obama described what would become the Ivanpah solar power plant in the Mojave Desert in a 2010 radio address.When Ivanpah started operations in 2014, the Department of Energy hailed its “innovative power-tower technology” and credited $1.6 billion in federal subsidized loans — as well as hundreds of millions in tax credits — for making the 4,000-acre solar plant a reality.It’s been pretty much downhill for Ivanpah ever since.The latest problem for the plant — which is owned by BrightSource Energy Inc., NRG Energy (NRG) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) -- came last week when it literally set itself on fire.Unlike other solar power facilities, that use photovoltaic panels, Ivanpah relies on 173,500 computer-controlled mirrors that focus the sun’s heat onto water tanks atop three 452-feet tall towers. The heat boils the water, and the steam turns the turbines.Turns out, some of those mirrors got misaligned, and pointing their heat rays too low, setting one of the towers on fire on Friday, which forced the tower to shut down.Embarrassing as this is, it is arguably the least of Ivanpah’s problems.Back in March, the plant faced the possibility of being shut down because it wasn’t delivering enough electricity to PG&E (PGC) as contracted. Ivanpah operated at about 45% of promised capacity in 2015 and 67% last year.California’s Public Utilities Commission decided to give the plant another year to meet is contractual obligations to the utility. But even then, the cost of electricity produced by Ivanpah is much higher than that from natural gas or even photovoltaic solar systems.Not only has Ivanpah turned out to be far more expensive than other sources of energy, but it's less green than advertised.Last summer, PG&E paid close to $200 per megawatt-hour for electricity from the plant, at a time when natural gas-powered plants cost about $35 a megawatt-hour.And because it depends on natural gas to preheat the boilers, Ivanpah emits 46,000 tons of CO2 a year, enough to require the plant to participate in California’s carbon cap-and-trade program.So, what we have is a power plant that can’t meet its quota for energy production, that relies on conventional sources of energy to operate, that can set itself on fire, and that is far more costly than other sources of electricity, and that is sucking up taxpayer dollars in the process.This isn't revolutionary. This is just a classic example of industrial policy at work.RELATEDEnvironmentalists Fight Huge Solar Plant On Behalf of 100 SheepMassive Solar Power Plant Emits 46,000 Tons of CO2The Dark Side Of Solar Power

186,PG,"Mondelez International (MDLZ) beat first-quarter estimates amid cost cuts and rising volumes, joining names like Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO) and big banks that have relied on cuts to improve profit.Excluding items, the maker of Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Cadbury chocolates earned 48 cents a share in Q1, up 17% from a year earlier and nine cents better than estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Including items, Mondelez earned $554 million, or 35 cents a share, compared to Q1 2015's $324 million, or 19 cents a share.Revenue fell 17% to $6.5 billion, beating estimates of $6.4 billion. It was the 10th straight quarter of revenue declines for the company.Volumes rose in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region but fell in Latin America and the region of Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Mondelez reaffirmed its full-year guidance.Slowing emerging markets, the strong dollar and consumers shifting their tastes away from sugary food have impacted the company. Activist investors Pershing Square Capital Management and Trian Fund Management also have been pressuring Mondelez to improve its performance.In response, the company has introduced healthier new products, cut costs and sold its coffee businesses. Its gross margin rose to 39.3% from 37.9%, while its operating margin rose to 11.2% from 10.4%.Mondelez says that it expects the dollar to be less of a drag and predicts that it will reduce net revenue growth by around three percentage points, in contrast to its previous estimate of six percentage points.Shares closed up 3.25% on the stock market today, pushing above their 200-day line, which crossed above the 50-day line in February.Other S&P 500 companies have relied on cost cutting in order to improve their bottom lines amid weak global demand and a strong dollar. A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive in overseas markets.Procter & Gamble said that its Q1 profit rose 28% to $2.75 billion. It has cut thousands of jobs, reduced its marketing budget and sold more than $20 billion of its units, including its Duracell battery business.Coca-Cola has aggressively moved to cut costs by $3 billion over several years, including $600 million in costs in 2016.Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) have moved to cut costs, including eliminating scores of jobs, partly in response to a tough revenue environment and partly due to increasing regulatory costs.Meanwhile, Mondelez Chief Commercial Officer Mark Clouse has joined Pinnacle Foods (PF) and will become its chief executive officer.

188,PG,"When the economy is entering a recession, stocks in consumer staples, health care and telecoms ""are the best places to hide,"" said Barclays' Jonathan Glionna, who names tobacco giants Philip Morris International (PM) and Reynolds American (RAI) and drug giants Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Meanwhile, he includes General Electric (GE) among the stocks to buy for a recovery.He doesn't see a recession in the near term, but there are red flags such as the collapse of oil prices, the 10% retreat in the S&P 500 so far this year and slowing growth in global No. 2 economy China.In a report Monday, Glionna joined a growing number of analysts providing lists of recession-resistant stocks. But he took a slightly different tack from others, offering two lists: a Recession Playbook and a Recovery Playbook.Among other top picks on his Recession Playbook are Campbell Soup (CPB), Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Hormel Foods (HRL).Philip Morris stock closed up 0.3% Tuesday, and Reynolds American, the maker of Camel cigarettes, added 1.3%. Merck gained 0.7%, and Pfizer rose 1.9%.

189,PG,"Wouldn't it be great if a company's earnings performance could be summed up in a single number that compares it to all other stocks? Such a wonder does exist. It's called the Earnings Per Share Rating, and it has been a staple in IBD for decades.The EPS Rating encapsulates an amazing amount of number crunching: It takes a company's two most recent quarterly earnings, and profit of the past three to five years, then compares those results with all the thousands of stocks in IBD's database.Depending on how well a company stacks up, its EPS Rating can go as high as 99. The worst earnings performers get a 1.So the first lesson for investors is to focus on the stocks with the highest EPS Ratings. Typically, the market leaders have ratings of at least 85, so make that your benchmark for most stocks you consider purchasing.Studies found that outstanding growth in the latest quarters, combined with a healthy three- to five-year profit history, form one of the most common characteristics of winning stocks before they make major price advances. That explains how the rating came to be formed.The EPS Rating is found in several places in IBD and its website, Investors.com.In print, it appears in the IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables, today starting on Page B3. Various other tables, such as the Stocks On The Move, the Timesaver Table and IBD 50, also include the rating.Online, it is most easily found by punching in the company symbol on the search box, by checking a current quote or by using IBD Stock Checkup .The Checkup lets you do some comparison shopping when you research stocks. The ""EPS Rating"" tab shows which five stocks have the best EPS Ratings in the industry group. This helps you determine if a company's EPS performance is truly among the best in its industry.Keep in mind that a strong EPS Rating doesn't necessarily mean a company doesn't have problematic earnings. A sudden change in the profit picture may not register so quickly on the rating.For example, quarterly EPS growth at AutoNation (AN) slowed from 29% to 20% to 17% the past three quarters. On Jan. 6, the auto dealership chain warned it expects a drop in fourth-quarter gross profit for new and used cars, saying it was forced to boost incentives to entice consumers. On average, analysts now expect just a 5% year-over-year increase in Q4 earnings.As of Thursday, AutoNation still held a high EPS Rating of 95.The EPS Rating does not take into account earnings expectations. While that's a valuable piece of information for investors, it is after all just an estimate, and no match for actual results.Moreover, some executives spend considerable energy talking down profit expectations, lest they become too lofty and leave the company vulnerable to a disappointing announcement.Investors also should remember that the EPS Rating makes no allowances for companies that traditionally have smaller profit growth rates. So a company like Procter & Gamble (PG), which has a steady business making consumer products, will have a mediocre EPS Rating. That shouldn't besmirch the company's reputation as a solid enterprise with stable profit.

190,PG,"When the stock markets are as rattled as they have been lately, there’s a certain comfort in putting your money into companies with consumer-friendly products, iconic brand names and steady dividend payments.Clorox (CLX) is a case in point. The maker of cleaning and household products set a record stock high in December and continues to show resilience even as the broader markets falter.It’s easy to overplay the “defensive” nature of defensive stocks -- those that investors gravitate toward in down markets or rocky economies. But in the case of Clorox, “it’s not overplayed at all,” said Linda Bolton Weiser, analyst at B. Riley & Co.“They produce very strong free cash flow, their dividends are bulletproof, and their earnings don’t vary significantly in a recession,"" she said.Clorox is one of four “true” consumer staple stocks in her coverage universe. The others are Proctor & Gamble (PG), Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB). Clorox is the least risky of the four, partly because it has much less exposure to markets outside the U.S., Weiser says.Clorox gets less than 20% of its sales from its international segment, in contrast to 80% for Colgate-Palmolive, 60% for P&G and 53% for Kimberly-Clark.“Clorox has a relatively small international exposure, so you’re not getting as much currency risk as you are from the other companies,” Weiser said. At the same time, she says, Clorox has gotten a boost from falling prices of commodities used to make, package and distribute its products. They include resin, cardboard and soybean oil.“They’re benefiting from commodity tailwinds and are not as badly hurt by unfavorable currency exchange rates,” Weiser said. “They’re really in a sweet spot right now.”Clorox’s share price reflects that sweet spot. The stock hit a high of 131.78 on Dec. 17, currently trades near 132 and has risen more than 15% over the last year.How much higher can it push? Probably not much, analysts say.“While we believe Clorox is one of the best managed companies under our coverage, we believe the stock is already trading at fair value,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi noted in a report.Weiser has a similar take.“Everything that is going well for Clorox is fully reflected in its stock price. It’s a very expensive stock right now,” she said.Clorox has delivered steady if unspectacular growth through the years. It hasn’t grown quarterly sales more than 4% since the December 2012 quarter. With few exceptions, its earnings growth rarely ventures into double digits.But the company does produce solid profits and more often than not ekes out annual sales gains. Much of the credit goes to the strong brand recognition of its products, including its namesake cleaning products as well as Glad wraps and trash bags, Liquid Plumr drain cleaner, Kingsford charcoal briquets, Pine-Sol cleaners, Hidden Valley salad dressings, KC Masterpiece barbecue sauces, Brita water filters and Burt’s Bees personal care products.Clorox operates in four segments: cleaning, household, lifestyle and international. It mainly sells its products to supermarkets and grocery stores. Discount chain Wal-Mart (WMT) is its biggest client, accounting for about 26% of sales.The cleaning and household segments -- encompassing everything from its iconic laundry bleach to garbage bags -- each contributed 32% of overall revenue during fiscal year 2015, which ended in June. The lifestyle segment, including salad dressings and lip treatments, contributed 17%. The international segment pitched in 19%.Clorox’s performance during this year’s first fiscal quarter was one of its best in years. It posted earnings of $1.32 a share, up 20% from the prior year and well ahead of consensus estimates for $1.18. Revenue climbed 3% to $1.39 billion, slightly above views.On Nov. 17, Clorox’s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 77 cents a share, payable Feb. 12 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on Jan. 27. The company benefited from price increases and higher volumes during the first quarter, which helped offset currency headwinds.The overall volume of products sold increased 3% from the prior year. Gross margin climbed 220 basis points to 45% from 42.8% a year earlier, thanks mainly to cost savings, higher sales and favorable commodity costs.“Clorox’s volumes have now been positive for five straight quarters, and the company’s focus on investing additional gross margin savings into (advertising and promotions) should keep this metric in the black for the foreseeable future,” Modi noted.Revenue in Clorox’s cleaning segment rose 5% during the quarter, driven by a strong performance from home care brands such as Clorox disinfecting wipes. The household segment posted 5% revenue growth, while the lifestyle segment logged a 7% gain.The international segment reported an 8% revenue decline because of unfavorable exchange rates. On a currency-neutral basis, international revenue rose 5%.To help deal with challenges in foreign markets, Clorox has adopted a “go lean” strategy that includes cutting costs and reducing infrastructure.“Strong execution of our go-lean strategy in international is particularly important as we look ahead to the balance of the fiscal year,” Clorox spokesman Steven Austenfeld said on a conference call with analysts. “(We recognize) the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, which would put additional pressure on profitability in our international business.”Clorox is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results before the open on Feb. 4. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $1.05 a share, up from 97 cents the previous year. Revenue should remain about flat at $1.35 billion.

"
206,PG,"Stocks struggled a bit and moved lower yesterday - while remaining in the range that I pointed out in yesterday's note....2080/2100 - Late morning we tested the 2080 level before finding some support and rally into the closing bell.... Trading was light as investors/traders appeared unwilling to commit to the market ahead of the onslaught of earnings today - think Apple (AAPL),  Facebook (FB),  Procter & Gamble (PG), EXXON Mobil (XOM), BAXTER (BAX), 3M (MMM), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Corning (GLW), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Eli Lilly (LLY) (Revenues beat, but EPS missed by 0.02 cts) & Whirlpool (WHR) (missed on the top line - revenues - and missed on the bottom line. reported $2.63 vs. exp of $2.68) that are all announcing today and ahead of tomorrow's FOMC announcement.Remember - today begins the two day FED meeting and there is a lot of anticipation and paralysis about what they will say tomorrow. Again - the mkt does not expect a change in rates at all...but it does expect some clarification in terminology concerning June and the next expected hike......Recall that the last hike in December, sent the mkts into a tailspin.....causing the FED to become a bit more 'dovish' as she searched for a reason to calm the mkts.....this time citing unstable global mkts as the culprit...but since then - the mkts have come roaring back - with the S&P now up 2.1% and the Dow up 3.74% - off of what looked like a disastrous year.....As a result of the strength - expect Janet to intimate a return to a path to higher rates......not necessarily faster, just a bit higher.....Expect every word to be parsed and every sentence to be deconstructed as everyone looks for the next 'clue'.Now why the low volumes? Well there are a number of reasons really - never mind the current regulatory environment, and the abuse suffered by so many managers during the 1Q - but yesterday - there was no 'news', right? No eco reports, no significant earnings, no speeches, no big international events, no nothing.....so why do anything? The mkt held in tight - giving no reason to deviate from the plan.....and so the only ones really playing yesterday were the HFT guys and - and asset managers that were tweaking core positions....but tweaking does not mean a change of investment strategy at all...it just means tweaking.....Now oil did come under a bit of pressure yesterday - falling by 2.4% to end the day at $$42.64- but all that tells me is that the recent run up in oil was a bit premature given the current glut and lack of a deal between the OPEC nations etc. So if oil trades within the current band - $39.50/$44 - it's all good.....Why should it break down or surge higher just yet? This morning we see oil up small as the dollar appears a bit weaker......(think no rate hike). Remember - we will get the weekly API (American Petroleum Institute) report this afternoon.Now yesterday we did get a broad measure of the housing mkt.....- but again - these stats are no longer the mkt moving events that they were......although - that could change...you see - yesterday was NEW HOME SALES....and typically this is good barometer of the state of the broader US economy...and guess what? Another disappointment.....New Home Sales FELL 1.5% vs. the exp of a rise of 1.6%.......and why should we be a bit concerned?Well - This is the time of the year when new home sales should be strong....so is this disappointment just another barometer of a weakening economic picture? What is really mind boggling is that we are now a decade into the housing collapse....a decade - that is 10 yrs of an incomplete recovery...as pockets of single family housing continue to stall..... New Home Sales on a total unit basis came in at 511k units - significantly below the 50 yr average of more than 650,000 units. During the Greenspan era - Subprime loans/mortgages propelled sales of New Homes into the stratosphere - sending them as high as 1.28 million units in 2005, - the yr before the beginning of the crash.......a crash created by the adjustable rate mortgages that managed to destroy so many people - triggering waves of foreclosures that then ignited the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2010 (some say the crisis is still ongoing.....I'll leave that up to you...).US futures are up 2 pts in early trading...as the mkt gets ready to react to the slew of those earnings reports noted above. Whirlpool - which we noted missed the numbers is quoted down about $10 bucks in pre-mkt trading....quoted NOT trading just yet....so let's see what investors/traders think about that.....Today is also a big economic day...lots of macro data to consider....Durable Goods exp of +1.9%, ex trans of 0.5%, Cap Good Orders of +0.6%, Cap Goods Shipped of +0.9%, Markit US PMI of 52 and the Richmond Fed Survey of 12. The earnings will all be happening prior to the open while the macro data begins at 8:30 and goes until 10 am. This will create a lot of noise in early trading...but once it settles in after 11 am....then expect the discussion to revolve around the FED once analysts consider the implications of whatever today's macro data reveals.Again - I expect the broader mkt to hold tight within the 2080/2100 range until tomorrow. (Think FED paralysis). Individual names today will get rewarded or punished depending on what they reported and what they say about the future....All in a day's work.....Take Good Care

209,PG,"It was a busy week for business, economic and investing news. The stock market came under more pressure as Apple (AAPL) reported its first sales decline since 2003, while Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) turned on the gas. The Federal Reserve signaled it's in no rush to raise rates, while the U.S. economy crawls.The market rally came under more pressure amid a slew of earnings reports and big economic news. The Nasdaq tumbled 2.7% for the week, falling through its 200-day line on Thursday and its 50-day average on Friday, as losers such as Apple, Twitter (TWTR) and First Solar (FSLR) trumped big gains for Facebook and Amazon. The S&P 500 and Dow are well above those support levels, but also tumbled, with all of the losses coming Thursday-Friday. Oil prices continued to march higher, helped by a weaker dollar and further declines in U.S. production. The 10-year Treasury yield gave up much of its recent gains.How healthy are shares of Amazon and Facebook, and how do they compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupThe tech titan certainly wasn't a growth company in its fiscal second quarter, reporting its first revenue decline since 2003 as iPhone unit sales tumbled. Earnings per share fell 18%, worse than expected. And Apple gave weak guidance for the current quarter. Apple hasn't had a huge product since the big-screen iPhone 6, and smartphone sales generally are stagnating. At this point Apple is so huge it will be hard for a new product to really move the needle.In another sign of its shift from rapid growth to a more mature model, Apple added an additional $50 billion to its shareholder return program, with more buybacks and a higher dividend.Meanwhile, activist investor Carl Icahn decided to cash out of Apple stock, and so did others. Apple stock fell 11.3% for the week, nearly settling at its worst close since mid-2014.Apple chip suppliers generally fared relatively well, in part due to diversifying away from Apple or smartphones generally.Apple Investors Worry Glory Days Are OverThe Federal Reserve, as expected, voted to leave interest rates unchanged at its latest policy meeting and gave no hints that it would tighten before the fall at the earliest. The Fed noted that labor markets have strengthened even as economic growth slowed. And that's true, for now. The U.S. economy rose at a 0.5% annual rate in the first quarter, the weakest in two years. Meanwhile, jobless claims are near 42-year lows. If the economy is barely growing, it's hard to see how the U.S. can continue to add 200,000 jobs a month. But that's what analysts are expecting in Friday's April employment report.The Fed's go-slow approach -- coupled with the Bank of Japan's unexpected decision not to increase its stimulus efforts -- pushed the dollar to big losses. That could boost U.S. multinationals' profits and give a further lift to dollar-priced oil and other commodities.The e-commerce giant sees Q2 sales of $28 billion-$30.5 billion, largely above Wall St. views and a 26% gain at the midpoint. While that would mark a slowdown from Q1's 28% pop, the highest in nearly 4 years, it would still be faster than what was typical the past three years. Q1 earnings also crushed estimates, as cloud unit Amazon Web Services remained hot. China's version of Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), reports Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Ford Motor (F), Uber, Lyft and Volvo announced Tuesday the formation of a coalition to advocate for self-driving cars. The lobbying effort comes as automakers race to develop autonomous technologies. Alphabet is in late-stage talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) about a partnership regarding autonomous cars, according to multiple reports. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) already has self-driving features in its electric cars, but has not unveiled plans to join the coalition. Tesla will report earnings on Wednesday, with autonomous tech firm Mobileye (MBLY) out Thursday.Social networking kings Facebook and LinkedIn had a good week, as both posted Q1 earnings that topped estimates and sent the stocks higher. Facebook reported its third straight quarter of accelerating earnings and revenue growth. Despite concerns about slowing user engagement, advertisers are definitely using Facebook. Mobile advertising accounted for 82% of Facebook's $5.2 billion in ad revenue, up from 73% in Q1 2015. Facebook stock spiked Thursday to a record high of 120.71, but pulled back to close the week modestly above a 117.09 buy point.LinkedIn renewed investor confidence after a harrowing Q4 that saw its stock plunge 44%. LinkedIn turned in a solid Q1 earnings that investors applauded.With the U.S. and global economy growing at a tepid pace, companies are stressing cost cuts to prop up earnings as revenue flatlines or falls. In the latest week, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, snack giant  Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Procter & Gamble (PG) announced recent or new efforts to curb expenses, restructure or sell assets. They join the likes of Coca-Cola (KO)  and banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). While cuts may help companies in the short run, they need stronger top-line growth to fuel earnings longer term.Shifting priorities for media companies came into play last week, as a handful of megamergers captured the spotlight and served as an attempt to keep growing or simply cling to survival. Cable and content titan Comcast (CMCSA) sought to grow in foreign markets via a $3.8 billion deal to buy DreamWorks Animation (DWA), the studio responsible for ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda."" Meanwhile, it looks like Comcast rival Charter Communications (CHTR) will be able to keep up, as its $55 billion bid to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC) won regulatory approval. But survival in the struggling newspaper industry was on the mind of USA Today parent Gannett (GCI) as it bid $815 million to buy Tribune Publishing (TPUB), owner of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune.Crude oil futures continued to rise, hitting 2016 highs. But Big Oil is still adjusting to lower prices. Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its oil dependence and float less than 5% of Saudi Aramco in an IPO, valuing the world’s largest oil company in excess of $2 trillion Meanwhile,  ConocoPhillips (COP) slashed its 2016 capital spending even further and BP (BP) said it was considering further cuts in '17.  Baker Hughes (BHI) warned that N. American rig counts still have room to fall, but the U.S. count may stabilize later this year. Chevron (CVX) swung to a loss in Q1. While U.S. production falls overall, output for most majors rose even as investment fell. Exxon (XOM) lost its AAA rating at S&P, but still kept its commitment to its dividend, raising it to 75 cents from 73 cents.Quarterly results from shale players Continental Resources (CLR), EOG (EOG) and Carrizo (CRZO) are out this week.Medical merger activity took off Thursday. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) inked a $25 billion buyout deal with cardiac device giant St. Jude Medical (STJ). Abbott's former biopharma arm AbbVie (ABBV) agreed to buy biotech startup Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion plus up to $4 billion in possible milestone payments. Big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion cash bid for smaller drugmaker Medivation (MDVN). Medivation rejected Sanofi's offer, but Sanofi vowed to press on, and Medivation's stock traded as if investors are expecting Sanofi (and perhaps another bidder) to go higher. Both Stemcentrx and Medivation are focused on cancer treatments, a field that has provided some of the biggest drug launches of recent years.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) recovery might be slow-going, with April same-store sales down 26% to date, surprising many. The burrito king logged its first-ever quarterly loss -- of 88 cents per share -- in Q1, though Wall Street expected worse. A revenue decline to $834.5 million missed views, as comps plummeted 29.7%.But another fast-casual chain, Panera Bread (PNRA), reported strong results. Its stock is setting up in a short consolidation going back to March 8.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) turned in mixed results, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) missed completely and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) edged past forecasts.

241,PG,"Stumbling over your own tired synapses? Try these antidotes to subpar cerebral firing:Press harder. Corporate facilitator Matthew May watched a Los Angeles bomb squad approach a hypothetical problem with predictably fallible thinking.The team jumped to conclusions, settled for so-so solutions and got stuck in routine mindsets.Predictable, because May had encountered the same less-than-inspired thinking while coaching thousands of corporate types.“It’s been a decade of watching this over and over again,” he told IBD.In “Winning the Brain Game,” May distilled his observations into seven fatal thinking flaws and fixes.Pause for queries. The first defect is instinctively leaping to a solution before considering a problem’s complexities.The rapid-fire approach rarely leads to a savvy solution because “not enough time is devoted to framing the issue properly,” May said.His fix, ""framestorming,"" involves quickly asking questions: Why? What if? How?The answers elucidate the issue and lead to more inspired resolutions.Reverse it. Fixation means relying on reliable mental methods. They deliver us to run-of-the-mill destinations.The antidote is inversion, “a fancy word for ‘Opposite Day,’ ” May said. “Flipping orthodoxy” is another take from TED Ideas editor Helen Walters.The approach is the same: “Take a breather and let’s just reverse things,” May said.Consider a hotel chain with no properties, and you get Airbnb.Check yourself. Overthink a problem and you’re likely to create new complications. May solves this with prototesting -- combining prototyping with testing to get a quick handle on an idea’s viability.Blend notions. Satisficing -- to satisfy and suffice -- means compromising your way to a weak solution.Rather than settle for a trade-off, maximize your efforts by examining options and pulling the best of all worlds into a synthesized solution.Go further. Downgrading is similar to satisficing. It means pre-emptively surrendering and aiming short of the ultimate goal.This can happen in brainstorming.Studies show that idea generation tends to stall after 20 minutes. When teams push past that psychological wall, they come up with inspired, rather than simply good, ideas.To remedy this, try jump-start techniques. One approach involves committing to beginning again with a fresh-start mindset. Another replaces “we can’t, because” thinking with “we can, if.”Declare it. Another hazard, self-censoring, means keeping that brilliant breakthrough to yourself. Too often, workers know speaking up is futile.To show C-suite executives what they’re missing, May tried an experiment.He planted low-ranking employees at tables with senior executives. May secretly told the rank-and-file staffers the answer to the challenge he was about present, and urged them to be as persuasive as possible to sell it.“Not a single person was able to convince the table that they had the right solution,” May said.Cure that problem by proactively inviting and celebrating input from all sources.Also try self-distancing, or stepping mentally outside yourself to notice details from an outsider’s perspective.Look beyond. Of all the flaws, “the deadliest is when an idea comes from the outside and we automatically reject it,” May said.Termed ""not invented here,"" or NIH, it’s when concepts from outside corporate walls are dismissed.

242,PG,"Aberdeen U.S. Small Cap Equity Fund (GSXAX) is on a roll. Through March 31, the now-$558 million portfolio was the eighth-best performing U.S. diversified stock fund in the prior 12 months with a 7.58% return, according to Morningstar Inc. And it was No. 1 among small-cap funds. The S&P 500 advanced a more modest 1.35% in that period.At the quarter's end, the fund ranked in the top 1% and 2% of its small-cap growth peers over the past three and five years, respectively.The fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Thirty-two-year-old Ralph Bassett and 47-year-old Jason Kotik, two of the fund's four managers, spoke with IBD from their offices in Philadelphia about how they invest.IBD: Describe key aspects of your research process.Kotik: We have concentrated positions of between 40 and 60 names. We start with meeting a company's management team. Some investors look at screens. We look at a company to understand its business model, to look at its historical margins and returns, the balance sheet, things like that. We build a list of questions for that management team.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe bigger difference (between us and other funds) is that, while we interview company management like other investors do, we take a three-to-five-year or longer approach to understanding businesses because we'll hold them a long time.Our turnover is 25% to 35% a year, the lower end of the range for most funds. Our approach is really about understanding management's discipline around their capital investments, understanding them and building a relationship with them.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceSo, in the future when things don't go as planned -- and there's always a time when things don't go as planned, always -- we know how they will react, based on their answers to our questions.That's really the most important part of understanding a business.IBD: You recently wrote that volatility can be an opportunity. Was the recent market volatility a buying opportunity?Bassett: In the back half of last year and the first month of this year, I would say there was more opportunity than we'd seen in a long time.We did find some companies of higher quality but linked to less predominant macro themes (than the ones that hurt the energy sector). Things unfairly got discounted around macro contagion and dollar strength. We take a long view and assume dollar strength will subside over time. So we found some good opportunities.IBD: What are some examples?Kotik: We found opportunities to take advantage of names we own. One example in Q4, we were able to top up Canadian Western Bank. When you think of western Canada, you think of oil and gas, the oil sands market. So you'd think their loans portfolio would be filled with damaged goods. But less than 3% of their loans are to oil companies. They had traded down to tangible book and to book value. We took advantage of the marketplace selling off energy stocks and Canadian stocks and anything related to the Canadian dollar, and we added to our position.IBD: What example would you provide, Ralph?Bassett: We initiated a position in WisdomTree Investments (WETF) in February at the depths of the market. Their business is focused on ETFs and specifically those that are bespoke in nature -- bespoke in the sense that they are the only solely-ETF-focused company that is public. They also have been very innovative and quick to market with products compared to their peers. Now they have a wide product menu, and that can capture shifts in client asset allocation over time.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersWe had grappled with their valuation for a while. Frankly, we watched it tumbled from 30 to 24 to roughly 10 -- then it got more intriguing. A lot of concerns about their product concentration and competitive forces were, in our minds, diminished.Secondly, they had net cash on their balance sheet and intended to keep it that way, so we weren't worried about financial risk.We will be slow and patient. This is an example of our process patience.IBD: What else besides the housing rebound is driving Gibraltar Industries (ROCK)?Kotik: It sold off in the down market, and we added to it. It's rebounded more than 40% off its bottom.Gibraltar has started to make a strong transition in its business model to diversify its end markets.Its new CEO (Frank Heard) came from Illinois Tools Works (ITW) and brought ITW's tenets of focusing on the parts of the business that provide higher profits.It's a building products company. It sells things like mailboxes to Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's Cos. (LOW). They have a large contract with the postal service for large-scale postal boxes. Apartment buildings need them because of ecommerce and the way consumers now buy products. Apartment managers can't figure out where to put all of this mail and packages. So Gibraltar came up with a plan for a new model.We own it because they use their capital extremely efficiently, and their cash flow is expanding. They're moving to a higher-margin mix of businesses.We look for company-specific drivers. Gibraltar benefits from the housing rebound. But we won't invest in companies that benefit just from volume and cyclical rebounds. We need a specific driver. For Gibraltar, it was about their transition to a more diversified business, driving higher quality profitability, rather than a focus on top-line growth.IBD: OK, what's the driver for Drew Industries (DW), a maker of components for recreational vehicles and manufactured homes?Kotik: The interest is that they've been adding dollar content on products to the RV and manufactured home industries. They've consistently improved their content dollars per vehicle.
"
243,PG,"Their continued market share gains let them perform well even during tough times. But we're skeptical when everything is going right. We still hold it at an average weight, and we brought it down to capture profits.IBD: You own some stocks that sound like they're in non-sexy businesses. What's their appeal? What's the special catalyst? Start with RBC Bearings (ROLL), please.Bassett: They make highly specialized ball bearings, which range from pen-cap size to several feet. Those big ones go into huge industrial products and reactors.They focus on specialty areas where the ball bearings need to be designed into the product. That reduces competition, so they capture margin along the way. Their business is high-value-added, taking share in programs. They've thought about acquisitions but are being careful. Years down the road, there could be pressure on their aerospace business. We're mindful of the potential cyclicality.IBD: What about Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), an egg distributor?Bassett: They are slowly shifting away from the egg commodity part of their business. About one-quarter of their business is providing specialties like liquid eggs to McDonald's (MCD) and Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN).They're increasing their organic eggs business. And a lot of customers want cage-free eggs. Few companies can afford to provide that. It takes capital for land and structures for organic eggs and cage-free eggs.So Cal-Maine not only picks up business, it consolidates as smaller farmers are forced out.IBD: What's the special driver for MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading exchange?Bassett: Previously, a lot trades went through large investment banks with huge inventory. But MarketAxess can do it cheaper in smaller quantities, so if someone wants to sell several bonds rather than huge round lots, MarketAxess offers cheaper transaction costs than larger brokerages.And they focus on a relative niche market: corporate credit, which is not as huge a market as the Treasury market that large investment banks focus on.But Bloomberg has also tapped into this market, and it's hard for MarketAxess to gain share vs. Bloomberg.IBD: What's the catalyst for Prestige Brands (PBH), which markets health care and house-cleaning products?Bassett: By and large, you've heard of their products: Comet, Luden's cough drops, Monistat. When they acquire a brand, they invest in it so they can maintain or gain share, then they harvest the added cash flow.They don't manufacture. They do more branding, marketing, distribution. They are outsource manufacturers.Look at Procter & Gamble (PG), which is shrinking its portfolio of products and is refocusing. Maybe Prestige can take advantage.IBD: How important are competitive moats for companies?Kotik: Over the long term, in this marketplace, success is not about high momentum. People care about valuation, and they should. This will differentiate us.

245,PG,"Idea people think inside and beyond the lines. How they structure creativity:Practice originality. In 1972, industrial design grads John Nottingham and John Spirk decided to forgo Fortune 500 company jobs to launch their own invention business in a Cleveland garage.“We just started creating innovative products,” Nottingham told IBD.Since then, their firm -- Nottingham Spirk -- has amassed more than 1,000 patents that have generated $50 billion in revenue for client companies.Get together. Nottingham and Spirk apply a vertical innovation approach at their 60,000-square-foot facility. Every needed discipline -- research, strategy, design, engineering, patent, prototyping -- is staffed.“Because we do it all under one roof, we are able to do it faster,” Nottingham said. “Nobody puts it together like us.”Mix it up. To make something completely different, try “taking something from one field and applying it in another field,” Nottingham said.The duo took the SpinPop, a spinning lollipop they developed in the mid-1990s, and applied the engineering to the toothbrush industry.They noticed that Oral-B was dominating the market with a $5 toothbrush. Nottingham Spirk’s brainstorm: “How about a motorized toothbrush for $5?”Their Dr. John’s SpinBrush made a big splash, and Procter & Gamble (PG) bought it for $475 million in 2001.Find voids. A trick to making something completely fresh? “Look for what’s not there,” Nottingham said.Also, focus on who you’re not reaching. “You have more noncustomers than customers,” he said.Test, test, test. The soft launch -- debuting a product in a single chain or limited geographic area -- is essential.“If you fail small, you reconstitute it and go back again,” Nottingham said. “Once we get it right, we blow it out nationally.”Separate them. Company chiefs often ask their product teams to disrupt their own creations. That’s a mistake, according to Nottingham.His advice: Keep one team focused on the core business. Then “have a separate team focused on disruption and innovation.”Put that second team in a separate building.Some companies hesitate to dedicate people and resources to big-leap thinking.“You know who disrupts them? Someone else in a garage somewhere,” Nottingham said.Speed it up. Firms can also drag out the innovation process.While working at Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, designer Jake Knapp had this realization about efficiency:“My best work happened when I had a big challenge and not quite enough time.”He developed what he called a sprint session – a structured week of focusing on a problem and prototyping a solution. One such five-day stretch resulted in Google Hangouts, a videoconferencing app.Compress efforts. “Sprint,” Knapp’s book with John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz, details the process:Monday. Map out the problem and target an area to attack.Tuesday. Put competing ideas on paper in sketch form.Wednesday. Decide on a testable hypothesis.Thursday. Build a realistic prototype.Friday. Try it out.Such sprints caught on within Google and have been used for developing products, marketing strategies and company names.Zip forward. Knapp applied the same approach with GV, formerly Google Ventures, the search giant’s venture capital division.The idea is to help bootstrappers quickly determine if they’re on the right track.“Working together with our startups in a sprint, we shortcut the endless-debate cycle and compress months of time into a single week,” Knapp wrote.Image provided by Shutterstock.

247,PG,"Utilities and consumer staples raced past most sector equity ETFs this year, but investors shouldn't get stuck in a defensive-minded, dividend-focused rut.""Consider cyclical sectors over defensive and high-dividend-paying sectors,"" BlackRock advises in its latest Investment Directions note. As of December 2015, BlackRock managed $4.64 trillion, more than any other investment firm in the world.Both utilities and consumer staples are vulnerable to rising yields, which BlackRock anticipates over the intermediate term as inflation expectations pick up.Consumer staples look particularly unattractive to the firm's strategists, with valuations appearing stretched despite the earnings stability of companies such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola (KO).""As the global growth outlook improves, we think cyclical stocks give more bang for the buck,"" the BlackRock team of global investment strategists wrote.Which sectors in particular? They're overweight consumer discretionary and technology.Job growth and low energy prices are fueling revenue and earnings momentum for consumer discretionary companies, including retail, media, automobile and leisure businesses. The sector is expected to deliver the best earnings growth among all sectors.SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) has gained 4.3% so far in 2016 through March 23, making it a best-performing consumer discretionary ETF. By comparison, its broadly diversified sibling, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), has jabbed 0.5% lower over the same period.The 96 stock holdings in the XRT portfolio include Ulta Beauty (ULTA), a highly rated IBD 50 stock. The beauty-store chain has grown earnings 24% annually over the past three years. It has a top-notch IBD Composite Rating of 97, which means that it's outperforming on various technical and fundamental metrics.In the past month, XRT rallied 7%.Technology ETFs are rebounding, too.First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend (TDIV) had a rough start to the year along with the broad market, but the ETF has clawed back losses since the Feb. 11 market bottom.It's up nearly 5% year to date through March 23 vs. 2% for the bellwether Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK).IShares Global Tech (IXN) offers a globally diversified portfolio of technology stocks. U.S. firms account for 78% of its assets.Apple (AAPL) is its top holding out of 110 stocks, at a 13% portfolio weighting.IXN has advanced 0.4% year to date. It was reversing lower on the stock market today.

248,PG,"Dividend mutual funds as a group lagged the S&P 500 stock index over the 10 years that ended going into Monday.The reasons for the underperformance are worth keeping in mind whenever you make buy or sell decisions in your portfolio, particularly the diversified portion -- your mutual funds and ETFs. They could boost the octane in your funds' fuel tank.Dividend funds lagged despite having outperformed as a group over the first half of the decade. But as the post-financial-crisis bull market picked up steam, the S&P 500 began to top dividend funds in total return.Many dividend funds are value-oriented, and many are willing to give up more in potential price appreciation for a shot at higher dividend yield.The average dividend funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. rose an average annual 5.24% in the past 40 quarters plus this current quarter to date.In that same span, the S&P 500 rose an average annual 6.75%.If you had invested $10,000 on Dec. 31, 2005, in funds with ""dividend"" in their name, your money would have grown into $17,753 by March 4.Invested in the S&P 500, the same $10,000 would have ballooned into $19,892.So putting money into a fund tracking the big-cap benchmark would have helped your overall portfolio more -- and your retirement planning in particular.One silver lining: dividend funds average a current 12-month yield of 2.22%. That's slightly higher than the 2.17% 12-month yield of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).Also, the top-performing dividend funds have skated past the S&P 500 in 10-year performance, though only three of the top 13 have higher yields.In the past 10 years, the top-performing dividend fund with more than $100 million in assets is $10.2 billion SunAmerica Focused Dividend Strategy Portfolio (FDSAX). The fund averaged a yearly gain of 9.52%. It also yields 2.47%.The fund had 99.63% of its money on U.S. stocks as of Dec. 31. It had 67% of assets at work in giant- and large-cap stocks. Another 28% was in midcaps. The balance of the portfolio was in small caps.The fund's biggest sector bet was consumer cyclical, with a 26% weighting.Industrials were its next biggest sector, with a 20% weighting. Energy was its third-largest sector, with a 16%.Energy was followed by consumer defensive, with a 14% weighting. In contrast, technology was only the fund's seventh-largest sector, with a modest 6.63% weighting.Recent top holdings include Verizon Communications (VZ), which is up 12% this year.The telecom giant has a Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Verizon pays a 4.4% dividend yield. Earnings per share grew 14%, 17% and 25% the past three quarters.Procter & Gamble (PG), another top holding, is up 5% this year.The cosmetics and personal-care products titan has a strong 87 Comp Rating and a 3.2% dividend yield.The stock has rewarded shareholders by raising its dividend 59 years in a row.EPS grew 9% in the fiscal second quarter. They fell 1% in the prior stanza.Philip Morris International (PM), yet another top holding, is up 7% this year. It has an 83 Comp Rating and pays a 4.3% dividend yield.Q4 EPS fell 4%, reflecting currency translation losses.

249,PG,"Procter & Gamble (PG) has a solid image. In recent years, though, a few doubts have emerged. The company has had four CEO changes over 15 years, beginning with Durk Jager's exit in 2000.

"
250,PG,"The strong dollar has been a drag on U.S. multinationals for several quarters. But with the greenback turning flabby, investors are betting on better corporate results, pushing Dow stocks General Electric (GE), McDonald’s (MCD), Microsoft (MSFT) and Coca-Cola (KO) near or above buy points.Another Dow component, Nike (NKE), fell Wednesday after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue for its February quarter, in part due to the dollar. The athletic shoe and apparel giant's sales rose 8% but would have climbed 14% excluding currency swings.Yet the currency headwind is waning. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against the euro, yen and 4 other  currencies, has turned lower vs. a year earlier in the last few weeks -- down 0.9% as of Wednesday, even with a recent upturn. At this time last year, the dollar index was up 21%.The Federal Reserve's decision this month to trim its plans to hike interest rates certainly had an impact. When investors expect U.S. rates to be lower for longer, their view tends to negatively impact the greenback, which becomes less attractive to yield-seeking investors. The dollar has rallied somewhat in recent days on less-dovish comments from various Fed officials.Although companies are still using the dollar as a reason for negative guidance, they're using that reason ""a little less than before,"" said Gregory Harrison, a senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters.""It seems like other factors are a little more prominent now -- like the slowing global economy and the slowdown in China,"" he said.Uncertainty over the U.S. presidential election usually tends to make consumers pull back a bit in spending, he added, noting also that a sagging energy sector has been a much bigger drag on corporate earnings than the dollar.""That’s kind of expected to remain the case throughout the year -- at least until the fourth quarter,"" Harrison said.Meanwhile, central banks in Europe and Japan have gone to negative rates, but their recent moves unexpectedly lifted their currencies against the dollar. The Chinese yuan has erased its early 2016 losses vs. the greenback.And stocks have responded. General Electric saw its stock break out of a cup-with-handle base with a 30.69 buy point on March 17, a few weeks after Coca-Cola cleared a long consolidation to a record high.McDonald's briefly rose to 125 on the stock market today, hitting a record high and just passing a buy point of 124.93. But the below-average volume rise faded to a 0.3% gain at 124.19.Procter & Gamble (PG) stock is on the cusp of retaking a buy point at 83.10. Microsoft also is close to an entry point.Of course, the dollar isn't the only reason for their success.McDonald's decision to introduce an all-day breakfast boosted the fast-food chain in Q4 to its best U.S. quarterly sales in nearly four years after several years of struggling.Coca-Cola is in the middle of selling its U.S. manufacturing and distribution operations by next year. Instead, Coke plans to focus on its concentrate-making business, which is more profitable. Procter & Gamble is moving to focus on more-profitable core brands.GE is transitioning back to its industrial roots, with a strong digital footprint. The company is selling off much of its once-massive GE Capital financial services unit. General Electric is also moving its headquarters from Fairfield, Conn., to Boston, a tech hub located near several major universities that should supply the company with fresh, young tech talent.Despite the market turbulence over the past 12 months, Microsoft has been a top performer, gaining 26% from a year ago; near the end of last year, it eclipsed its dot-com boom peak. The company has finally made a push into mobile, and its Windows 10 operating system has won praise -- especially after the debacle of Windows 8.As for Nike, the athletic brand king had been closing in on a new high but closed down 3.8% Wednesday. Nike reported after Tuesday's market close that fiscal Q3 earnings rose 22% and that currency-neutral futures orders leapt 17%, both results better than expected. But Nike sales fell short, and the company gave cautious fiscal 2017 guidance.A weakening dollar should provide a better business climate for blue-chip giants going forward. But if the Fed turns hawkish and the greenback firms up, investor optimism about profits may fade, threatening Dow breakouts.Those with a more skeptical view say that the window was closing on the tough year-over-year currency comparisons anyway and that the real story was corporate earnings finally catching up to the sluggish revenue environment.""Revenue growth has been somewhat constrained for quite some time,"" said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial. ""That just reflects you can only get so far on the expense side of the ledger and support earnings growth that way. Cost cutting can only take you so far.""

282,PG,"There's something for everyone in the vast universe of sector funds, from consumer staples to health care to technology.When a sector is in favor, those funds can rack up big returns. But they can also be prone to bigger declines, since they're more concentrated in specific areas than a diversified fund.IBD ran a screen of actively managed funds with at least $100 million in assets that have beaten their benchmarks in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. Two sectors were the clear winner: The five best sector funds ranked by 10-year performance all focus on biotech or health sciences. (See our full list of best sector mutual funds.)To highlight the best mutual funds in the top-performing sectors, the ""best of the best"" list of IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award winners includes the top fund in each of six sectors.Click Here To View A Table Of Top Performing Mutual Funds By CategoryFidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio (FBIOX) came out on top with a 10-year average annual return of 16.9%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 7.31%. The fund held $9.7 billion in net assets as of Feb. 29. Its expense ratio is 0.74%. Rajiv Kaul has managed the fund since October 2005.Like most sectors, biotech has seen its fair share of volatility. But that's not necessarily a negative.""In the next five to 10 years, there's going to be a renaissance for the industry in terms of the golden age of innovation,"" Kaul told IBD. ""It's not going to be in a straight line. Biotech is volatile for investors. That's the amazing opportunity that happens.""As of Jan. 31, biotech stocks made up 86% of the portfolio and pharmaceuticals 13%. Fidelity Select Biotech held 277 stocks in all. Top holdings at the end of Q4 included Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).All five stocks belong to IBD's biotech industry group, which surged more than 800% from a November 2008 low to its July 2015 peak. Turnover in the fund tends to run fairly low, at about 29%.There are high barriers to entry in the biotech field, including expertise, capital and regulatory hurdles, Kaul points out. ""But when you do get a major breakthrough in a medication, you really improve people's lives and help save costs for the health care system.""How does Kaul pick stocks for the fund?""You have to understand the management and what is the track record of success,"" he said. ""We have that kind of historical understanding and depth of understanding of the industry and the individual players. Equally important is the ability of these companies to access capital at a low cost. I want my companies to be self-reliant.""The five top biotech funds all owned big-cap biotech and Soliris maker Alexion in their recently reported quarters. Four of the five funds also held biotechs Celgene and Gilead, which focus on cancer and hepatitis C, respectively. Generic drug makers tracked by IBD soared more than 900% from March 2009 to July 2015, while ethical drug stocks rallied nearly 750% from March 2009 to August 2015.T. Rowe Price Health Sciences (PRHSX) took second place among biotech funds, with a 10-year return of 16.8%.

Services accounted for 35% of assets, followed by biotech at 25%, pharmaceuticals at 22%, products and devices at 10%, and life sciences at 6%. Top holdings included Aetna (AET), Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Allergan (AGN), Becton Dickinson (BDX) and Cigna (CI).""Focus on innovative medicines, diagnostics, devices and business models has been the core driver of success,"" Taymour Tamaddon, who has managed the fund since February 2013, said via e-mail. ""Over the past 10 years, strength has been broad-based, with biotech likely having the highest level of performance."" The fund's expense ratio is 0.77%.Prudential Jennison Health Sciences (PHLAX), with a 15.8% return over the past 10 years, has been closed to new investors since the end of June 2012. The fund has total net assets of $2.6 billion and an expense ratio of 1.1%.

The biggest holdings in the 98-stock portfolio included Celgene, BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Shire (SHPG) and Allergan.""We remain focused on the longer-term outlook of our fund, which we believe continues to be very positive based on a range of industry trends, from health care reform to the advent of oncology active immune therapy,"" the managers said in their Jan. 31 fund commentary. ""Although the realization of these companies’ values may encounter intermittent setbacks, we believe the market will recognize and reward them over the longer term.""Franklin Biotechnology Discovery (FBDIX), with $1.1 billion in total net assets as of Feb. 29, has a 10-year return of 15%. Biotech stocks made up 84% of the portfolio, followed by 13% in pharmaceuticals and nearly 3% in life sciences tools and services.""We focus on biotechnology and generally have limited exposure to other areas in health care,"" Evan McCulloch, senior vice president and lead portfolio manager of the fund, said. ""We avoid more traditional large-cap pharmaceuticals companies, which have less favorable growth prospects and do not show the same levels of innovation we see in biotechnology.""Celgene, Gilead Sciences, Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals were among top positions in the 119-stock fund. The fund, which closed to new investors in July 2014, has an expense ratio of 1%.""Overall, we believe there are strong fundamentals underlying the biotechnology sector's recent growth which have also helped our fund,"" McCulloch said. ""Innovation remains very strong, with promising new treatments in areas like immuno-oncology, gene therapy, Alzheimer's disease, GI (gastrointestinal) disorders, central nervous system diseases and others.""Rydex Biotechnology (RYOAX) rounds out the top-five sector funds with a 10-year return of 14.7%.

283,PG,"What do Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) have in common, aside from the fact that they're megacap U.S. companies?All three were in billionaire stock guru Warren Buffett's top 10 holdings as of Dec. 31. They also make IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, which highlights companies with steady profit growth and dividends.Coca-Cola, No. 3 in Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKA) portfolio, has slipped back into a flat base after briefly clearing a 44.01 buy point last week. The Coke maker doesn't show up on Dividend Leaders in Tuesday's IBD, since the list is truncated due to space limitations. It pays an annualized yield of 3.2%, above the 2.25% average payout of the S&P 500.Procter & Gamble, No. 7, is near an 83.10 buy point of a long cup with handle. The Tide and Pampers maker pays a 3.3% annualized dividend. No. 9, Wal-Mart -- which offers a 3% yield -- is 20% off its high and isn't near an entry.Two other stocks that are smaller Berkshire Hathaway positions also make the Dividend Leaders. AT&T (T), with a 5.2% annual dividend, tops the IBD screen. The telecom services giant was added to IBD's Leaderboard in early February as a defensive play and has held up well. Shares are up 8.7% so far this year. They're still in buy range from a 36.55 entry.AT&T has a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 2 on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable).

That's over half of U.S. food and beverage expenditures. Specifically, food based on convenience is seen as a market growth opportunity. Snack bars, yogurt, individually packaged cereal, all play into the space.Another area of growth mentioned at the conference was the natural and organic category.The acquisition of Annie's has helped in this regard, and the company announced three new cereals from the organic brand.Procter & Gamble (PG) is a stalwart of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, with a current dividend yield of 3.2%. The stock is approaching a buy point of 83.10 from a year-long cup with handle.The consumer-goods giant has a market capitalization above $200 billion but does have some issues with growth.Three-year earnings growth for the company has been flat, and estimates for the 2016 fiscal year show a decline in profits. Revenue has seen declines for the past seven quarters.Waste Management (WM) is still in buy range from a cup with handle with a 55.38 buy point.

286,PG,"Closing high-quality deals and maintaining big accounts are tough, and too often companies rely solely on the sales geniuses of individuals and departments.So notes Tim Sanders, author of “Dealstorming: The Secret Weapon That Can Solve Your Toughest Sales Challenges.” He’s also the former Yahoo (YHOO) chief solutions officer.He says research on top-performing companies proves that sales know-how “is a team sport, involving players from across the enterprise.” Also, his Dealstorming concepts “have led to a stunning 70% close ratio for multimillion-dollar deals” in over 100 cases in which he’s been personally involved.Tips on going wide and long to maximize sales:Live for collaboration. When faced with a sales challenge, “you’ll triple your chances of success by asking your operations, marketing and finance teams for help,” Sanders told IBD. By harnessing that collective brainpower, top companies outsell their competitors by 20% or more. Spread the wealth too at review and bonus time, for the contributions of these nonsales personnel. Turn them loose. It’s been Sanders’ experience that involving the CEO or another top company officer slows the sales initiative planning process and inhibits individual creativity.Junior attendees in meetings are reluctant to speak up or they gravitate to the ideas of the seniors executives, “even if the assumptions behind them are flawed,” he said. “In 75% of cases, the breakthrough idea came from a nonexecutive who was closer to the problem or was free from the constraints of executive or sales process. Make C-suite escalation a last resort, not the first response.”Embrace strategic planning. Sales meetings shouldn’t be 50% information dumps, then discussion. Sanders recommends leaders distribute a “deal brief” to the team at least two days prior to any meeting. It contains a statement of the problem, the opportunity at hand, an influence map, activities to date and premeeting assignments.This process harnesses “the power of incubation, where ideas bump into each other during downtime, sleep or passive activities,” he said. “When meeting attendees show up, often they come with ideas in hand. This leads to a much more efficient use of meeting time. The most innovative companies in the world from IDEO to Procter & Gamble (PG) live by this.”Illuminate. When dealing with prospects, ask them to identify major issues, says James Nielsen, CEO of Sales Bootcamp, which teaches the professional sales process to college graduates and new hires.“If your prospect doesn’t have an urgent problem to solve, you’re going to have a tough time convincing them to evaluate, purchase and implement your solution,” he points out.Provide real answers. Prospects need numbers and proof points to support your argument that you can solve their problem and that you can solve it better than anyone else, Nielsen says.Generate leads. Companies should build a sales development team that focuses exclusively on prospecting into new accounts, Nielsen advises. Create a target account list based on a specific niche your company is focused on.“Try to understand their business the best you can before picking up the phone,” he said. Further, personalize your prospecting emails and voicemail. “Something in that email should be very specific to them or their business.”He adds that Salesforce.com (CRM), which offers customer relation management products, has generated an additional $100 million in revenue by adding an outbound sales development department.Be persistent. One email isn't going to cut it, Nielsen says. Utilize Twitter (TWTR) and LinkedIn (LNKD) when applicable.Broaden hiring criteria. Many top producers fail to replicate their success in their next job because they are dependent on previous systems and products for it.“To build a collaborative sales culture, ask candidates about how they solved big sales challenges or landed big accounts,” Sanders said. “A key question is to ask, 'What nonsales projects have you volunteered for, and what was your role?’ This reveals the intrarelationship builder who creates the future.”Image provided by Shutterstock.

287,PG,"Shares of Procter & Gamble (PG) climbed 2.6% in the stock market today after organic sales and margins at the consumer products conglomerate rose in the second quarter, with the company forecasting further growth in the second half of the year.The company's organic sales -- a key metric that factors out currency swings, divestitures and acquisitions -- rose 2% during the quarter, aided in part by product price increases.In the prior quarter, organic sales fell 1%, a drop the company said would be followed by stronger growth in Q2. On its earnings call Tuesday, P&G reaffirmed that forecast, saying that organic sales would continue to pick up steam in the second half of the year.Earnings per share rose 9% from a year earlier to $1.04, above estimates for 98 cents. Net sales slid 9% to $16.9 billion, just missing forecasts for $16.940 billion, as P&G was hurt by weaker currencies in Russia, Brazil and Mexico, among others. While organic sales also suffered in Russia and China, the company said it expected performance in China to be stronger in the second half of the year.The results come after the company has struggled with the strong dollar and tried to rid itself of underperforming brands. P&G said it expected the strong dollar to weigh on full-year profits.Low oil prices have ravaged some world economies, but P&G saves money on packaging and ingredient costs when prices are lower.Gross margin rose 170 basis points during the quarter, while selling, general and administrative expenses fell 180 basis points.Organic sales grew in four of the company's five segments, helped by powered toothbrushes, SK-II skin care, shaving company Braun and a favorable pricing environment. Organic sales were unchanged in P&G's baby, feminine and family care segment, where gains in Pampers in North America were mitigated by declines elsewhere, the company said.During the call, P&G said it would boost spending on Luvs diapers after a rival cut prices.

Work is where big ideas happen, or so we hope.""Beyond Measure"" author Margaret Heffernan encourages incremental steps toward an inspirational culture. ""Small changes — listening, asking questions, sharing information — alter beyond measure the ideas, insights and connections those systems are capable of producing,"" she told IBD.Heffernan's first order: Think.""If we let it, our mind will wander beyond cliche, jargon, second-guessing,"" she said. Embrace stillness. Go to a meeting and say nothing. Just listen.Intuit (INTU) founder Scott Cook tunes in for surprises — comments that contradict or challenge his assumptions.As Ford Motor's (F) manager of global trends, Sheryl Connelly writes down anything with which she disagrees. Later she delves into that notebook for details ""she hadn't appreciated in the heat of the moment,"" Heffernan said. Probe. Murky ideas are easy to dismiss. Pixar President Ed Catmull told Heffernan most of the Disney (DIS) animation studio's blockbusters seem, initially, like clunkers. To ferret out winners, Pixar execs explore them all. ""The first glimmer of an idea or observation is like gold dust — highly cherished but hard to spot and not immediately valuable,"" said Heffernan. Reserve time. When Harvard University professor Leslie Perlow studied a software company, she noticed how engineers struggled to juggle routine meetings with time for creative work.Her proposal: Make 8 a.m. to noon three days a week quiet hours, during which no meetings or interruptions are allowed.Productivity soared — and workers became more respectful of others' time and were mindful to avoid unnecessary disruptions. Express. Every culture has reasons people avoid speaking up.Many cultures favor conformity.In Singapore, saving face is a priority. ""I've concluded that conflict aversion and a desire to please are universal, eviscerating our energy, initiative and our courage,"" Heffernan wrote. Invite dissent. Executives might assume reaching a consensus means everyone's communicating. The opposite is occurring.""Unanimity is always a sign that participation isn't wholehearted,"" Heffernan said.Make sure everyone's contributing thoughts, rather than staying mute to go with the group. Explore the fray. Instead of avoiding clashes at work, see those disagreements through — and pay attention to what lies under the surface of strife. ""Buried under the dragon's foot is always a gem — something to be learned from conflict,"" Heffernan said. Tune into discord.  Everyone doesn't have to get along to advance. ""Grumpy orchestras tend to play better and happiness is the output, not the input, of their work together,"" Heffernan said. Tap outside thoughts.  It's easy to think the office is where serious thinking happens, and what happens at home is trivial in comparison. ""This is a profound error,"" Heffernan said.A Procter & Gamble (PG) product manager told Heffernan a part-time worker became essential to the team by bringing the perspective of a typical consumer. Break away. Clear head space is essential. ""Volkswagen (VLKAY) turns off email outside of office hours,"" Heffernan said.

Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

"
352,PG,"The ETF holds 99 high-yielding stocks while tending to winnow out distressed companies.
"
353,PG,"It does that by requiring stock holdings to have 10 straight years of dividend payments and to rate highly on corporate fundamentals such as return on equity and cash-flow-to-debt ratio.
"

""A further tilt toward quality results from the fund's use of market-cap weighting, which favors large-cap companies rather than more volatile but high-yielding mid-cap companies.""
"

356,PG,"SCHD has an 0.07% expense ratio, or $7 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested.

In addition, China's central bank made a number of significant moves, cutting target interest rates by 0.25 percentage point, trimming banks' reserve ratio requirements and eliminating the deposit-rate ceiling.In China, the Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index each rose 1.3%. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo popped 2.1%. Europe's markets were knocking out solid gains near midday, with the DAX in Frankfurt up 2%, the CAC-40 in Paris showing a 1.9% gain and London's FTSE 100 ahead 1%.Many names were in motion ahead of Friday's open after reporting quarterly results. American Airlines (AAL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Shire (SHPG) each rose 4%. Whirlpool (WHR) rose 4% and Procter & Gamble (PG) added 2%. VF (VFC) slipped 3%.The morning's big moves came from tech.Alphabet (GOOGL), Google's parent company, spelled out an 11% premarket gain after stomping analyst consensus expectations late Thursday. A 16% EPS gain, a 15% rise in revenue and a $5.1 billion share buyback initiative were all part or the third-quarter package. Paid click volume, a carefully monitored metric, jumped a better-than-expected 23%. Alphabet finished Thursday's regular session a bit less than 5% below a 713.33 buy point in a 14-week cup base.Amazon.com (AMZN) held up a 10% advance ahead of Friday's open after soaring in extended trading on Thursday. The diversified online and tech service giant's Q3 results showed a 17 cent-per-share profit vs. consensus expectations for a 10-cent loss. Revenue leapt 23%, also better than expected; the closely watched cloud service unit, although only 8% of total revenue, saw sales surge 78%. The stock ended Thursday still in buy range, less than 3% above a 549.88 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Microsoft (MSFT) also scaled up 10%, reporting late Thursday that its fiscal Q1 earnings outpaced consensus projections. A 3% EPS gain easily topped estimates. Revenue fell 7%, less than forecast. The stock closed out Thursday's session in buy range, less than 1% past a 47.64 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Among IBD 50 stocks, Facebook (FB) banged out a 3% premarket gain. The social networking heavyweight ended Thursday's session in buy range, 3% above a 96.59 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.On the downside, shoemaker Skechers (SKX) collapsed 27% after weak Q3 results. A 30% jump in earnings and a 27% revenue gain stopped far short of consensus projections. Currency issues and rising rent expense were key factors, the company said. The stock has been fighting to regain support at its 10-week moving average, within a two-month basing effort.Streaming music service Pandora (P) crumbled 31% before the open. The Oakland, Calif.-based operation reported earnings rose 11%, in line with consensus expectations. A 30% revenue increase was smaller than forecast, and management lowered Q4 revenue guidance to well below consensus views. The stock had staged a comeback rally since July, but was still deep in a 19-month consolidation at the end of trade Thursday.

412,PG,"Stock indexes were having trouble getting past the starting gate Friday afternoon. The Nasdaq gripped a 0.1% gain, while the S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones industrial average slouched 0.2%. Volume rose from the previous session's pace.E-signature and authentication products provider Vasco Data Security International (VDSI) surged 3% in volume about 50% above average. The small-cap stock first cleared a 28.27 buy point Wednesday and then dipped under the entry Thursday. Now it's back above the buy point.Vasco carries a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, but the company's five-year earnings Stability Factor is 37 on a scale that runs from a calm 0 to a wild 99. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 99 means the stock is in the top 1 percentile.Among big caps, eBay (EBAY) popped 1% in heavy volume as it made a new, 52-week high. The stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base May 29, clearing a 60.24 buy point. The cup-with-handle is a bullish pattern. Ebay was No. 19 in Tuesday's Big Cap 20, a computer-generated list of the best big caps by fundamentals and technicals.Other top price performers Friday afternoon included the super-regional banks. Several stocks in the group were threatening to cross buy points, including SunTrust Banks (STI), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and BB&T (BBT). The fundamentals of the super regional banks, however, are spotty.Follow Paul Whitfield on Twitter: @IBD_PWhitfield.

424,PG,"ETFs that track the iconic S&P 500 index can produce very different results. They may approach that benchmark's investment universe from distinct angles. Most give investors plain-vanilla broad exposure to the U.S. stock market.
"
425,PG,"Others offer less volatility than a traditional stock portfolio. Or they overweight stocks that outperform in certain market conditions.
"
426,PG,"These three S&P 500 exchange traded funds exemplify those differences:
"
427,PG,"For most ETF investors, the mighty $174.28 billion SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) represents both the broad market and the benchmark against which they compare the performance of other investments. SPY has a simple goal — diversified, efficient exposure to roughly 500 U.S. large-cap and some midcap stocks.
"
428,PG,"A market-cap-weighted ETF, it gives a bigger weighting to larger stocks. Big price changes in these holdings can have a dramatic impact on the value of a cap-weighted ETF.
"
429,PG,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are its top three holdings, weighing in at about 4% for Apple and 2% for the other two. More recent additions include IBD Leaderboard stocks Mallinckrodt (MNK), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).
"
430,PG,"SPY has a 0.09% expense ratio, or $9 in fees for every $10,000 invested. It's up 3% in 2015 and produced an average annual gain of 20.4% in the past three years.
"
431,PG,"The $11.41 billion Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP) owns all the stocks in the S&P 500, but gives greater weight to smaller stocks. A smart beta ETF, it follows an equal-weighted index. This method gives each stock more or less the same portfolio weighting. Apple, with a market cap of $742.5 billion, gets a 0.2% stake in RSP. So does IBD 50 stock United Health Services (UHS), whose market cap is $12.6 billion.
"
432,PG,"In SPY, United Health has a 0.06% weight.
"
433,PG,"RSP has a 0.4% expense ratio. It has gained 2% year to date and averaged an annual 22.5% advance in the past three years.
"
434,PG,"Its returns also beat SPY's in the past five- and 10-year periods. Its stock market gains were helped in part by the skew towards smaller stocks in the underlying index. These companies tend to outperform when the market's in a strong uptrend.
"
435,PG,"PowerShares S&P Low Volatility (SPLV) is also a smart beta ETF. It selects the 100 S&P 500 stocks with the lowest volatility and gives bigger weightings to those that are less volatile. But those differences are relatively small.
"
436,PG,"Stericycle (SRCL), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Allstate (ALL) are its top three holdings. They get a 1.2% portfolio weighting. The stocks with the smallest weightings get 0.9%.
"
437,PG,"SPLV has a 0.25% expense ratio. Low volatility ETFs can lag in bull markets. SPLV has fallen 1.4% in 2015 and gained an average 15.3% in the past three years.
"
438,PG,"But this low-vol ETF should hold up better than its S&P 500 peers if the market trends down and in the long term, experts say. It does not have a five-year return history.

441,PG,"The major market indexes held modest gains Monday ahead of a federal tax reform vote later this week, as General Electric (GE) weighed on blue chips.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) was up 0.2%, while SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) were up 0.1% each. Foreign stocks lagged with iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA) fell 0.5%.General Electric weighed on the Dow with an 8% drop after the diversified giant offered weak profit guidance and slashed its dividend by half. But Procter & Gamble (PG), McDonald's (MCD) and Home Depot (HD) added about 1% each.Banks, utilities and metals miners led the upside among sector funds in the stock market today. SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) rose more than 1% apiece as they traded near their 50-day moving average lines.SPDR Utilities (XLU) added 1%, clearing a 56 flat-base buy point. Shares advanced 2% from a mid-August breakout from a flat base to the start of the most recent pattern.SPDR Consumer Staples (XLP), which holds P&G and Wal-Mart, gained 0.5%. It retook its 50-day line on Friday and is 4% below its 52-week high as it works on the right side of a five-month flat base.Energy, retail and biotech underperformed.If you like dividends, here are several funds to check out, including one that owns big yielders like AT&T (T) and IBM (IBM).The top two dividend exchange traded fund performers this year are focused outside the U.S. WisdomTree Europe SmallCap Dividend (DFE) led with a 28.9% year-to-date gain through Nov. 8, followed by WisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend's (DFJ) 28.1% return. Both funds have outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin.The rest of the list is predominantly composed of U.S. ETFs. Two other foreign plays made the 13-fund cut: SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend (EDIV) and SPDR S&P International Dividend (DWX), with respective YTD returns of 18.1% and 15.8%.The No. 3 spot was claimed by WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW), which was up 21% through Nov. 8. IShares Core Dividend Growth (DGRO) was fifth with a 17.7% gain.IBD'S TAKE: On the lookout for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.Most of these dividend funds are extended from a buy point. But SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), the last name on the list, is pulling back toward its 50-day moving average. If it finds support there and stages a solid rebound off the line, that would set up a potential buy area.Shares advanced 3% from a late September breakout to its Oct. 24 intraday high. Or, taken from its last touch of the 50-day line in early September, SDY rose more than 5%.While the fund's 9.8% YTD gain lags the S&P 500 index, its three-year average annual return of 10.2% is in line with the broader index's 10.8%. SDY offers a higher annualized yield of 2.4% vs. the S&P 500's average 1.9% payout.Consumer staples accounted for SDY's biggest sector weighting as of Nov. 8 at nearly 16% of assets. Industrials made up 15%, financials 14%, and utilities and consumer discretionary, 11% each. Top holdings included Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (SKT), AT&T and IBM. Those three stocks yield annualized dividends of 6%, 5.9% and 4%, respectively.The 12-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, has amassed $16 billion in assets. Its expense ratio is 0.35%. The index is designed to measure the performance of companies in the S&P 1500 that have consistently increased dividends every year for at least 20 years.Thursday's pick, ProShares Ultra Russell 2000 (UWM), is still testing support at its 50-day line.RELATED:These 3 Sectors Buck Sell-Off; High-Octane Play Near Buy Point?

Yesterday morning - Draghi 'hinted' (wink, wink) that he was prepared once again to 'do more to boost…
"
480,PG,"Ok...so what happened last night? All that hype about the China macro data kept everyone on edge over the weekend...what would they report? Would it be a disaster? What would that say about the health of the Chinese economy and then by default the global economy? In the end - it was NOT a blockbuster, in fact it was rather boring really....
"
481,PG,"At 10:00 pm est - China released a bunch of data - and it was mixed.....no disasters but no upside surprises either.........3rd Qtr GDP came in above expectations at 6.9% (exp was for 6.8%), Industrial Production did rise 5.7%, but that was below the exp of 6%. Fixed Asset Investments (FAI) - a key reading - came in at 10.3% - below the expectation of 10.8% and Retail Sales - that beat at 10.9% vs. the exp of 10.8%... So what does it all mean? Well - to start with - the data implies that the world is not ending and that the Chinese economy appears to be stabilizing - which in the end is a positive.
"
482,PG,"Angus Nicholson - Market Analyst at IG sums it up like this:
"
483,PG,"""It's hard to be overly optimistic about the headline number, especially given the range of other data released today. Nonetheless, markets have clearly been buoyed by the better than expected headline number, and it shows that China's economy has not deteriorated as much as some had thought""
"
484,PG,"James Laurenceson - Deputy Director of the Australia-China Relations Institute added that:
"
485,PG,"""The data show a rebalancing away from growth driven by investment and secondary sector production towards consumption and the services sector. It's time we accept that Chinese growth isn't solely at the mercy of industrial production and fixed asset investment""
"
486,PG,"So maybe, just maybe this is the 'new normal' for China. Maybe the world will see a China growing at a 6 handle and that's ok. Analysts are already looking out to the 4th qtr and suspect that by year end China will achieve annual growth of 6.8% -7% on continued fiscal and monetary support.
"
487,PG,"Global markets are not panicking with on these reports. In fact - there appears to be a little bit of 'risk on' as the investors/traders are relieved that the data was NOT as bad as analysts had prepared us for. Asian markets essentially ended flat. Japan - the worst performer - ended the day -0.88%, Hong Kong + 0.04%, China + 0.14% and ASX +0.03%.
"
488,PG,"European markets are also higher - discounting the China data and refocusing on earnings. FTSE flat, CAC 40 +0.32%, DAX + 0.86%, EUROSTOXX + 0.53%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY + 0.61%.
"
489,PG,"France's Danone Group up 2.5% beat estimates, Germany's Deutsche Bank +3.1%, announces a big management shakeup and restructuring plan - heads to roll and that is helping to send other financials higher. German retailer Metro - announces a rise in sales and is talking all bullish about the coming Christmas season sending this stock up by 3.7%. Air France- KLM announces job CUTS in 2016 and investors love it - sending that stock higher.... and not to be left in the dark - Italian carmaker Ferrari is getting ready to price its IPO tomorrow and will start trading on the NYSE on Thursday.
"
490,PG,"This morning US futures are off 1 pt.....Now prior to the China report - US futures were pointing lower on the expectation that we were gonna get hit hard....and when that did not happen - Futures moved to the plus side and are now flat. I suspect that the market will test resistance at 2040 and then back off trying to find support in the 2025 range - if not, then definitely the 1980 range.
"
491,PG,"As much as there is plenty of US macro data this week - the focus will now return to US corp earnings. This week and next week will see hundreds of reports for investors to chew on. Earnings to include: HAS, MS, HAL, GPC, IBM, ZION, AXP, BA, KO, MCD, MSFT, and PG to name just a few.
"
492,PG,"NOTE: Fed's Lacker is due to speak today at 12 pm.
"
493,PG,"Up til now - earnings have been, well, not so good. Not horrible, but not great. 70% are beating the estimates while only 48% of those are beating on top line revenue growth. Despite the economic weakness and a bunch of downgrades - stocks have not done so badly.....with the DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all closing close to 2 month highs.... All of these indexes have now pierced their down trending 50 dma's and are now challenging their intermediate term resistance - or 100 dma's. Now here we may hit some trouble - but I think that is just a matter of time....unless earnings completely implode - then I suspect that we will test resistance one or two more times before 'breaking out' and challenging the longer term resistance levels defined by their 200 dma's. And as is usual - as we move thru the 4th qtr - FOMO (fear of missing out) will help to lift stocks going into year end.
"
494,PG,"Now on the other hand - small caps are lagging...... The most recent lows for small caps came early October and it was much lower than the August 24th sell-off lows. The most recent highs were just two weeks ago and those highs were lower than the highs set in mid-September. - suggesting that a bearish downtrend (lower lows and lower highs) remains intact from a small cap perspective. And why would this be so?
"
495,PG,"Well - it is earnings season, and it is more common for the large cap/mid cap companies to be able to borrow money to buy back shares which will serve to 'doll up"" their earnings per share. (Small cap companies are not nearly as active buying back stock to create the illusion of better earnings and so you have the disconnect.) Or it could be that small caps are more risky and at a time of global nervousness - investors may want the security of large cap, liquid, dividend paying names....It's just a thought.....
"
496,PG,"The fact that small caps continue to lag might suggest that the selling pressure is not over yet....but until we get thru earnings season the divergence will continue. Then it will be Thanksgiving, and the debt debacle in DC, and then the FED December decision.... so there is plenty ahead to keep investors on their toes the question is: Does the market have enough strength to support another ""Santa Clause"" rally into the end of the year?

WisdomTree Europe SmallCap Dividend (DFE) has risen 14.6% so far…
"
510,PG,"Tell the truth with your employees and customers, even if the news is bad. The gains over the long run far outweigh any short-term pain, as Bob Carr, CEO of Princeton, N.J.-based Heartland Payment Systems (HPY), has learned.
"
511,PG," Live up to values. Carr, who wrote the book ""Through the Fires,"" dealt with his biggest crisis in 2009. A massive security breach compromised credit- and debit-card numbers for millions of transactions that Heartland processed.
"
512,PG,"Lawyers told Carr to say nothing beyond that a breach occurred.
"
513,PG,"""I couldn't figure out how to do that and still communicate honestly with our employees,"" Carr told IBD. ""I couldn't play rope-a-dope.""
"
514,PG,"He opened up to employees, customers and the market. The stock sank, but Heartland worked to strengthen security. The firm was upfront with information and drew plaudits from customers. Employees rallied around the company. It lost just 2% of its clients, quickly returned to Visa's (V) preferred list and the stock rebounded.
"
515,PG," Eye the long term. People can get away with deceptive business practices and shady dealings for a while. But eventually customers won't come back once they realize they've been duped. Employees will leave because they don't want to be part of the untruths. ""It catches up to you eventually,"" Carr said.
"
516,PG," Stick to your guns. A Procter & Gamble (PG) subcontractor went dumpster-diving at rival Unilever's (UN) hair care headquarters in 2001 to steal that company's trade secrets. When P&G CEO John Pepper found out about it, he quickly told Unilever, fired the subcontractors, paid a settlement and made sure his company never used the information. He simply stuck to P&G's principles that he had lived by throughout his career. ""That culture is a strong part of who they are,"" said Paul Fiorelli, co-director of the Cintas Institute for Business Ethics at Xavier University.
"
517,PG," Set the tone. The CEO needs to show he lives by the firm's principles at all times. He can't make exceptions for himself by cheating on expense reports. Other leaders also need to live up to the principles.
"
518,PG,"""If I'm not at the top, I take my cues from the boss, and maybe my boss' boss,"" Fiorelli said. ""It's tone at the top, mood in the middle and buzz at the bottom.""
"
519,PG," Stick to the basics. Carr learned from a young age the importance of doing the right thing. He especially took after his honest mother. ""Things were black and white growing up,"" he said. ""I saw that there are proper and ethical behaviors, and those that are not. It never occurred to me that I would treat people any way other than how I wanted to be treated.""
"
520,PG," Take bad with good. When foul news arises, leaders need to be willing to hear about it and address it without blowing up. Otherwise, people won't report the bad.
"
521,PG,"Promote hotlines and a reporting process to encourage people to let on about the bad stuff. ""If you want openness and candor, you have to accept that people will be open and candid,"" Fiorelli said.
"
522,PG," Be vigilant. Carr has gone on a crusade to clean up peer firms that act unethically. Hidden charges and processing bank transactions out of order to maximize fees were the norm. He has sued other companies. ""The industry has paid attention,"" he said. ""They realize, 'If Carr is going after them, he might come after us next.'""
"
523,PG," Stay consistent. Get rid of people who don't live by the principles. Make no exceptions, even if they're strong producers. ""If you allow that, you're saying that making the numbers is all that counts,"" Fiorelli said. ""Don't let high performers get away with things.""Tell the truth with your employees and customers, even if the news is bad.

He especially took after his honest mother. ""Things were black and white growing up,"" he said. ""I saw that there are proper and ethical behaviors, and those that are not. It never occurred to me that I would treat people any way other than how I wanted to be treated."" Take bad with good. When foul news arises, leaders need to be willing to hear about it and address it without blowing up. Otherwise, people won't report the bad.Promote hotlines and a reporting process to encourage people to let on about the bad stuff. ""If you want openness and candor, you have to accept that people will be open and candid,"" Fiorelli said. Be vigilant. Carr has gone on a crusade to clean up peer firms that act unethically. Hidden charges and processing bank transactions out of order to maximize fees were the norm. He has sued other companies. ""The industry has paid attention,"" he said. ""They realize, 'If Carr is going after them, he might come after us next.'"" Stay consistent. Get rid of people who don't live by the principles. Make no exceptions, even if they're strong producers. ""If you allow that, you're saying that making the numbers is all that counts,"" Fiorelli said. ""Don't let high performers get away with things.""

559,PG,"Ron Weisner is used to having demanding clients.After all, he's a music manager.From the 1960s through the 1990s, he traveled the world with the likes of Michael Jackson (""obsessive perfectionist""), Paul McCartney (""zero ego"") and Madonna (""never grateful"").""The music business isn't normal on a good day,"" Weisner, author of ""Listen Out Loud,"" told IBD. ""Managing artists is like owning a chain of 7-Elevens — you're on call all the time and have to be there for one emergency after another. But I was fortunate in having clients who made timeless music.""He got out of artist management 15 years ago. Now he organizes arena concerts for corporations featuring top artists such as Beyonce and the Eagles. He also produces specials for BET, MTV and VH1.Grow With The BeatWeisner, 69, grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, N.Y., where during the summer everyone played music with the windows open, mixing Elvis with Jamaican calypso, Motown and the Four Tops.In his teens, he would sneak over to the Apollo Theater in Harlem to catch concerts by the likes of Aretha Franklin and Little Stevie Wonder, and was usually the only white kid in the audience.""There's a whole generation of listeners who haven't experienced what it's like to see a tight, well-rehearsed band blow the roof off a theater, and it breaks my heart that today it's considered a successful show when the prerecorded vocal track to which the singer is lip-synching doesn't crap out in the middle of a song,"" Weisner wrote.In 1966 he got a job in the mailroom at MGM Records. He spent loads of time in the office of Harold Berkman, head of promotions, listening to how he pitched stations for new releases. Berkman decided to make Weisner his assistant.Weisner saw how singers did interviews with the press and noted that MGM's units worked closely together (""there were no divas"").After a year with Berkman, Weisner shifted to marketing in the Verve label, where he learned about distribution, production quality control and the label's artist and repertoire segment, which was signing new acts like Richie Havens, Janis Ian and the Velvet Underground.In 1969, Weisner followed two colleagues from MGM to Buddah Records (later renamed Buddha).""We knew that to survive, we'd have to outhustle and outthink the major labels, but we thought we could develop a reputation for being more artist friendly,"" he said.One of Buddah's most important clients was Curtis Mayfield, who had composed many of the anthems of the civil rights movement.""One of the great wordsmiths of our era,"" said Weisner.Mayfield and two other Buddah performers, Gladys Knight and Sha Na Na, became Weisner's first management clients.""What I wanted to do was to nurture the best talent, helping them put on brilliant live shows and build a following over the long run,"" said Weisner, who moved his management business to Los Angeles in 1972.""The first thing that grabbed me about Ron is how much he loved music,"" wrote Knight in the foreword to Weisner's memoir. ""When I asked him to be my manager, he said, 'I'll do what I can.' He didn't talk a big game like some managers do. The passion and loyalty he has for his artists, his business associates and his friends are unmatched.""Sha Na Na was a dozen guys who put on 250 shows a year, but each had a different idea of what the band should be doing.Weisner had to constantly intervene in their arguments while making their 1950s doo-wop style famous with their appearance in the 1978 movie ""Grease.""He also signed a syndication deal for a TV variety series for them, but it needed a sponsor. Weisner approached some Procter & Gamble (PG) executives, but they were skeptical about the group's appeal.Weisner came up with a flashy idea. He arranged for them to fly to New York so the P&G suits could see Sha Na Na perform, then called a billboard company. As the execs were driven up Sixth Avenue, the electronic billboards flashed pictures of the performers.P&G signed, and the show ran for four seasons.In 1977, Weisner got a call from a friend who said a group of brothers called the Jackson 5 needed help. They had left Motown for Epic Records, and their career had stalled because their light pop style had lost its appeal.The problem was that their dad and manager, Joe Jackson, didn't care what they sang, as long as he could squeeze every dollar out of the deal. They were petrified of him.""I knew I was walking into a minefield and became their manager anyway,"" Weisner said. ""Joe and I had constant fights, and my only real concern was that I could keep these away from Michael, who could make magic when he was in the studio.""Feet On The GroundWeisner found Michael to be a serious student of entertainment who had studied how Fred Astaire, Charlie Chaplin and James Brown danced and moved.""His energy level was off the charts, unmatched by anyone I've seen before or since,"" Weisner said. ""He wanted to be the best, then go beyond that.""Against the wishes of Epic, which thought Quincy Jones was too old to produce a record for what they thought was Michael's preteen audience, Weisner arranged for him to handle Jackson's solo record ""Off the Wall.""The process proved worth it.After it was released in 1979, ""Off the Wall"" sold 20 million copies — compared with the 1.3 million the label had expected.Jackson's next album, ""Thriller,"" was the ultimate smash after coming out in 1982. It sold 110 million copies, the greatest number ever.Michael had been calling Weisner 20 times a day when suddenly he stopped in 1984, after Joe Jackson reasserted his control over his son's careers.Downs And UpsBy then, Weisner had brought on a partner, Freddy DeMann, but by 1985 they had different visions for the business and decided to divvy up the clients.One of those clients was Madonna, and Weisner happily let DeMann have her.The singer had topped the charts the year before, but her demeanor wasn't for Weisner.""Sure I want to help my family have the good life, but I also want me to have a good life, and if Madonna were part of it, no amount of money was worth the headache,"" Weisner wrote.Paul McCartney sparked the opposite experience.""He was, without fail, a joy to work with — professional, energized and punctual,"" Weisner wrote. ""From him I learned that you must persevere not only when things are at their worst, but also when they're at their best. I learned that it's possible to balance your show business with your personal life and remain at the top of your game in both. I learned that entertainment is a noble profession.""Larry Schweikart, director of the independent film ""Rockin' the Wall,"" said: ""In interviewing musicians for our documentary on how rock music helped bring down the Iron Curtain, I learned that almost all of them had a very difficult time finding a manager they could trust. Ron Weisner was known for having built his success on being absolutely honest and always putting the client's benefit before his own. That's a lesson that can be applied to any profession.""

584,PG,"Increase the bottom line by making cuts in departments where you spend the most money. So suggests Matthew Figgie, author of ""Maximizing Profits Immediately"" and chairman of Clark-Reliance, which makes liquid gauges for the oil and gas industry.""Expensive software or consultants are not necessary,"" he told IBD. ""Just an understanding and implementation of a few foundational profit improvement techniques"" can make a big difference.Tips on how best to profit: Analyze. Identify which years your firm performed best in a variety of spending categories. Next, check how profit would rise if those numbers were garnered in the same 12-month period. ""You'll be amazed at the yearly profit that is attainable,"" Figgie said. Look beyond growth. A 5% reduction in costs will more than double pretax profit, says Figgie. Buy intelligently. Purchase, don't expedite, is Figgie's point.Your purchasing department should avoid single-sourced items. Make sure that unit has the independence to be creative when negotiating with competing suppliers. Charge properly. Companies work hard to cut costs in a product's design, parts and manufacturing, then give away all their savings through poor pricing strategies.Say you manufacture a part for $10 and sell it wholesale for $20. After using profit improvement techniques, you reduce costs to $9 and use the same markup to sell the product for $18.""You are giving away $2 for every dollar you save,"" said Figgie.He adds that thousands of small and midsize U.S. firms are profitable while competing with international competition — and don't always have to underprice ""as long as they are providing their customers with a superior product."" Compensate. Start thinking you can boost profit if you treat all of your stakeholders as partners. That's the view of Philip Kotler, who has studied under three Nobel laureate economists and authored ""Confronting Capitalism.""""Winning companies see their employees, suppliers and distributors as a working team,"" he said. ""All of them must feel fairly rewarded."" The payoff is ""stakeholder-oriented companies often earn greater profits than shareholder-only rewarded companies."" Boost fitness. Knowing that medical costs rise 20% per year, Jim Miller, CEO of tech platform Krowdfit, financially rewards members for healthy living.""What other single cost in running your business is going up at 20% per year that you have the direct ability to influence by simply deploying an accountable wellness incentive program?"" he said. ""There is no better way to improve profits, individual performance and reduce costs than to improve the health of your employees."" Market accordingly. Spend money to make money to increase profit through consumer awareness. Glean insights from analytics and digital marketing.Kotler recommends putting 10% of your promotion budget in blogging and social media presentations on such sites as Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Google (GOOGL)-owned YouTube. If you get good results, add another 10%. He adds that Procter & Gamble (PG) spends 25% to 35% of its promotion budget on digital marketing. Know the consumer. ""Many companies offer similar products and deals,"" Kotler said. ""You must not only match your competitors, but do one better. There are many coffee shops, but only one Starbucks (SBUX). Starbucks not only sells good coffee, but positions itself as a third home for its customers. Your job is to create a better life for your customers.""

617,PG,"William Procter, who with fellow immigrant James Gamble founded the consumer product giant Procter & Gamble in 1837, always took the long view.One of the strengths of P&G (PG) over the past two centuries has been long-range planning, a trait inherited from its earliest days.A reason for Procter's stress on the future may well have been that his early days were daunting.Procter (1801-84) started out with plenty of hardship that he overcame, says Ed Rider, retired head of P&G's corporate archives.Born in Herefordshire in western England, Procter became a general store apprentice during his youth and learned a skill, candle-making, that helped in hard times and was the earliest growth engine at P&G.The tough times started just as Procter opened a dry goods shop in London in 1831. On Day 2 it was robbed and set on fire.Off To OhioIn debt and looking for better prospects, 31-year-old Procter and his wife, Martha, set out for the American West, where many immigrants prospered. They got as far as Cincinnati when she caught cholera and died.Thinking of her death and his debt, he took a job in a bank. But the brisk growth of his adopted city sparked his entrepreneurial flame. With his candle-making skills in demand, he left the bank and built a firm making the tallow product.Procter was an obscure tradesman in a crowd of entrepreneurs at the gateway to the American West. He knew that to prosper, he had to adapt and grow with the quickly changing scene.Cincinnati was a hub of trade in the 1830s. It prospered from river transport and livestock and other farm markets. For small shops like Procter's, it was a source of needed raw materials like fat and oil used in making candles.Procter made sure to place his factory-store near the Ohio River for easy access to supplies and movement to markets. Meanwhile, he shifted from artisan to merchant — and married again, this time to Olivia Norris, daughter of another candle maker.Before long, the Panic of 1837 sank many banks and the economy, hurting many small businesses such as Procter's. His father-in-law, Alexander Norris, wanted to see his young relatives survive the crisis. So he suggested that Procter combine his operations with those of James Gamble, a soap maker who married Olivia's sister Elizabeth in 1837.Both of the younger men used similar raw materials that came from the area's stockyards. They proceeded to scale up their operations as other businesses lost out.Procter and Gamble also put over $7,000 into the combined works to recapitalize.As the economy turned around, these funds helped the firm , which made soap and candles and related products such as household oil, grow faster than its competition. Procter & Gamble persisted as a partnership until it was incorporated in 1890.""The importance of making strategic decisions like that was recognized very early,"" Charlotte Otto, a former global relations officer at P&G and now senior corporate strategist at the public relations firm Weber Shandwick, told IBD.Later, P&G leaders often referred to that ""heritage of looking ahead at the implications of change and the dynamics of markets, and taking action early,"" she said.Procter and teammate Gamble divided the firm's functions, with sales and accounting under the former, and manufacturing connected to the latter.Procter's grasp of detail kept this process in motion and formed the base for P&G's planning. As America's industry, economy and personal income grew over the next few decades, so did demand for P&G's consumable goods.The new railroad of the 1830s opened the way for market expansion. Procter took advantage by sending his son George to New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Chicago to prospect for new customers.Up to then, P&G was making 100 to 120 boxes of soap a day, and 50 to 75 boxes of candles.Stacking 'Em UpThanks to George's long-distance work, orders flooded in for 1,000 to 2,000 boxes a day, requiring larger equipment and bigger payrolls.As America's stockyards and railroads grew with more investment for new processes and equipment, so did the P&G enterprise.P&G improved its manufacturing process and built its soap, candle and oil products into brands that customers came to know for reliability and quality.The firm started using a moon and stars logo, a form of which still exists, on its packaging in 1851 to set itself apart from commodities — and in 1859, P&G's annual sales passed $1 million (worth $30 million now) for the first time.U.S. businesses knew the Civil War was coming and foresaw disruption. Few planned as well as P&G, which in the early 1860s built a new plant in Cincinnati to deal with growth they saw coming during and after the war. But they were challenged .In 1862 the firm won a contract with the Union Army to supply soap and candles. This kept P&G's factories running amid the Civil War.Procter and Gamble faced a huge take: getting raw materials. What paid off was their top training of the next generation. Their sons James Norris Gamble and William Alexander Procter raced off to New Orleans and bought a boatload of vital pine rosin. Their rivals laughed, thinking they had overbought, but this supply lasted nearly to war's end in 1865 — while P&G dominated its markets.Cleaning UpP&G ran out of other raw materials, like stearic acid , a byproduct from slaughterhouses that was used in making soap. But the company developed a new way to synthesize the acid. This process would be adapted years later by P&G to make Crisco, the first all-vegetable shortening.When pine rosin supplies ran out near the end of the war, P&G substituted silicate of soda. Later, this became a key component of its soap and detergent.""The diversification from soap to food and edibles like Crisco was followed by the development of detergents,"" Rider said. ""And you had to have new equipment for all the nonsoap cleaning products.""P&G had to shift even more dramatically after the candle business peaked in 1867. First petroleum-based oil, then the light bulb, snuffed out the wax product.By that year, market leader P&G had a number of growing rivals, including Colgate-Palmolive.""So it became a matter of if P&G didn't do it first, someone else would have,"" said Rider.Procter lived long enough to see the first major advertising campaign for a P&G product, Ivory Soap. He was not a great believer in ads, but they gave a boost to the company's painstaking product planning and development.P&G's business philosophy endured as a family tradition until the 1970s. The two generations following Procter served as successive presidents and CEOs, and his business philosophy was conveyed by William Cooper Procter's handpicked successor, Richard Deupree, who had an office at the headquarters until 1972. Their emphasis on product quality and value, fair treatment of customers, suppliers and employees descended from the founders, Otto says.Here's the payoff for investors: In ""Eyes on Tomorrow: The Evolution of Procter & Gamble,"" Oscar Schisgall describes the original capital of publicly traded P&G as $4.5 million of stock on July 17, 1890. Since then, P&G's market cap has grown to $225 billion.The steady company's stock has risen 200% since 2000.

684,PG,"Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk is touting the electric car maker's late-Thursday-night press announcement with this tease: ""For the future to be good, we need electric transport, solar power and (of course) ... the missing piece.""Sounds like it's battery-shaped — specifically, about 3 feet tall and almost that wide — and hangs on a wall, according to one analyst's figuring.Tesla Motors (TSLA) has been working on home power storage with cousin company SolarCity (SCTY), and that Twitter (TWTR) tweet from Musk on Tuesday sets the stage for what is expected to be a big battery-related announcement — home- and utility-scale storage, for use with renewable energy sources such as solar power, but with other uses too.The company drove home that expectation Thursday in a reminder about the 8 p.m. PDT event at its Southern California design studio in Hawthorne, noting ""renewable energy storage"" as part of its business: ""Tesla Motors' goal is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable transport with a full range of increasingly affordable electric cars. California-based Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles as well as renewable energy storage.""Today Tesla will announce the missing piece to building a sustainable future,"" it said of the ""Energy Storage Event"" to be webcast live from the carmaker's website. ""Tune in to learn more about Tesla's solution to this critical step in the mission to enable zero emissions power generation.""Microgrids Heighten InterestA utility-scale battery array announcement could be a bigger deal than the expected home battery announcement. With several companies announcing ""microgrid"" products or projects last month, interest is mounting for power systems that can serve something the size of a corporate campus or a remote community. Stationary batteries can help smooth out the power flow at times when renewables are not producing (lack of wind, or lack of sun, for instance).Along with building the multibillion-dollar battery Gigafactory in Nevada, Tesla has teamed up with solar installer SolarCity, where Musk is chairman and the top shareholder, on battery-based storage for homes and businesses that have solar panel systems. That stored power can be used when the sun isn't shining.Tesla and SolarCity last month said they've teamed up to build entire tiny power grids using Tesla lithium-ion batteries. Samsung SDI also announced a strategic alliance along similar lines, with global automation technology firm ABB (ABB). And solar power company SunEdison (SUNE) made a key grid-related acquisition.About 230 California households in California, and 100 elsewhere, currently have a Tesla Stationary Battery installed in their homes, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said in a research note last week.""It is widely believed that Google (GOOGL) has a few Tesla Commercial Grade Stationary Batteries in a couple of their buildings,"" Chowdhry wrote. ""It is also believed that the new Apple (AAPL) campus will have Tesla Commercial Grade Stationary Batteries.""Chowdhry noted that one user whose battery he reviewed charges from his home solar energy system, ""and when the battery is fully charged, energy is sent to the PG&E (PCG) Grid for rebate on Electric bill.""Follow Donna Howell on Twitter: @IBD_DHowell.

And while Latin America's growth prospects aren't robust , this region — and emerging markets generally — also offers bargain stocks, he says.

747,PG,"Pumped up by a strengthening U.S. and collapsing crude oil prices and weaker economies overseas, the dollar is flexing its muscles, resulting in weaker earnings and guidance for companies with international exposure.
"
748,PG,"Procter & Gamble (PG) said Tuesday its outlook for the entire year will be clouded by foreign exchange, which the company expects to reduce annual sales by 5% and net earnings by 12%.The Cincinnati-based consumer goods giant gets two-thirds of its revenue from outside America. When the dollar is strong, U.S. exports are more expensive and overseas sales translate into fewer greenbacks. P&G shares fell 3.4% Tuesday.Pfizer (PFE) in part blamed the stronger dollar for its sullen 2015 forecast. The largest U.S. drugmaker expects full-year adjusted earnings of $2 to $2.10, or 5% less than analysts thought. It sees sales of about $45.5 billion, slightly less than Wall Street views. Its shares fell 0.6% Tuesday, less than the general market.Other drug companies also are absorbing forex hits. Basel-based Novartis (NVS) is wrestling with a strong dollar and a Swiss franc that shot up this month after its currency cap was lifted.Buoyed by increasing consumer confidence and lower gasoline prices, the U.S. economy has been outperforming the rest of the world as Europe copes with deflation, Japan and Brazil endure recessions, China grows at a slower clip and Russia's petro-economy faces cheap oil and Western sanctions over Ukraine.As a result, the dollar rose 5% vs. major trading partners in Q4, the biggest gain since Q4 2008, when the global financial crisis spurred a brief stampede into dollar-denominated assets. As of Jan. 23, that dollar index in 2015 was a whopping 10% higher than Q4's average, turbocharged by central bank easings around the world.The ruble has lost half its value against the dollar in the past year. The yen lost about 15%, the euro 18.5% and the British pound 11.7%. The Chinese yuan, loosely pegged to the dollar, flattened last year after gaining strength slowly in recent years.Some analysts see cause for optimism, especially given oil prices' dramatic fall.""There is a question of (cheaper) energy being a windfall ... for consumers worldwide and with a weakening eurozone currency, does that bode well for S&P (500) profits?"" said Robert Keiser, vice president at S&P Capital IQ. ""In theory, yes. In theory, the global macroeconomic outlook is improving.""But in reality, his theory hasn't caught up yet to many U.S. companies reliant on overseas sales.The dollar will be ""a substantial headwind for us in 2015,"" DuPont (DD) CFO Nick Fanandakis said in a Tuesday conference call. He figures that forex will take 60 cents, or 12.7%, off his profit estimate to about $4.10 per share this year. Analysts expected $4.46. Shares fell 1.3%.Like Pfizer and Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) expects foreign exchange rates to cut 2015 revenue by $800 million and EPS by 12-14 cents. Bristol guided full-year sales to $14 billion to $15 billion and EPS to $1.55 to $1.70. Shares fell 0.8% Tuesday.It's hard to measure the dollar's impact on the overall S&P 500 — whose large-cap companies tend to have heavy overseas exposure — because the handling and accounting of foreign revenue vary from firm to firm.It's easier to analyze the effect of collapsing oil prices on corporate America: Q4 S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise 3.3%, but would be up nearly 7% excluding the energy sector, said Gregory Harrison, a senior analyst at Thomson Reuters.

816,PG,"Procter & Gamble (PG) said Tuesday its outlook for the entire year will be clouded by foreign exchange, which the company expects to reduce annual sales by 5% and net earnings by 12%.The Cincinnati-based consumer goods giant gets two-thirds of its revenue from outside America. When the dollar is strong, U.S. exports are more expensive and overseas sales translate into fewer greenbacks. P&G shares fell 3.4% Tuesday.Pfizer (PFE) in part blamed the stronger dollar for its sullen 2015 forecast. The largest U.S. drugmaker expects full-year adjusted earnings of $2 to $2.10, or 5% less than analysts thought. It sees sales of about $45.5 billion, slightly less than Wall Street views. Its shares fell 0.6% Tuesday, less than the general market.Other drug companies also are absorbing forex hits. Basel-based Novartis (NVS) is wrestling with a strong dollar and a Swiss franc that shot up this month after its currency cap was lifted.Buoyed by increasing consumer confidence and lower gasoline prices, the U.S. economy has been outperforming the rest of the world as Europe copes with deflation, Japan and Brazil endure recessions, China grows at a slower clip and Russia's petro-economy faces cheap oil and Western sanctions over Ukraine.As a result, the dollar rose 5% vs. major trading partners in Q4, the biggest gain since Q4 2008, when the global financial crisis spurred a brief stampede into dollar-denominated assets. As of Jan. 23, that dollar index in 2015 was a whopping 10% higher than Q4's average, turbocharged by central bank easings around the world.The ruble has lost half its value against the dollar in the past year. The yen lost about 15%, the euro 18.5% and the British pound 11.7%. The Chinese yuan, loosely pegged to the dollar, flattened last year after gaining strength slowly in recent years.Some analysts see cause for optimism, especially given oil prices' dramatic fall.""There is a question of (cheaper) energy being a windfall ... for consumers worldwide and with a weakening eurozone currency, does that bode well for S&P (500) profits?"" said Robert Keiser, vice president at S&P Capital IQ. ""In theory, yes. In theory, the global macroeconomic outlook is improving.""But in reality, his theory hasn't caught up yet to many U.S. companies reliant on overseas sales.The dollar will be ""a substantial headwind for us in 2015,"" DuPont (DD) CFO Nick Fanandakis said in a Tuesday conference call. He figures that forex will take 60 cents, or 12.7%, off his profit estimate to about $4.10 per share this year. Analysts expected $4.46. Shares fell 1.3%.Like Pfizer and Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) expects foreign exchange rates to cut 2015 revenue by $800 million and EPS by 12-14 cents. Bristol guided full-year sales to $14 billion to $15 billion and EPS to $1.55 to $1.70. Shares fell 0.8% Tuesday.It's hard to measure the dollar's impact on the overall S&P 500 — whose large-cap companies tend to have heavy overseas exposure — because the handling and accounting of foreign revenue vary from firm to firm.It's easier to analyze the effect of collapsing oil prices on corporate America: Q4 S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise 3.3%, but would be up nearly 7% excluding the energy sector, said Gregory Harrison, a senior analyst at Thomson Reuters.

817,PG,"Demonstrating its commitment to clean renewable energy sources, Apple (AAPL) has pledged $848 million to buy power from First Solar's California Flats Solar Project in Monterey County, Calif.First Solar (FSLR) called the 25-year power purchase agreement ""the largest agreement in the industry to provide clean energy to a commercial end user.""The 2,900-acre California Flats Solar Project is located in Cholame, Calif. Construction is expected to begin in mid-2015 and be completed by the end of 2016.Apple will get 130 megawatts of alternating current from the solar plant, and the remaining 150 MW of the project will be sold to Pacific Gas & Electric under a separate long-term agreement. Between Apple and PG&E, the 280 MW project is fully subscribed, First Solar said.""Apple's commitment was instrumental in making this project possible and will significantly increase the supply of solar power in California,"" Joe Kishkill, chief commercial officer for First Solar, said in a statement. ""Over time, the renewable energy from California Flats will provide cost savings over alternative sources of energy as well as substantially lower environmental impact.""Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the deal while speaking Tuesday at the Goldman Sachs Technology & Internet Conference in San Francisco.The solar project will generate enough power for almost 60,000 California homes, Cook said: ""It's enough to provide renewable energy for all of our new campus, every other office we have in California, all 52 retail stores we have in California and our data center in Newark, (Calif.).""Apple partnered with First Solar on the project because it's right for the environment and makes sense financially, Cook said: ""We know at Apple that climate change is real. Our view is that the time for talk has passed and the time for action is now."" He called the renewable energy venture Apple's ""biggest, boldest and most ambitious project ever."" Apple already uses renewable energy sources to power all of its data centers, he said.RELATED:Apple Crushes Q1 Earnings Expectations.

818,PG,"Stocks lost their grip on most of the day's gains Thursday as the indexes headed into the final hour of trade. The Nasdaq was up 0.3%, after being up 1.5% at midday. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average held pops of 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running much slower than the previous session.Among widely held issues, AT&T (T) thrust about 2% higher in volume 55% above average. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are down about 10% and 8% respectively so far this year, AT&T has held steady with a 1% gain.AT&T's dividend might be part of the reason. In an ugly market, dividend stocks start looking good to some investors. AT&T has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years. The current annualized yield is 5.6%.The stock price, though, has been rangebound for more than two years. AT&T stock has found repeated resistance at the 36-37 area and support at the 31-32 level. The stock is trading just under 35.In the IBD 50, a list of stocks with the best ratings via fundamentals and technicals, Carter's (CRI) gained 1% in volume a third faster than normal. The marketer of clothes for babies and children is working on a stage-two base. However, the stock needs to do more work on the right side. Carter's is 17% off its high.A stage-two base means the stock is forming its second consolidation since starting an advance. Breakouts from the first two consolidations are more likely to work than those from a later stage.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, coal and oil stocks grabbed the biggest gains. Funeral Services and book stocks took the hardest hits.Follow Paul Whitfield on Twitter @IBD_PWhitfield.

"
884,PG,"When she was born, nobody in Mary McLeod Bethune's family knew their ABC's.She went on to become one of a handful of women in the world to launch a college.Not that it looked like much at first. Her desk at her original school was a tipped-over shipping box.She had five students and patrolled the local dump for supplies.She came from a place where kids weren't asked to understand much more than how to yank cotton from its spiky boll without slashing their hands. Yet Bethune always pushed for more.Eventually, she inspired all Americans to seek big dreams.""Our children must never lose their zeal for building a better world,"" she wrote in a column for Ebony magazine.""She did not dwell on any sort of deficiencies or problems,"" Robin Muhammad, chairwoman of Ohio University's Department of African American Studies, told IBD. ""She didn't wallow in it. It didn't become part of her autobiography the way she would tell it. What became part of her autobiography was how she overcame it. That was her calling card.""Bethune (1875-1955) was the founder of Daytona (Fla.) Educational & Industrial Training School for Negro Girls, later called Bethune-Cookman University.Presidential LinkAs a bipartisan political powerhouse, she also spearheaded education and social improvement alongside Presidents Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman.And for the last 15 years of her life she was vice president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.Audrey McCluskey, co-editor of ""Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World,"" referred to her as ""one of the most active national leaders in America"" during the 1930s and '40s.In 1973, Bethune was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y.""I am always building spiritual air castles,"" Bethune said. ""I am blessed with the power to visualize and to see a mental picture of what I would desire.""That took a stretch.She was born near Mayesville, S.C., to Samuel and Patsy McLeod, former slaves, the 15th of 17 children. ""She liked to dramatize her family's poverty, but as land-owning farmers the McLeods were better off than many of their black neighbors,"" McCluskey said.Still, opportunities for moving up were scarce for blacks. Even learning the basics seemed out of reach.""We did not need an education,"" Bethune later said. ""Our part was to do chores on the farm.""One day, Mary went to work with her mother, who cooked for a prominent family. That's where the girl picked up a kiddie book.She couldn't read the scribbles, but she could think. And dream. And pray. ""I will learn to read,"" she said. It became her mantra.She spoke those words often, so she was top of the mind when Emma Wilson, a teacher at nearby Trinity Presbyterian Mission School, visited the McLeod home. Would Samuel and Patsy consider signing up 7-year-old Mary for school?Samuel hesitated; they needed all hands picking cotton.But hearing how Mary yearned to read, he couldn't say no.Lesson: Make your goals public.Mary applied herself and earned scholarships. Her drive took her to Chicago's Moody Bible Institute, where she graduated in 1896.She hoped to become an African missionary. No openings kept her from that path, a rejection she would call ""the greatest disappointment of my life."" But she quickly adjusted her mindset. Teaching became a new form of mission work.When a teaching job opened at the Haines Institute, a vocational school in Augusta, Ga., she leapt — just as she did marrying Gordon Bethune, a clothing salesman with a velvety singing voice, in 1898.Bethune learned much from Lucy Laney, the founder at the Haines Institute who urged students to build on their education.Laney's lesson: Good teachers share facts and skills; great teachers show students how to be lifelong seekers of knowledge.Bethune ran with that philosophy, echoed by the educator Booker T. Washington.By 1904, with her only child, Albertus Jr., now 5 years old, Bethune felt ready to launch her own academy. She was well aware of folks moving to coastal Florida in search of railroad construction jobs — and in need of opportunities for their kids.Bethune planned to show them how to look for them.Her academy didn't look like much at the start. It was housed in a cottage beside Daytona Beach's railroad tracks. Bethune negotiated the monthly rent from $11 — worth $300 today — to $1.50.The 29-year-old signed up five elementary-aged students in her school. Each child paid 50 cents a week to attend Mama Bethune's school. ""I saw in my mind's eye the Bethune-Cookman College of today,"" she said. ""Even in that first week in 1904.""Getting It DoneBethune was thrifty. Squashed elderberries became ink. She used charred wood for chalk. Those dry-goods boxes made great desks.""I haunted the city dump and trash piles behind hotels,"" Bethune wrote.A couple of years later, she bought that dump, which was called Hell's Hole, with the plan to turn it into her college campus.Gordon Bethune left her around that time, though the couple stayed married until his death in 1918.To reach her education goals, she targeted vacationers with clout. Among them: James Gamble, the name on Procter & Gamble (PG), and oil magnate John D. Rockefeller.At Daytona hotels, where business leaders wintered, Bethune gave charismatic appeals for money.The pitch: ""Invest in a child.""""She was the type of person who would take a slow yes over a quick no,"" said Ashley Robertson, director of the Bethune Foundation , a museum housed in Bethune's former home.Take Gamble. Bethune brought him to Hell's Hole in 1906.""Where is this school?"" he asked.""In my mind and in my soul,"" Bethune replied.""She showed him the trash dump and said, 'Don't you see the children playing?'"" Robertson said.Gamble signed on. He funded Bethune's dream to build a bigger campus for more students — and became chairman of her trustee board for the next 20 years.Cash And ClassesRockefeller was also impressed with Bethune, and forked over the equivalent of over $1 million in today's money.Bethune teamed up with Cookman Institute for Men in 1923 to create Bethune-Cookman College. The school transformed from a vocational school into a junior college in 1931. It became a four-year institution 10 years later.Bethune pictured her students as heroes in science, business and politics. She set the tone, diving into civic and national responsibilities.President Coolidge invited her to a child welfare conference in 1928. President Hoover put her on a committee for child health in 1930.""She has been quick to seize every opportunity which presented itself to come more and more into the open and strive directly for the uplift of the race and nation,"" Eleanor Roosevelt wrote about Bethune in a column in 1933.By then, the first lady and Bethune were friends.It dawned on President Roosevelt in 1936 that Bethune was the right fit for his National Youth Administration, a program to boost young graduates. All FDR had to do was convince the teacher to come to work with him in Washington.""I have to take care of my college,"" Bethune protested.The president pushed back: ""I'm afraid you'll have to accept.""Traveling the country for the youth program, Bethune fine-tuned her political savvy. She was named vice president of the NAACP in 1940.Bethune officially retired as president of Bethune-Cookman College in 1942, but came back to lead the school from 1946 till 1947.When the United Nations was formed in 1945, President Truman sent her as a representative.Bethune made the world her classroom during her golden years. No pleasure cruises for her. She was in Europe, Africa and Haiti, always pushing for democracy.

"
898,PG,"This year's subjects range from active management strategies to ""strategic beta"" — an index investing strategy that seeks to boost returns by using certain features of active management — to unconstrained bond funds, dividend-paying stocks and international opportunities.

"
901,PG,"Danoff, manager of $107.5 billion Fidelity Contrafund , was on a Wednesday panel that discussed how to find leaders ahead of the crowd. He said he looks for firms whose durable multiyear earnings growth is not reflected in its current price.

933,PG,"Three big pharmas reported light-to-mixed Q1 earnings Tuesday, but their shares went in different directions in the stock market today as Wall Street seemed to focus on different details of the reports.
"
934,PG,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) said Q1 earnings rose 12% over the year-earlier quarter to 46 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents. Sales, however, fell 1% to $3.8 billion, missing consensus of $3.9 billion. Bristol added a nickel to the low end of its previous 2014 EPS guidance range, now $1.65-$1.80, but the midpoint is below analysts' $1.78. Sales guidance of $15.2 billion to $15.8 billion was squarely in line with consensus. Both represent modest declines from last year.
"
935,PG,"HIV drugs Sustiva and Reyataz were largely responsible for the Q1 miss, along with rheumatoid-arthritis drug Orencia. On the other hand, stroke preventer Eliquis finally seemed to be finding its legs after a disappointing launch last year, with sales of $106 million beating views by $12 million. Diabetes also outperformed, but Bristol sold that business in February to AstraZeneca (AZN), though it's still collecting royalties.
"
936,PG,"Bristol also announced it's begun a rolling FDA submission process for its PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in squamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer, based on a study it expects to complete by year-end. Nivolumab performed well against this disease in a phase one trial, which presents a significant opportunity because the prognosis for squamous patients today is poor. Bristol said it will report phase two results at a meeting in October.
"
937,PG,"The company also acquired privately held biotech iPierian, which develops treatments for a class of neurogenerative diseases called Tauopathies.
"
938,PG,"Bristol stock was down 3% in midday trading, near 49.
"
939,PG,"Merck (MRK) reported a similarly mixed quarter, though the Street was more impressed as the stock was up 3%. Its profit climbed 3.5% over the year-earlier quarter to 88 cents a share, beating estimates by 9 cents. Sales shrank 4% to $10.26 billion, missing consensus of $10.44 billion. Merck affirmed its previous guidance, which calls for EPS of $3.35-$3.53 and sales of $42.4 billion to $43.2 billion.
"
940,PG,"For ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum, the most interesting thing about the results was that beleaguered diabetes drug Januvia beat expectations.
"
941,PG,"""We can't quantify the price impact at this point, but would note that ANY favorable (year-over-year) price impact is good news for MRK, as the DPP-4 category was plagued by new and aggressive price competition in 2013,"" he wrote in an email to clients.
"
942,PG,"Merck said it would leave pipeline updates till a business-review meeting next week. It also didn't comment on its efforts to sell its consumer business, which has reportedly drawn interest from Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble (PG) and Bayer (BAYRY) over the past few days.
"
943,PG,"Sanofi (SNY) reported its numbers in euros, but its sales converted to $10.86 billion, up 5%, or 3.5% at a constant exchange rate. That missed analysts' consensus of $11.15 billion. EPS of $1.62 missed consensus by 5 cents, but rose 5.8% at a constant exchange rate.
"
944,PG,"RBC Capital Markets noted that Sanofi moved up its expected filing timeline for alirocumab, the cholesterol drug it's developing with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). Previously it expected to file in Europe early next year and in the U.S. somewhat later, but now it expects an EU filing late this year.
"
945,PG,"Another product of the Regeneron partnership, dupilumab, is being moved to a phase three trial for atopic dermatitis. Perhaps based on these encouraging reports, Regeneron stock was up 3.7% in midday trading, even as Sanofi stock was down more than 1%.
"
946,PG,"Sanofi was also in the news Tuesday as it was reported that Allergan (AGN) has approached it as a possible buyer, in Allergan's bid to fend off a hostile bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX). The reports were based on anonymous sources, and the companies refused to comment.

1070,PG,"The return of a CEO with a sterling reputation can be a good thing for shareholders.On Thursday, Procter & Gamble (PG) announced that Robert McDonald was out as CEO and his predecessor A.G. Lafley was back.Lafley was CEO from mid-2000 to mid-2009. Many see Lafley as a strong leader. During the seven fiscal years before Lafley's reign as CEO, Procter & Gamble's revenue growth was in double-digits just one year, 1995. (The fiscal year ends in June.)Under Lafley, P&G's revenue growth was in double-digits for four years, with two years at 19% and 20% growth, respectively.Under McDonald, revenue growth was stuck at 3% in each of the past three fiscal years, though the U.S. economy provided virtually no help in those years.A few people, including hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management, called for the replacement of CEO McDonald.Yet, if an investor looks at price performance, it's hard to see McDonald as deserving the boot.During Lafley's reign as CEO, P&G's stock rose 80% from mid-2000 to mid-2009, or 7% per year. In the past four years under McDonald, P&G's stock rose about 59%, or 12% per year.The quarterly dividend increased from 44 cents a share to 60.15 cents a share under McDonald. That calculates to 8% annual growth in the payout.Under Lafley, dividend growth averaged 4% annually.If going back is better, some investors might wonder how better is better if it doesn't show up in the stock price or dividend.Numbers never tell the future story, however. Maybe the return of Lafley might help P&G.At this point, that's not a given.

In the past four years under McDonald, P&G's stock rose about 59%, or 12% per year.The quarterly dividend increased from 44 cents a share to 60.15 cents a share under McDonald. That calculates to 8% annual growth in the payout.Under Lafley, dividend growth averaged 4% annually.If going back is better, some investors might wonder how better is better if it doesn't show up in the stock price or dividend.Numbers never tell the future story, however. Maybe the return of Lafley might help P&G.At this point, that's not a given.

1105,PG,"Top leaders strive to build an organization based on accountability, where everyone trusts each other. It's not easy to do, but when you achieve it, everything moves faster within your firm and you gain a serious edge. Here's how.
"
1106,PG,"• Keep your word. Build trust by living up to your commitments, says Stephen M.R. Covey, global leader of Salt Lake City-based leadership development firm FranklinCovey trust practice. If you're not accountable for what you say, people won't follow. ""With low accountability, nothing gets done because no one trusts what you talked about,"" he told IBD.
"
1107,PG,"• Look inward. Accountability starts at home, says Covey, author of ""Smart Trust"" and son of Stephen R. Covey, author and co-founder of FranklinCovey. If you want others to be responsible, you have to be, too. If you aren't, you're just shifting blame. ""My father said, 'If you think the problem is out there, then that kind of thinking is the problem,'"" he said. ""Look in the mirror first. If you blame others, you can't sustain trust.""
"
1108,PG,"• Be all-encompassing. Integrity isn't just something you do. It has to be part of your being, says Jana Matthews, who heads her Boulder, Colo.-based namesake leadership and growth consulting firm. Your principles rule everything you do.
"
1109,PG,"""Integrity needs to be integral to who you are,"" she said. ""You want people to say, 'You have to understand we're all held accountable here. It's what the organization's personality is.'""
"
1110,PG,"• Operate reliably. Be consistent in what you tell people and how you act. Explain why you want them to do something. They'll learn they can trust what you say.
"
1111,PG,"""If you consistently tell people the truth and why you are asking them to do something, they will do it and eventually will walk over hot coals for you,"" Matthews said.
"
1112,PG,"• Be clear. Goals for how to live by values should be no different than sales or profit goals, Covey says. They should be stated to everyone. Procter & Gamble (PG) does that well, he says. The personal care firm sets out its values and rewards people only if they achieve results while in harmony with those principles. ""The key is making it explicit and real,"" he added.
"
1113,PG,"• Gain speed. When you have a culture of trust, everything moves faster, Covey says. People don't have to spend time checking on each other and wondering if they'll deliver.
"
1114,PG,"Warren Buffett completed one acquisition in 29 days because both sides trusted each other. ""When you don't have trust, speed goes down and costs go up,"" Covey said. ""There is a low-trust tax.""
"
1115,PG,"• Share negatives, too. Communicate bad news when it happens instead of hiding it, Matthews says. Own up to it, take responsibility and tell others how you plan to proceed to solve the problem in the future. ""People will follow a leader who has vision and who they trust,"" she said.
"
1116,PG,"• Offer support. Once you've told people what you expect from them, give them the resources to do it. Then you should hold them accountable, Matthews says.
"
1117,PG,"If they need two years for a project and you give them only one, you can't expect them to do the job as well as first planned.
"
1118,PG,"""You always want to be helping employees perform at a high level,"" Matthews said. ""It's unfair if you haven't told them what to expect, what the goal is and given them the resources to make it happen.""
"

1129,PG,"War On Terror: New information about a sniper assault on Silicon Valley's phone lines and power grid has raised fears that the nation's power grid is vulnerable to terrorism.The prospect that the unsolved attack on an electrical substation near San Jose just hours after the Boston Marathon bombing in April could have been a terrorist act was raised anew last week by Jon Wellinghoff, former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.""This is the most sophisticated and extensive attack that's ever occurred on the grid to my knowledge,"" he told the Associated Press, contradicting FBI denials that terrorism was involved. ""I don't know what the definition of terrorism is other than when an extremely well-trained group attacks a major piece of infrastructure in an expertly planned attack.""Wellinghoff also mused recently that the attack might have been a dress rehearsal for a more widespread attack on a national grid vulnerable to disruption. ""There are ways that a very few number of actors with very rudimentary equipment could take down large portions of our grid,"" he told Foreign Policy. ""I don't think we have the level of physical security we need.""An attack by intruders with guns and rifles could be just as devastating as any cyberattack, he said.The April 16, 2013, attack on Pacific Gas & Electric's Metcalf transmission substation attack began when intruders lifted heavy manhole covers at about 1:30 a.m. in two places on Monterey Highway, south of San Jose, climbed under the road and cut AT&T fiber-optic cables, temporarily knocking out phone service.The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that in just 19 minutes, gunmen fired more than 100 rounds into substation equipment, disabling 17 of 20 big transformers, causing about $16 million in damage.Last October, former CIA Director Jim Woolsey said a video showed three or four men carried out the attack in a ""disciplined military fashion,"" systematically firing their weapons and ""quickly and professionally disposed of everything they had."" This was no mere act of ""hooliganism,"" he said, but rather ""a systematic attempt to take down the electric grid.""""These were not amateurs taking potshots,"" Mark Johnson, a former vice president for transmission operations at PG&E, said last month at a conference on grid security. ""My personal view is that this was a dress rehearsal"" for future attacks.Part of the problem is a porous southern border through which what the Border Patrol calls OTMs (other than Mexicans) cross in significant numbers. If the cartels can smuggle drugs and people into America, Hezbollah and al-Qaida have to know they can smuggle in trained terrorists. Politicians like to talk about repairing infrastructure. How about protecting it?

1163,PG,"The first-quarter earnings season is past the halfway mark, with more than 900 companies including 142 S&P 500 members due to report results this week.According to the latest Earnings Preview, results of 267 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 27, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members were up 25.1% year over year on more than 10% higher revenues. Of these, 76.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 73.8% beat revenue expectations.Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are likely to increase 22.6% from the same period last year on 8.4% higher revenues. Total earnings for consumer staples companies are expected to grow 6.8% while revenues are likely to increase 3.1% in the first quarter of 2018.Some of the key players in the sector — Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) — have already released their quarterly numbers. Procter & Gamble, popularly known as P&G, reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products. The company has also lifted its core earnings per share guidance.PepsiCo reported first-quarter 2018 results, with earnings and revenues both beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise for the company. The improvement was mainly attributable to strong performances in its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.Coca-Cola started 2018 on a strong note, beating the consensus mark on both counts in the first quarter. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following stocks within the consumer staples sector that are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1.Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79% last quarter. The Oreo-maker surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 4.43%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of +0.34% and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The food industry within the consumer staples sector has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the past few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (for example, a shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat) and consumer dynamics (such as increased need for portable and on-the-go products), demographic shifts and also a shift in demand for low-priced products.Mondelez, like other legacy brands including General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014.Nonetheless, in order to counter the tepid sales trend, Mondelez has been focusing on innovation and brand building. The company has also undertaken some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. Mondelez’s to-be-reported quarter’s results are likely to gain from its Power Brands, favorable trends in emerging markets, higher pricing, productivity and cost saving initiatives, partly offset by higher input costs.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, indicating a 15.1% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.66 billion, implying 3.8% growth.(Read More: Will Cost Saving Plans Aid Mondelez's Q1 Earnings?) Mondelez International, Inc.

QuoteArcher-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is a leading food processing company. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.14%. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.7%.Our proven model does not show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to-be-reported quarter. Archer Daniels sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Archer Daniels has a dismal surprise history. In fact, the company has been lagging sales estimates for more than three years now. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $14.52 billion, down 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprise in eight of the preceding 10 quarters. This drab performance can be attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.However, Archer Daniels’ focus on cost savings to strengthen its business has been offsetting the sales headwind to some extent. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 50 cents for the quarter under review reflects a decline of 16.7% year over year.

1164,PG,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1165,PG,"The Dow snapped a five-session long losing streak this week, boosted by strong quarterly results. During the early half of the week, surging bond yields caused heavy losses for stocks. But strong results from key components helped the index recover toward the end of the week. The 10-year Treasury yield also retreated from the psychological 3% level, calming investors’ fears.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined 0.8% last Friday after Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) took a hit owing to concerns of weak demand for iPhones. Also, the broader consumer staples sector took a beating, led by PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report). Moreover, a rise in bond yields, reflecting fears of rising inflation, kept investors worried. The 10-year Treasury note touched a four-year high leading to huge selloffs.However, the index gained 0.4% over last week. U.S. equity markets surged on the first two day of the week driven by robust first-quarter 2018 earnings results, strong economic data and easing geopolitical tensions. The middle of the week was a mixed bag for the markets with the Dow declining marginally.However, the last two days of the week saw all major indexes ending in the red. This was primarily because of concerns over rising inflation, which saw the 10-year Treasury yield touching a four-year high.The Dow This WeekThe index declined less than 0.1% on Monday, making it the fourth straight day of losses since March. The Dow’s decline was led by Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), which declined 2.1%. Tech stocks continued to suffer and rising bond yields dented investors’ confidence. However, optimism about earnings prevented markets from declining further.The index fell 1.7% on Tuesday, making it the fifth straight day of losses for the index since March 2017. The 30-stock index rose as much as 131 points shortly after trading began only to witness huge selloffs in the later part of the day. However, the Dow eventually took a beating after industry bellwether Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) said economic growth might decelerate later in the year.The Dow bounced back on Wednesday, gaining 0.3% to end its five-day losing streak. The 30-stock index witnessed a lot of volatility throughout the day, declining as much as 201.05 points at one point. However, it erased initial losses to end higher after shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) rallied on robust quarterly results.The index added 1% on Thursday following robust corporate earnings from a number of big companies, including Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report). The Dow gained 238.51 points, helped primarily by Visa Inc. V which posted better-than-expected profits and raised its earnings forecast. Moreover, the 10-year Treasury yield traded below the 3% level, as investors shed worries that had fueled huge selloffs over growing U.S. debts and rising costs.Components Moving the Index 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of 98 cents per share compared with $2.16 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.50, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, the reported figure increased 15.7% on a year-over-year basis.Net sales came in at $8,278 million, up from $7,685 million in the year-ago quarter and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,079 million.

1166,PG,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term. So how about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1167,PG,"Investors are keenly awaiting earnings results from both Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report). The main reason is that Merck KGaA's consumer healthcare division was acquired by Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) last month for $4.2 billion or €3.4 billion. Following the acquisition, the focus shifted toward Pfizer as Procter & Gamble was expected to acquire the consumer healthcare business unit of the former.Meanwhile, the healthcare sector has jumped 9.9% in the past year, becoming one of the best performing sectors among the S&P 500. Signs of the sector’s well-being became more evident in the last one year, when the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index gained 2.9% and 4.6%, respectively.With both Merck and Pfizer are scheduled to report on May 1, this may be a good time to figure out which of these is a better stock. Both pharma giants carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled on the same day include Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report). Price PerformanceMerck has witnessed a decline of 4.7% over the past year, while Pfizer has advanced 8.3%. So Pfizer is a clear winner in this respect with better returns than both rival Merck and the broader industry, which rose 4% during the same period.Dividend YieldIn a year’s time, Merck and Pfizer have offered dividend yields of 3.22% and 3.71%, respectively, while the industry’s dividend yield is 3.25%. So Pfizer has taken lead here too, compared to both Merck and the broader industry.Net MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continually draw attention to allegedly exorbitant drug pricing, which helps the sector maintain its steep margins.With a net margin value of 30.61%, Pfizer performs better than rival Merck, which has a net margin value of 27.25%. In comparison, the broader industry has a net margin value of 26.23%.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a good indicator of the financial health of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. In the context of a capital-intensive industry like pharma, this is an indicator of a company’s long-term sustainability.Merck’s debt-to-equity ratio of 61.8% is significantly high, compared with the industry’s D/E ratio of 56%.  With a comparatively lower D/E ratio of 46.8%, Pfizer evidently has a better leverage condition.ValuationThe most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks in the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma majors, Pfizer with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 16.42 is overvalued than the broader industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 11.80. On the other hand, with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.38, Merck is underpriced than both Pfizer and the industry.Earnings History and ESPConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Merck has delivered positive surprises in each of the prior four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.5%. In comparison, Pfizer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5% in the prior four quarters, registering an earnings beat each time.When considering Earnings ESP, Merck and Pfizer have ESP values of 0.00% and +1.36%, respectively, which implies that Pfizer is at advantage in this respect. Moreover, Pfizer’s earnings estimates for the current year have advanced by 0.3% over the last 60 days, slightly better than Merck’s 0.2% increase. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Merck holds an edge over Pfizer when considering only EV/EBITDA ratios and previous earnings performance. However, when considering price performance, leverage position, net margins and estimate revisions, Pfizer holds an advantage over Merck. Additionally, Pfizer has a better dividend yield than Merck, making it a clearly better stock.What clinches the case in favor of Pfizer at this point of time is that it has a positive and better ESP than Merck, which is a leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. This is why it may be better to bet on Pfizer over Merck as both prepare to report earnings next week.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1168,PG,"One of the most famous names in the consumer products world – Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) – came up with a beat on both line in results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The consumer behemoth also announced a big-ticket acquisition of Merck's Consumer-Health Unit as well as the terminated a joint venture with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.Such a volley of good news should boost the stock of P&G, but in reality, shares fell about 4.2% due to about loss of market share in its core business, per CNBC. Margin pressure was pronounced in the earnings report.Let’s delve a little deeper into the results and assess what could be done with P&G shares in the coming days (read: 3 Staples ETFs & Stocks to Buy on Retail Sales & Geopolitics).Procter & Gamble's 3Q18 Earnings in FocusP&G’s fiscal third-quarter core earnings of $1.00 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents by 2%. The bottom line increased 4% from the prior-year quarter. Currency-neutral core earnings per share (EPS) also improved 1%. The upside was primarily driven by increased net sales and a lower core effective tax rate.Reported net sales of $16.3 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.2 billion and grew 4% from the year-ago level, thanks to strong sales from its beauty, and fabric and homecare business lines. Foreign exchange had a 4% positive impact on sales.On the flip side, organically (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues grew 1% (versus 2% growth seen in the preceding quarter). Pricing had a 2% negative impact on sales. P&G’s Gillette shaving business continues to face pricing pressure from U.S. retailers. The brand has been facing steep competition from the likes of Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s have due to the latter’s less expensive products.Core gross margin dropped 110 basis points (bps) to 49.4%, as productivity savings and higher sales were more than offset by headwinds like higher commodity costs and unfavorable pricing impacts.Outlook The company has lifted its core EPS growth projection to 6-8% (versus 5-8% expected earlier).But it maintained its projection for the year and expects organic sales growth in the range of 2-3% for fiscal 2018.Acquisition Details P&G announced to buy the consumer-health business of Germany-based Merck KGaA for approximately 3.4 billion euro ($4 billion). Per the terms, P&G will also acquire a 51.8% stake in India-listed Merck Ltd. The deal is expected to close during the 2018/19 fiscal. The acquisition will help P&G to solidify its consumer healthcare business.Consumer ETF ImpactThe loss in PG and Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) shares is reflected in the ETF world, with consumer staples funds being hurt. Many of the key funds in this segment have a double-digit allocation to the consumer product giant P&G, suggesting that the performance of the fund is highly dependent on the company’s performance. Let’s take a look at the following three ETFs with a solid allocation to Procter & Gamble (read: Consumer Staples ETF Investing 101):Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)The most popular consumer ETF on the market, XLP, follows the S&P Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. The fund invests about $7.56 billion of assets in 34 holdings. Of these firms, the in-focus P&G takes the first spot, making up roughly 1.4% of the assets. The fund lost 2.9% on Apr 19 (see all consumer staples ETFs here).Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC  -  Free Report)This fund manages a $3.79 billion asset base and provides exposure to a basket of 99 consumer stocks. The product charges a low fee of 10 bps per year from investors. Here too, P&G is the top firm with 10.4% allocation. VDC retreated about 2.7% on Apr 19.iShares U.S. Consumer Goods ETF (IYK  -  Free Report)The fund holds about 107 stocks in its basket with AUM of $468.4 million. Like the other two, the stock under consideration occupies the top position in the basket with 9.12% of assets. The fund shed about 2.9% on Apr 19.Bottom LineEven though acquisition announcement should bode well over the long term, the near-term prospect of P&G doesn’t appear to be smooth. Plus, the Zacks Industry Rank of Procter & Gamble is in the bottom 8%. The VGM Score of the stock is D. Investors should also keep in mind that the wind is not in favor of the broader sector. The Zacks Sector Rank is in the bottom 44%. So, it is better to stay away from the consumer space at this moment.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

1169,PG,"Q1 earnings season has thus far had a pronounced calming effect on market volatility this week; after more than a month of wild turbulence based on a host of external issues, impressive growth and positive surprises for companies so far reported have brought a welcome tepidness to daily trading. Even when markets are down like they were Thursday, there were no three- or four-digit spikes to strike fear into the hearts of investors.This quarterly good news continues into Friday’s pre-market, with beleaguered industrial major General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) posting a positive surprise on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of 16 cents per share outpaced the 11 cents expected, whereas quarterly sales of $28.7 billion surpassed the $27.9 billion in the Zacks consensus.CEO John Flannery had already described 2018 as a “reset year,” following a long duration of losses and underperforming segments under past leadership. Many analysts still expect GE to take some sort of different form in terms of business holdings down the road, but for now the market is pleased with the Q1 beat. Shares are up 6.5% in today’s pre-market, off the multi-year lows struck earlier this month. For more on GE’s earnings, click here.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) also topped quarterly estimates this morning, posting $1.00 per share on $16.3 billion in revenues — ahead of the expected 98 cents and $16.2 billion, respectively, as well as +4% year over year on both top and bottom lines. Though we saw some weakness in the company’s fiscal Q3 report, such as a dip in core gross margins, full-year earnings guidance was ratcheted up to 6-8%. For more on PG’s earnings, click here.Oilfield services major Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), however, saw an opposite fortune befall the company in its Q1 report: an earnings meet of 38 cents per share combined with a top-line miss of $7,829 million (versus $7,852 million expected) has caused a 1% pre-market sell-off at this hour. Yet revenues were up big from a year ago, with Drilling +28% and Production +98%. For more on SLB’s earnings, click here.Global financial services major State Street Corp. (STT  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 4 cents to $1.62 per share, on revenues in Q1 of $3.02 billion which met estimates exactly. This represents 13.2% year-over-year growth on the top line for the Zacks Rank #3-rated company. Shares had been pulling back a tad of late, but this is off all-time highs posted earlier this year. For more on STT’s earnings, click here.And Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with Zacks Style Score (Value, Growth, Momentum) of A, beat marginally on both top and bottom lines ahead of today’s opening bell. Earnings of $1.39 per share outperformed by 4 cents per share, whereas $3.2 billion eked by the $3.1 expected. Earnings guidance for the full year reached $8.30-8.50 per share. For more on SWK’s earnings, click here.

1171,PG,"The Dow traversed a tough week, suffering losses for three consecutive sessions. Initially, investors were wary of the outcomes of the Fed and ECB meetings. The outcome of the meeting between President Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un was also eagerly awaited.Ultimately, these talks had little impact on market proceedings. Comments from the ECB were also largely welcomed by investors. However, the Fed’s rate hike led to losses for the bourses.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 0.3% last Friday as investors’ concerns related to global trade war and G-7 summit faded away. The blue-chip index posted its third straight positive trading sessions and closed at its highest level since March. Notably, The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) was the major advancer of the blue-chip index with a gain of 1.9%.The index gained 2.8% over last week, its biggest weekly gain since March. The Dow posted its third straight weekly advance despite global trade war and tariff related conflicts. However, the index ended lower on last Tuesday, as trade tensions dented investors’ confidence.

Notably, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) was the major decliner of the blue-chip index with a loss of nearly 1%. However, movements of indexes were modest in either direction as investors were closely awaiting the outcome of meetings of the Fed and ECB.  Meanwhile, investors’ concerns regarding trade war and geopolitical conflicts waned, at least for the time being, as President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un inked an agreement to denuclearize Korean peninsula and stop war games.The index declined 0.5% on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve announced its second rate hike for the year and indicated that the central bank may raise rates more aggressively going forward.This was the second rate hike in 2018 and was in line with market expectations. Eight of 15 Fed officials now expect four rate hikes this year compared with seven at the March meeting.The index lost 0.1% on Thursday after financials weighed on the index. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) lost 1.8%, being as the largest drag on the blue-chip index.

1172,PG,"Wall Street closed higher on Friday to end a particularly strong week. All three major indexes closed in positive territory as investors’ concerns related to global trade war and G-7 summit faded away. However, trading volumes were relatively low ahead of a busy week where President Trump is scheduled to meet his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un in Singapore.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 25,316.53, increasing 0.3%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also increased 0.3% to close at 2,779.03. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,645.51, gaining 0.1%. A total of 6.05 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.6 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.42-to-1 ratio.

The United States and the six highly industrialized nations of the world, who are the major political and trading ally of the United States, will engage in a crucial meeting after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on imported metals from these countries.A strong U.S. macro economy along with a robust labor market, solid consumer and business confidence and healthy earnings momentum for the rest of 2018 are the primary reasons which enabled investors to shrug off G-7 trade conflicts.Crucial Week AheadTrading activities on Wall Street were relatively low as investors were waiting for the outcome of the Jun 12 meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The Nasdaq closed at a record high for the first time since March 12.  However, U.S. stocks had a mixed Tuesday.

The Dow closed at its best single-day percentage gain since April 10. Markets were mixed on Thursday. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 ended the day with moderate losses.

1173,PG,"Consumer staple companies came under pressure on Jun 5, after Mexico announced retaliatory tariffs on goods imported from the United States. The heat was primarily felt by packaged foods companies, as fears of a trade war fail to subside. Consumer staples have been suffering for a long time now with changing tastes and preferences of consumers and increased competition from online retail giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).In fact, the consumer staples sector fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, registering its worst performance since 1990. Trade war fears have added to the sector’s woes, as consumer staples continue to take a beating with retaliatory tariffs being imposed by the United States’ trade allies. That said, it needs to be seen how consumer staple companies fight back in the days to come.Mexico Tariffs Hit Consumer Staple Stocks The United States’ decision to impose 25% and 10% tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum followed by tariffs of another $60 billion saw China come up with retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of U.S. products that primarily hit the consumer staples sector.Moreover, the United States last week imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the European Union (EU), Mexico and Canada. On Jun 5, Mexico announced that it will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products including pork, bourbon and some types of cheeses.This saw consumer staples stocks, in particular packaged food companies, taking a hit. Shares of Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) slid 2% and 1.8%, respectively. Also, shares of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  declined 0.1% each.Understandably, packaged food companies have reasons to worry with Mexico, one of United States’ biggest trade allies, now imposing retaliatory tariffs.Consumer Staples Suffer Longest DeclineConsumer staples stocks have been suffering for quite some time now, with the sector entering the longest monthly losing streak since November 2016. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples index declined 1.7% in May, registering its straight monthly fall. On a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 Consumer Staples index has declined 13.3%.Moreover, of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) was the second-worst performer in first-quarter 2018. The consumer staples sector didn’t have a good start to 2018, after having registered gains of more than 130% over a period of nine years. The sector has been under pressure owing to rising competition from online retailers and at the same time has been affected by rising commodity prices and transportation costs, and declining brand value.Packaged Food, Beverage, Tobacco Companies SufferChanging customer preference and inclination toward healthier options have seen a number of beverage, packaged foods and tobacco companies suffer. Year to date, shares of PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) have declined 15.1% and 5.3%, respectively. Similarly, shares of B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) have declined 20.3% and 18.4%, respectively, over the same time period.Tobacco companies too have been suffering with slower-than-expected adoption of alternate tobacco products in some markets and at the same time health-conscious people looking for healthier options. Shares of tobacco giants like Turning Point Brands, Inc. (TPB  -  Free Report) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) have declined 0.6% and 25.8%, respectively. Turning Point Brands carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bottom LineConsumer staples stocks have been considered a defensive bet, mainly because of its predictable growth rate and high dividends. However, a number of factors including changing consumer preference, declining brand value and stiff competition from online retailers are acting as tailwinds. Moreover, trade war fears have added to the woes, with countries like Mexico and China imposing tariffs on imported goods from the United States.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1174,PG,"Reforms — whether financial or demographic — are pretty rampant in China right now. The ride has been rocky for this economy, with growth dropping to a 26-year low last year and with little respite in sight.  The Chinese economy expanded 1.4% sequentially in Q1, marking the weakest pace of expansion since the first quarter of 2016 and also lagging market expectations of 1.5%.Naturally, the government is adopting a host of accommodative measures to boost the economy.  Probably, as part of the demographic reform, Beijing is planning to end the four-decade-old infamous policy pertaining to birth limits, as reported on Bloomberg. The reform is expected to take effect by 2019.China is actually gradually easing its one-child policy in recent times. China had slightly loosened the policy in 2013, relaxing the limit for couples where one partner is an only child. In 2015, China scrapped its one-child policy altogether, allowing couples to have two children.Why the Move? Put into effect in 1979, the policy is expected to have put off about 400 million births. However, concerns over China's ageing population and the resultant shortage of workers and consumers prompted this move.China’s working age population dropped to its lowest level since 2009 last year and also fell below a billion for the first time since 2010. The number of people 65 or older rose to 11.4% of the population, up from 10.8% in 2016.The State Council last year estimated that about 25% of China’s population will cross 60 by 2030, up from 13% in 2010. As a result, slowing population growth and declining number of workers pose a threat to China’s economic growth and its state-run pension program, per an article published on Reuters.Investors should note that China has long been working on stepping up domestic consumption, reducing focus on exports and intending to move to a ‘slower and more balanced growth’ economy.How Effective Will the Move Be? Now, the scrapping of restriction is expected to translate into huge demographic gains down the road. However, a former division chief at the National Family Planning Commission indicated that ""scrapping birth limits will have little effect on the tendency of China’s declining births,"" as the decision came in late.Investors should note that the number of births fell 3.5% to 17.23 million in 2017 despite 2015’s loosening of birth limits. Still, we expect some positives out of this move over the long term.Impact of Likely Baby Boom on Stock MarketAs expected, companies selling baby-related goods and services will be the immediate beneficiaries from the end of this policy. Baby-related stocks rallied in China following the news. Of course, companies selling products related to baby care should see a surge over the long run and the Real Estate and Education sectors will also get a lift.Below we highlight two U.S. stocks pertaining to baby products that can gain from the possible reform of China’s family planning norm.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report)The Procter & Gamble Company is into Beauty, Hair and Personal Care; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Baby wipes, diapers, and pants belong to the last segment. Notably, PG derives considerable sales from Greater China and is thus expected to gain significantly from a change in child birth policy. PG has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)The company is a renowned name in baby care products along with other health care offerings. Its huge global exposure makes it a must-watch on China news. This Zacks Rank #3 stock has Momentum Score of A, Value Score of B and Growth Score of A.A Look at China ETF WorldBe it over short or long term, the Chinese economy will likely reap the considerable benefits, putting the spotlight on China ETFs as well (read: 4 Reasons to Bet on China ETFs Now).China Consumer ETF (CHIQ)An end to birth limits will translate into higher consumption over the long term, making CHIQ a solid bet. This 40-stock product offers exposure to the consumer sector in China. The product has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy).Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 500 China A-Shares Small Cap ETF (ASHS  -  Free Report)This product is a combination of China A-shares and smaller capitalization. This ETF attempts to replicate the performance of the CSI 500 index, which tracks 500 small-cap companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The fund currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #3.KraneShares Zacks New China ETF (KFYP  -  Free Report)Since the news revolves around government reform, a look at the ETF related to China's Five Year Plan seems like a decent idea.

1186,PG,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report)) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 20, before the market opens. This consumer goods company has exceeded analysts’ expectations for nine consecutive quarters despite lower sales.The company has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years. Weak volumes and slowing market growth along with foreign exchange headwind have been hurting its sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, also adds to the worries.The trend is unlikely to change for the to-be-reported quarter. Softness in the United States, United Kingdom and volatility in developing markets is likely to adversely impact Procter & Gamble’s results. In fact, categories in the company’s largest and most profitable market, the United States (accounting for 42% of total net sales in fiscal 2017), grew barely above flat in fiscal fourth-quarter 2017. The U.S. market growth slowed to just above 1% in fiscal 2017 from over 2% in fiscal 2016. Overall, the company expects fiscal 2018 organic sales growth of 2-3%.Importantly, Procter & Gamble expects first quarter to witness the lowest organic sales and core earnings per share (EPS) growth of the year, as the period compares against the highest organic growth base period. Top-line headwinds from portfolio choices and the recent Gillette price reduction in the United States will primarily impact the first half of fiscal-2018 results.Segment Discussion: Fabric & Home Care, comprising about 32% of the total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fabric & Home Care revenues of $5.4 billion reflect growth of 3.5% sequentially and 1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for Baby, Feminine & Family Care revenues of $4.6 billion indicates an increase of 0.5% from the prior-year quarter.Again, revenues from Beauty segment are expected to increase 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. Health Care revenues will most likely witness 0.9% growth. However, Grooming revenues is likely to register 2.1% year-over-year revenue decline.Here are the other factors that might influence Procter & Gamble’s Q1 results:To counter the tepid sales growth, Procter & Gamble has been benefiting from its ongoing restructuring program aimed at reducing costs and driving efficiency. The company has been taking various restructuring initiatives aimed at generating higher profit and lowering costs. These initiatives have helped the company to accelerate margins growth amid the slowdown in sales.The company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs and lowering its marketing and advertising spending could boost its operating margins in the coming quarters.However, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category, higher commodity costs, a tough retail environment, an unfavorable mix, and year-over-year comparables are anticipated to continue being a drag in its bottom-line growth rate.For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.07, reflecting an increase of 4.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.6 billion, implying a 0.8% growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Procter & Gamble has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Procter & Gamble is +0.33%.Zacks Rank: Procter & Gamble carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few consumer staples stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company is set to report third-quarter results on Oct 26 before the opening bell.Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.09% and holds a Zacks Rank #3. The company is set to report quarterly results on Oct 30.Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.36% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to report third-quarter results on Nov 2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1187,PG,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because The Procter & Gamble is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat.

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PG, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.33% heading into earnings season.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that PG has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for The Procter & Gamble, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1192,PG,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 20, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.48%.In fact, this consumer goods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.11%.Factors to ConsiderWeak volumes and slowing market share growth have been hurting sales of Procter & Gamble for quite some time. However, the company has been witnessing improved sales environment and thereby earnings in the recent times, thanks to higher volumes driven by innovation, proficient distribution, and in-store activity.In the last reported quarter, sales grew 3%, increasing in 14 of the 15 largest markets and 8 out of 10 categories. Overall organic sales were up 2% comprising 2% volume growth. Market share trends are improving modestly, with Procter & Gamble holding or growing shares in 27/50 top category-country combinations (versus 22 last year). In fact, the company’s sales grew 2% in the first six months driven by 2% volume growth.We expect this improving sales trend to follow in the to-be-reported quarter as well, driven by growth in key markets, product categories, as well as e-commerce and in-store operations. Notably, the company’s premium offerings like Olay have been registering solid growth in China. In the fiscal second quarter, Olay in China achieved its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.That said, various top-line headwinds continue to persist. Overall, the soft category growth rate in developed countries and higher competition in the United States from brands like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s Razor in the male grooming category are likely to hurt the company’s razors and blades’ sales. Again, challenges in the baby care category, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category and higher commodity costs are added woes. Meanwhile, the Algerian government’s import ban on finished products and lower subsidies in Saudi Arabia are added concerns.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, Procter & Gamble reiterated its fiscal 2018 sales projection. The company expects organic sales growth in the range of 2-3% for fiscal 2018. All-in sales growth is expected about 3%.Overall, for the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $16.2 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.5%.Apart from the sales improvement, let’s take a look at the company’s margin story. Despite muted sales growth, the company has exceeded analysts’ expectations on earnings for the 11th consecutive quarter. Procter & Gamble has managed to post higher earnings despite tepid sales owing to productivity and cost-saving plans in order to boost margins, thereby lifting profit level.However, the company failed to expand margins in the last three reported quarters, as productivity savings were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, and product reinvestments. Then again, the company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs, and lowering its marketing and advertising spending has helped it in supporting its operating margins to some extent. The trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Overall, for the quarter to be reported, the company’s margins are likely to remain subdued due to higher input costs. The company expects higher commodity costs including pulp, kerosene, ethylene and propylene to adversely impact its profitability by $300 million in fiscal 2018.Again, unfavorable mix and lower pricing in the shave care category are likely to impact margins further. Procter & Gamble’s investing in price to drive sales of its razors and blades, due to increased competition from shave clubs, have affected its market share. Yet, productivity savings and share repurchases will partly offset these woes.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 98 cents, reflecting growth of 2.1% year over year.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Procter & Gamble does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP:  Procter & Gamble has an Earnings ESP of -0.58%.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

1193,PG,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 23, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.87%.This consumer goods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.72%.Factors to ConsiderProcter & Gamble has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years. Weak volumes and slowing market share growth have been hurting its sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, also adds to the worries. Overall, the soft category growth rate in developed countries and higher competition in the United States like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s Razor in the male grooming category is likely to hurt the company’s razors and blades’ sales. Again, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category and higher commodity costs are added woes.That said, this conglomerate remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging, and marketing initiatives in order to boost sales.Although the company did not provide any sales guidance for the fiscal second quarter, Procter & Gamble remains positive and expects new product launches to improve sales in fiscal 2018. Its innovation-led products like premium Olay and SK-II products are creating higher demand and the trend is likely to follow in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Procter & Gamble anticipates 3% growth in sales for the year. Organic sales are expected in the range of 2-3% (read more: Will New Products Lift Procter & Gamble's Q2 Sales?).Overall, for the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $17.34 billion, reflecting a sequential growth of 4.1%.

1194,PG,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 23, before market open. This consumer goods company has been reporting weak organic sales growth along with continued market share losses for quite some time now (read more: Will New Products Lift Procter & Gamble's Q2 Sales?).However, the company has managed to post higher earnings despite tepid sales owing to productivity and cost savings plans in order to boost margins, thereby lifting profit level.Let’s take a look at how the company's margin is shaping up for this earnings season.In order to counter the tepid sales growth, Procter & Gamble has been benefiting from its ongoing cost-saving program aimed at reducing costs and driving efficiency. The company has been taking various restructuring initiatives aimed at generating higher profit and lowering costs. These initiatives have helped the company to accelerate margins growth amid the slowdown in sales.However, the company failed to expand margins in the last two reported quarters. In the last reported quarter, Procter & Gamble’s core gross margin decreased 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 51.2%, as productivity cost was more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, and product reinvestments. Even, the company’s core operating margin decreased 40 bps year over year to 23% in the quarter, reflecting lower gross margins and higher marketing and overhead costs.That said, the company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs and lowering its marketing and advertising spending have helped it in supporting its operating margins to some extent. Its SG&A margin decreased 10 bps and productivity savings positively impacted its profitability by 190 bps.Overall, for the to-be-reported quarter, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s margins are likely to remain subdued due to higher input costs that has heightened further by the recent hurricanes. The company expects higher commodity costs, including pulp, kerosene, ethylene, and propylene, to adversely impact its profitability by $300 million in fiscal 2018.Again, unfavorable mix and lower pricing in the shave care category is likely to impact margins further.

1195,PG,"Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23, after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 6.9%.In fact, Whirlpool has reported negative surprise in the last four quarters, with an average miss of 5.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $3.99, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 8.9%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.5 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the broader industry in the past month. The company’s shares have increased 3.1%, while the industry dipped 10.5%.Factors at PlayWhirlpool’s surprise history remains unimpressive as it posted fourth consecutive negative surprise in second-quarter 2017. Further, we believe that volatility in commodity prices, particularly steel, may adversely affect operating performance. This was clearly reflected in Whirlpool’s second-quarter results which were hurt by raw material cost inflation. The company notes that costs of key raw materials, particularly steel and resins have increased worldwide in the first half of 2017.While these headwinds were fully offset in North America and Latin America due to favorable demand and productivity gains, Europe and Asia suffered as soft demand made it difficult to negate the challenges.Not surprisingly, the company slashed  earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher raw material costs and lower product price/mix in China and Europe. It now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $14.50-$15.00 per share compared with $14.7-$15.50, guided earlier.However, Whirlpool has been riding on its innovation strategy that helps it to tap additional sales and gain market share. Moreover, the company's solid integration and cost-productivity activities have been enhancing performance. These factors, along with its robust brands portfolio, and continued strength across North America and Latin America have been growth drivers.While Whirlpool’s long-term plans and solid brands portfolio reflect strength, we cannot ignore the near-term challenges hurting the results. That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can aid in sustaining the stock momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Whirlpool has an Earnings ESP of -5.90% as the Most Accurate estimate of $3.75 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99 per share. Moreover, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) lowers the chances of a beat in the ensuing release. We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Strong Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1196,PG,"With rising consumer confidence, spending on beauty and personal care products in addition to apparel and footwear has increased. Moreover, the rise of e-commerce has driven growth of the beauty segment.The Estée Lauder Companies Inc (EL  -  Free Report), one of the leading manufacturer and marketer of beauty products, has been a favorite pick for investors. Shares of the company have surged 29% in the past six months compared with the industry’s gain of 13.2%. Recently, its shares have hit a new 52-week high of $111.79 during the trading session on Oct 16, eventually closing at $111.28.Let’s delve into the aspects which have been aiding the company’s impressive performanceE-commerce on the Rise Estée Lauder has been continuously opening sites across different regions and targeting sustained growth in its e-commerce platform. During the fiscal year 2017, global online sales of the company depicted a 33% growth to reach $1.3 billion. Further, Estée Lauder is implementing new technology and digital experiences including online booking for each store appointment and omni-channel loyalty programs. These initiatives are expected to boost the company’s top line.Well Planned AcquisitionsEstée Lauder has been widening its portfolio through acquisitions. The buyout of BECCA and Too Faced (during the first quarter of fiscal 2017) have strengthened its fastest-growing prestige portfolio. This, in turn, have contributed about 3.5 percentage points of the reported sales growth during the fiscal fourth quarter and approximately half the reported sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The recent investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company — is also expected to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming periods.Other notable acquisitions of Estée Lauder include By Kilian, RODIN olio lusso, GLAMGLOW and Le Labo. Such acquisitions aid the company to expand its portfolio and maintain the respective loyal customer base.Strategic Allocation of Resources & Marketing Fuels Sales Effective promotions help cosmetic and beauty companies to influence consumer sentiments and thereby enhance sales. Estée Lauder emphasizes heavily on marketing, especially through digital media and social networking.The company continues to reallocate resources and reduce costs under the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, in order to boost its beauty business. After its full implementation, Estée Lauder expects the initiative to yield annual net benefits, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses of $200-$300 million, before taxes.Favorable EstimatesAhead of its first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate inched up by a penny to reach 97 cents in the past 30 days. Estimated earnings for the forthcoming quarter lie in the upper end of the management’s guidance of 94-97 cents. This marks an increase of 12% to 15% over the prior-year earnings of 84 cents. However, estimated earnings of $3.97 per share for the fiscal year 2018 surpass management’s anticipated range of $3.87-$3.94.Final Thoughts                                                                                Estée Lauder has been struggling with social and political issues in Hong Kong. Though the company is attempting to strengthen its business with local consumers in Hong Kong, we do not anticipate a significant increase in consumption from the region in the near term.Nevertheless, the company expects to easily offset such challenges based on its strong growth in other emerging regions. The Middle East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific markets offer extensive untapped potential for the company. Estée Lauder also expects strong growth of its brands in China, and has therefore been expanding steadily in the region.Moreover, Estée Lauder is strongly positioned in the beauty arena, with its robust brand portfolio and productive growth strategies. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of B, indicating its inherent growth potential.Looking for More?

1197,PG,"Shares of Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) are down roughly 13% over the last year as the consumer packaged goods giant faces tougher competition from rivals and upstarts. With that said, earnings season could give Procter & Gamble a much needed shot in the arm, if it impresses investors.One proven way for investors to benefit during earnings season is to find companies that are set to outperform earnings expectations. This tactic becomes even more important amid volatile market conditions.In the case of Procter & Gamble, the company saw its organic sales lose steam earlier this fiscal year. However, Procter & Gamble raised its fiscal 2018 earnings outlook last quarter.Now, as investors look to use quarterly earnings season to recoup from a rough couple of months, they need to understand how Procter & Gamble is actually expected to perform this quarter in order to see if a turnaround might be in store.OutlookProcter & Gamble’s quarterly revenues are projected to climb 3.5% to reach $16.16 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the CPG power is projected to see its earnings reach $0.98 per share, which would mark 2.1% growth from the year-ago period.  Cleary, Procter & Gamble is projected to report some growth this quarter, but on their own, these top and bottom line estimates don’t give investors nearly enough information.Investors need to know if Procter & Gamble is expected to top our earnings estimate. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Procter & Gamble is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and sports an Earnings ESP of -0.58%. The company has also experienced three downward earnings estimate revisions within the last seven days. Therefore, investors should consider Procter & Gamble a stock that could very well fall short of earnings estimates, and in turn, see its stock price continue to sink.Procter & Gamble is expected to report its upcoming quarterly financial results before the market opens on Friday, April 20, just a few days before fellow CPG giant Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report).Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1198,PG,"The Dow experienced a particularly volatile week as earnings results took center stage. The index gained on the week’s first two trading days thanks primarily to robust earnings and strong economic data as geopolitical tensions eased. However, the Dow declined over the next two sessions as earnings came in mixed and treasury yields surged to their highest level for the year.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined 0.5% last Friday as earnings results of major banks failed to live up to investors’ high expectations. Also, panic selling took place as news about U.S. airstrike on Syria surfaced.Moreover, investors were concerned about the possibility that Russia's lower house of parliament is considering a draft legislation allowing Kremlin to ban a list of U.S. products. This was in retaliation of recent U.S. sanctions on a group of Russian tycoons and officials.The index gained 1.8% over last week. Gains came on the back of strong expectations for Q1 earnings in an otherwise volatile market.Markets opened higher on Monday and continued its bull run on the next day after trade related tensions eased.

However, the Wall Street rebounded on Thursday as geopolitical tensions eased.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 0.9% on Monday driven by robust first-quarter 2018 earnings results and easing of geopolitical tensions at least for the time being.

The focus is now squarely on earnings which are more of a mixed bag than was earlier estimated. However, the only real worry investors have at this point is the ongoing spike in treasury yields.

1199,PG,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report), popularly known as P&G, reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products. The company has also lifted its core earnings per share guidance.P&G’s fiscal third-quarter core earnings of $1.00 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents by 2%. The bottom line increased 4% from the prior-year quarter. Currency-neutral core earnings per share (EPS) also improved 1%. The upside was primarily driven by increased net sales and a lower core effective tax rate.Meanwhile, P&G agreed to acquire the consumer-health business of Germany-based Merck KGaA for approximately 3.4 billion euro ($4 billion). Per the terms, P&G will also acquire 51.8% stake in India-listed Merck Ltd. The deal is expected to close during the 2018/19 fiscal. The addition of Merck KGaA’s differentiated as well as physician-supported brands will enhance P&G's existing consumer healthcare capabilities, and brands such as Vicks, Pepto-Bismol and Oral-B. The buyout is expected to boost the company’s brand portfolio and category footprint. It will also expand P&G’s geographic footprint, as Merck KGaA’s consumer health business is active in 44 countries and includes more than 900 products.Sales in DetailsP&G’s reported net sales of $16.3 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.2 billion. The top line grew 4% from the year-ago level, given strong sales from its beauty, and fabric and homecare businesses. Foreign exchange had a 4% positive impact on sales.    Organically (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues grew 1% (versus 2% growth seen in the preceding quarter) on the back of 2% increase in organic volumes. However, price had a 2% negative impact on sales.Of the five business segments, three registered positive organic sales growth. Beauty, Health Care, and Fabric & Home Care segments registered organic sales growth of 5%, 1% and 3%, respectively, in the quarter. Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care segments, on the other hand, registered 3% organic sales decline each.Net sales of the Beauty, Fabric & Home Care, Health Care and Grooming segments grew 10%, 6%, 5% and 2%, respectively. However, Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment’s sales remained flat in the quarter.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteMarginsCore gross margin decreased 110 basis points (bps) to 49.4%, as productivity savings and higher sales were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, unfavorable pricing impacts and product reinvestments.Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) margin decreased 10 bps (as a percentage of sales) to 28.3%, driven by productivity savings from overhead, higher revenues, agency fee and ad production costs. Core operating margin decreased 100 bps year over year to 21.1%.Productivity cost savings contributed 310 bps of margin benefit in the quarter. P&G has been cutting costs aggressively to reduce spending across all areas like supply chain, research & development, marketing and overheads.FinancialsAs of Mar 31, 2018, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $5.3 billion, down from $5.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2017 (as of Jun 30, 2017). Long-term debt was $22.4 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, up from $18 billion at the end of fiscal 2017.Cash flow from operating activities was $10.7 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, up from $9.1 billion a year ago.The company returned $3.2 billion of cash to shareholders through $1.8 billion of dividend payments and $1.4 billion of common stock repurchase.Earlier this month, P&G’s board of directors declared a 4% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 71.72 cents per share, in a bid to impress investors. This consumer goods giant has consistently increased its dividend and has been paying dividends for 128 years, ever since its incorporation in 1890. In fact, the latest increase marks P&G’s 62nd consecutive year of dividend hike.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceThe Cincinnati, OH-based company maintained its projection for the year and expects organic sales growth in the range of 2-3% for fiscal 2018. However, P&G expects organic sales to be at the low end of the range. All-in sales growth is expected to be about 3%.The company has lifted its core EPS growth projection to 6-8% (versus 5-8% expected earlier) compared with fiscal 2017 core earnings of $3.92 per share.On a GAAP basis, EPS is expected to decrease 31-33% (unlike the 30-32% decrease expected earlier) versus the fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS of $5.59, which included a significant benefit from the Beauty Brands transaction that was completed in October 2016. The fiscal 2018 GAAP EPS estimate includes approximately 14 cents per share of non-core restructuring costs and 25 cents per share of non-core charges related to the Tax Act.P&G carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1200,PG,"We expect the designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded apparel and related products, V. F. Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.6%.In fact, the company has recorded an average positive surprise of 0.7% in the last four quarters, missing estimates only in one quarter.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether V.F. Corp. will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.12 per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 1.8%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $3.41 billion, down 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.V.F. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise V.F. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | V.F. Corporation QuoteHowever, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have increased 13.7%, while the industry grew 2.1%.Factors at PlayV.F. Corp's second-quarter 2017 results marked a comeback as earnings topped estimates after delivering two straight quarters of in-line results. Also, sales broke its four-quarter long negative surprise trend, backed by strength in international and direct-to-customer platforms, the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition and the company’s workwear business, which forms a part of the Imagewear coalition.Notably, the company’s Outdoor & Action Sports coalition has delivered positive revenue surprise in the last two quarters. Further, its Imagewear coalition has delivered better-than-expected profits in five of the last six quarters.Management expects to sustain its solid momentum in 2017, which encouraged it to raise outlook.The momentum in V.F. Corp.’s shares can largely be attributable to its focus on 2021 strategy that provides visibility into its efforts to grow business and boost shareholder value. The company recently raised 2021 revenue and earnings per share targets to include the impact of the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, which is expected to contribute more than $1 billion to revenue and in excess of 25 cents per share to earnings through 2021.The company now anticipates five-year compounded annual revenue growth rate (CAGR) of 5-7% to more than $15 billion, through 2021. This compares with the previous forecast of 4-6% at a five-year CAGR. Further, it now estimates earnings per share growth of 11-13% at a five-year CAGR, to more than $5 per share. The company had previously predicted earnings per share growth of 10-12% at a five-year CAGR. Moreover, the company had previously anticipated generating cumulative operating cash flows in excess of $9 billion in the five-year period between 2017 and 2021 along with returning about $8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.However, adverse currency translations continue to be a hurdle and are expected to hurt margins and sales in 2017. Nonetheless, we expect V.F. Corp.’s growth strategies to help it sail through these headwinds this earnings season.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that V. F. Corp. is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1201,PG,"SUPERVALU INC. (SVU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 18, before the market opens.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading grocery dealer will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 6.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model conclusively shows earnings beat for SUPERVALU this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SuperValu Inc. QuoteSUPERVALU has an Earnings ESP of +24.64% with a Zacks Rank #3. This increases the predictive power of ESP, thus making us confident of an earnings beat.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents for the fiscal second quarter has been stable in the last 30 days while it reflects a year-over-year decline of about 50% from the year-ago quarter. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.30 for fiscal 2018 shows 13.2% growth from fiscal 2017.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,758 million for the impending quarter, down 2.8% from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, revenues of $15.50 billion are forecasted for fiscal 2018, thus showing an increase of 3.5% from fiscal 2017.Factors Likely to Impact the QuarterSUPERVALU is battling with its sluggish retail business for quite some time, owing to tough competitive pressure and lower store traffic. Evidently, the company has witnessed negative sales from identical retail stores for the last nine quarters. Additionally, the company is facing competition from traditional grocery rivals that are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples.Further, revenues generated from existing transition services agreements with Albertson’s LLC and NAI, which are expected to wind-down over the next two years are anticipated to contribute to lower corporate sales and operating earnings in fiscal 2018. Consequently, SUPERVALU’s share price declined 26.9% in the last six months, wider than the industry’s loss of 7.4%.Nevertheless, the company’s focus on accelerating business by making acquisitions and supply agreements in its wholesale segment remains noteworthy. These agreements are expected to boost its top line in fiscal 2018.SUPERVALU is also trying to develop wholesale operations, primarily through adding new customers, retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions. In fact, the acquisition of Unified Grocers is expected to boost the company’s wholesale business and complement its customer base.Furthermore, the company has been shutting down its underperforming locations. This, in turn, will allow it to utilize its resources and investments on a few strong performing locations. Additionally, SUPERVALU has been striving to reduce cost and resorted to ‘single sourcing’ in its independent businesses in order to induce greater operating efficiency.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +8.70% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1202,PG,"For investors seeking momentum, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report) is probably on radar now. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up roughly 8% from its 52-week low price of $48.76/share.But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:XLP in FocusXLP focuses on the consumer staples segment of the U.S. market. The fund has a large-cap focus with key holdings in the beverages, household products, food & staples retailing and food products segments. XLP charges investors 13 basis points a year in fees and has top holdings in Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) (see: all the Consumer Staples ETFs here).Why the Move?The consumer staples sector has been an area to watch lately given the risk-off sentiments. The bitter exchange of tit-for-tat tariff threats has sparked fears of global recession, thereby raising the appeal for consumer staples stocks. This is because the sector generally acts as a safe haven amid political and economic turmoil. Stocks in these sectors generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty.More Gains Ahead?Currently, XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a Medium risk outlook, suggesting that outperformance could stall in the months ahead. However, many of the segments that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank, so there is definitely some promise for those who want to ride this surging ETF a little further.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1203,PG,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 23, before market open. This consumer goods company has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years. Weak volumes and slowing market share growth have been hurting its sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, also adds to the worries.The company’s total sales grew only 1% in the first quarter. The improvement during the last reported quarter was due to higher shipment volumes. However, lower pricing had a negative impact on sales. Organic sales grew 1%, softer than 2% growth in the prior quarter.Nonetheless, this $65-billion conglomerate remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging, and marketing initiatives in order to boost sales.Resultantly, Procter & Gamble’s shares have gained 3.2% in the last six months, compared with the industry’s growth of 1.2%.Let’s see how the company's top line is shaping up for this earnings season.Although the company has refrained from providing any quarter-specific sales guidance, the company’s management remains positive and expects new product launches to improve sales in fiscal 2018. Its innovation-led products like premium Olay and SK-II products are creating higher demand and the trend is likely to follow in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Procter & Gamble anticipates 3% growth in sales for the year. Organic sales are expected in the range of 2-3%.Segment Discussion: The Fabric Care and Home Care segment (accounting for 33% of the total sales) is likely to witness 1.9% sequential and 4.1% year-over-year growth to $5.5 billion per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, banking on improvement in both Fabric Care and Home Care divisions.The company’s Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment (accounting for 27% of its total sales) revenues of $4.8 billion is expected to grow 2.6% year over year and 4.9% sequentially in the second quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company remains upbeat about China Baby Care sales this fiscal year and expects Pampers to return to share growth, marking a significant turnaround. Again, premium innovations like Whisper Infinity and Radiant is likely to drive Family Care organic sales.The company’s Beauty segment (19% of total sales) revenues of $3.1 billion is expected to decline 2.1% sequentially but witness 4.5% growth year over year, banking on improvements in Skin & Personal Care, owing to continued growth across PG’s “superpremium” SK-II skincare brand in China.Again, the consensus estimate for Health Care (11%) segment revenues of $2.1 billion are likely to increase 11.6% sequentially and 2.5% year over year. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Grooming segment (10% of total sales) revenues of $1.7 billion indicates an increase of 10.7% from the prior quarter but a decline of 2.4% on a year-over-year basis. Aggressive competitive activity, changes in grooming fashions and habits, and increasing online competitors in some markets like the United States are hurting the performance of the grooming segment.Overall, for the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $17.34 billion, reflecting a sequential growth of 4.1%. Revenues of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company are likely to increase 2.9% year-over-year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The soft category growth rate in developed countries and higher competition in the United States like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s Razor in the male grooming category is likely to hurt the company’s razors and blades’ sales. Again, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category and higher commodity costs are added woes. That said, new product launches are likely to offset the negatives.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Revenue (TTM)  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Revenue (TTM) | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteStocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

1204,PG,"The euphoria over the Republican-led tax overhaul policy helped the Dow persistently hit record highs and book back-to-back weekly gains. This epic Dow rally is likely to get a boost from a stellar Q4 earnings season. Strong guidance and an upbeat economic scenario are cited to be some of the primary reasons that will help earnings pick up steam.Given the positives, investing in blue-chip stocks that are likely to make the most of the Q4 earnings season seems judicious. Such stocks, moreover, are positioned to report promising earnings results as they have strong balance sheets and solid cash flow.Dow Jones to Hit Record High Post HolidayDow futures soared triple digits on Jan 15, when the U.S. stock market was closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Dow has already booked two straight weekly gains, as well as registered seven positive weeks in the last eight. The Dow jumped almost 4.4% and posted its best start to a year since the first nine trading sessions of 2003.The 30-stock index demonstrated mostly nothing in the way of gyration or market pullbacks. In fact, the broader market shrugged off uncertainty over the past 12 months. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), quiet remarkably, registered 47 lowest closings last year, out of a total of 56 since its inception in 1990.Tax Package: A Boon for Blue ChipsThe enthusiasm over tax cuts fueled a strong rally in blue-chip stocks. The corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help blue chips bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities. They also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Q4 Earnings Growth Expected to be StrongerSuch blue-chip stocks’ stupendous start could get even more wings as the Q4 earnings season kicks off. Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 9.2% from the same period last year on 7% higher revenues. This would follow 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the Q3 of 2017 on 5.9% higher revenues (read more: JPMorgan's Positive Kick-off to Bank Earnings).Q4 earnings estimates for most of the sectors are expected to be positive, with Energy, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Technology poised to post strong gains. An uptick in oil and gas output is expected to benefit the energy sector, while an increase in sales from housing demand post-hurricanes will drive manufacturing activities. Tech, in the meanwhile, will make headway from substantial growth in cloud computing, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence (read more: 5 Best Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q4 Earnings Season).Healthy Economic DataA sound economy is further likely to support earnings growth. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), a diversified financial services company, has predicted that the U.S. economy will expand an average 2.5% each quarter this year and the next.The unemployment rate, in the meanwhile, is at an ultra-low level of 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high set in November 2017. Lest we forget, workers’ pay has also increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month.Such low jobless level, rise in income and more confident consumers increased spending further at both online and bricks-and-mortar stores and restaurants (read more: Retailers Cap a Robust Holiday-Shopping Season: 5 Must Buys).4 Blue Chips to Buy NowThanks to the bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp run up in the 120-year-old index of 30 stocks. This calls for investing in some fundamentally sound blue-chip companies which can make the most of the Q4 Earnings season. They have a positive Earnings ESP — our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We have, thus, zeroed in on four such stocks that also flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) operates as a diversified technology company worldwide. The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending December 2017 on Jan 25. 3M has an Earnings ESP of +4.37%. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 11.5%, better than the industry’s expected gain of 8%.Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) manufactures and sells construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives. The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending December 2017 on Jan 25. Caterpillar has an Earnings ESP of +6.11%. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 88.9%, better than the industry’s expected gain of 34%.McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants in the United States and internationally. The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending December 2017 on Jan 30. McDonald's has an Earnings ESP of +0.11%. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 14.6%, better than the industry’s projected gain of 1.2%.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) provides branded consumer packaged goods to consumers in the United States and internationally. The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending December 2017 on Jan 23. Procter & Gamble has an Earnings ESP of +0.87%. The stock, which is part of the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, is expected to post a solid earnings growth rate of 6.9% in the current year.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1205,PG,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 23. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this consumer products company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Well the company has outperformed earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation Quote What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.55, which represents nearly 7% growth from the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4,591 million, up about 1% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayKimberly-Clark witnessed year-over-year growth in both top and bottom line in the last quarter, driven by higher sales at Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional (KCP) and Other segments, along with robust cost savings from its Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) program. Sales at the aforementioned segments gained from higher volumes backed by the company’s effective merchandising strategy. This also helped the company to witness marginal growth in organic sales at its overall consumer business, after a 3% drop in the first half of 2017. Region wise, organic sales remained flat in North America, grew 3% in emerging markets, while it dropped by the same rate in developed markets. Softness in the developed markets mainly stemmed from weak diaper sales in South Korea due to a considerably fall in birth rate.Moving to the company’s Personal Care Products segment, which constituted about 50% of Kimberly-Clark’s total sales, we note that sales remained soft owing to lower volumes as well as net selling prices. Well, lower net selling price remains a concern for the overall company, owing to intense competition and heightened promotional activities. In fact, North America remains particularly challenged due to these factors.Nevertheless, management expects Personal Care Products to deliver a better performance in the fourth quarter, backed by its brand initiatives and effective promotional strategy. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $2,261 million, reflecting a 0.6% rise from the year-ago figure. The consensus marks for sales at Consumer Tissue and KCP and Other units are $1,547 million and $791 million, depicting 2.8% and 1.5% year-over-year growth, respectively.Cost Savings Vs Input Cost InflationApart from these factors, Kimberly-Clark is also likely to gain from the successful implementation of its FORCE program, which generated cost savings of $125 million in the third quarter. However, input cost inflation remains a challenge, which the company has been battling for over a year now. For 2017, the company anticipates commodity costs inflation to be marginally higher than its previous estimate of $200-$300 million, primarily due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp and polymer resin.Nonetheless, management remains focused on curtailing discretionary spending during the year. Moreover, currency and lower effective tax rate are expected to favorably impact the bottom line. All said, we expect benefits from these factors and the FORCE program to more than offset rising input costs, and help the company witness earnings growth in the fourth quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Though Kimberly-Clark carries a Zacks Rank #2, its Earnings ESP of -0.84% makes surprise prediction difficult. Notably, the Most Accurate estimate of $1.54 is pegged a notch lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.14% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.58% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>

1206,PG,"After a blockbuster start to 2018, Wall Street has been caught in a vicious circle of trading over the past two months as volatility and uncertainty have taken the center stage. While a combination of factors like solid earnings, upbeat economic data and new tax legislation have fueled the rally, inflation fears, protectionist and anti-trade Trump policies, Washington turmoil and faster-than-expected rates hike continue to weigh on stock returns.Below we discuss some of the events that dominated the headlines in 1Q and influenced the market:Technology Boom & BustThe technology sector has experienced huge swings in the first quarter. It remained in the hot spot for investors given the dual tailwinds of a rising rate scenario and the new tax repatriation policy. A surge in FAANG stocks and emergence of cutting-edge technology have also added to the strength. Given its strong fundamentals, the sector easily survived a couple of massive selloffs – one in early February that took away nearly $194 billion from the market capitalization of the top tech stocks, according FactSet data.The other selling spree was witnessed last week following the news of Facebook data breach that raised regulation concerns and once again snatched the sheen away from the FANG stocks and the broader sector. Notably, Facebook eroded about $100 billion in market cap since the scandal unfolded last week. The US-China trade war jitters also took a toll on the sector. Again, this week has turned out to be a scary one for the sector as FANG stocks erased about $180 billion from their market value on March 27 on a slew of bad news.Despite twist and turns, technology is among the top performing sectors of the first quarter with the S&P Technology Index gaining around 2%. ACM Research Inc. (ACMR  -  Free Report) having a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of D emerged as the winner, climbing more than 143%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved up from a loss of one cent to earnings of 20 cents over the past three months and has an estimated earnings growth of 5.26%.Fed Raises RateAs expected, the Federal Reserve, headed by Jerome Powell, raised interest rates for the sixth time since the financial crisis by 0.25% to 1.50-1.75% in his first meeting this month. The central bank hinted at gradual hikes for this year with two lift-offs but turned hawkish for 2019 and 2020 citing growing confidence in the strengthening economy. As a result, cyclical sectors like financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary are expected to benefit from a rising rates environment.Some of the top-ranked stocks from these spaces saw a huge surge in their share price from a year-to-date look. These include Virtu Financial Inc. (VIRT  -  Free Report) up 79.2%, Capstone Turbine Corporation (CPST  -  Free Report) up 50.6% and Weight Watchers International Inc. (WTW  -  Free Report) up 47.8%. The trio has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), suggesting their continued outperformance in the months ahead. Further, these stocks are expected to generate solid earnings growth this year (VIRT - 178.95%, CPST - 81.82% for year (ending March 2019) and WTW – 56.36%). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Oil Roller-Coaster RideOil was off to a solid start in 2018 with the return of geopolitical risk in Iran, tightening supply and soaring demand. In fact, the first trading day of 2018 marked the strongest start for oil price since January 2014, as both West Texas Intermediate and Brent opened above $60 per barrel. The rally fizzled out as we moved ahead in the quarter due to rising output in the United States. However, the commodity has managed to hold up well lately with Brent at around $70 per barrel supported by tensions in the Middle East and the possibility of further falls in Venezuelan output.With this, oil price rose 4% in the first quarter, putting it on track for the third consecutive quarterly gain and setting the stage for a strong rebound in the energy sector. This implies that investors should buy the beaten down momentum energy stocks having a better Zacks Rank and double-digit earnings growth rate for this year. Magellan Petroleum Corporation (TELL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Momentum Score of A, with an estimated earnings growth rate of  62.2% for this year. It has lost about 30.4% in the first quarter.Dow Jones in Correction Territory: Any Winner?With many wild swings, Dow Jones is in correction territory to end the first quarter. It is down 10.4% from its all-time high made on Jan 26. General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) led the index down, shedding 23% followed by declines of 15.3% for Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and 12.9% for Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report). However, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) not only managed to hold up but also gained in double-digits. Cisco has a Zacks Rank #2 and an estimated earnings growth rate of 7.53% for this year while INTC has a Zacks Rank #3 and an estimated earnings growth rate of 2.31%.Best & Worst Performing StockThe terrible trading in Wall Street has spread across many sectors. BioAmber Inc.  is the worst performing stock of the first quarter, shedding 90.2%. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and a VGM Score of F. Though the stock has an estimated earnings growth rate of 50.47% for this year, it witnessed no earnings estimate revision since its start. Further, it delivered a negative earnings surprise of 73.09% over the past four quarters.  Though the list of best performing stocks is small, Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report) climbed the most with 232.2% gains. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised up from a loss of two cents to earnings of a penny over the past 90 days, representing a whopping year-over-year earnings growth of 105.56%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and a VGM Score of F.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1207,PG,"Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) has been under tremendous pressure following the uproar over its user data fiasco. Everyone has raised questions over how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data of roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge. Traders dumped its shares fearing that the scandal would compel users to shift from the platform. In fact, shares of the Internet major saw a weekly decline of 14%, the steepest since 2012.But does it make any sense for long-term investors to pull the trigger on Facebook shares at such low levels? After all, the tech titan isn’t that expensive. The company has an average trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 25.92, which is well below the Internet - Services industry’s average of 29.93.Moreover, Facebook’s plunge is overdone, and the stock is actually a great buy. Here’s why.Limited Number of Users AffectedEven though 50 million users sound a lot, it’s nothing when compared to the total of 2.2 billion monthly active users. Thus, only 2% of the platform’s users have been affected. And even for the 2%, nothing on their medical information or social security numbers seems to have been accessed.This is just an isolated case and there is much ado about nothing. Especially, when the company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is a solid 16.4%, and 26.2% compounded annually over the next five years.Facebook Bridges Gap With Google in Ad RevenuesLest we forget, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Facebook control around half of the ad market. Facebook is, in fact, steadily making up ground. In 2014, 37% of Internet advertising revenues went to Google, compared to Facebook’s 18%. But, the lead shrunk to 33% to 19% in 2015, 32% to 19% in 2016, and 32% to 20% in 2017.It might take some time for Facebook to outdo Google, but the gap is closing fast. And there is little competition from other players. The next major competitor is Twitter, Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report), with just 4.4% share.Meanwhile, there have been some concerns that the big consumer companies like Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report) are trimming digital ads. However, analysts predict that digital ad spend will hit $376 billion in 2021, up from $228 billion in 2017. And if Facebook can gain 28% of market share by that time, it will earn $100 billion in revenues — a huge increase from last year’s $41 billion. So, there is still an encouraging runway ahead.Facebook Stock VerdictFacebook’s public relation issues have been going from bad to worse but this has made the stock cheaper than usual. The company is continuing to catch up with Google in the digital ad space that itself has been gaining traction. All in all, Facebook could gain more once it survives this controversy.To top it, investors have seen 16 earnings estimate revisions move higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for Facebook has trended upward over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $6.61/share two months ago to just $7.17/share right now.  If this wasn’t enough, Facebook flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1208,PG,"The performance of buyback ETFs has been moderate in the last one year as PowerShares Buyback Achievers ETF (PKW  -  Free Report) has gained about 13.5% in the last one year (as of Feb 23, 2018) versus the 15.9% rise in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report). S&P 500 buybacks fell down 5.3% for the 12-month period ending September 2017.Will Tax Reform Boost Buyback?President Trump’s administration passed a tax plan in December that mainly revolved around cutting corporate taxes and adjusting personal tax rates. The final tax version cuts the corporate rate from 35% to 21% (read: Tax Bill: What ETF Investors Need to Know).The Trump administration also proposed a move from the current worldwide tax system to a territorial system, allowing companies to send their offshore profits back to the United States without extra taxes. Investors are expecting tax savings to result in fatter and faster dividend hikes and more stock buybacks (read: What Makes iShares' Dividend and Buyback ETF Launch Timely?).Are Hopes Too High? As per an article published on Financial Times, 400 earnings calls revealed that 28% of companies intend to return cash to shareholders, while 44% plan to enhance capex and wages.  A great deal of tax savings can also be used as debt repayments. Instead of higher payouts, if debt retirement becomes corporations’ priority, especially in a rising rate environment, companies can produce a healthy leverage ratio.Still, “Morgan Stanley analysts expect a greater overall amount of cash from tax savings to be dedicated to dividends and buybacks than capex,” as quoted on Financial Times. Morgan Stanley’s analysts are forecasting that 43% of the total tax savings will go to dividends and buybacks, 30% will be shelled out on capex and employee compensation and just 8% will go to “balance sheet repair.”In any case, increase in returns to shareholders has already been an established trend. Tech behemoths “have been raising buybacks and dividends by issuing bonds against savings held offshore.”But then, if the global economy gains momentum, and central banks tighten policies faster, interest rates are expected to rise faster. So, accessing the debt market to finance buybacks would not be an easy task going forward.Plus, investors should also note that the S&P 500 is hovering around multi-year highs and a loose fiscal policy (if at all it materializes) may spur stock rally even further. Amid such inflated prices, buying back their own shares may not be a great idea for the corporations.ETFs in FocusWhatever the case, investors can keep a tab on the following buyback ETFs.PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio (PKW  -  Free Report) looks to track companies that have implemented a net reduction of 5% or more in shares outstanding in the last 12 months (see Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here). Another buyback ETF SPDR S&P 500 Buyback ETF (SPYB  -  Free Report) measures the performance of the top 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratios in the S&P 500 in the last 12 months.Yet another fund iShares U.S. Dividend and Buyback ETF (DIVB  -  Free Report) invests in U.S. companies that return capital to their shareholders through dividends or stock buyback.AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF (TTFS  -  Free Report) looks to generate long-term capital appreciation.Bottom Line  Call transcripts of tech biggies did not evoke any enthusiastic on dividends and buybacks. But not every company has been stingy, as per Financial Times. The article revealed that Pepsi (PEP  -  Free Report) plans to hike its dividend by 15%, make a one-time pension payment and speed up capital spending while Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) raised its plans for share repurchases to $6-$8 billion from $4-$7 billion.Overall, the outlook for buyback and dividend activity is neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic. It remains to be seen what decides the path of buyback ETFs — whether Trump’s tax plan benefits the activity or if the Trump rally and an all-time high corporate leverage come in the way of shareholder’s value maximization.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

1209,PG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Procter & Gamble Company  (PG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 9% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PG due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Second-Quarter Fiscal 2018 ResultsThe Procter & Gamble Company, popularly known as P&G, reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations. The company has also lifted its core earnings per share guidance to reflect the potential benefit from the Tax Act.P&G’s fiscal second-quarter core earnings of $1.19 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 by 3.5%. The bottom line increased 10% from the prior-year quarter. Currency-neutral core earnings per share (EPS) also improved 6%. The upside was primarily driven by increased net sales and a lower core effective tax rate.Sales in DetailsP&G’s reported net sales of $17.4 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.34 billion. The top line grew 3% from the year-ago level. Foreign exchange had a 1% positive impact on sales.Organically (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues grew 2% on the back of a 2% increase in organic volumes. However, price had a 1% negative impact on sales.Quarterly Segment DiscussionBeauty: The segment’s revenues grew 10% year over year to $3.2 billion. Organic sales increased 9%. While volumes increased 2%, price remained flat and mix added 7% to sales.Skin & Personal Care organic sales grew double digits driven by Olay brand innovation and continued strong growth of the super-premium SK-II brand. Hair Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by growth across all major brands — Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences and Rejoice.Global market share of the segment decreased 0.1%. The segment’s net earnings grew 21% to $655 million, attributable to lower SG&A expenses and productivity improvements.Grooming: Sales declined 1% to $1.8 billion. Organic sales declined 3% due to lower Shave Care sales. Price had a 4% negative impact on revenues. Organic volumes declined 1%, while mix remained unchanged from the prior-year level.Organic sales were down high single digits at Shave Care due to lower pricing in the United States and negative product mix. The segment’s net earnings dipped 10% to $423 million and global market share of the segment decreased 0.7%.Health Care: Healthcare products' sales grew 7% to $2.2 billion. Organic sales increased 4%. While organic volume grew 4%, price fell 1%. Currency had a favorable impact of 3% on sales.Oral Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by premium Oral-B power toothbrush innovation. Personal Health Care organic sales increased high single digits with increased consumption in the United States, driven by an early and intense Cough/Cold season, and strong international shipments from the PGT joint ventureGlobal market share of the segment decreased 0.1%. The segment’s net earnings were up 8% to $455 million.Fabric Care and Home Care: Revenues at the segment increased 3% to $5.4 billion. Organic sales grew 3% on volume growth of 3%.Fabric Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by unit dose detergent and scent bead innovation, as well as marketing and merchandising investments. Organic sales at Home Care also increased low single digits driven by marketing and merchandising investments.Global market share of the segment increased 0.2%. The segment’s net earnings improved 2% to $714 million.Baby Care, Feminine and Family Care: Revenues declined 0.7% to $4.6 billion. Organic sales fell 1% as volumes and prices each dropped 1%.Baby Care organic sales declined mid-single digits due to stiff competition and trade inventory reductions. Feminine Care organic sales grew mid-single digits driven by innovation on the Always brand and positive mix from premium tier growth. Family Care organic sales grew low single digits driven by recent Charmin innovation and strong consumption of Puffs.Global market share of the segment decreased 0.9%. The segment’s net earnings decreased 12% to $597 million.MarginsCore gross margin decreased 80 basis points (bps) to 50.7%, as productivity savings and higher sales were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, unfavorable pricing impacts and product reinvestments.Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) margin decreased 80 bps (as a percentage of sales) to 27.2% driven by productivity savings from overhead, higher revenues, agency fee and ad production costs. Core operating margin decreased 10 bps year over year to 23%.Productivity cost savings contributed 190 bps of margin benefit in the quarter. P&G has been cutting costs aggressively to reduce spending across all areas like supply chain, research & development, marketing and overheads.FinancialsAs of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $7.4 billion, up from $5.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2017 (as of Jun 30, 2017). Long-term debt was $22.2 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, up from $18 billion at the end of fiscal 2017.Cash flow from operating activities was $7.3 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2018, up from $6 billion a year ago.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceThe Cincinnati, OH-based company maintained its projection for the year and expects organic sales growth in the range of 2-3% for fiscal 2018. All-in sales growth is expected to about 3%.The company has lifted its core EPS growth projection to 5-8% (versus 5-7% expected earlier) compared with fiscal 2017 core earnings of $3.92 per share. The upbeat view primarily reflects the potential benefit from the Tax Act.On a GAAP basis, EPS is expected to decrease 30-32% (compared with 26-28% decrease expected earlier) from fiscal-2017 GAAP EPS of $5.59, which included a significant benefit from the Beauty Brands transaction that was completed in October 2016. The fiscal-2018 GAAP EPS estimate includes approximately 10 cents per share of non-core restructuring costs and 24 cents per share of non-core charges related to the Tax Act.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions lower for the current quarter.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and Consensus Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and Consensus | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, PG has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for value investors than those looking for growth and momentum.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, PG has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1210,PG,"U.S. economy has been on a rally since Donald Trump’s election victory. Trump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, increasing optimism among investors around a faster pace in economic growth and on the prospective passing of other policies of the President.However, with better-than-expected job growth, investors are betting on faster rate rises and inflation, causing havoc in the markets. In such a situation, investors generally flock to traditional defensive investments. However, these investments failed to protect investors in the most recent downturn.Market CorrectionPer data released by the Labor Department, wages grew 2.9% year over year in January compared with 2.6% in the prior month, the highest pace since April 2009. This introduced fears among investors of rising rates and inflation making a comeback.Moving on to interest rates, the Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation. Given this, markets are betting on the Fed to hike rates more than three times suggested earlier. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 71.9% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in March (read: 6 Ways to Build a Rate-Proof Portfolio With ETFs). As a result, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. This spooked investors and weighed on their risk appetite, which in turn made investors reallocate their portfolios.Defensive Funds in DetailLow-volatility ETFs are the go-to investment vehicles during times of high market uncertainty. These investments fared well in 2017, as high political uncertainty and geopolitical risks brought low volatility plays in favor.Low-volatility ETFs generally include utilities and staples stocks, and try to expose investors to high dividend yields. These funds invest in stocks that are viewed as “bond like” by investors for their steady business. Although this strategy is known to protect investors during uncertain times, the reason it did not work out in the recent selloff is that rising rate expectations were behind it. For instance, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report) has lost 5.8% so far in February.High dividend funds are known to be negatively correlated to rising rates. It is a good play to combat market uncertainty. However, with bond yields at record highs and the 10-year yield touching 2.81%, the appeal of bond-like equities declined. For instance, WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report) has lost 6.3% so far in February.As a result, it is no surprise that defensive funds failed to be in positive territory during the sell-off caused by fears over rising rates. As the Fed keeps on raising rates, these so called defensive investments might not be able to protect investors from the wrath of the correction. For instance, Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report) has lost 4.7% so far in February while Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has lost 5.6% in the period.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF targeting large-cap U.S. companies with low volatility.It has AUM of $7.1 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Financials, Utilities and Industrials with 20.9%, 19.7% and 19.2% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Honeywell International Inc (HON  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway BRKB and Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) with 1.3% allocation each. The fund has returned 11.2% in a year but has lost 3.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a Medium risk outlook.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends by applying quality screens. It has AUM of $2.0 billion and charges a fee of 28 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Information Technology, Industrials and Health Care with 20.2%, 18.7% and 17.5% allocation, respectively.The fund’s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil XOM, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) with 5.0%, 4.6% and 4.1% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 22.0% in a year but has lost 1.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3, with a Medium risk outlook.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and has AUM of $8.0 billion and charges a low fee of 13 basis points a year.The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble PG, Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 11.6%, 9.5% and 8.9% allocation, respectively.  The fund has returned 3.9% in a year but has lost 4.6% year to date. XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell), with a Medium risk outlook.Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report)XLU is one of the most popular funds in the utility space. The fund has AUM of $7.3 billion and is a relatively cheaper bet as it charges a fee of 13 basis points a year. It has an 11.4% allocation to NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), 8.0% to Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) and 7.8% to Dominion Energy (D  -  Free Report). The fund has returned 2.6% in a year but has lost 7.1% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #4, with a Medium risk outlook.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1213,PG,"After the worst first half performance since 2010, the Dow Jones has shown some strength at the start of the second half. This is especially true as the blue-chip index had its best day in a month on Jul 9, which pushed back the index to a positive territory for the year. The gains came on the back of a strong jobs report and Q2 earnings optimism amid trade tensions (read: Winning & Losing Sector ETFs From June Jobs Data).  Further, the index closed above its 50-day moving average for the first time in nearly three weeks, a positive sign for its short-term momentum trend. As such, its proxy version, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report), is in the spotlight heading into the earnings season.DIA in FocusThis is one of the largest and most-popular ETFs in the large-cap space with AUM of more than $20.6 billion and average daily volume of 5.5 million shares.

1214,PG,"Logitech International (LOGI  -  Free Report) recently announced that its board of directors (BOD) will seek shareholders’ approval to elect Marjorie Lao during the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) to be held on Sep 5 in Lausanne, Switzerland.Currently, Marjorie has been holding the position of chief financial officer in LEGO Group. Prior to this, she held leadership positions in companies like Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and McKinsey & Company.Guerrino De Luca, chairman of Logitech, commented that “It’s a pleasure to welcome Marjorie to Logitech. She brings with her extensive experience in global finance, senior leadership, business strategy and M&A from tech and brand marketing brands like Tandberg, Cisco and currently LEGO. She joins a fantastic team at an exciting time for Logitech.”In connection with the appointment of Marjorie, the company revealed that the two non-executive members of Logitech's board of directors, Sally Davis and Sue Gove, “have decided not to stand for re-election to the board at the 2018 AGM when their current terms end.”Apart from this, for fiscal 2018 the company’s board of directors has increased annual cash dividend payment by approximately 10% to CHF 0.67 per share. However, this is subject to final approval of the company's shareholders at the AGM. In this connection, the approximate payment date for the dividend is expected to be Sep 21, 2018.The hike in dividend is believed to be in line with Logitech’s capital-return policy. It should be noted that in March 2017, the company’s board of directors authorized a three-year share repurchase program of $250 million. Additionally, the company has also increased the size of its cash dividend every year since fiscal 2013.The company’s strong balance sheet and cash flow provide it with the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder-friendly initiatives. The company ended fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $642 million. Also, during the fiscal, the company generated a massive operating cash flow of $346 million, which marked the highest level in the last eight years.We believe the cash return initiatives not only enhance shareholder return but also raise the market value of a stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the script. Looking ahead, Logitech remains confident about its growth potential.Notably, Logitech has appreciated 29% against the industry’s decline of 16% in the year-to-date period.Zacks Rank & Other Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Logitech has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Another top-ranked stock in the broader computer & technology sector is Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report).

1215,PG,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IRWD  -  Free Report) announced the initiation of two phase III studies to evaluate its gastrointestinal candidate, IW-3718, for the treatment of persistent gastroesophageal reflux disease (“GERD”).The phase III studies will evaluate a 1500 mg dose of IW-3718 twice daily for eight weeks in patients with GERD receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) – the current standard of care – compared to placebo for reduction in heartburn. The primary endpoint of the study is a minimum 45% reduction in heartburn severity in GERD patients from baseline for at least four out of eight weeks, including at least one of the last two weeks.A look at its share price movement shows that the stock has outperformed the industry this year so far. Ironwood’s shares have gained 24.2%, while the industry registered an increase of 5.5%.We remind investors that the company had announced positive results in July 2017 from a phase IIb study evaluating IW-3718. Data showed that the addition of IW-3718 to PPI reduced heartburn severity by 58% from baseline against a 46% for PPI alone. Moreover, 52.9% of the patients treated with IW-3718 on top of PPI achieved a 45% reduction in heartburn severity from baseline for at least four out of eight weeks, including at least one of the last two weeks. This was achieved in 37.1% patients treated with PPI alone. However, we note that the results were below expectation.IW-3718 also reduced the frequency of regurgitation – acid rising into the throat and burning the esophagus – by 55.4% from baseline versus 37.9% reduction achieved by PPI alone.Per the press release, the number of adults with GERD is estimated to be 10 million in the United States and more than 60 million globally. A person associated with the study said that GERD patients are seeking new treatment options as they continue to suffer despite receiving treatment with PPIs which include AstraZeneca PLC’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Nexium and Procter & Gamble’s (PG  -  Free Report) over-the-counter drug,  Prilosec.Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1216,PG,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report), commonly known as P&G, entered into an agreement to acquire the consumer-health business of Germany-based Merck KGaA for approximately 3.4 billion euro ($4 billion). Per the terms, P&G will also acquire a 51.8% stake in India-listed Merck Ltd. The deal is expected to close during the 2018/19 fiscal year.Merck KGaA’s $1-billion consumer health business provides a wide range of over-the-counter (OTC) products for pain relieving products as well as for supporting physical activity and mobility. The business grew 6% over the past two years. The drug company is selling its consumer health business to focus more on its higher-margin pharmaceuticals business.Buyout BenefitsThe addition of Merck KGaA’s differentiated as well as physician-supported brands will enhance P&G's existing consumer health care capabilities and brands such as Vicks, Pepto-Bismol and Oral-B. It is expected to boost the company’s brand portfolio and category footprint.It will also expand P&G’s geographic footprint as Merck KGaA’s consumer health business is active in 44 countries and includes more than 900 products.P&G believes that the addition of Merck KGaA’s products will provide strong health care commercial and supply capabilities, deep technical mastery and proven consumer health care leadership.Termination of PGT JVImportantly, the acquisition of Merck KGaA’s consumer health business replaces P&G’s joint venture with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries — PGT Healthcare joint venture. This joint venture delivered disproportionate revenues and earnings growth and strengthened presence in more than 50 countries.After a recent review, Teva and P&G decided to terminate the venture as their priorities and strategies were no longer in sync.P&G's shares have lost around 11.4% in the last six months while its industry fell 4.5%. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 fell 0.2% over the last seven days. Nevertheless, the deal is expected to contribute at a time when the company is struggling with sluggish growth in global markets.  Zacks Rank and Key PicksP&G carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are Tyson Foods, Inc.

1218,PG,"Welcome to a Winter Olympics edition of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we explore the companies driving the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.The next two weeks are massively important for NBC Universal and its parent company Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), as the media conglomerate has spent billions of dollars to broadcast the Olympics for years to come.NBC outbid Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN to earn its domestic broadcast rights. The company has since sought to innovate its coverage through a recent streaming push and future-looking partnerships with firms such as Snap Inc. (SNAP).One of the main reasons NBC can justify spending this money is because advertisers are willing to shell out the cash to promote their brands during the global athletic showcase. This year, Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Famers Insurance, Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and many others are official NBC partners.But there are also 13 top dogs: the firms that spend over $100 million to become official International Olympic Committee sponsors. This list includes Visa V, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), along with recently added tech giants Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and Intel INTC—which will give fans a taste of its virtual reality capabilities from Pyeongchang.The Olympics are also a time for companies and apparel brands to attach themselves to athletes. Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) outfitted Team USA with gear for the opening ceremonies, while medal winners will sport Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) on the podiums. Even Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) got back in the action after some athletes panned its gear in 2014.And this year’s games were awarded to South Korea, due in large part to a push from the former head of one of the world’s most well-known technology companies.

1219,PG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Procter & Gamble has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.4. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Procter & Gamble’s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Procter & Gamble has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 19.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Procter & Gamble stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Procter & Gamble has a P/S ratio of about 3.3. This is marginally lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.As we can see, the stock is trading around its median value for the time period from a P/S metric. This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Procter & Gamble currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Procter & Gamble a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Procter & Gamble might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B. This gives PG a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current fiscal quarter has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen eight upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and Consensus  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and Consensus | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineProcter & Gamble is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 43% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock.However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick. Moreover, broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1221,PG,"Although the ‘Dogs of the Dow’ strategy has a history of outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the long term, it lagged in 2017, returning just 19% compared with 25% gains for the blue-chip index. Before 2017, the Dogs had generated outsized returns in six of the seven previous years, missing only in 2012.The ‘Dogs of the Dow’ represents the 10 highest-yielding blue chip companies of the Dow Jones Industrial Average that are out of favor with the markets and thus have higher dividend yields (due to depressed stock prices). High dividend yields suggest that these stocks are in the oversold territory and will rebound faster than any other stock when the fundamentals changes. As such, the strategy combines both the elements of dividend and value investing.Given this, honing in on stocks that are cheaper than their peers and unlikely to cut dividends could generate above-market returns and lead to juicy yields. In fact, the new tax legislation will act as the biggest catalyst to these stocks, as it would lead to dividend hikes, thereby resulting in higher shareholder returns (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks Set to Explode Higher on Tax Cuts).Let’s meet this year’s Dogs of the Dow.Dogs of the DowWhile eight of the 2017 Dogs of the Dow — Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil XOM, Chevron CVX, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) — are on the list, the astounding performance of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar CAT led to their departure. These two have been replaced by Procter & Gamble PG and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report). Investors should note that GE is an unusual inclusion in the Dogs given that it cuts its dividend in late 2017 (read: Steer Clear of GE, Bet on These Industrial ETFs Instead).The Dogs of the Dow could lead this year given that a recovery in oil and natural gas prices could spur outperformance in the two integrated oil giants. Both XOM and CVX are up 3.7% and 2.1%, respectively, to start the year. Additionally, General Electric – the biggest laggard last year – has turned into one of the hottest stock to start the year. The stock logged in the biggest weekly percentage gain since Nov 2016 in the first week of the New Year.However, the performance of the Dow Dogs differs from bull to bear markets and great caution needs to be exercised while investing in these companies. Still, those looking to invest in these stocks could do so in the basket form via ETFs with lower risk. Below, we have highlighted five ETFs with heavy exposure to the Dogs of the Dow that look exciting for 2018.ETF BetsELEMENTS DJ High Yield Select 10 ETN (DOD  -  Free Report)This is an ETN option and provides investors pure play to the 10 highest dividend-yielding securities in Dow Jones Industrial Average in equal proportions. It tracks the Dow Jones High Yield Select 10 Total Return Index and charges 75 bps in annual fees. The note has only $38.2 million in AUM while trades in a light volume of around 10,000 shares on an average daily basis. DOD shed 7.2% to start the New Year.ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs ETF (SDOG  -  Free Report)This fund applies the ‘Dogs of the Dow Theory’ on a sector-by-sector basis using the S&P 500. This could be easily done by selecting the five highest yielding securities in each of the 10 GICS sectors and equally weighing them. These higher yielding stocks will appreciate in order to bring their yields in line with the market, potentially leading to outsized gains. The approach results in a portfolio of 50 stocks with each security accounting for no more than 2.35% of total assets. The fund has accumulated $2.4 billion in its asset base and trades in a good volume of more than 146,000 shares. It charges 40 bps in annual fees and has gained 2.6% in the first few trading sessions of 2018.Guggenheim Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF DJDThe fund offers an alternative, strategic beta approach to the Dow Jones Industrial Average by weighting each security by dividend yield, rather than price. It follows the Dow Jones Industrial Average Yield Weighted index, holding all the 30 Dow stocks in its basket. The 10 Dogs account for 44.2% of the portfolio. The product charges 30 bps in annual fees from investors and has amassed $13.9 million in its asset base. It trades in a paltry volume of 5,000 shares a day on average and has added 2% so far this year (read: DOW ETFs: More Upside Ahead?).   iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV  -  Free Report)This product provides exposure to 74 dividend stocks by tracking the Morningstar Dividend Yield Focus Index. The nine Dogs of the Dow account for 46.4% of the portfolio, suggesting that the Dogs dominate the returns of the fund. HDV is among the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space with AUM of about $6.8 billion and average trading volume of around 262,000 shares. It charges 8 bps in fees per year and has added 0.6% in the first few trading sessions of 2018.First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (FDL  -  Free Report)With AUM of $1.7 billion, the fund follows the Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index. In total, it holds 97 stocks that have shown dividend consistency and sustainability with nine Dogs of the Dow collectively accounting for 48.8% of assets. Volume is good as it exchanges nearly 173,000 shares a day on average while the expense ratio comes in at 0.45%. The fund is up 1% so far this year (read: 6 Dividend ETFs of 2017 With At Least 3% Yield & 17% Gains).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1222,PG,"With the Dow breezing past the 25,000 milestone, President Trump believes even 30,000 is possible. The blue-chip index has relentlessly soared to record highs in the past year and has nearly quadrupled in value from the financial crisis in 2009. Enthusiasm over the Republican-led tax cut, which can boost corporate profits this year, and a series of strong economic reports helped the index move north by leaps and bounds.Given the positives, investing in blue-chip stocks seems tempting at the moment. Such companies are slated to gain further in the near term as they have large market capitalization, strong balance sheets and solid cash flow.Dow Bursts through the 25,000 Point MarkThe Dow kicked off 2018 with sizeable gains. The 30-stock index topped the coveted 25,000 mark and notched its biggest weekly gain since the period ended Dec 1, 2017. It just took 35 calendar days for the Dow to jump from 24,000 to 25,000, its fastest 1,000-point climb.The Dow has now extended its last year’s gain of 25%, helping the Bull Run that began in 2009, to post its second-longest run in Wall Street history. In fact, the index hit 71 record closing highs last year, the highest since the blue-chip index’s creation in 1896.Several gurus, who until recently called for a stock market correction, are now turning super bullish. They are predicting the Dow to hit 30,000 in the near term. Also, Trump said, “I guess our new number is 30,000.” He has already taken credit for Dow 25,000 and has become the first ever President in the history to have spoken so much about the U.S. equity market.Is Dow 30,000 Possible in Trump’s First Term?The recent tax code overhaul and a strengthening economy could certainly help the Dow breeze past 30,000 and help American blue-chip companies make more money.Republican-Backed Tax Package Republicans efficaciously defied opposition from Democrats to pass the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code that will trim corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. The corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help blue-chips bring funds held overseas back to the United States. Bringing back overseas cash pile will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities. They also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. The tax bill, in the meanwhile, will provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. This in turn will increase discretionary income that may give a boost to the demand for consumer goods and services (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Strong Economic GrowthU.S. manufacturing surged in December, touching the second-highest reading of 2017. Increase in sales from housing demand post-hurricane and a general uptick in the economy gave a boost to manufacturing activities. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), a diversified financial services company has predicted that the U.S. economy will expand an average 2.5% each quarter this year and the next.Economic recovery worldwide also gave a boost to profitability of American blue-chip companies, reduced the jobless rate to 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high set in November. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, added that “consumers’ expectations remain at historically strong levels, suggesting economic growth will continue well into 2018.”Some pessimists may argue that job addition numbers last month came in below expectations. However, the average over the past few months continues to show that the labor market remains strong, while workers’ pay has also increased 2.5% from Dec 2016 to Dec 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month. The National Employment Law Project, in fact, showed that minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States. This will result in inching employees wage closer to $15 an hour, which is known as “living wage.”5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Ride Dow’s Stellar RunThanks to the aforesaid bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp run up in the 120-year-old index of 30 stocks. This calls for investing in some fundamentally sound blue-chip companies which can make the most of this bullish run. We have, thus, zeroed in on five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1224,PG,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) said it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made next year and it may ultimately opt to retain the business.Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has returned 12.1% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 18% for the industry.The Consumer Healthcare segment includes several over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare medicines, vitamins, and personal care products, which can be sold without prescriptions. Important products among these are Advil pain relief tablets and Centrum multivitamins, which are two of the top-selling consumer healthcare brands globally. The segment recorded sales of almost 1.7 billion in the first half of 2017, representing growth of 2% year over year.Chief executive officer (CEO) Ian Reed said that the consumer unit is not core to its prescription drug business and its potential value will be “more fully realized outside the company”. Regarding its core pharmaceuticals business, in August, Pfizer said that it expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential. These include line-extensions for Xtandi, Ibrance & Xeljanz/XR. Half of these potential blockbusters are expected to receive approval by 2020.The funds from the potential spin-off of the non-pharmaceutical Consumer Healthcare business may make it easier for the company to achieve this goal.It is being apprehended that consumer health biggies like Nestle, Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) or Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) may be interested in buying the unit that Pfizer may put on sale.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1225,PG,"Tuesday, October 10, 2017It’s being called the biggest proxy fight in history: activist investor an co-founder of Trian Fund Management, Nelson Peltz, has been trying for months to attain a seat on Procter & Gamble’s (PG  -  Free Report) board of directors. The company has thus far disallowed the move, fearing disruption from high-profile Peltz. This morning — right now, in fact, P&G is putting it to a vote.No company remotely this large — P&G has a $235 billion market cap — has ever gone through this. Yet Trian routinely invests in big brand names, of which P&G has many — Charmin, Tide, Head & Shoulders and Downy, just to name a few. Trian itself owns interest in Pepsico (PEP  -  Free Report), Mondelez (MDLZ  -  Free Report), among others, and just yesterday gained a seat on General Electric’s (GE  -  Free Report) board. From Peltz’s perspective, this bid should be a slam-dunk. But the consumer discretionary giant has reportedly stated Peltz shouldn’t be granted a seat on the board “just because he can.”As an activist investor, Peltz has freely shared his opinion that P&G relies too heavily on its established products at the expense of innovation. P&G board members supporting CEO David Taylor, who took the reins not quite two years ago, are not taking kindly to Peltz’s forceful assertion that he should be given the seat. Thus we find ourselves in this current situation.Wall Streeters voting at P&G would tend to support Peltz’s entry to the board today. But 40% of P&G shareholders are retail, not insiders, and they would more likely be supporting the corporation’s status quo. At 1 P&G Plaza in Cincinnati, OH, the x-factor may be the index funds which swing the balance. Representatives from Vanguard, BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report), and the like are considering whether to push P&G in a more aggressive direction under Peltz’s influence, or safeguard this staple corporation of Southern Ohio.P&G currently employs roughly 95K people worldwide. Should Peltz win himself a seat, many feel he would push to further consolidate its workforce, which has already been trimmed more than 25% since the company put its internal reforms into play five years ago.

1226,PG,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) looks attractive on the back of its brand management initiatives, focus on e-commerce model and 2020 Strategy. Also, the company has delivered a robust start to fiscal 2018 as both first-quarter earnings and sales topped estimates and improved year over year.Consequently, the stock scaled a 52-week high $149.90 on Dec 22, though it closed a tad lower at $149.52. In the past three months, the company’s shares have gained 15.6%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 0.6%.Let’s make a detailed analysis of the stock.2020 Strategy – A Long-Term Growth DriverClorox remains keen on the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. In fact, the whole strategy is meant to achieve certain long-term aspirations including growing net sales by 3-5%, increasing operating margin by 25-50 basis points and generating free cash flow of 10-12% of sales, all on a yearly basis.The strategy is likely to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands, development of e-commerce, technological advancements, enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds - desire, decision and delight.Brand Strength & E-CommerceClorox's diversified brand portfolio positions it well ahead of peers to generate above-average industry growth. Further, it is focused on strong investments in demand building including digital marketing, e-commerce and product innovation. Also, the company’s Go Lean strategy in International remains focused on improving margins through operational efficiencies.Meanwhile, Clorox is keen on making strategic partnerships with retail customers and evolving capabilities offline as well as online. Apparently, the company recorded nearly 40% annual growth in e-commerce sales in the last two fiscal years.Bottom LineThough the company has also been gaining from its efficient cost-saving initiatives and improved international pricing, management trimmed its guidance for fiscal 2018. Earnings are now envisioned in the range of $5.47-$5.67 per share owing to the hurricane-related impacts and the divestiture of the Aplicare business. Further, inflation and high commodity and logistics costs may dent gross margin.Nevertheless, Clorox has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with a VGM Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.6%, which boost investors’ optimism on the stock.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Appeal You, Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Staples space include The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report), Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report) and Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.

1228,PG,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation’s (KMB  -  Free Report) shares have been dismal for a while. The company’s shares have plunged 12.5% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s decline of 9.1%. Its performance has primarily been affected by weak organic sales trend in the North American region. During the first and second quarters of 2017, organic sales from the region declined owing to high competition, reduced promotional shipments and lower net pricing.Although organic sales have been positive in the developing and emerging markets, its growth rate has decelerated in the past few quarters. Further, consumer dynamics have also shifted negatively toward Kimberly-Clark’s diaper offerings. Rising input costs are also hurting the company’s margins. Owing to such challenges, Kimberly-Clark issued soft earnings guidance for the full year, when it reported second-quarter 2017 results. The company now expects earnings per share at the low end of its previous targeted range of $6.20-$6.35. Following the company’s discouraging performance and dull outlook, the Zacks Consensus Estimate also witnessed a downtrend in the past 60 days. In the said period, estimates for 2017 have gone down nine cents to reach $6.22. Also estimated earnings of $1.55 for the third quarter depict a decline of five cents.  Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been striving hard to spark a turnaround. Let’s look into some of the initiatives undertaken by the company to improve performance.Product Innovations Kimberly-Clark dedicatedly focuses on innovations and product launches to improve market share. Recently, the company launched its new Kleenex Reveal Countertop System under the Kimberly-Clark Professional segment, to offer improved and exceptional hygiene products. The company has been providing greater importance toward the improvement of its personal care products portfolio, especially feminine hygiene and diaper products. Innovations related to the Huggies brand has been initiated in several regions such as in Russia and China. In the near term, the company has a number of innovations lined up for launch in North America, including upgrades on Huggies Snug and Dry diapers, Good Nights youth pants and Depend underwear. Savings Enhancing Initiatives Kimberly-Clark is also aggressively cutting costs through a program called Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE. The FORCE program has generated higher cost savings each year with $435 million in 2016, $365 million in 2015, $320 million in 2014, $310 million in 2013, $295 million in 2012 and $265 million in 2011. In fact, cost savings in 2016 exceeded the initial target of at least $350 million. For 2017, the company now expects to generate cost savings in the range of $425 to $450 million from the FORCE program, up from the prior estimate of $400 million.Restructuring efforts, which involve divestiture of lower-margin businesses and streamlining of manufacturing activities, have also resulted in significant savings for the company. Such efforts generated savings of $70 million in 2016, bringing the cumulative benefit to $140 million annually, compared with the original estimate for savings of $120-$140 million by the end of 2017.           Final Verdict We expect that the company’s innovation and restructuring efforts will aid toward driving its performance in the periods ahead. Moreover, the company currently carries a VGM Score of A and has a long-term growth rate of 6.7%.Considering the pros and cons, Kimberly-Clark currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

1229,PG,"While Wall Street is scaling multiple highs on Trump’s pro-growth reforms, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been an outperformer since election last year. This is because a strong rotation in leadership in the large-cap domestic space has benefited Dow Jones more than its other large-cap counterparts like the S&P 500 (read: High Beta ETFs & Stocks for Market-Beating Returns).Notably, the Dow Jones has returned 24.2% since the Election Day compared to a gain of 18.9% for the S&P 500.

1230,PG,"The Dow traversed a choppy week, marked by both gains and losses even as the much vaunted tax legislation finally gained legislative approval. The index increased on Monday on tax cuts hopes, but dipped on Tuesday following concerns that these changes may adversely impact future monetary stimulus. Another decline came on Wednesday following a pullback which occurred since investors had already priced in the impact of tax cuts. Ultimately, the index notched up gains on Thursday after banks and telecom companies pledged to provide better pay to their employees.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased by 0.6% last Friday, hitting a new all-time high following optimism that the much awaited Republican tax Bill had garnered sufficient support from policymakers to enable it to be passed the following week. Support from Senators Bob Corker and Marco Rubio raised expectations that the tax related legislation would not face any further obstacles to its passage.The index gained 1.3% last week following optimism over passage of the tax cut Bill and a higher rate environment. The Federal Reserve finally increased its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point. The new rate of interest will hover between 1.25% and 1.5%. Further, central bank officials reiterated their earlier projection of three possible rate hikes in 2018.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 0.6% on Monday following rising optimism that the much awaited Republican tax Bill was likely to be passed this week. This development is expected to reduce U.S. corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. The Dow notched up its 70th record close and advanced more than 5,000 points for the first time in a year. Additionally, a number of corporate deals also helped boost investor sentiment.The index lost 0.2% on Tuesday after optimism over the passage of the Republican tax Bill was outweighed by its likely impact on future monetary stimulus. Further, investors widely expected that the much-awaited tax cuts legislation would be passed this week, which in turn resulted in a stock sell-off.However, the House failed to comply with Senate rules on Tuesday, following which the House will re-vote for the tax Bill again on Wednesday. Housing starts rose to 1.297 million in November from the upwardly revised 1.256 million in October, well above analysts’ estimate of 1,251 million. Moreover, building permits increased by 3.4% year over year to settle at 1.298 million.The index declined by 0.1% on Wednesday as investors remained indifferent even as Congress passed the much-awaited Republican tax Bill.

Markets had already traded higher over previous sessions on optimism over the passage of the tax cut Bill and witnessed a sell-off after both the Houses actually passed the Bill.The index gained 0.2% on Thursday following gains in bank and energy stocks. Following the passage of the legislation related to tax cuts, major banks and telecom companies pledged to provide better pay to their employees, which in turn boosted investor sentiment.Additionally, energy sector rallied upward after WTI oil prices hit their second highest level so far in 2017.

(WMT  -  Free Report), soon to be branded Walmart officially, seems to be leaving no stone unturned to counter Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) rising dominance.

Takeout Kit offers a wide range of global options, whereas Home Chef’s offerings are more on the classic side.While Takeout Kit and Home Chef conduct the entire selling process, Walmart receives a small commission as well as a referral fee. The company’s meal-kit price ranges from $32 to about $79, with each kit serving roughly four people, as per media sources.

The company agreed to add Peltz to its board of directors as he had garnered so much shareholder support. “Because the election results were so close, and because a large number of shareholders voted for Nelson Peltz to be a Director, the Board has engaged in numerous discussions with Mr. Peltz regarding a Board seat,” the company said.

The joint venture is the biggest producer in the Gippsland Basin. It was rumored that Zacks Rank #3 ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton will be compelled to end the joint venture and sell gas separately.The companies argued that the joint venture bolstered the economy and the termination will make new investment and supplies in Gippsland Basin more complex.The primary concern was that big gas buyers were receiving not more than two offers for multi-year deals. This will be possible only when ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton start marketing gas separately Consequently, ACCC announced that the companies will sell their gas separately from the Gippsland Basin from 2019.Legal actions can be taken if the partners fail to comply with the decision.

This brings to an end a long running political struggle and is likely to boost markets in the days ahead. Evidence of such a trend was visible on Thursday when the promise of higher pay from major companies boosted stocks.Moreover, GDP data has exceeded expectations by a wide margin.

1231,PG,"After a prolonged proxy battle, activist investor and co-founder of Trian Fund Management, Nelson Peltz has been appointed to Procter & Gamble’s or P&G’s (PG  -  Free Report) board, effective Mar 1, 2018.Shares of the world’s largest consumer products maker by market value gained 1% in after-hours trading on Dec 15.The latest announcement came after P&G revealed last month that Peltz is leading Ernesto Zedillo by 0.0016%, or 42,780 shares, out of the company's nearly 2.7 billion in diluted shares outstanding. However, in its latest sec filing, the company said that the results between Ernesto Zedillo and Nelson Peltz were extremely close, with Peltz receiving almost 50% of the shares voted.P&G announced that Zedillo and 10 others were re-elected. The company agreed to add Peltz to its board of directors as he had garnered so much shareholder support. “Because the election results were so close, and because a large number of shareholders voted for Nelson Peltz to be a Director, the Board has engaged in numerous discussions with Mr. Peltz regarding a Board seat.” P&G said.P&G also revealed that the company had ""numerous discussions"" with Peltz on how to boost the company and not focus on cutting jobs or consolidating business units. P&G officials said Peltz has reaffirmed that he doesn't want the company to grow its debt, reduce research and development spending, break up the company or see it exit Cincinnati.Meanwhile, the consumer goods conglomerate increased its board size by two to 13 in order to accommodate Peltz and appoint a new director — Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis.It is to be noted that the company, currently under CEO David Taylor, is simplifying its operating structure to boost sales and profits. In contrast, during Peltz’s campaign, he had slammed P&G's ""stifling bureaucracy"" and advocated consolidating the company's business units radically from five to three standalone business units, namely grooming, home care and family care.Investors should note that P&G has been struggling to boost sales for the last few quarters. A soft consumer spending environment in the United States and slowing global market growth are pressing concerns for the company.Resultantly, P&G's shares have gained only 9.3% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 18%. Also, the trend in current-quarter and current-year earnings estimates is not satisfactory as it has remained stable over the past 30 days. Now, it is to be seen whether Peltz's inclusion would drive the company to focus more on acquiring small brands or bring in innovations. “I believe in the tremendous potential of P&G,” Peltz said in a statement on Dec 15. He added, “I look forward to bringing fresh perspectives to the boardroom, and working collaboratively with David and the rest of the board to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value.”Zacks Rank & Key PicksP&G currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) and Michael Kors Holdings Limited KORS, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Guess', Inc.

1232,PG,"It has been a tale of two very different indexes so far on Monday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged higher on the back of the Senate’s tax reform deal, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has slumped.The Dow’s rally today is being supported by continued strength in the financial sector. Index component JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) was up over 2.3% in morning trading, touching a new all-time high in the process.Meanwhile, investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs, which is one of the most heavily-weighted members of the index, was up about 1.5% on Wednesday morning. Other notable Dow stocks in the green include American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report).Shares of Disney gained as much as 6% in morning hours after reports of reignited buyout talks between Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) surfaced. According to the latest batch of rumors, Disney has started talking to Fox about purchasing some of its assets again, with a renewed focus on its fellow media giant’s TV and movie studios (also read: Why Shares of Disney, Fox & Comcast Surged Today).Led by these strong gains, the Dow gained about 1% in Wednesday morning trading, touching an intraday high of 24,534.04 in the process. On the other hand, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dove as much as 0.5% to reach an intraday low of 6,798.48.The Nasdaq’s sluggishness comes as investors continue to transition away from the technology sector, which has dominated Wall Street for the majority of 2017.More specifically, it looks like the red-hot semiconductor industry is starting to cool off, as shares of companies like Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) have all dropped significantly over the past few trading periods.Before this selloff, the Nasdaq had soared about 30% on the year, eventually settling at a new all-time high in late November. That run-up was inspired by another strong earnings report season, but now it appears that many investors are cashing out of the sector—with strong profits from this year’s rally.Additionally, the tech sector is still viewed as a high-volatility area by many investors, and recent geopolitical news may be forcing people towards more “safe and sound” options. Despite sector-wide earnings and revenue growth, Wall Street is quick to jump out of volatile areas when the threat of crisis looms—and it is probably fair to say that North Korea’s recent missile testing has caused that threat to rise.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1233,PG,"Shares of Snap Inc. (SNAP  -  Free Report) were up nearly 4% in morning trading Tuesday, putting the struggling stock on course to break a six-day losing streak that has watched the company shed more than 13% of its value.After closing at $13.22 per share on Monday, Snap opened modestly higher at $13.33 on Tuesday morning. Nevertheless, the stock quickly surged to an intraday high of $13.82 and eventually settled near the $13.70 level in early trading hours.Snap Inc. Price and Consensus Snap Inc. Price and Consensus | Snap Inc. QuoteTuesday’s gains put the social media company on pace to see its first positive day after six-straight negative trading sessions, which marks its second-longest losing streak in its short history as a publicly-traded stock. Snap’s longest losing streak occurred in early July and lasted eight trading days. Shares of the Snapchat parent lost nearly 15% during that decline. On Monday, the stock finished trading at its lowest closing price since August 16.Snap has failed to generate any momentum since its March debut, and shares now rest comfortably below their IPO price of $17. Nevertheless, this latest slump comes on the back of an industry-wide lull in the digital advertising space.As Marc Pritchard, the chief brand officer at Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), pointed out at a recent marketing conference in Cologne, digital advertisers seem to be running out of ideas—and someone desperately needs to save the day.“Bottom line, it is time for marketers and tech companies to solve the problem of annoying ads and make the ad experience better for consumers,” Pritchard said, via Ad Age.Those bullish on Snap see the company’s unique platform as an opportunity to be this hero. Although Snapchat’s disappearing messages and “story” mode ideas have been copied throughout the social media world, its location-based services are still relatively unparalleled, and it already has a head-start with developing short and engaging branded content.Nevertheless, the stock remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an overall VGM grade of “D.” In comparison, its social media nemesis Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) is currently rocking a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want more stock market analysis from this author?

(AAPL  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble Co (PG  -  Free Report) lost 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively, contributing primarily to the day’s losses for the index.Components Moving the Index Apple’s little snafu on stage while demonstrating the new facial recognition feature for its mega edition, iPhone X not only resulted in a wave of trolls and memes on social media but also gave competitors an opportunity to take potshots at the tech giant.Per reports, in a Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) ad post, Huawei took jabs (using a clown) at iPhone X’s facial recognition by stating it fails often and people should wait for the real artificial intelligence (AI) phone coming on Oct 16, 2017. This refers to its upcoming device, Mate 10.During Apple’s mega event on Sep 12, 2017, the company suffered a major embarrassment when the phone Craig Federighi was using to demonstrate the Face ID feature did not unlock and the software chief was forced to use the backup, which worked as it was required.

1236,PG,"Shares of Pinnacle Foods, Inc (PF  -  Free Report) have been underperforming of late, owing to underlying weaknesses in its Specialty segment and pickle business. The company’s share performance has remained dismal since it released second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, wherein sales were negatively impacted by the divestitures of its low-margin businesses.Further, shares of the company have also declined 3.5% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s fall of 1.5%.Investors seem to be disappointed with the company’s murky sales surprise history, whereby it missed estimates in 10 out of the past 14 quarters. Being a leading marketer and distributor of canned meat, shelf-stable pickles and frozen seafood, Pinnacle Foods has been struggling with consumers shift toward healthy and natural food products. Stiff competition, aggressive promotional spending and tight margins have also been bothering firms in the food industry.Considering its ongoing challenges, Pinnacle Foods now expects earnings for 2017 to be at the lower end of its expected range of $2.55-$2.60 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the forthcoming third-quarter 2017 results as well as for 2017 has also declined by a penny to reach 58 cents and $2.55 respectively, in the past 60 days. Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains hopeful on improving its performance backed by dedicated expansion initiatives. Let’s now delve into some of the efforts undertaken by the company to improve performance and the factors from which it has been gaining.Acquisitions Aiding Portfolio Expansion The acquisition of Boulder Brands, completed in January 2016, gave Pinnacle Foods a new growth platform for refrigerated foods and also added brands such as Udi's, Glutino, Smart Balance, Earth Balance and EVOL to the company’s portfolio. The benefits from the acquisition are expected to be spread over 2017, in areas such as procurement, manufacturing and logistics. The company received synergies of $15 million from the acquisition of Boulder Brand in 2016. It expects to achieve the same worth $15 million in 2017.The company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to expand its distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. Few noteworthy acquisitions of the company in the past include Duncan Hines, Garden Protein and Wish-Bone salad dressings.Initiatives to Enhance Savings & Margins The company has an operational excellence program in place designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. In fiscal 2016, the company’s operational excellence initiative drove productivity savings of 4%, as compared with 4.4% in fiscal 2015 and 3.7% in fiscal 2014.These productivity savings, along with higher pricing, have been mitigating the impact of input cost inflation to drive gross margins. The company continues to expect gross margin to improve 300 to 400 basis points by 2019.In order to enhance gross margin, Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives, including the improvement of its product mix through innovation. The company has also been exiting from low-margin businesses in order to utilize resources more efficiently.In this respect, the company had undertaken divestiture of Aunt Jemima frozen breakfast products in May 2017, and also closed down its Boulder UK operations in November 2016. Such rationalizing efforts have negatively impacted the company’s top line of late, in the long run. These initiatives are expected to aid Pinnacle Foods to focus specifically on growth oriented businesses.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

1237,PG,"In recent times, we have witnessed catastrophic hurricanes making landfall on the U.S. soil, missile launches over Japan by North Korea, global terror attacks and cyber breach at credit bureau Equifax and the Securities and Exchange Commission.The Dow Jones, however, continued to scale record highs despite the bad tidings. The blue-chip index extended its winning streak to six straight sessions after President Trump’s closest confidant Rex Tillerson denied that he has considered stepping down. Trump administration, in the meanwhile, is moving ahead with his new tax plan that further helped stock traders breathe a sigh of relief.But, the primary catalyst that is helping the 30-stock index gain ground is bullish economic data. The ISM services index expanded at the fastest clip in 12 years on the heels of a solid ISM manufacturing report. Needless to say, the U.S. economy is growing close to the range expected by Trump and some other Republicans. This has provided a fillip to U.S. corporate profits, while the Federal Reserve’s intention to hike rates exhibited the underlying strength of the economy.Given the positives, investing in blue-chip dividend paying stocks seems tempting at the moment. These stocks provide higher returns at lower risks, which are undoubtedly the ‘holy grail’ of investing. Dividend payers, moreover, have remarkable financial strength and are immune to market vagaries. After all, this month is traditionally known to be the most volatile for the broader market. The daily percentage change this month is 1.44%, compared with 1.08% for the other months.Before we cheery pick such stocks, here’s a look at the factors that helped the Dow Jones kick off October on a high note:Best Service Sector Growth in 12 YearsNon-manufacturing activity picked up in the United States to scale a 12-year high in September. Services Purchasing Managers’ Index was boosted by a rise in production and new orders. According to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), the non-manufacturing gauge came in at 59.8% last month, its highest reading since August 2005.The new orders index registered 63%, six points higher than that recorded in the previous month, while the production index, climbed to a five-month high of 61.3%. This encouraging report on service growth showed a steady recovery of the economy from the hurricane-related setback.Factory Activity Hits 13-Year HighA key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States scaled a 13-year high in September, courtesy of two major hurricanes. Increased demand for rebuilding supplies somewhat drove manufacturing activity. New orders, production, new export orders and hiring increased last month.According to the ISM, the manufacturing index climbed to 60.8% in September from 58.8% in August. Notably, 17 of the 18 industries reported growth last month, led by textile mills and machinery. Only furniture manufacturing witnessed a decline (read more: U.S. Manufacturing Activity Hits 13-Year High: Top 5 Winners).Economic Recovery Solid, Corporate Earnings EncourageThe U.S. GDP expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment drove the upside. Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter.The resilience of the domestic economy boosted earnings results. Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index were up 11.1% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues. This marked the second straight quarter of double-digit growth. Earnings growth is also expected to enter the positive territory in Q3. Total Q3 earnings are poised to be up 3.2% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues (read more: Handicapping the Q3 Earnings Season).Trump’s Tax Policy ProposalsTrump has urged the Congress to proceed faster with the corporate tax cut and had recently held a bipartisan group of House members at the White House to discuss a tax deal. He has been working on a major tax overhaul in more than three decades. Ever since 1986, the tax code hasn’t been restructured, when President Ronald Reagan along with a divided Congress broadened the tax base and slashed marginal tax rates.Trump proposed a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that would boost the U.S. economy and drive corporate profits. Such a tax cut included trimming of the business tax rate to 20% from 35%. Low corporate tax will benefit businesses of all sizes, as most of them will see an improvement in the bottom line (read more: 5 Stocks Blistering Higher on Tax Reform).5 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy for Solid GainsThanks to the bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp rally in the Dow.  The companies under the index are slated to gain further in the near term as they have large market capitalization, strong balance sheets and solid cash flow. They also return record amount of money to shareholders in the form of dividends.We have, thus, selected five blue-chip dividend paying stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1238,PG,"Unilever (UN  -  Free Report) is in the midst of a strong run that has seen its shares skyrocket to a new all-time high. New highs can sometimes cause investors to hesitate because they assume a stock will settle down, but our Zacks Style Scores can help investors find stocks that are still poised to grow, even as they sit near their historical peaks.Almost any investor could benefit by sticking to stocks with strong Zacks Ranks and high grades in our Style Scores systems. But for growth investors, it takes much more than simply looking for stocks with the highest growth rates. Understanding and evaluating quality is essential as well.This is where the Growth category of the Style Scores system comes into play. This category not only analyzes the growth prospects of a company, but also evaluates its corporate financial statements.Studies have shown that stocks exhibiting the best growth characteristics consistently outperform the market, and if investors add a strong Zacks Rank on top of those growth fundamentals, the returns are even better.With that said, let’s take a look at Unilever, a high Zacks Rank stock that also grades out well in terms of Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Unilever N.V. (UN  -  Free Report) Shares of the Anglo-Dutch consumer packaged goods giant, which owns brands such as Dove, Lipton, Ben & Jerry’s, Degree Deodorant, and many more, started to soar after a $143 billion merger attempt from Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) failed to go through.Since then, Unilever’s stock price has shot up 47.59% year-to-date and now rests just below its all-time high of $60.81 per share, which it hit on Sept. 11.Unilever has flexed its muscles since the merger failed. The company posted a 22% increase in net profits during the first half of its fiscal year, and it has begun to bolster its brand portfolio by adding companies such as British-based organic tea maker Pukka Herbs, which helps Unilever as consumers look for more eco-friendly and healthy options.The London-headquartered company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Unilever also sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system, as well as an overall VGM grade of “A.”Unilever’s projected EPS growth of 31.97% blows out the industry average of 7.71% and crushes Proctor & Gamble’s (PG  -  Free Report) 6.46%. The company also outpaces the industry with projected sales growth of 9.11%. Unilever’s 30.73% cash flow growth also helps to show that the company is on a solid growth trajectory, especially compared to the industry’s 7.28% average.The company also earned an “A” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system. This metric helps to indicate when the timing is favorable to enter a stock in order to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Bottom LineUnilever’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ranking and it’s “A” grades for both Growth and Momentum help demonstrate that the company is in a solid position, both today and going forward. Despite recently hitting a new all-time high, the CPG powerhouse might just be a stock to consider.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think. See This Ticker Free >>

1239,PG,"While most market participants will be paying close attention to results of the latest FOMC meeting today and tomorrow — where interest rates are expected to remain unchanged but an unwinding of the Fed’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet looks to begin in earnest — those in the Caribbean still recovering from Hurricane Irma two weeks ago now face another Category 5 storm: Maria. Currently barreling down on Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria has already caused severe damage to smaller islands in the region such as Dominica and Guadaloupe.According to reports from meteorologists, Hurricane Maria is one of the fastest growing hurricanes in recorded history. And with Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in its direct path, residents of the Bahamas and — yes — Southern Florida also look to take a wallop. Sustained winds of 160 mph and warnings that the storm’s damager could be “catastrophic” for the region, President Trump has already declared states of emergency in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Meanwhile, Hurricane Jose — which ventured back out to the Atlantic after briefly threatening the Southeast coast of the U.S. days after Irma made landfall — continues to create choppy surf up the Atlantic coast as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts. This storm appears reluctant to actually strike land, but the longer it remains in cyclone formation, the more prolonged the risk this happens is.The U.S. still works to recover from the two earlier hurricanes that struck this summer; Hurricanes Harvey (in Southeast Texas off the Gulf of Mexico) and Irma (in the Caribbean and up the Gulf coast of Florida) are estimated to claim an overall price tag of $290 billion. The estimated path of Maria — if it does strike the continental U.S. and doesn’t spin back out to sea like Jose did — would more likely arrive on the Atlantic side of Florida, Georgia and/or the Carolinas. But because the storm is traveling at just 9 mph currently, it is difficult to project when the storm is likely to make landfall. Perhaps not for another week, if at all.Nelson Peltz Faces a Storm of His OwnTurbulence for the founder and CEO of Trian Partners — activist investor Nelson Peltz — is impacting the news cycles ahead of the opening bell this morning: Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), the $240 billion market cap retailer of healthcare, grooming and home goods has issued a statement this morning that takes direct aim at Peltz’s investment performance. Recall Peltz is aggressively pursuing a seat on P&G’s board, which the company is apparently aggressively pushing back against.The analysis from the company’s report suggests that Trian tends to buy into companies when they are undervalued, they gain slightly over the next finite period of time, then sink back down to earlier levels. Even more pointedly, P&G’s report says that Trian’s best investments are those in which Nelson Peltz is not awarded a board seat. It is a rather unique approach to dealing with an activist bid, but then again P&G is the largest corporation to ever face such a challenge from an activist investor.

1240,PG,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) or P&G has been struggling to boost sales for the last few quarters. A soft consumer spending environment in the United States and slowing global market growth are pressing concerns for the company.Resultantly, P&G's shares have gained only 5% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 14.2%.Also, the trend in current-quarter and current-year earnings estimate revisions is not satisfactory as it has remained stable over the past 30 days. Nonetheless, this $65-billion conglomerate remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging, and marketing initiatives and productivity cost-saving plan.Initiatives to Counter Slow Sales GrowthP&G’s sales have remained subdued in recent quarters with net sales increasing a meager 1% in its first quarter of fiscal 2018. Organic sales increased 1% in the quarter, softer than the last quarter’s 2% growth. The slower growth rate was due to the challenges thrown by a tough base period comparison and 40 basis points (bps) impact from recent targeted pricing actions in U.S. blades and razors and ongoing portfolio clean-up efforts. Natural disasters were a further 30 bps headwind in the quarter as well.Importantly, this 1% organic sales growth was driven by volume instead of pricing, which has been flat. P&G could not push its prices up and has seen some inflation in input costs. Hence, margins have been trending down a bit despite continued productivity gains.Global category growth was below 2.5% during the quarter, a modest deceleration from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, with much of this slowdown occurring in the United States. While developing market growth was around 5%, developed market growth was just 0.5%. Weakening global share reflects poor execution in key markets of the company’s business.Nevertheless, management has outlined priorities to accelerate top and bottom-line growth. Importantly, in order to boost its profit level, P&G is re-working its supply chain to lower cost, reduce inventory and improve customer service levels by closing down underperforming plants, setting up new multi-category facilities, localizing manufacturing, upgrading, automating and standardizing operations and employing smart automation and digitization. Currently, the company expects to generate up to an additional $10 billion of cost savings over the next five years (fiscal 2017-2021) in areas including supply chain and cost of goods sold, marketing and digitization and promotional spend effectiveness.P&G’s adjusted earnings in the last reported quarter increased 6% from the year-ago level aided by productivity cost savings.

1242,PG,"The Dow enjoyed a strong week of gains, riding on stellar earnings results. The index declined on Monday due to a spike in bond yields, which dimmed the attraction of such safe haven stocks as telecom and utilities. But the index closed in the green on each successive day, closing Thursday at a record level. The Fed’s decision to refrain from raising rates at the end of its two-day policy meeting also lifted investor sentiment.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow lost 0.2% last Friday after General Electric Company GE posted a decline in second-quarter earnings and revenues. Furthermore, decline in oil prices adversely affected energy shares, which in turn weighed on the broader markets. As per Petro-Logistics, OPEC is expected to increase crude production by 145,000 barrels per day (bpd) this month.

Also, shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) fell 1.5%, dragging down the blue-chip index. This was largely due to the fact that Merck and Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) together with its South Korean partner Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd has started selling Renflexis, a less expensive alternative version of Johnson & Johnson's rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in the United States.The index gained 0.5% on Tuesday following stellar earning results from McDonald's Corp. MCD and Caterpillar Inc. CAT. Oil prices rose following Saudi’s decision to curb oil exports to the US.

1244,PG,"Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 5, after the closing bell.Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for eight consecutive quarters now, with a trailing four-quarter average of 18%. Let’s dive deeper to know what’s in store for this earnings season.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Helen of Troy is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Helen of Troy Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Helen of Troy Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Helen of Troy Limited QuoteHelen of Troy has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.37. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Earnings Estimate RevisionsLet’s look at the company’s earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about Helen of Troy, right before the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 has been stable in the last 30 days. The company reported earnings of $1.31 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.Furthermore, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $381.0 million for the to-be-reported quarter, representing growth of 3.5% year over year.Factors at PlayHelen of Troy’s shares have rallied 8.4% in the past month, substantially outperforming the Zacks Cosmetics industry’s gain of 1.2%. Currently, the industry is placed at the top 42% (107 out of 256) of the Zacks Classified industries.Additionally, we remain encouraged by the company’s solid brand portfolio and its transformation strategy that remains on track. In fact, its leadership brands like Braun, PUR, Honeywell, OXO, Vicks, Hydro Flask and Hot Tools are gaining traction in various markets.Also, Helen of Troy is exploring new opportunities for additional investments in product enhancement, expanding its footprint, digital marketing as well as e-commerce growth.However, the company is facing a tough retail landscape including sluggish brick-and-mortar business. Furthermore, it is facing intense competition in the personal care category, and is also being impacted by changing consumer preferences. In addition, Helen of Troy is witnessing sluggishness in its Nutritional Supplements and Beauty segments.Evidently, these factors hurt the company’s top line that has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last five quarters.Nevertheless, it is to be seen whether Helen of Troy is able to keep its positive earnings streak alive in the to-be-reported quarter.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.53% and a Zacks Rank #2.Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

1245,PG,"We expect food/beverage giant PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 4, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.91%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.18%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that PepsiCo is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components. Zacks ESP: PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of +0.27%. The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.43 per share for PEP compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 per share. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: PepsiCo currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.The combination of PepsiCo’s favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?PepsiCo has delivered revenue growth in the past three quarters banking on significant innovation, continued momentum in Frito-Lay business, revenue management strategies, along with better market execution. Moreover, it has been witnessing higher volumes and profits in the North American segments due to an improving economy, better industry pricing dynamics and a consistency in positive innovation.Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company in 2017. Keeping this in mind, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier Everyday Nutrition Products and the company believes that such products will play an important role in the long-term growth.That said, consumer tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies.Again, adverse currency movements continued to negatively impact the company’s revenues. In fiscal second quarter, foreign currency headwinds had a 1.5% impact on the company’s revenue growth. PepsiCo expects currency headwinds to adversely impact revenues by approximately 2%. The company expects the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 to negatively impact reported net revenues in fiscal 2017 by 1%.Coming to the company’s margins, PepsiCo had indicated that as the commodity inflation is expected to continue in 2017, the company’s gross margin might face some pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.Notwithstanding the above-mentioned concerns, the company beat expectation in the last six quarters. PepsiCo delivered revenue growth in the last three quarters after successive declines in revenues in the previous nine quarters. We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $1.42, reflecting a 1.5% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.42 billion, implying a 2.4% growth. Stocks to ConsiderHere are some consumer staples stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.68% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Oct 25.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1246,PG,"The battle for a seat on the board of The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) or P&G may now be drawing to a close. Hedge fund billionaire Nelson Peltz seems to have won a seat, albeit narrowly, after a recounted tally of votes was released on Nov 15.Shares of the world’s largest consumer products maker by market value gained more than 3% in after-hours trading on Nov 15. The news might have cheered P&G investors, who support management reshuffle in the hope of financial improvement.  P&G revealed Peltz is leading Ernesto Zedillo by 0.0016%, or 42,780 shares, out of the company's nearly 2.7 billion in diluted shares outstanding. In a preliminary count disclosed last month, Peltz fell short of winning by 6.2 million votes, after losing by 0.3% of votes cast.However, yesterday’s updated vote count is also a preliminary one, and subject to review and a challenge period. The company, currently under CEO Taylor, is simplifying its operating structure to boost sales and profits.In contrast, Peltz’s Trian Fund Management wants to radically alter the company’s corporate structure. Trian argued that P&G should be simplified further into three standalone business units, namely grooming ($26 billion in annual sales), home care ($21 billion) and family care ($18 billion).Native BuyoutIn a separate business development, P&G announced the acquisition of Native, a startup competitor that specializes in direct-to-consumer personal care products. Although the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, it marks P&G's first buyout in eight years.Bill Brace, P&G's vice president of North American Personal Care said in a statement that this addition will help P&G to expand its portfolio that already includes Secret, Old Spice and Gillette, to reach consumers avoiding ingredients like parabens and aluminum.Consumers have become extremely vigilant of the ingredients used in products. Native’s website proclaims its brand as ""deodorant that isn't a science experiment.”The purchase not only gives P&G another beauty brand in the field of natural ingredients, but also gives a solid foothold in digital sales. The Cincinnati-based consumer products giant said Native would appeal to consumers, who buy natural personal care items online and not in stores.Again, the acquisition could be an answer to Peltz, who in his quest for a seat on P&G's board, had earlier criticized the company for being slow in adapting to innovations and insisted on taking over small, on-trend companies. P&G, however, has largely focused on streamlining operations by divesting rather than acquiring in recent years.Share Price PerformanceP&G’s shares have gained 5% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the growth of the industry it belongs to. Earnings estimates for the current year have remained unchanged over the last 30 days. Meanwhile, P&G has surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company’s new product lineup, aggressive marketing, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives should boost its profits and thereby the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters.Zacks Rank & Key PicksP&G currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) and Tyson Foods, Inc.’s (TSN  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Unilever PLC (UL  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1247,PG,"The Consumer Staples sector has been garnering a lot of investor attention lately. The recent increase in volatility and uncertainty in the markets has increased the appeal of defensive sector investments like Consumer Staples.Cause for AppealOn Oct 19, the Senate passed a budget of $4 trillion in a 51-49 vote, which will allow the Republicans to move ahead with the tax cuts with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote supermajority that is generally required. However, uncertainty is mounting on the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform. Per Washington Post reports, Senate Republican leaders are weighing the impact of a one-year delay in reforms.The primary concern weighing on the timely passing of the tax reform is that the House and Senate’s respective versions vary significantly. This might then pose some challenges in the passing of the reform without a few key changes.Moreover, the Republicans have a slim majority in the Senate. If Roy Moore is defeated in the Dec 12 elections, the majority will be further reduced. This increased uncertainty has led to the relative appeal of staples.Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and tracks the Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $7.9 billion and charges a low fee of 14 basis points a year. It has 34 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 68.5% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Beverages, Household Products and Food & Staples Retailing, with 24.6%, 20.9% and 20.0% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 12.7%, 10.0% and 9.1% allocation, respectively (as of Nov 13, 2017).  The fund has returned 8.0% in a year and 5.6% year to date (as of Nov 13, 2017). XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index. It has AUM of $3.7 billion and charges a fee of 10 basis points a year. It has 102 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as almost 62% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Household Products, Soft Drinks and Fertilizers & Packaged Foods & Meats, with 19.6%, 19.1% and 17.1% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola Co and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) with 11.6%, 9.0% and 8.5% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund has returned 7.1% in a year and 4.2% year to date (as of Nov 13, 2017). VDC has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a High risk outlook (read: ETFs in Focus After Phillip Morris's Downbeat Results).Bottom LineXLP is more popular than VDC, as is evident from its higher AUM. However, VDC may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  Moreover, VDC also has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings.At the same time, both the funds have had relatively similar year-to-date performance. XLP returned 1.4% more than VDC so far this year, whereas in a year, XLP outperformed VDC by 0.9%. With growing uncertainty in the markets, these ETFs are poised to offer better growth potential. However, the sector has had relatively poor performance so far this year, owing to investors’ risk appetite. Moreover, if the tax reforms are enacted, the appeal of such defensive investments will be lost as investors will seek riskier investments.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1249,PG,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a range of branded consumer packaged goods within five different operational segments including: Beauty, Grooming, Health care, Fabric care and Home care, and Baby Care and Family Care. More importantly, the company will be releasing its quarterly earnings report before the market opens on July 27.Procter & Gamble currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has beaten its earnings estimates in a whopping nineteen of its past twenty operational quarters dating back to 2012, including a modest beat last quarter of 2.13%. Furthermore, Procter & Gamble operates in the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, which currently ranks in the top 4% on the Zacks Industry Rank.Procter & Gamble features a stable Zacks Rank, an impressive earnings performance history, and an Earnings ESP of 1.28%.  All of these factors should allow investors to possess optimism as we approach its quarterly earnings release.If not that is not enough to convince you of Procter & Gamble’s positive outlook, here are three additional reasons to remain optimistic about the company ahead of earnings:1.       Strong Market share in Key PositionsProcter & Gamble’s products possess strong brand recognition and are sold in more than 180 countries. The company enjoys leading positions in over 75% of the categories in which it competes. Procter & Gamble’s 20 Billion Dollar Brands are some of the world’s most common household names. These products have reached the Billion Dollar Brand status through sustained product innovation and geographic expansion.Procter & Gamble now holds a portfolio of about 65 consumer and shopper-preferred brands, focusing on 10 categories organized under four industry-based sectors, which have historically grown faster and have been more profitable than others. The company’s long-term goals include growing organic sales modestly above market growth, achieving core earnings growth in mid-to-high single digits, and generating free cash flow productivity of over 90%.2.       Commitment to Saving Costs and Improving ProductsThrough March 2017, the company reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by 26% and expects to reduce non-manufacturing or overhead roles by about 30% by the end of fiscal 2017. Now, the company expects to generate up to an additional $10 billion of cost savings over the next five years in areas including supply chain and COGS, marketing and digitization, and promotional spending effectiveness.Procter & Gamble is attempting to reorganize its supply chain to lower costs, reduce inventory, and improve customer service level by setting up new multi-category facilities and localizing manufacturing.  Management also highlighted initiatives to drive e-commerce, a $3 billion business for Procter & Gamble, making the company’s aggregate (online) market share commensurate with its offline share.3.       Earnings Growth in Key DivisionsProcter & Gamble is projected to announce increases in net earnings throughout multiple areas of the company. For example, according to our consensus estimates, net earnings for its Health Care division are expected to increase by 4.6% to about $272 million for the quarter. Also, Procter & Gamble’s Fabric and Home Care division is projected to post a net earnings increase of 6.4%, lifting the segment to a quarterly total of around $644.5 million.These consensus estimates are from our exclusive non-financial metrics estimate file.

In the preceding quarter, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping for a positive earnings surprise from Costco in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $2.01, reflecting a year-over-year increase of over 13%. We observe that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $41,739 million, up 14% from the year-ago quarter.Model Predicts Lower ProbabilityOur proven model does not conclusively show that Costco is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Costco has an Earnings ESP of -0.73%. Notably, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

Moreover, Costco continues to maintain a healthy membership renewal rate. Further, it is gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, U.K., Mexico, Taiwan and Korea. We are also encouraged by the company’s expansion strategy, as it remains committed to opening new clubs in the domestic and international markets. However, stiff competition and cautious consumer spending remain causes of concern.3 Stocks with High Probability to Beat EstimateHere are three stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Constellation Brands, Inc.

1253,PG,"We expect the leading alcohol company, Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 5.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.2%. In fact, its earnings have outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 11.7% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Constellation Brands Inc QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Constellation Brands will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. The current estimate of $2.16 per share for the to-be-reported quarter reflects year-over-year growth of nearly 22%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.06 billion, which is 1.9% higher than the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has outperformed the industry year to date. The company’s shares have surged 30.1%, while the industry grew 19.9%.Factors at PlayConstellation Brands has been on a roll owing to its strong brand portfolio, strategic initiatives and robust quarterly results. The company’s focus on brand building, strength in beer business and efforts to include new products in its wine and spirits portfolio are the key catalysts. Further, it has been gaining from effective integration and growth of recently acquired brands, higher margins, solid overall depletion trends and strong consumer demand.In fact, these factors assisted the company to showcase another sterling performance in first-quarter fiscal 2018, marking its 16th straight quarter of earnings growth year-over-year and 11th straight positive surprise. Moreover, sales advanced while favorable pricing, volumes and lower cost of goods sold provided a boost to margins.Further, the company continues to gain from the recent buyouts and strength in the beer business, which encouraged management to raise fiscal 2018 earnings view. Management also hiked fiscal 2018 operating income targets for the beer segment. The company now envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $7.90-$8.10 per share. Operating income is now expected to grow 13-15% for the beer segment.The company is also on track with its Nava brewery expansion, while it also enhanced its wine portfolio with the buyout of Schrader Cellars. These factors make us optimistic about the company’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Constellation Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The Most Accurate estimate is $2.17 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.16 per share.

1254,PG,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) continues to progress well with its savings programs along with a disciplined capital strategy and other initiatives. However, the company has a dismal sales trend.Savings Programs Bode WellColgate remains committed to its savings programs as both Global Growth and Efficiency Program (or 2012 Restructuring Program) as well as Funding the Growth initiatives are delivering impressive results.Furthermore, the company stated that the additional savings opportunities identified under the program in the second quarter of 2017 provide visibility to reach the upper end of its previously announced cost and savings guidance range. Consequently, the company expects both GAAP and adjusted gross margin to expand in 2017.Markedly, this four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share position worldwide.Meanwhile, through funding growth initiative the company aims at opening new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers while reducing fuel and transportation costs. These programs are anticipated to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Other CatalystsColgate commands a market-leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories. In fact, innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles of the company’s growth strategy over the years, thus enabling it to capture market share across all regions and categories. Management further expects to grow market share in 2017 via a series of innovative product launches lined up for the year.Going forward, the company remains focused on four fundamentals to boost profits including, increased spending on more impactful advertisements, innovation across portfolio of businesses, higher spends on high growth e-commerce business and aggressively maximizing productivity.Additionally, Colgate has always followed a disciplined capital allocation strategy. This strategy focuses on making investments to develop business while using the excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks owing to its strong cash generation ability.Stellar Earnings TrendColgate, which shares space with Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report), The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report), The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has been infamous among investors with its meet or beat earnings track record. Notably, the company has posted in-line earnings in four of the last seven quarters while it surpassed estimates in the remaining three.ConcernsColgate has a dismal sales trend as its top line has lagged estimates in 16 of the trailing 17 quarters. In fact, the company’s second-quarter results marked its fifth straight sales miss. Sales in the quarter were hurt by the persistence of softness in North America and challenges in Asia-Pacific. Furthermore, low global unit volumes and negative currency fluctuations were deterrents.Management anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide in the near term.Bottom LineWhile the soft sales trends indicate weakness, we remain confident of the company’s growth prospects, given its innovation track record and ongoing initiatives. We believe the company’s actions will help counter the dismal sales trends. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1255,PG,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens. Last quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.13%.In fact, despite sales remaining subdued, the consumer goods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 3.97%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderProcter & Gamble has been struggling for the last few years to boost sales. Notably, the company’s sales declined in the last 13 consecutive quarters. Major foreign exchange headwind, weak volumes, divestitures and slowing market growth have been hurting the company’s sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets also adds to the worries.The trend is not likely to change for the to-be-reported quarter. Softness in the U.S. and volatility in developing markets will likely have an adverse impact on Procter & Gamble’s results. In fact, categories in the company’s largest and profitable market, the U.S. (accounting for 40% of net sales), grew by less than a point in the fiscal third quarter, a lot lower than the roughly 2% growth registered in the first half of fiscal 2017. Overall, the company posted flat organic sales growth in developed markets.Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble has been taking various restructuring initiatives aimed at generating higher profit and lowering costs. These initiatives have helped the company to accelerate margins growth amid the slowdown in sales. However, fiscal third quarter’s gross as well as operating margins fell despite benefitting from productivity savings. This was due to higher input costs, a planned increase in marketing spending, higher R&D costs, and lower pricing due to increased competition.Hence, lower sales accompanied by higher commodity costs, more investments for marketing and increased R&D spending to push demand might adversely affect margins, thereby putting pressure on bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. This will be partly offset by cost-saving measures.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 78 cents, reflecting a decrease of 0.8% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $15.98 billion, implying a 0.8% decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Procter & Gamble is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Procter & Gamble’s Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 78 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Procter & Gamble’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a few consumer staples companies that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +2.36% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1256,PG,"On Friday, shares of fuel cell maker Plug Power (PLUG  -  Free Report) are soaring, up over 10% to $2.34 per share in morning trading after the company announced a new expanded deal with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report). Shares of the brick-and-mortar retailer are down a slight 0.37% in same time frame.As part of the partnership, Plug Power will provide its GenKey hydrogen fuel station and fuel cells to up to 30 additional Walmart store locations in North America over the next three years. The company was operating 22 Walmart sites at the end of last year, and deployed a new site every six weeks since 2014.Another aspect of the deal expansion includes the issuing of warrants to Walmart for the purchase of up to 55.3 million common shares of PLUG, with the first 5.8 million bought after the transaction is completed. The shares’ total value is worth roughly $600 million, and Walmart plans on paying Plug Power in $50 million installments.Plug Power’s GenKey technology offers customers ""a complete range of turnkey services to streamline the entire hydrogen and fuel cell-adoption process,” including a GenDrive or GenSure hydrogen fuel-cell system; GenFuel hydrogen infrastructure and fuel; and GenCare aftermarket customer service and support.There aren’t many companies offering turnkey solutions like Plug Power, so its recognition throughout the industry is widespread. And, Walmart isn’t the only partnering with Plug Power; Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Sysco (SYY  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have all deployed GenDrive units throughout their business.Currently, PLUG is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank. Shares of the company have gained about 77% so far in 2017.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

1257,PG,"Earnings Preview 7/30/10
"
1258,PG,"Earnings season will be still going strong next week. There will be 1,161 firms reporting, including 106 S&P 500 firms. The firms reporting are some of the biggest and most important bellwethers of the economy, and slice across a wide spectrum of industries. Included in next week's line up are: Archer Daniels Midland (ADM  -  Free Report), Dow Chemical (DOW), Duke Power (DUK), Kraft Foods (KFT), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Time Warner (TWX). By the end of the week, more than seven-eighths of the earnings will be in for the S&P 500.
"
1259,PG,"In addition to earnings there will also be a very busy week for economic data. We start with Construction Spending and end the week with the all-important employment report on Friday. In between, we get both the ISM Manufacturing and Service surveys, personal Income and Spending and Auto Sales. More than enough data on the economic front to significantly move the markets.MondayConstruction Spending is expected to have dropped by 1.0% in June on top of a 0.2% decline in May. On the commercial side, the vacancy rate for offices and shopping centers remains very high, which limits the need to build more of them. On the residential side, new housing starts have been weak, as have building permits, indicating weak spending on that side as well.The ISM manufacturing index is expected to fall to 53.5 in July to 56.2 in June. Any reading over 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is expanding, but a reading of 53.5 would mean a much slower rate of expansion than in June, and June was off from 59.7 in May. This spring, the manufacturing sector was the star of the recovery, but that star appears to be dimming. In addition to the main index, it is important to look at the key sub-indexes for the current level of production and the rate of new orders and employment.TuesdayPersonal Income is expected to have grown by 0.2% in June, down from 0.4% growth in May. At the same time, personal spending is expected to be up just 0.1% down from 0.2% in May. If income is rising faster than spending, it means that the savings are is going up. Over the long term that is a good thing, but in the short term it means lower economic growth. The savings rate is still very low by any historical perspective, and is also low relative to that of almost every other major economy. Unfortunately, there is no way to go from a low savings rate to a high one with out the savings rate rising. However, spending going up slower than income is less painful than income falling more slowly than spending.The Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the Core PCE price index, is expected to have risen only 0.1% in June, down from 0.2% in May. Clearly runaway inflation is not a major threat right now. The big danger is that we might actually slip into deflation, which would be a very negative thing for the economy.Factory orders are expected to be up 0.8% in June after falling 1.4% in May. Given the weak report for new orders for durable goods, don’t be surprised if this comes in lower than the “official expectations.Detroit will release its auto sales for July. Auto sales are expected to have rebounded slightly to an annual rate of 3.9 million from 3.7 million in June. However, light truck sales, like pick ups and SUVs, are expected to have dropped to a 4.5 million rate from 4.8 million. While the sales rate on both Autos and Trucks will be higher than a year ago, they remain very depressed compared to pre-recession levels.WednesdayThe ADP employment report serves as an appetizer for the main BLS report on Friday. It focuses just on private sector payrolls, and ADP is in a good position to know, since it actually cuts the paychecks for most major corporations. It is expected to show a gain of 30,000 private sector jobs in July, up from a gain of just 13,000 in June. That, however, is not the sort of growth that is needed to put a serious dent in the unemployment rate, but it sure beats losing jobs hand over fist like we were a year ago.The ISM service index covers a much bigger part of the U.S. economy than does the ISM manufacturing survey, but does not have as long a history. Like the Manufacturing survey released on Monday, any number over 50 indicates expansion. The July number is expected to have dipped slightly to 53.2 from 53.8 in June. That means the economy is still expanding but at a somewhat slower rate.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 11,000 in the last week, to 457,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have become very erratic so far in 2010. Look for them to fall modestly again next week. Longer term, we have made good progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 640,000 on a consistent basis, but still have a ways to go. Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. But last week they rose by 81,000 to 4.565 million. That is still down 1.570 million from a year ago. Part of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims fell by 269,000 to 4.577 million. However that is due to even the extended claims running out as a bill to further extend benefits has been stalled in the Senate. The filibuster was eventually overcome two weeks ago. Given the delays in the data, next week will again show a big increase due to the people who were thrown off the benefit rolls due to the Senate delay coming back into the system. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 8.225 million, which is down 188,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.2 million below year-ago levels. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.FridayThe biggest number of the week comes at the end of the week when the employment report comes out. It is expected to show a loss of 116,000 jobs on top of a loss of 125,000 jobs in June. However, the situation is not quite that bleak, more than all of the jobs lost in June were due to temporary Census workers completing their jobs, and the same is likely to be true in July. We will probably see a modest gain in private sector payrolls (the ADP number is a reasonable forecast).The Unemployment rate (U-3) is expected to tick up to 9.6% from 9.5% in June. That is partly due to the end of Census jobs, and partly due to people who have been out of the workforce expected to jump back into the workforce. In addition to the unemployment rate, which gets all the headlines, look at the actual employment rate, or the percentage of the population that is actually working. Unless we totally do away with the idea of retirement and scrap all child labor laws that rate will never get close to 100%. However, it has been in a steep downtrend, in recent years.Other key measures in the employment report to look at include the average work week, which is expected to be unchanged at 34.1 weeks in July, and average hourly earnings, which are expected to rise by 0.1% in July after falling 0.1% in June. While a slight increase is better than a decrease, it is not enough to give consumers that much firepower to increase spending and thus power the economy forward. Another thing to look at will be the number of long-term unemployed and the duration of unemployment metrics. In June, the median duration of unemployment was 25.5 weeks, more than twice as long as the record prior to the Great Recession. Long term unemployment is a very different experience than the “unplanned vacation that short-term unemployment represents.Even with the anemic growth in incomes (see the expectations for average hourly earnings and personal income) consumers have been trying to repair their tattered personal balance sheets. In addition to saving more, they have been paying down consumer credit (which does not include mortgages). In June, consumer credit fell by $9.1 billion. Look for another decline in July.Potential Positive Surprises
"
1260,PG,"Historically the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. While normally firms that report better-than-expected earnings rise in reaction, that has not been the case so far this quarter.American Tower (AMT) is expected to report EPS of $0.20 versus $0.13 a year ago. Last time out AMT beat the consensus by 33.3%, and over the last four weeks the mean estimate has risen by 0.29%. AMT is a Zacks #2 Ranked stock.Expeditors International (EXPD) is expected to report EPS of $0.39 versus $0.25 a year ago.  Last time out EXPD beat the consensus by 3.6% and over the last four weeks the mean estimate has gone up by 28.3%. EXPD is a Zacks #1 Ranked stock.Tenent Health (THC) is expected to report EPS of $0.06 versus $0.05 a year ago. Last time out THC beat the consensus by 128.6%, and over the last four weeks the mean estimate has gone up by 6.5%. THC is a Zacks #1 Ranked stockPotential Negative Surprises
"
1261,PG,"Dean Foods (DF) is expected to report EPS of $0.25 versus $0.43 a year ago. Last time out DF disappointed by 17.9%, and over the last four weeks the mean estimate has fallen by 1.2%. DF is a Zacks #4 Ranked stock.Electronic Arts (ERTS) is expected to report a loss of $0.50 versus a loss of $0.12 a year ago. Last time out ERTS reported in line with expectations, and over the last four weeks the mean estimate has dropped by 1.6%. ERTS is a Zacks #5 Ranked stock.

1263,PG,"Investors will be inundated with earnings reports this week. More than 800 companies are scheduled to release third-quarter reports. Within this group are 149 S&P 500 members, including Dow components Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report).
"
1264,PG,"We'll get our first look at how well the economy fared in the third quarter with the advance GDP report. Economists are expecting a return to growth with a 3.1% expansion. Any number below 3% could cause a negative reaction in the equity markets.

"
1271,PG,"Although third-quarter earnings have been running above expectations, the major indexes have stayed in a relatively narrow range ever since the Dow broke above 10,000. The blue-chip average has found resistance at about 10,160. This sideways action is not surprising given that the rally has lasted for more than 7 months. The only concern is the recent trend of volume being higher on down days than up days. Nonetheless, the bull continues to breathe and a further move upward is still possible.
"
1272,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings SurprisesJones Apparel Group (JNY) has topped expectations for 5 consecutive quarters.

McKesson is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Oct 27, after the close of trading.
"
1274,PG,"Owens Corning (OC  -  Free Report) has issued positive earnings surprises for 3 out of the last 4 quarters. Judging by the recent trend in estimate revisions, analysts believe the company could surprise again.

"
1275,PG,"The third-quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for Penske Automotive Group (PAG  -  Free Report) rose this week to 27 cents per share. Two analysts boosted their forecasts, a sign of optimism about the forthcoming report. The most accurate estimate is even more bullish at 29 cents per share.

"
1276,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesSprint Nextel (S) has issued 2 negative earnings surprises in the past 4 quarters.

1281,PG,"Tuesday, September 19, 2017While most market participants will be paying close attention to results of the latest FOMC meeting today and tomorrow — where interest rates are expected to remain unchanged but an unwinding of the Fed’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet looks to begin in earnest — those in the Caribbean still recovering from Hurricane Irma two weeks ago now face another Category 5 storm: Maria. Currently barreling down on Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria has already caused severe damage to smaller islands in the region such as Dominica and Guadaloupe.According to reports from meteorologists, Hurricane Maria is one of the fastest growing hurricanes in recorded history. And with Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in its direct path, residents of the Bahamas and — yes — Southern Florida also look to take a wallop. Sustained winds of 160 mph and warnings that the storm’s damager could be “catastrophic” for the region, President Trump has already declared states of emergency in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Meanwhile, Hurricane Jose — which ventured back out to the Atlantic after briefly threatening the Southeast coast of the U.S. days after Irma made landfall — continues to create choppy surf up the Atlantic coast as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts. This storm appears reluctant to actually strike land, but the longer it remains in cyclone formation, the more prolonged the risk this happens is.The U.S. still works to recover from the two earlier hurricanes that struck this summer; Hurricanes Harvey (in Southeast Texas off the Gulf of Mexico) and Irma (in the Caribbean and up the Gulf coast of Florida) are estimated to claim an overall price tag of $290 billion. The estimated path of Maria — if it does strike the continental U.S. and doesn’t spin back out to sea like Jose did — would more likely arrive on the Atlantic side of Florida, Georgia and/or the Carolinas. But because the storm is traveling at just 9 mph currently, it is difficult to project when the storm is likely to make landfall. Perhaps not for another week, if at all.Nelson Peltz Faces a Storm of His OwnTurbulence for the founder and CEO of Trian Partners — activist investor Nelson Peltz — is impacting the news cycles ahead of the opening bell this morning: Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), the $240 billion market cap retailer of healthcare, grooming and home goods has issued a statement this morning that takes direct aim at Peltz’s investment performance. Recall Peltz is aggressively pursuing a seat on P&G’s board, which the company is apparently aggressively pushing back against.The analysis from the company’s report suggests that Trian tends to buy into companies when they are undervalued, they gain slightly over the next finite period of time, then sink back down to earlier levels. Even more pointedly, P&G’s report says that Trian’s best investments are those in which Nelson Peltz is not awarded a board seat. It is a rather unique approach to dealing with an activist bid, but then again P&G is the largest corporation to ever face such a challenge from an activist investor.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1282,PG,"On Sep 7, The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) or P&G highlighted key strategies, at the Barclays Consumer Staples Conference, that are resulting in impressive results.P&G has been able to significantly boost growth on the back of strong brand portfolio, significant productivity improvement, supply chain transformation and organizational changes.P&G’s products enjoy strong brand recognition and are sold in more than 180 countries. It streamlined its business to focus more on its biggest brands. From 170 brands classified into 16 categories, P&G now has a portfolio of 65 brands organized into 10 categories. We believe that a smaller and more focused company should be able to grow faster, create more value and be much easier to manage. This positions the company for stronger sales and earnings growth.The company aims to generate up to an additional $10 billion from productivity improvements over the next five years (fiscal 2017-2021) in areas such as supply chain, marketing, digitization and promotional spend effectiveness. P&G’s earlier $10-billion productivity improvement plan that ended in fiscal 2016 has helped the company offset $7 billion of foreign exchange headwinds along with the effects of wage rate inflation and deconsolidation of Venezuela. Over the last four years, adverse foreign exchange has hurt sales by 19%.Over the last five years, constant currency core earnings per share have grown 11% on average, while core gross margin improved 200 basis points (bps) and core operating margin 270 bps. The company’s aggregate core operating profit margin is the third highest in the industry. Also, it has the second-highest tax profit margin and among the lowest tax rates.P&G is restructuring its supply chain to lower cost, reduce inventory, improve customer service, set up new multi-category facilities, localize manufacturing and employ smart automation and digitization.The company has also transformed its organizational structure to a simpler, faster and more accountable one. P&G implemented an end-to-end approach in the United States in fiscal 2016, and added four more markets, including China and the U.K. in fiscal 2017. It also plans to add five markets in fiscal 2018. In smaller countries, the company is going in for a “freedom within a framework” approach, which implies that these markets have “complete freedom to make changes without the need for engagement with regional or global resources,”  as long as they are operating within pre-defined strategies and delivering on the financial targets. Since Nov 1, 2015, P&G has yielded total shareholder return of 28% through Aug 18, 2017.Also, P&G is “raising the bar” in terms of performance through the introduction of superior products, packaging, brand communications, in-store & online execution and consumer & customer value equations. All these strategies are expected to significantly boost growth for P&G.Stock PerformanceP&G’s shares have gained 10.4% year to date, below the industry’s gain of 20.2%. Although P&G has underperformed the industry so far this year, estimates for the current and next year have moved up 1.5% and 0.5% over the last 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism regarding the company. P&G also beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company’s new product lineup, aggressive marketing, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives should boost profits as well.Zacks Rank & Key PicksP&G currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector include Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report), Sanderson Farms, Inc. (SAFM  -  Free Report) and Unilever N.V. (UN  -  Free Report).Pilgrim's Pride, with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is expected to see 37.1% EPS growth this year.Sanderson Farms’ EPS is expected to grow 16% in fiscal 2017. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1.

1283,PG,"On Aug 16, shares of The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report), also referred to as Procter & Gamble or P&G, rallied to a new 52-week high of $92.95. The stock pulled back to end the trading session on Wednesday at $92.44.This consumer goods giant, with a market cap of around $235.11 billion, has seen its shares rise roughly 10% so far this year, almost in line with the 10.3% increase for the S&P 500 over the same period. However, the company’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year.Although P&G shares have underperformed the industry, estimates are trending upward for the last 30 days, hinting analysts’ optimism about the company. P&G also beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.52%.What’s Driving P&G?Although weak sales have been offsetting margin improvement from pricing gains and cost cuts for some time now, P&G is investing in its brands and products as well as re-designing the supply chain to boost productivity and organic growth.This is evident from its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results that were released late last month. P&G’s earnings and revenues surpassed expectations in its fiscal fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings increased 8% year over year but net sales remained unchanged from the year-ago level.The earnings growth was encouraging in light of solid organic sales growth and operating margin expansion (up 210 basis points or bps) aided by productivity cost savings (up 350 bps). SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were also down 220 bps aided by cost savings.Overall organic sales were up 2% comprising 2% volume growth. All five business segments achieved organic volume growth despite deceleration in market growth. P&G’s online organic sales also improved 30% and represent over 5% of total revenue.The company remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging, and marketing initiatives and productivity cost-saving plan. the company expects to generate up to an additional $10 billion of cost savings over the next five years (fiscal 2017-2021) in areas including supply chain and cost of goods sold or COGS, marketing and digitization, and promotional spend effectiveness.The $10 billion cost-saving plan comprises $7 billion in COGS savings ($4.5 billion from raw and packaging materials, $1.5 billion in manufacturing savings and $1 billion from transportation/warehousing/other), $2 billion of marketing cost reductions, $1.5 billion of trade spending savings (10% efficiency), and $1–$2 billion of additional overhead reductions. This brings the total potential savings to $12–$13 billion, higher than the $10 billion level. However, P&G adjusted the level down to up to $10 billion to take into account the uncertainty associated with it, especially when projecting out several years.The company continues to focus on product and packaging, superior execution of communications, in-store fundamentals, and consumer value. Hence, the company’s investments in promising innovation and go-to-market capabilities allow it to expand in more categories, geographies and channels, thus bolstering top and bottom-line growth.Zacks Rank & Key PicksProcter & Gamble currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the same sector is Unilever N.V. (UN  -  Free Report), with an expected earnings growth rate of 30.3% for 2017. It sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.This proven stock-picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing.

1286,PG,"What is the value of a stock?
"

"
1290,PG,"In the short-term, the market is a voting machine. In the long-term, it is a weighing machine.
"
1291,PG,"In other words, the stock prices of both good and bad companies can change rapidly for several reasons in the short run. But over the long run, only the strong companies thrive.

1292,PG,"So what is the real value of that piece of paper you hold? Is it worth anything at all?
"
1293,PG,"Ownership
"
1294,PG,"When you buy a stock, you're actually buying an ownership interest in a company. And the value of any business is the present value of all of its free cash flows.
"
1295,PG,"Free cash flow is calculated as:
"
1296,PG,"Cash Flow from Operations
"
1297,PG,"- Capital Expenditures
"
1298,PG,"This is the cash a company generates for its shareholders after paying expenses and investing in its growth. Companies that are growing rapidly may have very little or even negative free cash flow. That doesn't make them worthless. The idea is that one day they'll stop expanding as quickly and start generating significant free cash flow for its shareholders.
"
1299,PG,"Companies that generate substantial free cash flow can either hold onto that cash, pay down debt, buy back stock, or distribute it to shareholders through dividends.
"
1300,PG,"The Kings of Cash Flow
"
1301,PG,"So what companies are currently generating substantial free cash flow for their owners? Here are 4:Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) may have had its missteps lately, but its Windows operating system and Office business software are still huge cash cows.
"
1302,PG,"Microsoft generated over $22 billion in free cash flow in 2010, a 72% increase from 2006. The company has been using its cash to buyback stock and raise its dividend. It currently yields 2.5%.

"
1304,PG,"Proctor & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) is about as stable as they come. The company markets more than 250 products to more than 5 billion consumers around the world.
"
1305,PG,"In 2010, P&G generated over $13 billion in free cash flow, and it returned nearly $11.5 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividend payments. It currently yield 3.2%.

"
1308,PG,"Big Blue has been aggressively buying back shares with its substantial cash flows. In 2010, IBM spent over $15 billion repurchasing its common stock.

"
1312,PG,"Although its earnings per share hasn't gone anywhere in the last 5 years, the company has been steadily increasing its free cash flow over that time. It has been rewarding its shareholders as a result. Verizon has been aggressively paying down debt and still has room to pay a dividend that yields a juicy 5.4%.
"

1317,PG,"Shares of Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) declined 5.2% over the last three months, as against the industry’s gain of 5.3%. Moreover, the stock has underperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector that gained 1.4%. However, management remains on track to deliver growth on the back of its savings programs and other initiatives.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock exhibits a VGM Score of “D”. Let’s delve deep to explore more about the stock.Soft Sales Trend & Bleak OutlookColgate’s dismal sales trend reveals that its top line has lagged estimates for the last 17 quarters. Moreover, the company’s revenues fell short of expectations for the fifth straight quarter in second-quarter 2017 due to continued softness in North America and challenges in the Asia-Pacific region.Going forward, the company anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. While it reiterated net sales projection for 2017 anticipating low-single digits growth, the company lowered its organic sales growth guidance on account of a soft first-half 2017.Furthermore, Colgate anticipates GAAP earnings per share, on a dollar basis, to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared with the previously stated flat guidance.Consequently, the estimates witnessed downward revisions in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89 for 2017 and $3.11 for 2018 has declined 1% and 1.6%, respectively.Other HeadwindsForeign exchange continues to be a headwind for Colgate in some markets as it derives around 75% of revenues from outside the U.S. In fact, the Asia-Pacific region and the Hill’s Pet Nutrition business were impacted by negative currency translations in the second quarter. Also, management expects it to hurt results throughout 2017.In addition, the company faces intense competition from other well-established players in the consumer products industry, such as The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) and The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) on the basis of pricing, promotional activities and new product introductions.Strategic InitiativesOn the positive side, Colgate has been infamous among investors with its meet or beat earnings track record. The company posted in-line earnings in four of the last seven quarters, while it surpassed estimates in the remaining three.Further, Colgate is progressing well with its savings programs, as both, its Global Growth and Efficiency Program or 2012 Restructuring Program and Funding the Growth undertakings are delivering impressive results. Evidently, these initiatives contributed in gross margin expansion in the quarter, and expect GAAP and adjusted gross margin to expand in 2017.With these initiatives, Colgate focuses on reducing structural costs, standardizing processes and enhancing its market share position worldwide. Also, the company aims at opening new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers, while also reducing fuel and transportation costs. These programs are expected to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Moreover, it commands a market-leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories and maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Going forward, the company expects to further grow its market share in 2017 via a series of innovative product launches lined up for the year.Bottom LineWe believe Colgate’s growth drivers to outweigh the obstacles in the near term, and help regain its momentum.Meanwhile, you can count upon a better-ranked stock from the same industry, which is Unilever N.V. (UN  -  Free Report), with long-term earnings growth rate of 9.4%. Also, it carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1318,PG,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) looks good on the back of its long-term initiatives, solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, strong brand portfolio and a disciplined capital strategy.Let’s find out more about the stock, which also boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.6%.2020 StrategyClorox remains keen on the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. In fact, the whole strategy is aimed at achieving certain long-term aspirations, including growing net sales by 3−5%, improvement of EBIT margin by 25−50 basis points, and generating free cash flow of 10−12% of sales, all on a yearly basis.We note that the company is well on track with its 2020 Strategy, which is meant to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands; development of eCommerce; technological advancements; enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds – desire, decision and delight.Sturdy Q4 Results & Favorable OutlookClorox posted solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines grew year over year and topped estimates. Notably, earnings marked the third straight quarter of a beat, while sales reverted to its positive surprise track after a miss in the last quarter.While the bottom line gained from strong sales and cost-savings, the top line was fueled by higher volumes, better International pricing and benefits from RenewLife (acquired in May 2016). Further, sales grew year over year in each segment in the quarter. The company’s fiscal 2017 performance also remained robust with solid top- and bottom-line growth year over year. (Read More: Clorox Q4 Earnings & Sales Beat the Zacks Consensus)Further, management is encouraged by its International operations, and expects pricing and cost savings to continue driving results. It expects fiscal 2018 to represent another year of strong earnings and sales growth. For fiscal 2018, Clorox expects sales to grow in a range of 2–4%, and earnings from continuing operations to rise 3–7% year over year.Other StrengthsWe believe Clorox's diversified brand portfolio places the company well above its peers to generate above-average industry growth and sustain itself in the currently challenging environment.In fact, its focus on boosting sales through brands is well-evident from its constant innovations and marketing strategies to drive top-line growth. Alongside, it maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy, making investments to develop its business while using the excess cash to lower debts and enhance shareholder returns.Concerns/WeaknessHowever, the stock is not devoid of concerns/headwinds, which might dampen its performance in the near term. Clorox’s significant international presence exposes it to major foreign currency risks (especially in Argentina), which have hurt results for a while in the past. Also, currency headwinds are expected to have one point adverse impact on sales growth in fiscal 2018.Additionally, Clorox faces intense competition from other well-established players in the consumer products industry, such as Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report), Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) on the basis of pricing, promotional activities and new product introductions.Bottom LineWhile these headwinds, along with a retail landscape that is expected to be more competitive in fiscal 2018, the company’s focus on its 2020 strategy and continued investments in innovating products and brands, will help drive results.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1319,PG,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected results in the second quarter of 2017 on cost savings and a tax benefit. However, sales suffered owing to industry-wide soft consumption trends for packaged food items.Earnings BeatSecond-quarter comparable earnings of 97 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents by 5.4%. Earnings increased 6.6% year over year banking on higher operating profit and a lower effective tax rate, which more than offset a higher level of restructuring charges.Excluding currency headwinds of 1 cent, earnings increased 7.7% year over year.Adjusted earnings exclude costs associated with Project K, a mark-to-market loss and certain other items. Including these items, however, the company reported earnings of 80 cents per share, higher than year-ago earnings of 79 cents.Revenues BeatKellogg reported revenues of $3.19 billion, down 2.5% year over year, marking the 10th straight quarter of revenue decline. The decline can be primarily attributed to weak consumer demand across most parts of the North American regions and Europe. Revenues fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.15 billion by 1.3%.Currency hurt sales by 0.7% in the quarter. Acquisitions had a 1.5% positive impact on revenues. However, Venezuela deconsolidation had a 0.2% negative impact on the top line. Accordingly, organic revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign exchange) fell 3.1% compared with a 4.4% decline in the previous quarter. Except Asia Pacific, organic sales decreased across all other regions.Volumes decreased 4.9%, a shade better than the 5.7% decrease in the preceding quarter. On the other hand, price/mix added 1.8% to sales, higher than the 1.3% contribution last quarter.Profits RiseKellogg’s operating margin (currency-neutral comparable growth) was 17.2%.Comparable operating profit grew 5.9% to $538 million.However, excluding the currency impact of 1%, adjusted (currency-neutral comparable) operating profit increased approximately 6.9% to $544 million on strong Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting cost savings.Segment DiscussionTotal North America: Kellogg’s North America sales declined 2.6% (down 2.4% organically) year over year to $2.15 billion, due to a shift in the consumer preference to healthier options from its processed food offerings. Volumes decreased 3.7% compared with 4.9% growth witnessed in the previous quarter. Price/mix increased 1.8% compared with a 0.5% growth in the prior quarter. Adjusted (currency-neutral comparable) operating profit increased 6.8% in North America.Europe: Segment revenues of $566 million declined 10% due to currency headwinds of 3.6%. Organically, sales were down 7% in the second quarter compared with a decline of 8.3% in the last quarter. Adjusted operating profit declined 1.1%.Latin America: Segment revenues of $234 million improved 14.8% (organically, revenues were down 4%) owing to 3.4% price/mix growth. This was partly offset by a 7.4% decline in volume and 0.9% currency headwind. Adjusted operating profit decreased 14.6% in Latin America.Asia Pacific: Segment revenues of $238 million improved 4.3% on the back of strong growth across the region for Pringles. Organically, sales increased 2.1%, softer than 2.9% growth in the last quarter. Adjusted operating profit improved 34.9% in the Asia Pacific. Volumes were down 1.9%, while price/mix grew 4%, in the quarter.2017 Views ReaffirmedThe company expects revenues to decline about 3% on a currency-neutral comparable basis.The company expects adjusted constant currency earnings to grow 8–10% in the range of $4.03–$4.09 per share.However, including currency impact of 6 cents after tax, adjusted EPS is now expected in the range of $3.97–$4.03 against $3.91–$3.97 expected earlier.Adjusted constant currency operating profit growth projection was maintained in the range of 7–9%. Operating margin is expected to improve more than a full percentage point, and is well on track to achieve its goal of 350 basis points expansion from 2015 through 2018.Zacks RankKellogg carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1334,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises
"
1335,PG,"Brokerage analysts have recently become more optimistic about Ameristar Casinos (ASCA). During the past 30 days, analysts have raised both their first-quarter and full-year profit forecasts.
"
1336,PG,"For the first quarter, 2 analysts changed their projections. The revisions pushed the consensus earnings estimate one-cent higher to 33 cents per share.

Ameristar Casinos is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Apr 29, before the start of trading.
"
1337,PG,"Corning Inc. (GLW  -  Free Report) told shareholders last month that it was ""experiencing increasing glass orders"".

"
1338,PG,"About a third of the covering analysts adjusted their first-quarter profit projections in response. These changes pushed the consensus earnings estimate 2 cents higher to 6 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 7 cents per share. GLW did miss estimates last quarter, so this call does carry some risk. Corning is scheduled to report on Monday, Apr 27, before the start of trading.
"
1339,PG,"After being slashed in February, first-quarter earnings estimates for Commscope Inc. (CTV) have started to rebound. During the past 30 days, 3 of the 12 covering brokerage analysts have raised their forecasts. The positive revisions pushed the consensus earnings estimates 1-cent higher to 10 cents per share and resulted in a most accurate estimate of 11 cents per share. This communication networking company has a long history of topping expectations. CommScope is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Apr 28, after the close of trading.
"
1340,PG,"Two brokerage analysts recently raised their first-quarter profit projections on Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR  -  Free Report). The changes resulted in a most accurate estimate of -2 cents per share. However, the consensus earnings estimate is basically unchanged at a per share loss of 5 cents per share as a total of 9 analysts cover the stock. Nonetheless, the positive revisions follow a trend of higher earnings estimates that is also occurring with many other semiconductor companies. MPWR has topped expectations during 3 out of the last 4 quarters. Monolithic Power Systems is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Apr 28, after the close of trading.
"
1341,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesTextron (TXT) warned a few weeks ago that most of its ""commercial markets continue to soften"". The company also said that it continues to reduce production at Cessna. Though guidance was not provided, one-third of the 10 covering analysts cut their first-quarter earnings estimates. As result, the consensus earnings estimate fell to 6 cents per share, a 2-cent reduction. The most accurate estimate is far more bearish and calls for a loss of 12 cents per share.

1361,PG,"On Monday, shares of tech giant Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) are sliding, down about 1.3% to $170.18 per share in morning trading after an analyst at a small research firm downgraded the stock to a Sell rating from a Hold.Analyst Brian Wieser is part of Pivotal Research, an equity research company based in New York City. The decision to lower its rating on Facebook comes just days after the social media company reported a massive earnings beat and monthly active user count of 2 billion. Weiser believes that because large companies are “scrutinizing” their marketing budgets, Facebook is facing the risk of digital ad saturation.""We think that the market is looking at upside potential without appropriately considering risks to growth,"" Wieser wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""With every passing year, digital advertising is closer to a point where the market is saturated."" He went on to say that large company advertisers represent 30% of Facebook’s sales, pointing out how Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) recently cut $140 million from its digital ad budget and said it had no impact on its revenue.The consumer staple giant’s ""statement will undoubtedly add fuel to the fire of large brands more carefully scrutinizing their digital advertising choices,"" he wrote. ""There are limits to growth to spending on advertising, as marketers are mostly unable to tap into broader and generally segregated marketing budgets."" Along with lowering his rating, Wieser reaffirmed his year-end price-target of $140 for Facebook, which represents a 19% downside from Friday’s close.Wieser also cut his rating for Facebook stock back in February, lowering it to a Hold from a Buy. CNBC notes that there is only one other Wall Street analyst out of 40 that has either a Sell or Underweight rating on Facebook.FB is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, and shares of the company have gained over 47% year-to-date.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9x stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

1364,PG,"April ends with what could be the last rate cut for quite some time. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (aka ""the Fed"") will hold a two-day meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with the statement being released on Wednesday afternoon. Futures are pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut.
"
1365,PG,"Some fed officials have recently expressed concern about the rate of inflation. Given this chatter, it is very possible that there could be dissenting votes when the statement is released. It's not just inflation that has some Fed officials worried, however; the potential new target rate of 2% does not leave the Fed with much ammunition to fight any future economic weakness.
"
1366,PG,"Presuming that the Fed does cut by 25 basis points and hints at moving towards a more neutral rate policy, the question becomes one of how will the market react? A sell on the news pullback is not out of the realm of possibilities given the inability of the major indexes to significantly break out of their trading ranges. That said, the bulls could interpret the statement as another sign that an economic recovery is coming sooner than later.
"
1367,PG,"I think we will get a pullback, but hope I'm wrong.
"
1368,PG,"First-quarter earnings will continue to have a bearing on daily market action with nearly 800 companies confirmed to report. Large-caps will remain prevalent with 127 members of the S&P 500 on the schedule, including Dow components Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), General Motors (GM), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report).
"
1369,PG,"Nearly all of the economic data will be released near the end of the week.
"

1373,PG,"First-Quarter Earnings
"
1374,PG,"Slightly more than half of S&P 500 companies have reported as of Thursday afternoon. Positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a margin of 2.25. Not horrible, but not nearly as good as we have seen in past quarters. Notably, as the proportion of non-financial companies has increased, the surprise ratio has not improved much.
"
1375,PG,"As I said last week, earnings growth is a matter of perception. Median per share growth is just dandy at 10%. Average per share earnings growth, however, is almost the exact opposite at -10.2%. More than a third of companies have reported a decline in year-over-year per share earnings.
"
1376,PG,"Net income growth, which is not impacted by share buybacks, shows a similar story. Median net income increased 5.3%, but average net income is running at -12.1%.
"
1377,PG,"Sixteen companies lost money last quarter. Not surprisingly, most of these were financial companies.
"
1378,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Apr 28 - May 2
"
1379,PG,"There are multiple energy companies reporting. Rising oil and natural gas prices should translate into good earnings. Here are a few that should surprise to the upside:
"
1380,PG,"Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) - The first-quarter consensus earnings estimate of $2.38 is seven cents higher than the average forecast of a month ago and reflects upward revisions by seven brokerage analysts. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $2.40 per share. CVX has delivered positive earnings surprises during three out of the past four quarters. Chevron is scheduled to report on Friday, May 2, before the start of trading.
"
1381,PG,"EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) - Almost half of the covering brokerage analysts have raised their forecasts within the past few weeks. The first quarter consensus earnings estimate of $1.59 is 11 cents above the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.65 per share. EOG has topped expectations during three out of the past four quarters. EOG Resources is scheduled to report on Friday, May 2, before the start of trading.
"
1382,PG,"Murphy Oil (MUR  -  Free Report) - The first-quarter consensus earnings estimate of $1.86 reflects recent upward revisions by six out of the 11 brokerage analysts. In comparison, the average forecast called for profits of $1.71 per share a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.94 per share. MUR has issued positive earnings surprises for three consecutive quarters. Murphy Oil is scheduled to report on Thursday, May 1, before the start of trading.
"
1383,PG,"St. Mary Land & Exploration Company (SM  -  Free Report) - SM will be looking to extend its streak of consecutive positive earnings surprises to seven quarters. Six of ten covering brokerage analysts have raised their projections within the past few weeks. The first-quarter consensus earnings estimate of 98 cents is 13 cents above the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.02 per share. St. Mary is scheduled to report on Thursday, May 1, after the close of trading.
"
1384,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Apr 28 - May 2
"
1385,PG,"The trend in earnings estimate revisions implies that the economic slump has had an adverse affect on Office Depot (ODP  -  Free Report). Two brokerage analysts have cut their forecasts on the office supply retailer in recent weeks, dropping the consensus earnings estimate to 23 cents per share from 40 cents two months ago. ODP missed expectations last quarter by nine cents per share. Office Depot is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Apr 29, before the start of trading.

"
1391,PG,"Another week, another rate cut. The futures markets are predicting the Federal Open Market Committee (a.k.a ""the Fed"") will cut rates for the second time this month when it meets on Wednesday and Thursday. As of yesterday, Jan 24, expectations were highest for an additional 50-basis point cut, though the possibility of just a quarter-point cut is gaining steam.
"
1392,PG,"The problems for the economy stem from a lack of available credit, and anything that can be done to encourage lending is a step in the right direction. Therefore, erring on the side of cutting rates too much is better than maintaining the fight against inflation. The stimulus can always be pulled back later in the year. If the economy does regain its footing, it would not surprise me to see rate hikes occur in the fourth quarter of this year. Let's hope that the economy regains enough strength to make my prediction about higher rates come true.
"
1393,PG,"Going back to the week of Jan 28, the following economic reports will be released:
"
1394,PG,"Tuesday: December new home sales
"
1395,PG,"Wednesday: December durable good orders and January Conference Board consumer confidence survey
"
1396,PG,"Thursday: Weekly initial jobless claims, advance fourth-quarter GDP and January PMI
"
1397,PG,"Large-cap stocks will continue to dominate the earnings news with approximately a quarter of the more than 500 companies confirmed to report belonging to the S&P 500. Among these large caps are Dow components 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report), American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Proctor & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report). In all, we have confirmed reports from nine Dow components and 124 S&P 500 companies.
"
1398,PG,"Fourth-Quarter Earnings Results
"
1399,PG,"As I expected, the median rate of growth accelerated as results from many non-financial companies were released. As of Thursday evening, median per share earnings growth for S&P 500 companies was 8.6%. The pace of net income growth was slightly less at 5.5%, reflecting the impact of share buybacks.
"
1400,PG,"More companies continue to beat expectations than miss, though the number of misses remains proportionately higher than we have seen in past quarters. A total of 97 companies have beat and 42 have missed, a surprise ratio of 2.3:1.
"
1401,PG,"The sample size remains relatively small with only 159 total reports (20 companies met expectations) and therefore the numbers should continue to change as more companies release their earnings results.
"
1402,PG,"Earnings growth is not much different for the broader S&P Composite 1500 (S&P 500, S&P Midcap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600). Median EPS growth is running at 8.8% and median net income growth is 5.1%. The surprise ratio is 1.74:1 (172 companies beat and 99 missed).
"
1403,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Jan 28 - Feb 1
"
1404,PG,"Earlier this month, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) preannounced full-year 2007 adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share. Following the announcement, two of the 10 covering brokerage analysts adjusted their fourth-quarter forecasts. The revisions caused a one-cent increase in the consensus earnings estimate to 29 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 32 cents per share. CELG has topped expectations for five consecutive quarters. Celgene is scheduled to report on Thursday, Jan 31, before the start of trading.
"
1405,PG,"Crude's ability to stay near $90 per barrel, and its upward march towards $100 in late December, has caused brokerage analysts to adjust their profit projections on many oil companies, including  Occidental Petroleum (OXY  -  Free Report). During the past 30 days, four of the covering analysts raised their forecasts, causing a seven-cent increase in the fourth-quarter consensus estimate to $1.67 per share. The most accurate forecast is slightly more bullish at $1.68 per share. OXY has topped expectations for four consecutive quarters. Occidental Petroleum is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Jan 29, before the start of trading.
"
1406,PG,"Petro-Canada (PCZ) has topped expectations over the past three quarters by an average margin of 18 cents per share. For many of the same reasons as OXY, brokerage analysts have been raising their fourth-quarter profit projections on PCZ. Positive revisions by two of the four covering analysts have caused the fourth-quarter consensus estimate to rise 10 cents to $1.39 per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.41 per share. Petro-Canada is scheduled to report on Thursday, Jan 31.
"
1407,PG,"VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) beat expectations by eight cents when it reported its first quarter as a publicly-traded company last October. A recent upward revision to the fourth-quarter consensus estimate suggests a second positive surprise could be forthcoming. Within the past 30 days, one brokerage analyst raised his profit forecast, pushing the consensus estimate up one cent to 17 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 19 cents per share. VMware is scheduled to report on Monday, Jan 28, after the close of trading.
"
1408,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Jan 28 - Feb 1
"
1409,PG,"The slowing economy is just the latest headwind for YRC Worldwide (YRCW). The trucking company is also contending with high energy prices and competition from other trucking companies and rail. Therefore, it is little wonder that roughly half of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their fourth-quarter earnings estimates within the past 30 days. The consensus estimate of 55 cents is four cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is a penny lower at 54 cents per share. YRC has missed three times in just the past four quarters. YRC Worldwide is scheduled to report on Monday, Jan 28, after the close of trading.

"
1415,PG,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, aka ""the Fed"") will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday (Oct 30-31). Most market participants expect a rate cut to be announced, but this is not a certainty. The downside risk is that committee's inflation hawks stand their ground and vote down a rate cut. Such a decision would create turbulence in both the stock and bond markets over fears that the Fed is not being proactive enough. I don't think the Fed will spook investors on Halloween; rather, I believe a 25 basis point rate cut will be announced. Furthermore, the meeting's statement will suggest a willingness by the committee to do what is necessary to maintain economic growth.
"
1416,PG,"Among the economic data the Fed will have to consider will be the Conference Board's October survey of consumer confidence, advance third-quarter GDP, September construction spending and the October Chicago PMI. The consumer confidence survey will published on Tuesday, the other three reports will be published on Wednesday.
"
1417,PG,"Staying on the economic calendar, September personal income and spending data, September pending home sales and the October ISM manufacturing index will be released on Thursday. Friday will feature October employment data and September factory orders.
"
1418,PG,"Competing with the economic data will be earnings reports from approximately 850 companies, 96 of which belong to the S&P 500. Three Dow components are also expected to step up to the plate: Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Proctor & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report). In addition to XOM, 11 other large-cap oil companies are scheduled to report. Despite crude's march towards $100 per barrel, brokerage analysts have lowered third-quarters forecasts on nine of these 12 companies and lowered fourth-quarter forecasts on five of the 12.
"
1419,PG,"There are a few other noteworthy items on the calendar. Monday will be the anniversary of the 1929 crash (technically the anniversary is Sunday and Monday). Wednesday night is Halloween. (Boo!) November begins on Thursday and it has traditionally marked the start of a good six-month period to own stocks. (The Stock Trader's Almanac notes that the Dow has been up on Nov 1 during 22 out of the last 28 times. Given that Fed will announce its decision on Wednesday, I would suggest not using this streak as a reason to buy stocks.) Daylight savings time (set your clocks back one hour) starts on Sunday, Nov 4.
"
1420,PG,"Third-Quarter Earnings Performance
"
1421,PG,"As the proportion of financial companies reporting third-quarter results has dropped, the rate of profit growth has increased. Through Thursday evening, the median company within the S&P 500 has generated year-over-year profit growth of 11.5% on a per share basis. The ratio of positive to negative surprises is running at 2.7:1. These numbers are based on reports from approximately 280 companies.
"
1422,PG,"Expanding the universe to the S&P 1500 Composite (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600), median growth is 10.9%. Positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a margin of 2:1.
"
1423,PG,"Third-quarter earnings have  clearly been impacted by the ongoing credit crisis. For example, I ran the growth numbers for the S&P 1500 Composite with banks and savings & loans excluded. The median growth rate rose by nearly 200 basis points. The overall numbers don't reflect the impact of forecasts that were lowered ahead of earnings reports or retailers, whose third-quarter hasn't ended yet. Therefore, the actual drag on growth is bigger. Partially offsetting the credit crunch is the impact of share repurchases, the weak dollar and faster economic growth abroad. Simply put, we know that the credit crunch is slowing earnings, but it's difficult to quantify the exact speed of the headwind.
"
1424,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Oct 29 - Nov 2American Axle & Manufacturing (AXL  -  Free Report) has been the beneficiary of two positive earnings estimate revisions by brokerage analysts recently. The revisions have resulted in a four-cent increase in the consensus estimate to 29 cents per share. The most accurate consensus is more bullish at 41 cents per share. AXL has topped expectations for two consecutive quarters. American Axle & Manufacturing is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Oct 30.
"
1425,PG,"Callaway Golf Company (ELY  -  Free Report) recently preannounced third-quarter results. The company estimates that its profits will be between breakeven and two cents per share; brokerage analysts had been forecasting a loss of four cents per share. ELY is enjoying strong sales of woods, irons, golf balls and accessories as well as improved gross margins. After previously missing estimates four consecutive times, ELY has turned things around with two consecutive positive surprises. (Some readers may recall that I predicted the golf company could begin topping expectations last April). The consensus estimate calls for ELY to breakeven, but the most accurate consensus is calling for profits of a penny per share. Callaway Golf is scheduled to report on Thursday, Nov 1, after the close of trading.
"
1426,PG,"Omniture (OMTR) has topped expectations for four consecutive quarters. Ahead of the business optimization software company's third-quarter report, brokerage analysts have narrowed their loss projections. The consensus estimate now calls for a loss of two cents per share, a penny less than the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate forecast is considerably more bullish and calls for a profit of four cents per share. Omniture is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Oct 30, after the close of trading.
"
1427,PG,"Approximately one-third of the covering brokerage analysts have raised their forecasts on Safeco (SAF) within the past 30 days. The cumulative impact of these revisions has been a seven-cent jump in the consensus forecast to $1.53 per share. The most accurate consensus is more optimistic at $1.55 per share. SAF has topped expectations for three consecutive quarters. SAF is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Oct 30, before the start of trading.
"
1428,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Oct 29 - Nov 2
"
1429,PG,"The sharp rise in oil prices may not translate into an upbeat report for refiner Tesoro (TSO). Higher feedstock costs and a seasonal decline in margins are expected to have weighed down margins. As a result, more than half of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their third-quarter forecasts within the past 30 days. The consensus estimate calls for earnings of $1.15 per share, 56 cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate consensus calls for profits of 93 cents per share. TSO has missed once during the past four quarters. Tesoro is scheduled to report on Thursday, Nov 1, before the start of trading.Charles Rotblut, CFA, is the senior market analyst for Zacks.com.

1435,PG,"The markets fear about a potential credit meltdown is overshadowing what is turning out a pretty good earnings season. Through the close of trading on Thursday, Jul 26, positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a ratio of 3.7:1 among companies within the S&P 500. (On Thursday, the day of the Dows 311-point plunge, positive surprises outnumbered negative surprises by a ratio of 37:6.) Median company growth is running at 12.8%, which is better than the first-quarter. (With a similar number of reports, first quarter growth was running at 10.5%).
"
1436,PG,"Extending the universe out to the S&P 1500 (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600), a similar story exists. Positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a margin of 2.65:1 (versus 2.3:1 in the first quarter). Median company growth is running at 9.4% (versus 8.8% in the first quarter). The slower growth rates for the smaller capitalization companies may partially be explained by the simple fact that larger companies have more exposure overseas, which provide the double benefit of faster economic growth and favorable currency translations. (A euro dollar of profits is worth about $1.35 in American dollars.)
"
1437,PG,"So when will investors focus shift back to the bullish earnings news? Its hard to say because the subprime mortgage hole is not only getting deeper, but also wider. (Risky corporate debt is starting to get sucked into it). Plus, the earnings calendar contains 129 financial companies for the week of Jul 30  Aug 3. Fortunately, about a third of these companies are insurance companies. REITs and other real estate companies account for 49 companies in the group, but many of these have exposure to commercial properties, which are not experiencing the same problems as residential properties are. There are 13 banks and eight investment banking firms, however, so there will still be a focus on the health of debt markets. 
"
1438,PG,"Overall, we have confirmed scheduled earnings reports from 810 companies for the week of Jul 30  Aug 3. Included in this group are 97 S&P 500 members and Dow components General Motors (GM), Proctor & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report).
"
1439,PG,"On the economic front, Tuesday features June personal income and spending, June construction spending, the Conference Boards July consumer confidence survey and the July Chicago PMI. Wednesday features June pending home sales and the July ISM manufacturing index. June factory orders will be released on Thursday. Friday will feature July employment data and the July ISM services index.
"
1440,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of July 30  Aug 3Activision (ATVI  -  Free Report) recently said that it expects to exceed its previous fiscal first-quarter guidance for revenues of $425 million and earnings of three cents per share. The video game maker has shipped more than eight million units of Spider-Man3, Shrek the Third, Transformers and Guitar Hero II. Two of the 13 covering brokerage analysts adjusted their projections in response, sending the consensus estimate up by a penny to five cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at six cents per share. ATVI has exceeded expectations twice during the past four quarters. Activision is scheduled to report on Thursday, Aug 2, after the close of trading.
"
1441,PG,"A few weeks ago, CommScope (CTV) raised its guidance for second-quarter earnings. The wire and cable maker expects sales to have totaled between $500 and $510 million and for operating margins to be in the range of 15-16%. Previously, the company had forecast revenues of between $490 and $510 million and operating margins of 14.5-15.5%. (Strong demand has been allowing cable makers to enjoy pricing power for the past several quarters.) Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, causing the second-quarter consensus estimate to rise by three cents to 76 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at 77 cents per share. CTV has topped expectations for 12 consecutive quarters. CommScope is scheduled to report on Monday, Jul 30, after the close of trading.
"
1442,PG,"Two of the 13 covering brokerage analysts have raised their second-quarter forecasts on CV Therapeutics (CVTX) over the past 30 days. These revisions have narrowed the consensus estimate to a loss of 86 cents per share, from the prior prediction for a loss of 90 cents per share. The biotech company exceeded expectations during the past four quarters by an average margin of nine cents per share. CV Therapeutics is scheduled to report on Monday, Jul 30, after the close of trading.
"
1443,PG,"Refining margins have been strong thanks to a combination of elevated crude prices and tight capacity. As a result, it is not surprising to see earnings estimates rising ahead of Marathon Oils (MRO  -  Free Report) second-quarter report. During past 30 days, six brokerage analysts have raised their forecasts. The consensus estimate of $1.98 is 19 cents above the average projection of a month ago and 39 cents above the average forecast of two months ago. The Most Recent Consensus calls for profits of $2.18 per share. MRO has exceeded expectations during the past two quarters by an average margin of 6.5 cents.
"
1444,PG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Jul 30  Aug 3
"
1445,PG,"Last month, Advanced Medical Optics (EYE) slashed its guidance, citing the impact of lower sales, the recall of a contact lens solution and higher interest expense. Slightly more than half of the covering brokerage analysts materially cut their forecasts in response, resulting in the second-quarter consensus estimate plunging to a loss of 68 cents per share from a profit of four cents per share. EYE has missed expectations twice during the past four quarters. Advanced Medical Optics is scheduled to report on Thursday, Aug 2, before the start of trading.

1450,PG,"Key Points:Only 30 firms have reported 3Q earnings, most with fiscal periods ending in August. The numbers are thus not particularly meaningful, but we present them anyway. Your focus should be on the “expected tables, which cover the other 470 firms.We are off to a strong start with a median surprise of 6.00%, and a 6.00 surprise ratio. Positive year-over-year growth for 24, falling EPS for 6 firms -- a 4.00 ratio. Total net income reported up 27.7%.Sales Surprise ratio at 1.42, median surprise 0.34%, 56.7% of all firms do better than expected on the top line. Revenue growth healthy at 13.7%.Total net income for the S&P 500 in the third quarter of 2010 is expected to rise 15.5% over third quarter of 2009 levels. Slowdown from the 37.0% growth those same firms had in the second quarter.  A rebound to 23.1% growth expected in the fourth quarter.Net margins (among the 470 yet to report) expected to rise to 8.73% from 7.80% a year ago. Sequentially, margins expected to fall from 9.09% in the second quarter but rebound to 9.16% in the fourth quarter.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 expected to jump 41.5% in 2010, 17.0% further in 2011.

"
1451,PG,"The official kick-off for the third quarter earnings season started this week. We have had a few “preseason games already, though. Just 30 firms have reported third quarter earnings so far, so it is not much to go on, but so far so good, with 22 beats and only 5 misses.
"
1452,PG,"One thing to note is that for the Earnings and Revenue Scorecards, as well as the “Growth Reported tables, are based on only those 30 firms, while the “Growth Expected tables are based on the other 470 firms. Your main attention should be focused on the “Growth Expected tables.
"
1453,PG,"The same is true for the new net margin tables. The quarterly reported table is only based on 30 firms, but the comparative data is also for just those firms as well. The “expected table is based on the remaining 470 firms. The annual net margin table is based on all 500 firms.
"
1454,PG,"As far as total net income is concerned, year-over-year growth is expected to decelerate to 15.5% growth from the 37.0% reported in the Second quarter (among the 470). That is still a very healthy level of earnings growth.Tougher Comps
"
1455,PG,"A big part of the slowdown can be traced to the fact that third quarter earnings in 2009 were significantly better than second quarter earnings in 2009. Thus we are facing tougher comparisons. However, it is not all just tougher comps. Sequentially, earnings are expected to drop by 6.9% from the second quarter. In the second quarter, earnings were 8.93% higher than in the first quarter.
"
1456,PG,"As far as the sectors are concerned, the list of high-growth sectors in the third quarter (year over year) will be pretty much the same as the high-growth sectors in the second quarter. The one exception is Aerospace, which was one of only two negative growth sectors in the second quarter, but which will see more than a doubling of net income in the third quarter. The rest of the high-growth sectors are very cyclical, such as Construction, Autos and Transportation.Peeking at the 4th Quarter
"
1457,PG,"Looking at the early expectations for the fourth quarter, somewhat surprisingly, the analysts are collectively expecting a bit of reacceleration in earnings growth, with total net income rising 23.1% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Sequentially, earnings are expected to be 7.3% higher in the fourth quarter. The thousands of analysts tracking individual companies are thus not looking for a double-dip recession and implicitly see the third quarter slowdown as more of a pause in the economy, rather than the start of a new downturn.Looking Back on the 2nd Quarter
"
1458,PG,"In the second quarter reports, arguably revenues were even more important than earnings. Firms that disappointed on the top line were spanked by the market even if they did well on the bottom line. Year-over-year, revenue growth is expected to decelerate sharply, growing just 3.2% down from 10.4% in the second quarter.
"
1459,PG,"However, most of the deterioration in overall revenue growth is coming from the Financials. Revenue for Financials is notoriously flakey. A big part of it is interest income, which falls when interest rates are low. At the same time, though, interest expense also falls.
"
1460,PG,"Thus don’t read too much into the revenue slowdown. This is one area where the trends in the individual sector are more important than what is going on with the S&P 500 as a whole. On a sequential basis, revenues are expected to decline by 3.1%. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, revenues are expected to fall 0.8% year over year and be up 2.3% sequentially. This implies continued very strong growth in net margins.Three New Tables (Net Margin-Related)
"
1461,PG,"I recently introduced three new tables: quarterly net margins reported, quarterly margins expected and net margins for the full year. Since we are tracking aggregate earnings and aggregate revenues, this seemed to be a logical addition to the coverage.
"
1462,PG,"For the quarter, the firms that have not yet reported are expected to post net margins of 8.73% for the third quarter, up from 7.80% a year ago, but down from the 9.09% net margins they posted in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, net margins of 9.16% are expected. Excluding financials, net margins are expected to rise to 8.29% from 7.68% a year ago, but down from 8.66% in the second quarter and are expected to rise to 8.58% in the fourth quarter.
"
1463,PG,"For the full year, net margins are expected to rise to 8.92% in 2010 from 6.42% in 2009, (and just 5.90% in 2008) with a further rise to 9.56% in 2011. Excluding financials, margins are expected to rise from 7.13% in 2009 (7.81% in 2008) to 8.69% in 2010 to 8.81% in 2011.
"
1464,PG,"For the full year, earnings are expected to grow 41.5% in 2010, with further growth of 17.0% in 2011. Next year we should once again set a new all-time record high for S&P 500 earnings. That will be long before employment returns to record levels. These results refer to the S&P 500, which are almost by definition ""big businesses,"" many of which get a majority of their earnings from overseas. With interest rates low, they are able to float bonds at very attractive interest rates.
"
1465,PG,"Full-year revenue growth is expected to be 4.71%, which does not fully make up for the 6.75% decline in 2009. For 2010, a further 6.11% revenue growth is expected. However, revenues for financial firms are flakey and distort the numbers significantly. With earnings growing much faster than revenues, it means that net margins are headed higher.
"
1466,PG,"It is important to note that when we say “2009 in this report, we mean the last full fiscal year to be reported, even if that year happens to end in June 2010. June is one of the largest non-December fiscal year-end months. Thus, as those firms “switch over not only the projections for 2010 can change, but so too can the “historical 2009 results.Earnings to Have Recovered by Next Year
"
1467,PG,"Regardless of some of the technical timing issues, it means that earnings will have fully recovered by mid-2011, and that full-year 2011 earnings will be 8.5% above full-year 2007 earnings (before the great recession started). That is years before we are likely to see a full recovery in the job market.
"
1468,PG,"Collectively the 500 firms in the S&P 500 earned $546.0 billion in “2009, and that is going to grow to $772.5 billion this year and $903.9 billion in 2011. Translated into “EPS for the index, earnings are expected to rise from $57.61 in 2009 to $71.55 in 2010 and $95.71 in 2011.
"
1469,PG,"In other words, then, the S&P 500 is selling for 20.1x 2009 earnings, but just 14.2x 2010 and 12.1x 2011 earnings. By historical standards that is quite cheap. Normally, when interest rates and inflation are low, P/E ratios are higher than average. Well, we currently have some of the lowest rates of inflation in decades and interest rates are at near record lows.
"
1470,PG,"It only costs the government 2.38% to borrow for 10 years. It is not hard to find good, solid blue chip companies that are providing dividend yields of more than that, and not just a bunch of electric utilities, either. One thing is certain, the coupon on a 10-year T-note will not increase over the next 10 years. The odds of the likes of Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), 4.15%), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), 3.26%) or Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), 3.20%) increasing their dividend in the next 10 years is pretty high.
"
1471,PG,"Currently 145 S&P 500 stocks yield over 2.55%, and 95 of those have payout ratios of less than 60%.  Earnings that are not paid out in dividends are reinvested for future growth, or are used to buy back stock, which also lifts earnings per share. Based on this year’s earnings, the earnings yield is 7.04% and based on next year it is 8.26%.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseOnly 30  firms have reported 3Q earnings, most with fiscal periods ending in August. The numbers are thus not particularly meaningful, but we present them anyways. Your focus should be on the “expected tables, which cover the other 470 firms.For what it is worth, we are off to a strong start with a median surprise of 6.00%, and a 6.00 surprise ratio.Positive year-over-year growth for 24, falling EPS for 6 firms, 4.00 ratio.Total net income up 27.7%. Pay attention to the % reported in evaluating the significance of sector growth rates and surprise medians.
"
1472,PG,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%.

1473,PG,"The first table shows the actual reported growth of those that have already reported, and the second table showing the expected growth for the firms that have yet to report. The reported numbers are based on a very small sample size and do not reflect what the overall S&P 500 is likely to report.  See comment in the Earnings Scorecard section.The total net income of firms that have reported so far is 27.7% above what they reported in the second quarter of 2009. These same firms reported year-over-year growth of 37.4% in the first quarter. Sequential earnings growth is 3.5%.Sample sizes are small, and growth rates will shift wildly as more firms report.The numbers in the table (and Revenue growth table) below only refer to those firms which have already reported.

Negative revenue growth of 0.8% is now expected for the fourth quarter.Revenue for the Financials is the principal source of the revenue slowdown. Low interest rates depress interest income, which is a major part of financials revenue, but also reduce interest expense. As a result, revenues at Financials are notoriously flakey.Five sectors expected to post double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter. The same five also posted double-digit growth in the second quarter and are expected be among the leaders again in the fourth quarter. High revenue growth in Energy and Materials is largely a function of commodity prices.Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues Expected Sales Growth Sequential Q4/Q3 E Sequential Q3/Q2 E Year over Year3Q 10 E Year over Year4Q 10 E Year over Year2Q 10 AIndustrial Products -0.42% 0.46% 21.14% 19.47% 20.20%Transportation 3.04% 1.57% 16.37% 12.70% 20.25%Oils and Energy 0.16% 0.67% 15.35% 8.00% 27.70%Basic Materials 1.33% -3.28% 13.65% 9.06% 19.41%Computer and Tech 9.23% 0.81% 13.55% 9.09% 20.67%Medical 2.61% -0.09% 9.04% 2.71% 10.09%Business Service 5.54% 0.47% 5.80% 5.26% 7.06%Retail/Wholesale 0.84% -0.01% 5.64% -6.63% 3.40%Utilities -1.97% 10.81% 4.99% 3.81% 0.60%Aerospace 6.37% 3.12% 3.00% 2.81% -2.25%Consumer Discretionary 7.91% 2.82% 2.58% 3.82% 7.93%Conglomerates 5.42% -0.30% 2.32% 0.99% 2.10%Construction -3.94% -2.87% 1.68% -3.40% 8.78%Auto 4.24% -12.21% -1.16% -8.09% 26.09%Consumer Staples 2.82% -10.47% -7.87% -7.89% 5.23%Finance 0.24% -20.58% -20.61% -19.16% 3.85%. 2.28% -3.07% 3.20% -0.84% 10.38%Quarterly Net Margins ReportedThis is only for the 30 firms that have already reported, calculated as total net income for the sector divided by total revenues for the sector.

"
1477,PG,"The table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. To qualify there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both  FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
1478,PG,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Biggest FY1 Revisions Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstDiscover Fin Sv DFS 22.67% 8.59% 0.79 0.75 18.20 9.75Textron Inc TXT 13.36% -3.64% 0.14 -0.27 41.35 16.20Carmax Gp (Cc) KMX 10.25% 11.06% 1.00 1.00 18.56 17.51Eastman Chem Co EMN 8.80% 6.81% 1.00 0.67 11.09 10.88Family Dollar FDO 7.10% 5.86% 1.00 0.30 14.39 12.73Pall Corp PLL 7.00% 5.19% 0.91 0.89 17.69 15.60Carnival Corp CCL 6.18% 6.63% 0.94 0.94 16.11 13.77Best Buy BBY 5.25% 3.48% 0.96 0.72 11.48 10.51Freept Mc Cop-B FCX 4.23% 3.27% 0.22 0.18 12.24 10.82Nike Inc-B NKE 4.15% 3.44% 0.84 0.68 18.72 16.69Autozone Inc AZO 4.12% 3.20% 0.88 0.38 13.47 12.01

1479,PG,"Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 10/7/2010.
"
1480,PG,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report. All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.
