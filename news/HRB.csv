1,HRB,"President Trump boasted more than a year ago that the only big loser from his tax cuts would be H&R Block (HRB).XInvestors apparently didn't heed the warning, and H&R Block stock was trading at a nine-month high on Tuesday before the bottom fell out.Trump's prediction looked pretty spot on as shares of the tax preparer tumbled 18% to end at 24.29 on the stock market today, after it issued surprisingly cautious revenue guidance for 2019 along with better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results. But the reality was a bit more complex.""We had expected some slight revenue decline in FY2019,"" wrote BMO Capital analyst Jeffrey Silber, as less complexity in the individual tax code reduced the average assistance charges going to tax preparers.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMorgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen called H&R Block's 2019 revenue guidance of $3.05 billion-$3.1 billion vs. $3.2 billion in fiscal 2018 a ""slight negative."" Analysts had been expecting $3.115 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.But both analysts agreed that the real issue which would ""spook investors,"" as Silber put it, was H&R Block's plan to accelerate investments in technology, which along with office consolidations could squeeze margins by 380-580 basis points in the coming year.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:AT&T Can Buy Time Warner; Court Ruling To Ignite Comcast, Disney BrawlIBD Stock Of The Day: Hot New China IPO iQiyi Flashes This Key Technical Sign3 Top Stocks Near Buy Zones; Time To Take Profits In Twitter?Why This Biotech Company Is Bounding Closer To A BreakoutChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

2,HRB,"BofI Holding (BOFI) won't stop evolving — simply because it can't afford to stand still.XAs online banking booms, BofI's roster of rivals now spans everything from credit unions to other banks. The roster includes stalwarts such as Ally Financial (ALLY) and CIT Group (CIT), as well as the upstart Marcus brand from venerable Wall Street brokerage Goldman Sachs (GS).Analyst Gary Tenner at D.A. Davidson commends BofI's asset strategy. It has grown from ""rate shoppers"" to encompass a diverse mix of spread-income and fee-income businesses.""BofI is always evolving, always eliminating bottlenecks from a process and cost perspective,"" Tenner said. ""This is a company that has very effectively navigated the last several years of growth.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs an example, San Diego-based BofI decided six years ago to expand from mortgage lending to commercial lending. Other banks had made similar moves after the housing crisis, but BofI quickly shifted. It moved from cash-flow-based loans, which offer little downside credit protection. And it went to real-estate-backed and asset-backed lending, which provide 40% to 50% downside protection.BofI then expanded into equipment financing for construction companies and bridge lending for real estate developers. Commercial and industrial loans jumped from $46 million as of June 2012 to roughly $1.4 billion as of March. That's 17% of BofI's total $8.2 billion loan portfolio. Single-family and multifamily mortgage lending account for a combined 72% of that fast-growing portfolio.""The growth of our (commercial and industrial) lending has enhanced our asset generation capabilities without compromising our pristine credit profile, and has provided another bridge to a more diversified loan portfolio in the years ahead,"" BofI's 2017 annual report said. The company did not respond to an interview request.Tenner highlights BofI's ability to ""pivot"" as one of its strengths. He noted it is in the midst of a rebranding exercise, for which few details are known.BofI Holding roots reach back to Bank of Internet, a pioneer of online consumer banking. It was one of the first banks to ditch brick-and-mortar stores entirely, greatly reducing costs. It's now a full-service financial institution, serving both consumers and businesses. Its BofI Federal Bank holding finances single and multifamily homes. It also targets small to medium businesses.BofI stock sits 4% below a record high of 45.18, pegged on June 11. Shares were off 1.4% to 42.93 in afternoon trades Friday, just below buy range with a 43.60 flat-base entry. They found support at the 50-day moving average last week after longtime partner H&R Block's (HRB) flat-to-lower revenue guidance for 2019 sparked a sell-off.Year to date, the small-cap BofI stock has surged 46% and earns a stellar IBD Composite Rating of 95. By comparison, S&P 500 financials are down 2% so far in 2018, including an 11% loss for Goldman Sachs.In a June 13 note to clients, Tenner described the recent BofI stock sell-off as likely overdone. While BofI offers refund advance loans to H&R Block customers, he does not see ""outsized risk to BofI's tax season revenue"" from the growing trend of do-it-yourself tax preparation. Borrowers repay the interest-free loans — a new product and growth driver for BofI — using their tax refunds.BofI has grown from under $950 million in assets in 2007 to just shy of $10 billion. It's done so by adding distribution channels and making acquisitions such as H&R Block Bank in 2015. It's also launched new businesses and products.Asset quality remains strong, with total nonperforming loans and leases at 0.39% of total assets as of March. But the company significantly jacked up its loan loss provision in the March quarter. The bank says that was due almost entirely to reserves for refund advance loans.In its April quarterly report, BofI posted a 27% jump in earnings to 80 cents a share on strong consumer and commercial loan production. Assets swelled to $9.9 billion as of March, up 15% from a year ago. Net income hit $51.3 million, up 25%, and deposits reached $7.9 billion, up 17%.Analysts on average expect earnings of $2.51 a share for fiscal 2018, ending in June. It's seen ramping up 29% to $3.23 in fiscal 2019, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue should grow 13% to $505 million over the same period.Tenner forecasts earnings of $3.20 a share in fiscal 2019, with BofI's growth outpacing like-sized banks. This underpins his buy rating and $50 price target over the next 12 to 18 months.So, too, does the macro outlook for financial companies.""We are in a banking environment that is certainly much more friendly than it has been in the better part of a decade,"" Tenner said in a phone interview with Investor's Business Daily on June 13. On that day, a hawkish Fed raised interest rates and signaled two more hikes this year, citing inflation. For banks such as BofI, rising rates accompanied by economic growth are good news. As interest rates rise, so does the spread between long-term and short-term rates. That boosts profits on both cash holdings and loans to customers.In fact, BofI's net interest margin expanded to 4.77% in the March 2018 quarter vs. 4.24% a year ago, on the back of refund advance loan growth.Still, the road ahead could be bumpy for BofI stock.""Deposit gathering is probably their biggest challenge,"" said Scott Valentin, managing director at Compass Point. Valentin noted the number of online rivals has ""dramatically"" increased.As it fends off intense competition, the company continues to invest heavily in product development, hiring talent and branding, analysts say.While Ally Bank and CIT Bank pose a threat, Goldman Sachs' Marcus is undergoing rapid growth that mimics BofI. Marcus an online banking platform racked up more than $3 billion in loans and $22 billion in deposits since its October 2016 launch. But it's consumer-focused, for now.Meanwhile, websites such as Bankrate.com have made rate comparison shopping easier than ever. With interest rates ticking up, Valentin is watching how BofI will offset the rising cost of deposits.""BofI will continue to be an asset growth story, I'm confident about that,"" he told IBD. ""The bigger question is the margin story, the cost-of-funds side in a rising-rate environment."" For now, based on soaring BofI stock, investors may be focused on the loan growth story. BofI is growing loans in the ""low-to-mid-teens"" rate, while the industry average is in the low single digits, according to Valentin.BofI stock posted only one down week as the market corrected in February. More recently, it has continued to hold up, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and the nation's biggest banks struggled amid rate-hike uncertainties.However, D.A. Davidson's Tenner ties some of BofI's rally to short covering, saying negative blog coverage made it a ""heavily shorted"" stock. Short-sellers try to profit from a decline in a company's shares.BofI faces a number of whistleblower and shareholder lawsuits, contending Bank of Internet engaged in wrongdoing as it grew at breakneck pace. In a 2015 interview with the New York Times, Chief Executive Gregory Garrabrants called the allegations groundless.The shareholder lawsuit suffered a setback in May. The company heads back to court a year from now in the original whistleblower case, according to a recent update from the law firm Proskauer Rose.Meanwhile, Valentin downgraded BofI stock to neutral in May.He called that primarily a valuation call, saying the discount at which BofI trades vs. high-growth peers had narrowed.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:PayPal Buddies Up To Visa, Mastercard — And New Accounts Roll InBest HSA Providers By Fees, Features And Investment OptionsHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners

Comcast (CMCSA) took the largest loss among Nasdaq 100 stocks. H&R Block (HRB) fell furthest among S&P 500 names.Dow Jones futures were down a fraction, struggling against a heavy loss by Walt Disney (DIS) after the court decision.

The decision caps a 20-month effort to earn approval for a deal that will make AT&T the top U.S. distributor of pay TV. AT&T saw the deal as essential to its effort to compete for advertising dollars with internet content providers led by Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google. The Department of Justice is reportedly considering filing an appeal to the ruling.AT&T traded down 2%. Comcast dropped 3%. Walt Disney dipped 1.7%. Discovery Communications had jolted 5% higher late Tuesday, but was inactive early Wednesday. 21st Century Fox surged 7%. Fox ended Tuesday's session near the top of a buy range, above a 38.66 buy point that it had initially cleared on May 8.The AT&T ruling also sent a handful of health care names higher. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts scrambled 2% higher. Regulatory resistance to the AT&T deal led investors to grow wary of Cigna's (CI) $52 billion effort to take over Express Scripts. Cigna shares were unchanged early Wednesday.Tuesday's ruling also eased investor concerns over CVS Health's (CVS) $69 billion bid to acquire Aetna (AET). Aetna rose 4% and CVS Health climbed 2% in late trade Tuesday. Both stocks were inactive ahead of Wednesday's open.Despite the Time Warner ruling, the market returned to the standard ""lay low"" pose it typically strikes ahead of key Federal Reserve decisions. Markets are geared for a quarter-point hike to between 1.75% and 2%. That would mark the Fed's seventh increase since 2015.

Shares jumped more than 5% in late trade, but were inactive early Wednesday. Fiscal first-quarter revenue blasted past consensus expectations and losses were less than forecast.

Korn Ferry shares are extended, up 25% since clearing a flat base in March.Oil prices could be a factor in Wednesday trade, as they slipped late Tuesday following weekly data from the American Petroleum Institute. Europe's Brent crude benchmark was down 0.4%, while West Texas intermediate dipped 0.2%, holding above $66 a barrel, early Wednesday.Data released from the API showed a 730,000-barrel draw on U.S. oil inventories, well below consensus expectations for a 2.7-million-barrel drawdown.

4,HRB,"In IBD's specialty financial services industry group, IBD Dividend Leaders stock Western Union (WU) does not have the highest annual dividend yield.At 3.7%, Western Union actually ranks behind Liberty Tax (TAX), which holds a 7.5% annualized yield. Western also trails Navient (NAVI) (4.9%), Yintech Investment (YIN) (4.8%) and H&R Block (HRB) (4.2%).So why does Western Union earn a spot within IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, which on Friday featured 16 stocks?Share price is a key factor. The better-performing stocks tend to trade at least 10 a share. For that reason, Liberty Tax and Yintech don't make the cut. Navient trades just 13.14 a share; Western Union trades near 20.33 a share and trades just 11% below a multiyear peak of 22.84.Earnings stability is another key factor. Here, Western Union is superior.The Englewood, Colo., firm shows a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 2 on a scale of zero (highly stable) to 99 (highly volatile). Stable earnings support ongoing dividend payments. On March 30 and June 29 this year, Western Union paid a dividend of 19 cents a share. That's up 19% from the 16 cents it paid each quarter in 2016.H&R Block gets a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 26 from William O'Neil + Co. That's not bad at all, especially considering the highly seasonal nature of the tax return business.In a May 23 edition of The Income Investor, IBD highlights the level of competition within the money transfer market.

5,HRB,"Stocks crept higher at Wednesday's open as telecom and entertainment stocks continued to respond to Tuesday's U.S. district court ruling allowing AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) to merge. Beyond the sectors affected by the ruling, markets set up in a holding pattern ahead of this afternoon's policy announcement from the Federal Reserve.21st Century Fox (FOX) led early advancers, with Time Warner, Discovery Communications (DISCA) and CBS (CBS) also making strong, related moves. AT&T,  Comcast (CMCSA) and H&R Block (HRB) posted some of the heaviest early declines.The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 fought to hold fractional gains. The Nasdaq Composite gained almost 0.2%.A federal judge in Washington late Tuesday threw out the U.S. Justice Department's effort to block AT&T's $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. The judge said the DOJ case, which echoed promises made by Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, was too weak to consider an appeal.The ruling throws open the door to a broad range of restructuring among telecom and entertainment names struggling to adapt to competition brought by Netflix (NFLX), Facebook (FB), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and other huge new-media venues. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit stock news today)Meanwhile, Disney inched up 0.5%.

Fox vaulted 7% higher.As a result, 21st Century Fox and Discovery Communications posted the two largest premarket gains among Nasdaq 100 issues. Fox, Time Warner and CBS led the S&P 500.While H&R Block dived to the bottom of the S&P 500 on disappointing quarterly results, Comcast and AT&T held the next-largest declines.

Shares are up more than 20%, placing the stock in a profit-taking zone.Pivotal Software (PVTL) blasted 19% higher, sending the April IPO to take a new high. Pivotal reported after Tuesday's close fiscal first-quarter revenue that blasted past analyst expectations, while losses were less than forecast. The San Francisco-based company also hoisted second-quarter earnings and revenue guidance above estimates. The stock is extended after clearing an IPO base on June 6, ending Tuesday up 41% from its April IPO at 15 a share.Korn Ferry International (KFY) jetted ahead 20% following its fiscal fourth-quarter report.

The accounting firm reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales and earnings comfortably above analysts targets. Full-year revenue guidance was just below consensus expectations, however, as the company said discount pricing would affect its top-line performance.  The stock had been climbing the right side of an 11-month base.Banks, financial stocks and other interest-rate sensitive portions of the market could kick into action late in Wednesday's session. That would depend on the outcome of the Federal Reserve's policy announcement, which comes out at 2 p.m. ET, and press conference, which begins at 2:30 p.m.  The market has for the most part baked in expectations for a quarter-point rate hike, putting the Fed's target at between 1.75% and 2%. But hints as to whether Fed strategy might include one or two more rate increases during the remainder of the year could cause adjustments, and a shift in tone, late in the session.Oil prices could also factor into Wednesday's action, pending the results of weekly data due out from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET. Weekly data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showed a lighter-than-anticipated 730,000-barrel decrease in oil inventories (vs. forecasts for a 2.7 million-barrel decline).

18,HRB,"Tax Reform: If President Trump wants to drain the swamp, the best place to start is with the tax code, which is so complicated that Americans spend billions of hours and hundreds of billions of dollars just trying to figure out how much they owe.The IRS instructions for filing out the 1040 form include a box near the back that estimates how much time it takes to fill that one form out. This year, it's 15 hours. That's a 67% increase from 1988. This year, the instruction booklet runs 241 pages. In 1988 it was fewer than 80.The tax code has become so complicated that even the IRS complains about it. In its annual report to Congress, the IRS' national taxpayer advocate, Nina E. Olson, writes that the tax code imposes a ""significant, even unconscionable, burden on taxpayers.""This is the hidden tax.Olson figures that individuals and businesses spend 6.1 billion hours — the equivalent of more than three million full-time workers — complying with the tax code.Almost no one can figure it out on their own anymore. IRS data show that 90% of individual taxpayers either hire companies like H&R Block  (HRB) to do their taxes, or buy software to help them navigate the forms.Various groups have tried to calculate the total cost of tax compliance, and the numbers are staggering. The National Taxpayers Union puts the bill at $262 billion, when you count direct costs and lost productivity. The Tax Foundation says it's more like $409 billion.Either way, ""if tax compliance were an industry, it would be one of the largest in the United States,"" Olson notes.Looked at another way, we spend around $1 in compliance costs for every $10 paid in federal taxes.Here's the rub: This money buys nothing. It doesn't help the poor. It doesn't improve the nation's security. It doesn't go to education, the environment, roads or parks.Yes, tax complexity provides steady business for tax lawyers and accountants — H&R Block's average fee has nearly tripled since 1980, after adjusting for inflation, according to the National Taxpayers Union report out last month — and for tax software companies. But is there anyone who thinks this is the most productive use of these vast sums of money?There are other hidden costs. The massive complexity of the code makes it easier to cheat, which the IRS says results in a tax gap of more than $400 billion a year. (That also means a simpler tax code could raise as much money as today with far lower rates.)As if this weren't bad enough, the current tax code distorts economic activity and hampers startup companies, thereby slowing the economy.The problem is that Congress keeps adding to the complexity problem, while rarely pruning. The IRS says that Congress has made 5,000 changes to the tax code since 2001 — an average of more than one a day. ObamaCare added mightily to tax complexity, since it put the IRS in charge of handling insurance subsidies. That one law resulted in thousands of pages of new IRS regulations.This is madness.Yet there is little hope for relief, because lawmakers insist on using the tax code to achieve public policy goals, whether it's to make the code more ""fair"" or to encourage certain types of behaviors, investments and the like. Every time Congress tries to enlist the tax code to do something other than raise revenue, it ramps up complexity.The solution — which we have advocated for years in this space — is a simple flat tax with few or no deductions that can be filled out on a postcard. The flat tax always rankles the left, which calls it a giveaway to the rich. But imagine how much the welfare of the nation would improve if we could put the $406 billion wasted on tax compliance to better use.Note: This editorial had misstated the tax compliance cost figure calculated by the Tax Foundation. The correct number is $409 billion.RELATED:Never Mind The Gimmicks, We Need Real Tax ReformTrump Needs A Big Win On The Board, Here's How To Get OneJust As With Reagan, Getting Tax Reform Right Today Is Key To Booming Economy

21,HRB,"President Trump on Wednesday met with retail CEOs, promising to cut industry regulations and urging them to build more stores, while Target (TGT) afterward warned a proposed border tax would raise prices.Trump also promised a ""massive"" tax plan ""in the not-too-distant future."" That followed Trump's remarks to airline CEOs last week when he vowed to announce something ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" in the coming weeks.Wednesday's meeting included CEOs from Gap (GPS), AutoZone (AZO), Target, Tractor Supply (TSCO) and JCPenney (JCP), who were in Washington, D.C., to lobby the White House and Congress against the border tax.""We're cutting regulations big league,"" Trump said at the meeting, later adding, ""You have a very, very big regulatory problem, and we're going to take care of that, because I want more jobs.""He also pressed the executives on growth.""We want you to expand your stores,"" Trump said. ""You'll tell me why you will or why you won't. And tell me why you won't, we'll work on you a little bit.""The issue of a border tax did not come up specifically during the public remarks. But Target said later it was brought up, though didn't mention what Trump said about it.""They also discussed the … proposal for a border adjustability tax, which is a priority issue for Target because it will raise prices for American families on everyday essentials,"" Target said in a statement, according to CNBC.If enacted, Target said, such a policy ""would have profound implications for our guests and business, and at Target, we believe that anything that raises prices for families is not a good idea for America.""Trump did reiterate his administration's attempts to bring down the overall tax burden on businesses and simplify the tax code, so much so, that ""H&R Block probably won't be too happy — that's one business that might not be happy with what we're doing.""Shares of H&R Block (HRB) fell as much as 2% on the comment but pared losses and were down 0.8% to close at 20.80 on the stock market today. TurboTax provider Intuit (INTU) was flat.Shares of Target were up 0.2% to 65.75, Gap added 0.8% to 24.39.

23,HRB,"The choice for voters is clear: a tax cut from Donald Trump or a pay cut courtesy of Hillary Clinton. Trump is promising to slash income taxes to zero for millions of people currently paying them, and to reduce the tax bite on everyone.Clinton isn't cutting income tax rates for anyone. Instead, she's campaigning to hike business taxes, despite warnings it will cause wages to plummet and the economy to tank.No wonder Trump is moving up in the polls. Most Americans are still making less than they did in 2007. The mainstream media want to double down on the ""birther"" controversy and other fabricated issues. Voters aren't fooled. They'll vote their wallets.Trump proposes a zero income tax rate for singles making $25,000 and couples making twice that. Instead of paying the government money, they'll file a one-page tax form that says, ""I win.""Moving up the ladder, singles earning $35,000 will save about a thousand dollars, according to tax experts at CNN Money. And singles earning $64,000 will get a $2,700 break, on average. Anyone earning $112,000 will save more than $5,300. Sweet.And that's before applying Trump's proposed deductions for child care, which will average $12,000 per child regardless of whether parents actually incur child care expenses. A boon for stay-at-home parents. Bottom line: Working couples with two kids will pay no federal income tax on their first $60,000 to $70,000 in household income.Clinton promises credits — but only to families that actually spend.Disregard Clinton's bogus claims that Trump wants ""to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself."" Nonsense. Trump caps deductions at $100,000 for singles and double that for couples, so some high rollers will end up paying more.As for the misery of tax preparation, Trump simplifies it: only three brackets, all lower. He jokes about putting H&R Block (HRB) out of business. Clinton's plan adds complexity: more brackets and additional rules.Keeping more of what you earn is good. Earning more is even better. To give everyone a shot at a brighter economic future, the next president and Congress need to jump-start the economy by slashing business taxes. Right now, the economy is limping along at 1.2% — a third of the normal growth rate over the last century. Partly to blame for the stagnation are corporate taxes — the highest in the developed world. They are driving companies to leave the U.S. and putting those that stay at a global disadvantage.Trump proposes cutting taxes by over half for large and small businesses to encourage them to stay, expand and hire.Meanwhile, Clinton preaches class warfare, vilifying businesses for not ""paying their fair share"" and pledging tax hikes. Recession, here we come. A Federal Reserve report warns that ""increases in corporate tax rates lead to significant reductions in employment and income.""Typically, Democrats bash business tax cuts as ""trickle-down economics"" to benefit rich Republicans. But the inspiration for Donald Trump's tax reform came from a Democrat — John F. Kennedy — who faced a stagnant economy when he became president in 1961.Kennedy understood tax cuts would cause businesses to invest, boosting worker productivity. More productive workers lead to higher wages as well as more goods and services to go around. A more abundant nation.Kennedy startled the nation by insisting that tax cuts would ultimately produce more tax revenue — not less — thereby reducing deficits. He was right, as Larry Kudlow explains in his new book, ""JFK and the Reagan Revolution.""JFK slashed business taxes, and after his assassination, Congress enacted the rest of his tax program, igniting 5% annual growth for the next eight years.Ronald Reagan repeated the formula in the 1980s, launching 20 years of 4% plus growth.It can happen again. Hillary Clinton has given up on growth. Voters can't afford to.

28,HRB,"Money manager Vladimir “Val” de Vassal holds the same kind of leading stocks that you probably try to buy. But can you say your portfolio has outperformed 98% of your peers?De Vassal of Glenmede Investment Management aims to remove messy emotion from his buy and sell decisions. That adds to his performance in the long run, he says.Through May 31, he and his colleagues, including co-manager Paul Sullivan, have steered $2.3 billion Glenmede Large Cap Growth Fund (GTLLX) to average annual gains that topped all but 2% of their large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past three and five years.Since de Vassal took the reins in early 2004, the mutual fund has scored a 9.16% average annual gain, while the S&P 500 averaged 7.26%.The fund’s star performance over both the long and short term make it an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersIn an interview with IBD from his Philadelphia office, De Vassal, 56, shared some of his investing secrets. Here’s what he had to say about the techniques that allow his investing team to beat the S&P time and again:IBD: You have a quantitative investment approach. What does that mean, and how do you mix in fundamental research with that?De Vassal: I look at our process as a quantitative discipline based on fundamental insights. I worked with fundamental managers for 20 years. They were value-oriented, growth-oriented, small-cap, large-cap, even international. Basically, one of my responsibilities was objectively assessing their criteria in selecting stocks in their particular sectors or universe, and assessing what worked and what didn't.And I've tried to remove the emotion and subjectivity out of the process.So we've built a library of the factors that worked and that didn't. They're different for different sectors. If you talk with a tech analyst versus a utility analyst, they talk about very different metrics as to why a company is effective or not.So we've built models that are unique for each sector. Some factors may be similar, but when we look at stocks, we look at them relative to their peers in the sector in terms of their attractiveness. This is a continual process every year.We add each year of data to our analysis. And we'll test new ideas.We have dialogue with our internal portfolio managers and analysts. We also have dialogue with some leading Street research firms like Empirical (Research Partners), Bernstein, JPMorgan (JPM) and Citi (C).IBD: What type of market does your approach work best in?De Vassal: Our process works when valuations and earnings matter. We look to create a portfolio that is cheap with high cash flow versus its benchmark, but has strong consistent profitability. And the stocks we own are likely to have positive earnings and revenue surprises, and fewer negative earnings and revenue surprises, than the benchmark.Where the strategy can struggle is when investors are distracted by macro issues. In the financial crisis in the Great Recession, earnings didn't matter. Investors fled equities, and they didn't care at what price.In that situation, when investors are not focused on specific company fundamentals but are driven by macro and behavioral issues, our models have less efficacy.IBD: What about more recently?De Vassal: Other periods when the strategy underperforms would be risk rallies, like 2009, and we've had a pretty strong risk rally starting in March this year, when a lot of the riskiest names are outperforming, in the last couple of months.But in this risk rally, there's been a lot of price dislocation when you look across stocks within sectors, a lot of gap between high- and low-priced stocks measured on, say, price-to-book.So this year's risk rally is a good environment for active equity managers because there seems to be a large arbitrage opportunity between cheap and expensive stocks that maybe can be taken advantage of. Those create opportunities for future price appreciation.IBD: So you like the current market?De Vassal: Our indicators still suggest we're in a positive growth environment for the U.S. economy. We had two weak quarters in Q4 and Q1. But our models suggest we should expect a rebound. Most economists expect 2% to 3% annualized growth in GDP for this quarter and the next couple of quarters.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWe favor more cyclical sectors right now, like technology and consumer discretionary. We're underweight in interest-rate sensitive sectors like utilities and REITs.IBD: Let's talk about how you put your strategy to work. How does Edwards Lifesciences (EW) fit in? All of my questions are as of your latest disclosure.De Vassal: We owned it as of Jan. 31. It had good return on equity, over 20%. More sell-side analysts were raising than lowering estimates for the year and next year. The valuation was not cheap. But the fact that more analysts are raising estimates and that it has strong profitability and momentum -- historically, strong earnings growth offsets a rich valuation. And that's why we included this stock.IBD: What other holdings were you attracted to for similar reasons?De Vassal: Other names we bought in January were Oracle (ORCL), Masco (MAS), Schwab (SCHW). Again, they were attractive based on our criteria, a combination of earnings growth and analysts' estimates.One stock we sold in January was H&R Block (HRB). It was in the bottom quintile of its sector. Fortunately -- it's down 40% since we sold it.If there's something hitting one of our downside screens, we force it out of the portfolio. No questions asked.It takes time for fundamental analysts and portfolio managers to fall in love with a stock. But once they put it into a portfolio, it's hard for them to let go. We try to remove that emotion out of the process. In the long term, that adds to our performance.IBD: How does your approach differ from a fundamentals-only fund manager's?De Vassal: We look for stock that is cheap and has positive growth metrics and (whose coverage) analysts are raising estimates. We just look at what criteria work best in differentiating stocks in a sector. If it's a health care company, we don't look at what's in their pipeline, for example. Our stock ranking model for health care emphasizes high free cash flow yield, low relative price-to-book, strong reinvestment rate and positive earnings and revenue estimate revisions.IBD: Facebook (FB) has three quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. How do you look at this holding?De Vassal: It's attractive in our models. Its valuation is not cheap. But its fundamentals and growth story are positive. So is the fact that analysts are raising estimates.There have been periods when we sold Facebook because it was getting too rich. Last year, the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, which is now Alphabet (GOOGL)) were just flying. But their valuations got too rich, and we wouldn't hold on. But at this point, Facebook would still be considered a buy in our models.IBD: You opened a stake in Lowe's (LOW) just last year. What was your thesis?
"
29,HRB,"De Vassal: We started our stake in June 2015. It ranked in the top third of our stock-ranking models. It had positive (revenue and earnings) estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. Valuation was not too extreme. The price-earnings ratio on this year's earnings was under 20.Our stock-ranking models are based on 12-month periods. We look to turn over about 1/12th of the portfolio each month to maintain attractiveness. Every month we look to refresh and harvest losses to offset short-term gains in particular.IBD: Cadence Design's (CDNS) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for two quarters. What's your quant view?De Vassal: It has had very positive earnings revisions. When we ran this in January, every analyst raised estimates for this company. Its P-E is not that expensive. It was 17.7 in January. It has done well and is now a little over 20.IBD: Thinly traded Mettler Toledo (MTD) is in an uptrend, but its EPS growth is slowing slightly. What's your view?De Vassal: It is still attractively ranked in our model. Estimate revisions are more neutral. But we showed positive for looking forward on analysts' estimates. It has very strong profitability, very high ROE. January ROE was over 40%. Some was contingent on book value. It's decelerating, but historically their growth has been over 10%. Looking forward, this still looks like double-digit growth, even if low double digits.IBD: You've been boosting your stake in Accenture (ACN). Why?De Vassal: It has a very attractive rank in the tech sector for us. Analysts at the margins are raising their estimates. It has high ROE and a good track record of dividend growth.IBD: What makes you different from other quant-oriented fund managers?De Vassal: The difference is in four principles.First, we believe in active management, and that stocks get mispriced. One issue with benchmark indices is that if a stock is overpriced, effectively it is overweighted. To address that, we ignore weights of individual stocks. We want to avoid the idiosyncratic risk of overexposure to a single name. If everything else is equal between a midcap and a mega-cap name, why wouldn't you invest in both instead of overweighting one just because it has a larger weight in the benchmark?Second, we treat each sector differently. I don't believe one model should be used for all stocks. Stocks in different sectors have different attributes and business models.Third, downside risk screens, including quality of earnings; avoiding companies with poor stock quality, debt and/or high idiosyncratic risk.Fourth, we differentiate stocks that are more likely to have positive versus negative surprises based on sell-side analyst behavior, company fundamentals and technical data.IBD: The idea behind your quantitative approach is that it homes in on the factors that identify stocks which outperform and it enables you to avoid being sidetracked by subjective factors that are, basically, irrelevant to outperformance, right?De Vassal: Yes, we build extensive back tests going back 20 years-plus, that identify which combinations of criteria would create a portfolio of stocks that outperform the average stock in the sector on a rolling 12-month basis, and which would be in the top 20%, the most attractive stocks.IBD: What about risk?De Vassal: We're looking for the most consistent excess return over rolling 12-month periods. So we're looking for the highest return per unit of shortfall risk. And shortfall risk would be any (stock) that didn't outperform the average stock by at least 200 basis points.We want to have upside, but we don't want to have much downside performance relative to the average stock.IBD: Some managers portray themselves as people who eat and sleep fund management, doing nothing else. But you've got at least one interesting hobby. Tell me about it, please.De Vassal: Well, one of my hobbies is genealogy. My last name is French. It's an old French name. We have a family tree going back more than 1,000 years. Apparently family members did a thousand-year reunion in 1987. We learned about it after the fact.We have a lot of documentation, interesting history. Our family went from France to the Ukraine in the early 1800s. We actually, this past Saturday, we saw relatives that we didn't know about. One, she was my third cousin. We got in touch through a Frenchman who was doing genealogical research on my family, and we ended up connecting for the first time.

32,HRB,"No. 1 tax-preparation software maker Intuit (INTU) -- as it heads into its busy season -- posted Q2 earnings and Q3 revenue guidance that beat Wall Street expectations, only to see its shares fall. One analyst says that the shares might be falling because the company didn't raise its guidance for the year.At least two analysts raised their price targets on Intuit stock after the earnings release, and another was bullish on the tax season. Yet, Intuit stock fell 4.3% on the stock market today, to 95.75.In an interview after the earnings release late Thursday, Intuit CFO Neil Williams said that the company's ""momentum is really continuing into Q3.""Intuit said that sales for its fiscal Q2, which ended Jan. 31, rose 23% from the year-earlier quarter to $923 million. The company swung to a 25-cent per-share profit minus items from a 6-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $893 million and 19 cents.The company doesn't give earnings guidance, but it expects Q3 sales of $2.2 billion to $2.26 billion -- at the midpoint up only 4.4% from the year-earlier quarter but above the $2.2 billion analyst consensus. Wall Street expects EPS ex items to rise 10%, to $3.15 per share.For the fiscal year, Intuit sees revenue of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion, up 8.5% at the midpoint.But the company didn't raise its guidance for the year, RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan told IBD, and there are questions about the company's underlying growth potential.Another factor could be the strong earnings and guidance this week from software makers  Salesforce.com (CRM) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). Intuit, MacMillan says, is regarded as a ""defensive"" stock play, but if other stocks are doing well, Intuit is less attractive.In a research note, MacMillan said that Intuit's TurboTax sales stood out last quarter, rising 9%. He hiked his price target on Intuit stock -- but only to 93 from 91.UBS analyst Brent Thill called the results the ""best start to tax season in 13 years.""The fiscal Q3 tax season is always the company's biggest quarter.“We’re in the third year of a multiyear journey and are beginning to see a sea change in how Americans prepare their taxes, driven by the massive innovation across the TurboTax experience combined with a breakthrough marketing campaign that makes our product the hero,” Sasan Goodarzi, executive vice president and general manager of Intuit’s Consumer Tax Group, said in the earnings release.Part of Intuit's plan to drive consumer tax growth is to leverage its do-it-yourself tax packages, CFO Williams told IBD. ""Think about growing the DIY market as growing our total addressable market,"" he said.Thill also says that Intuit is a good defensive play. Williams agrees, saying that the small businesses that comprise much of Intuit's customer base often turn to its software packages when the economy heads south. Besides TurboTax, Intuit is known for its Quicken and QuickBooks small-business software.""Our products are needed most when small-business owners are maybe facing some headwinds economically."" Williams said. ""We do well with economic uncertainty.""Wedbush analyst Gil Luria raised his price target on Intuit stock to 100 from 90.Intuit rival H&R Block (HRB), which makes the other major tax-preparation software product, is slated to report fiscal Q3 earnings on Thursday.

Europe's Brent crude benchmark tumbled almost 2% to below $40 a barrel for the first time since February 2009. West Texas Intermediate fell more than 2% to trade below $37 a barrel. Gold and other metals, as well as agricultural commodities, continued in mixed trade.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) fell hardest among Dow stocks, down about 3% apiece.On the S&P 500, H&R Block (HRB) skidded 6% to the bottom of the list. The tax preparation chain's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue missed consensus expectations. Management said foreign currency issues dragged on results.AutoZone (AZO) rolled up nearly 4% after reporting better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings. Gross margins expanded to 52.5%, up from 52.1% a year ago, and the company repurchased $400 million in shares during the quarter. Tuesday's gain left the stock about 3% from its November high, and almost 4% above a 755 flat-base buy point.Gains on the IBD 50 list were modest, holding to less than 1%. On the downside, about 10% of the group fell 2% or more.Dave & Buster's (PLAY) dropped almost 3% in heavy trade. The slip stopped well short of the stock's 50-day moving average, and could set the stage for the stock to shape a handle on a potential two-month base.China-based asset manager Noah (NOAH) slumped more than 3%. The stock is crafting a handle on a flawed, 51% deep cup base.Follow Alan Elliott on Twitter @IBD_AELliott and on Facebook.

34,HRB,"Intuit (INTU) late Thursday posted Q1 earnings and sales that beat Wall Street's expectations and sent shares rising after hours. The company, the maker of No. 1 tax software TurboTax and the small-business software suite QuickBooks Online, reported revenue of $713 million, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter, and earnings per share minus items of 9 cents, swinging from an 11-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $670 million and a 4-cent per-share loss.Intuit stock was up 8% in after-hours trading after it released results for its fiscal Q1, which ended Oct. 31. Intuit stock rose a fraction in Thursday's regular session to 97.42, which is down 11% from its all-time high above 109, touched on May 22.""We exceeded our subscriber and financial targets in the first quarter and have raised our earnings per share guidance for the fiscal year based on these initial strong results and our acceleration of share repurchases in the quarter,"" Intuit CEO Brad Smith said in the company's earnings release.The company said that its small-business operations ""drove momentum"" and that QuickBook Online subscriptions, a key metric, rose 57% to 1.159 million subscribers.Intuit executives raised Q2 EPS ex-items guidance to 17-20 cents. The company expects revenue of $880 million-$900 million, where Wall Street had modeled $823 million.Intuit is amid a transition. In August, the company announced that it would sell its popular personal finance software Quicken as well as its QuickBase and Demandforce business lines. In its earnings release, the company said that it's ""on track"" to divest the businesses by ""early 2016.""Intuit will focus on ""doing the nation's taxes, and small business,"" spokeswoman Diane Carlini told IBD. TurboTax's main rivals are tax preparation products from tax service company H&R Block (HRB).Fiscal Q3, ending on or near April 30, is Intuit's largest quarter because of the U.S. tax season, during which the company garners about half its annual revenue. For Q3 fiscal 2016, Wall Street expects revenue to rise 5% year over year to $2.3 billion.

57,HRB,"As new laws and regulations make life more complicated, some companies find a way to win under the changing landscape.H&R Block (HRB) has seen the playing field change in two respects.First, the company's savings and loan arm faced higher capital requirements under the Dodd-Frank law. H&R responded by putting its S&L arm on the block. A deal was in the works, but Republic Bank recently backed out of the agreement. H&R still intends to unload the unit.Implementation of the new health insurance law is the second factor. Initially there was speculation that many IRS refunds that H&R Block navigates for its customers would be wiped out by the ObamaCare's tax penalty for not having health insurance. Human nature being human nature, H&R Block is more likely to get the blame than the new law, or at least that was the fear.In September, H&R Block responded by reaching a deal with GoHealth to develop an H&R Block-branded service to help clients shop and enroll in a health care plan while determining eligibility and applying for the government subsidy.At the earnings call in September, CEO William Cobb said the law will ""not result in a materially positive impact to our business in fiscal year 2014.""Still, the GoHealth deal essentially lessened fears of an ObamaCare-related negative impact on H&R Block. Also, ObamaCare is complicated and hard to understand, and that plays to H&R Block's strength.Because the fiscal fourth quarter ending in April is H&R Block's moneymaking quarter, investors should focus on annual earnings.EPS grew 25% last fiscal year on flat revenue. The Street expects 11% growth this fiscal year and 16% in the following year. Sales growth of 4% is expected both years.The company's quarterly dividend is 20 cents a share, which works out to an annualized yield of 2.9%. The dividend has not been increased in the past eight quarters.
"
58,HRB,"Most American consumers know by now that whatever the brand label on their electronics, most of them were made in the same network of factories in China. Shoppers at the website Monoprice.com follow this to its logical conclusion: Why not cut out the middlemen, and buy the gadgets straight from the Far East?
"
59,HRB,"Monoprice launched in 2002 selling cables and switches it had bought from Asia and offered at cut-rate prices thanks to its simplified supply chain. Since then, it's expanded into computer accessories and, more recently, audio and video equipment. And in August, it came to the stock market's attention when Blucora (BCOR) acquired it for $180 million.
"
60,HRB,"Search Engine Roots
"
61,HRB,"Blucora might have seemed an unlikely buyer for Monoprice, since the only thing the two companies had in common was the Internet. Up until 2012, Blucora was known as the search engine InfoSpace, a by-its-fingernails survivor of the dot-com boom and bust that experimented with various business models before stabilizing under the leadership of CEO William Ruckelshaus, who took the helm in 2010.
"
62,HRB,"In January 2012, however, it branched outside its core business by buying TaxAct, a provider of cloud-based tax-preparation software. Like Monoprice, TaxAct has carved out its place in a highly competitive market — dominated by Intuit (INTU) and H&R Block (HRB) — by undercutting its rivals on price.
"
63,HRB,"TaxAct has ""a product offering with substantially the same feature set as larger players in the space but at what we would characterize as a substantially more fair price for their filing,"" Ruckelshaus told the BMO Technology, Media & Entertainment Conference in December. ""The cornerstone of their offering is free federal filing for everybody regardless of your filing type or complexity or AGI (adjusted gross income), without any exclusions.""
"
64,HRB,"Another thing that TaxAct and Monoprice have in common is the potential that Ruckelshaus sees in them for expansion. He estimates that the digital do-it-yourself tax market is growing 4% to 6% a year, but the company has also been broadening its product offerings with sites designed to help people write up their own wills or navigate ObamaCare.
"
65,HRB,"Monoprice also continues to offer a wider variety of wares, with more than 5,000 kinds of product available at this point. Ruckelshaus believes the customer base can be expanded given the high satisfaction of existing customers — some 70% of reviews have given the site a 9 or 10 rating, he says. Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald wrote in his Dec. 31 initiation report that Monoprice should also benefit from secular growth.
"
66,HRB,"""Monoprice operates in large markets that are rapidly moving online,"" he wrote. ""Global consumer electronics is a $300 billion market growing at single digits. The $37 billion online subsegment is forecasted to grow approximately 15% annually through 2016, according to IDC.""
"
67,HRB,"Business In Transition
"
68,HRB,"Even so, the majority of Blucora's revenue — around 60% — is still coming from its core search business. The InfoSpace unit doesn't generate its own search results, but aggregates the results of other search engines through sites such as Dogpile and WebCrawler, as well as through its partners' properties and through the distribution of toolbars. It has more than 100 partners but about 31% of search revenue comes from the top five, led by Google (GOOG).
"
69,HRB,"Google has been the source of some concern for analysts, since early in 2013 it changed its software distribution policy in response to complaints about misleading toolbar downloads that wind up taking over the browser. Blucora changed its own policies in accord with Google's, which Fitzgerald says slowed search revenue growth by quite a bit last year — from 62.5% in the third quarter of 2012 to 17.9% in Q3 2013.
"
70,HRB,"Nonetheless, Blucora's third quarter handily beat expectations, sending its stock to a 12-year high. Profit rose 20% over the year-earlier quarter to 30 cents a share, nearly double analysts' consensus. Sales climbed 34% to $124 million, vs. analysts' estimate of $96 million.
"
71,HRB,"On the conference call to discuss results on Nov. 5, Wedbush analyst Gil Luria asked how the company had achieved such growth in its search revenue, given the policy changes.
"
72,HRB,"Ruckelshaus pointed to the advantage of using both the distribution-partner model and the owned-and-operated website model.
"
73,HRB,"""You're starting to see evidence of our taking advantage of that on the owned-and-operated side, which is really reverting back to where the company had its origins, which is as a consumer-facing provider of search solutions that are differentiated in their nature,"" he said. ""What you're seeing in recent periods is our ability to not just bring that product to market, but also to market it and promote it in a way that we think is a benefit to consumers and also a benefit to us.""
"
74,HRB,"Nonetheless, analysts still see an overhang in the expiration of InfoSpace's contract with Google at the end of the first quarter. Fitzgerald points out that both Google and Yahoo (YHOO), another major InfoSpace partner, have refused to renew contracts recently with partners who they thought were abusing their policies.
"
75,HRB,"However, Barrington Research analyst Alexander Paris didn't sound worried in his Dec. 9 research note.
"
76,HRB,"""While customer concentration is indeed high, we do believe the agreement will be renewed at similar terms,"" he wrote.
"
77,HRB,"Analysts overall expect continued solid growth from Blucora. They estimate that fourth-quarter sales jumped 62% over the year-earlier quarter to $158 million, with profit rising 63% to 39 cents a share.Most American consumers know by now that whatever the brand label on their electronics, most of them were made in the same network of factories in China.

Up until 2012, Blucora was known as the search engine InfoSpace, a by-its-fingernails survivor of the dot-com boom and bust that experimented with various business models before stabilizing under the leadership of CEO William Ruckelshaus, who took the helm in 2010.In January 2012, however, it branched outside its core business by buying TaxAct, a provider of cloud-based tax-preparation software. Like Monoprice, TaxAct has carved out its place in a highly competitive market — dominated by Intuit (INTU) and H&R Block (HRB) — by undercutting its rivals on price.TaxAct has ""a product offering with substantially the same feature set as larger players in the space but at what we would characterize as a substantially more fair price for their filing,"" Ruckelshaus told the BMO Technology, Media & Entertainment Conference in December. ""The cornerstone of their offering is free federal filing for everybody regardless of your filing type or complexity or AGI (adjusted gross income), without any exclusions.""Another thing that TaxAct and Monoprice have in common is the potential that Ruckelshaus sees in them for expansion. He estimates that the digital do-it-yourself tax market is growing 4% to 6% a year, but the company has also been broadening its product offerings with sites designed to help people write up their own wills or navigate ObamaCare.Monoprice also continues to offer a wider variety of wares, with more than 5,000 kinds of product available at this point. Ruckelshaus believes the customer base can be expanded given the high satisfaction of existing customers — some 70% of reviews have given the site a 9 or 10 rating, he says. Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald wrote in his Dec. 31 initiation report that Monoprice should also benefit from secular growth.""Monoprice operates in large markets that are rapidly moving online,"" he wrote. ""Global consumer electronics is a $300 billion market growing at single digits. The $37 billion online subsegment is forecasted to grow approximately 15% annually through 2016, according to IDC.""Business In TransitionEven so, the majority of Blucora's revenue — around 60% — is still coming from its core search business. The InfoSpace unit doesn't generate its own search results, but aggregates the results of other search engines through sites such as Dogpile and WebCrawler, as well as through its partners' properties and through the distribution of toolbars. It has more than 100 partners but about 31% of search revenue comes from the top five, led by Google (GOOG).Google has been the source of some concern for analysts, since early in 2013 it changed its software distribution policy in response to complaints about misleading toolbar downloads that wind up taking over the browser. Blucora changed its own policies in accord with Google's, which Fitzgerald says slowed search revenue growth by quite a bit last year — from 62.5% in the third quarter of 2012 to 17.9% in Q3 2013.Nonetheless, Blucora's third quarter handily beat expectations, sending its stock to a 12-year high. Profit rose 20% over the year-earlier quarter to 30 cents a share, nearly double analysts' consensus. Sales climbed 34% to $124 million, vs. analysts' estimate of $96 million.On the conference call to discuss results on Nov. 5, Wedbush analyst Gil Luria asked how the company had achieved such growth in its search revenue, given the policy changes.Ruckelshaus pointed to the advantage of using both the distribution-partner model and the owned-and-operated website model.""You're starting to see evidence of our taking advantage of that on the owned-and-operated side, which is really reverting back to where the company had its origins, which is as a consumer-facing provider of search solutions that are differentiated in their nature,"" he said. ""What you're seeing in recent periods is our ability to not just bring that product to market, but also to market it and promote it in a way that we think is a benefit to consumers and also a benefit to us.""Nonetheless, analysts still see an overhang in the expiration of InfoSpace's contract with Google at the end of the first quarter. Fitzgerald points out that both Google and Yahoo (YHOO), another major InfoSpace partner, have refused to renew contracts recently with partners who they thought were abusing their policies.However, Barrington Research analyst Alexander Paris didn't sound worried in his Dec. 9 research note.""While customer concentration is indeed high, we do believe the agreement will be renewed at similar terms,"" he wrote.Analysts overall expect continued solid growth from Blucora. They estimate that fourth-quarter sales jumped 62% over the year-earlier quarter to $158 million, with profit rising 63% to 39 cents a share.

78,HRB,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is H&R Block, Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in HRB.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen four estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $2.38 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.91.Also, for the current quarter, H&R Block has seen two downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 79 cents a share from a loss of 72 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 19.2% in the past month.H&R Block, Inc.

The top-line figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,328 million.H&R Block, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise H&R Block, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | H&R Block, Inc. Quote For fiscal 2018, the company reported revenues of $3,159.9 million compared with $3,036.3 million in the prior year. The upside was driven by increased U.S. Assisted tax preparation fees owing to favorable net average charge and mix, partially offset by a decrease in return volume.Total operating expenses were up 4.4% year over year to $1,142.4 million owing to higher compensation costs and occupancy costs.Financial PositionH&R Block exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,544.9 million compared with $1,011.3 million as of Apr 30, 2017. Total outstanding long-term debt was approximately $1,494.6 million, relatively flat with the prior-year quarter.For the fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities was $850 million, which was 53.9% higher than the year-ago period.DividendH&R Block’s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share payable on Jul 2, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Jun 22.

80,HRB,"Rent-A-Center, Inc. (RCII  -  Free Report) is through with the previously announced “comprehensive review of strategic and financial alternatives,” as part of which management also explored a possible divestiture of the company. However, Rent-A-Center did not get any buyout offers that suited its main business sale objectives such as maximizing shareholders’ value.Following a detailed review of various alternatives, management believes that continuing with its previously unveiled strategic plan would be best for the company as well as its shareholders. Well, Rent-A-Center has been well on track with its strategic plan, which is yielding solid results. This is clearly reflected by the company’s revised financial guidance and its core April and May operating metrics.Preliminary April & May Sales DataIn April, core U.S. same store sales rose 3.3%, while same store sales of Acceptance NOW (“ANow”) increased 2.3%. Core U.S. same store sales jumped 3.6% in May and that of ANow increased 2.5%.The better-than-expected performance across both the business was backed by robust portfolio performance. Further, improved pricing and better marketing endeavors fueled core customer growth for the first time ever, during April and May. Also, customer retention increased considerably, in comparison to historical averages. Same store sales of ANow were also driven by a double-digit rise in demand, courtesy of the recently executed value plans at most ANow locations.Updated Cost-Savings ForecastsWith its strategic initiative underway, Rent-A-Center is moving exceedingly well toward solidifying its financial status and enhancing results. Markedly, the company’s cost-saving initiatives are much ahead of track, making it hopeful of generating annual run-rate savings of more than $100 million and savings of roughly $70 million in 2018. This fares better than management’s February and April forecasts.In February, Rent-A-Center forecasted annual savings in a range of $65-$85 million, with $43-$57 million delivered in 2018. In April, management upgraded this outlook and predicted annual savings of $75-$95 million, with $50-$63 million generated in 2018.2018 & Q2 Outlook This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company envisions consolidated revenues to range between $2.640 billion and $2.690 billion in 2018, including Core U.S. revenues of $1.835-$1.865 billion and ANow revenues of $730-$750 million. Further, adjusted EBITDA is expected to range from $160-$180 million. Finally, management envisions adjusted earnings for 2018 in a band of 65-90 cents. Free cash flow for the year is anticipated between $210 million and $230 million, up from at least $170 million expected in April.For the second quarter of 2018, Rent-A-Center projects consolidated revenues in a range of $640-$660 million. While Core U.S. revenues are expected to range from $450 million to $460 million, revenues of ANow are likely to come in a band of $170-$180 million. Management expects adjusted EBITDA to be roughly $40-$50 million and adjusted earnings to be about 20-30 cents per share. Free cash flow for 2018 is likely to be $30-$40 million.Clearly, this guidance reflects management’s confidence in the company’s capability to drive profitability, while enriching shareholders’ value. Let’s see if these factors can drive further growth at the stock that has gained 9.6% in the past three months, when the industry grew 12.4%.Interested in the Same Space?

81,HRB,"Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Jun 7. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.59%. Broadcom beat earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.79%.The company reported impressive first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Earnings of $5.12 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. The figure improved 41% from the year-ago quarter and 11.5% sequentially.Non-GAAP revenues from continuing operations were $5.33 billion, which increased 28% from the year-ago quarter and 10% on a sequential basis. The figure was slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.25 billion.Guidance & EstimatesFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, Broadcom forecasts non-GAAP revenues of almost $5 billion (+/- $75 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimates is pegged at $5 billon.Broadcom is increasing traction in 10G technology to support broadband video delivery. We believe that increase in demand for networking products from cloud and data centers as well as broadband access products, will positively impact Wired Infrastructure revenues in the to-be-reported-quarter.The company is also benefiting from strong demand for Wi-Fi chips and radio frequency solutions from smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Going forward, Purley product cycle, robust demand from enterprise and datacenters along with recovery in HDD demand will aid Enterprise Storage segment. The segment will also include Brocade Fiber Channel SAN business that is expected to generate a partial quarter revenues contribution.Broadcom believes that the storage business will benefit from strong adoption of All-Flash arrays in storage appliances infrastructure that utilizes the company’s PCI Express and NVMe technology.Industrial shipments and resale are likely to grow, which will drive segmental revenues in the second quarter.Factors to ConsiderSegmental Details & Strong Product PortfolioBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its wireless solutions. Last quarter, Wireless Communications (41% of total revenues) were up 88% year over year and 23% quarter over quarter to roughly $2.21 billion. Strong growth was driven by the ramp-up in shipments of next-generation platform from the company’s large North American smartphone customers. Higher dollar content in this platform also drove top-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Wireless Communications segment revenues are pegged at $1.36 billion.Coming to the Enterprise Storage (19% of total revenues) increased 40% from the year-ago quarter and 54% sequentially to $991 million. The increase was due to the contribution from the recently acquired Brocade Fibre Channel switch business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Enterprise Storage segment revenues are pegged at $1.12 Billion.Moving forward, Broadcom recently announced the launch of the latest NVMe and automation know-hows as well as Brocade G630 switch and Brocade FC32-64 port blade for the Brocade X6 director.Broadcom’s expanding product portfolio makes it well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G.We believe that the company’s extensive product portfolio, which serves multiple applications within four primary end markets (Wired Infrastructure, Wireless Communications, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial & Other), will positively impact the to-be-quarter’s results.Other Positives Early in the first quarter, Broadcom completed the long-delayed Brocade acquisition. It completed the divestiture of Brocade's campus WiFi and switch business to Arris for 800 million in cash. Moreover, it sold Brocade's headquarter building in Santa Clara for approximately 225 million in cash. The addition of Brocade will help the company further penetrate the FC SAN market and garner competitive prowess, going forward.Broadcom recently concluded the redomiciliation procedure of the company from Singapore to the State of Delaware in the United States. The now U.S. company is headquartered in San Jose, CA.Broadcom’s recent move will aid it to pursue the Qualcomm acquisition aggressively once more. The base-shift will also make the regulatory environment uncomplicated for Broadcom. Going forward, we believe that if the deal goes ahead Broadcom can reap the benefits of cost reduction as well as reduced competition.Qualcomm’s investment in 5G wireless services as well as NXP purchase, which will offer significant exposure to self-driving cars and automotive market, will empower Broadcom’s growth prospects.A possible merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm might create the world's third-largest semiconductor company, trailing Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung.Broadcom Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Broadcom Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Broadcom Limited QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that Broadcomis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Better-than-expected results were attributable to a rise in revenues during the quarter.Consolidated loss for the quarter came in at $1.18 per share compared with loss of 50 cents in the year-ago quarter owing to changes in effective tax rate resulting from the recently enacted federal corporate tax legislation.          Operational PerformanceH&R Block reported revenues of $488.4 million in the fiscal third quarter compared with $451.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year increase in revenues was attributable to higher return volumes in both Assisted and DIY tax preparation businesses. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $457 million.As of Feb 28, 2018, total U.S. return volume increased 3.4% with returns from Assisted and DIY businesses increasing 0.7% and 8.2%, respectively. While the Assisted business benefited from the success of early-season promotions including the company's Refund Advance no-interest loan and Free Federal 1040EZ offer, DIY business gained from continued product improvements, enhanced partnerships and the H&R Block More Zero promotion.Total operating expenses increased 2% year over year to $585.7 million due to higher compensation costs.Financial PositionH&R Block exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $187.4 million compared with $221.2 million in the year-ago period.

87,HRB,"In a bid to shift away from low-margin consumer electronics and strengthen entertainment portfolio, Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) announced plans to gain control of EMI Music Publishing. The company has agreed to buy all of the roughly 60% stake in EMI Music held by Mubadala Investment Company. This will increase Sony's stake to 90%, making it a consolidated subsidiary. EMI Music owns or administers more than 2 million songs.The deal is based on an enterprise value of $4.75 billion. Sony will also assume EMI Music's existing gross debt of about $1.359 billion as of Mar 31, 2018.The music business has witnessed a strong resurgence in the past couple of years, primarily driven by the growth of paid subscription-based streaming services. EMI Music’s extensive catalog will fortify Sony’s position as the leading music publisher amid a boom in streaming services that has boosted the value of music copyrights.The acquisition is the biggest so far by Kenichiro Yoshida, who became Sony’s new CEO in April. Sony is gradually shifting its focus away from making commodity products like televisions, personal computers and mobile phones. Instead, the company is expanding in areas like music, movies and games as well as building image sensors for mobile phone cameras. In May, Sony acquired a stake in Peanuts Holdings, the company behind Snoopy and Charlie Brown. The move was also aimed at strengthening Sony’s content.Yoshida also unveiled a three-year plan highlighting Sony’s increasing reliance on income from gaming subscriptions and entertainment. The Japanese gaming giant plans to invest ¥1 trillion ($9 billion) over the next three years, primarily in image sensors, per its revamped strategy to fortify hardware and creative content.In its mid-year plan, the company projected profit growth in most divisions over the next three years, but offered a somewhat conservative outlook. Sony expects operating profit in its video games and network services business to fall between ¥130 billion and ¥170 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2021, down from the ¥190 billion forecast for the current fiscal year.At the time, its PlayStation 4 (PS4) will near the end of a game console's typical life cycle. Operating profit in the semiconductor business is expected to grow in the range of ¥160-200 billion at the end of the forecast period compared with a prediction of ¥100 billion for the current fiscal year.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares have appreciated 36.1% over the past year, which compares favorably with the industry’s rally of 27.6%. Further, analysts have also revised the company’s estimates higher, recently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 has gone up from $3.77 recorded a couple of months back to $4.21 today — an improvement of 11.7%.

89,HRB,"H&R Block Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the market closes on Mar 6. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, beating estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 11.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderH&R Block is continuing with its aggressive client expansion policy with compelling promotions and product offers. At the same time, the company is actively investing in innovative solutions that leverage its ability to better serve customers through customized products. These include a redesigned website to file taxes anywhere on the go, high security standards to prevent tax identity theft and enhanced security features to safeguard taxpayer information. With such core business focus, the company anticipates providing improved services to its existing clientele while attracting newer ones to augment revenues.Moreover, the company has upgraded its desktop software by adding a slew of new features. The drag and drop feature enables users to import previous tax information and tax returns from any source. In addition, a maximum of five free federal returns can be filed. Free In-person Audit Support including step by step assistance for IRS Correspondence Management, Audit Preparation and Audit Representation will also be provided. It includes the option to add Tax Identity Care service at an extra price which will protect clients from tax identity theft. By providing high quality services at such reduced rates or for free, H&R Block aims to increase its consumer base in the tax services market.The company has been making various enhancements to its online digital tax software in order to improve monetization and conversion for the long run. It has also been focused on operational excellence, new product developments, partnerships, compelling marketing campaigns and promotions. The company expects these efforts to result in improved financial performance in fiscal 2018 accompanied by an increase in client trajectory.However, the company faces huge litigations in connection with its various operating activities. H&R Block is also exposed to employment related lawsuits in various parts of the country and compliance fee litigation in Missouri state and federal courts. Such litigations weigh on investors’ sentiments and hamper the company’s goodwill. Moreover, its debt-to-equity ratio compares unfavorably with the sector average. Additionally, the cash position of the company is fluctuating in nature. This raises skepticism about its ability to engage in de-leveraging activities. H&R Block uses multiple digital technologies to collect, transmit and store high volumes of personal client information, which increases information security risks. The company is highly susceptible to cyber attacks including computer viruses, malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, social engineering, denial of service attacks and other sophisticated attacks. These cyber attacks are designed to electronically circumvent network security for malicious purposes such as unlawfully obtaining personal client information and disrupting ability to offer services. This, in turn, could damage the brand name and credibility, resulting in loss of business. H&R Block has to continually invest in security measures to keep guard against cyber espionage, which leads to additional burden on its exchequer and erodes margins. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that H&R Block is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -24.29%.

91,HRB,"Rent-A-Center, Inc. (RCII  -  Free Report), which has been struggling to cope with the change in retail landscape, is still looking for ""strategic and financial alternatives"" and also announced job cuts. Additionally, the company has received bid from different parties for a possible sale. We expect Rent-A-Center to come out with a decision regarding possible sale in the second quarter of 2018. The company’s shares, which have been struggling, declining more than 37.3% in the past six months compared with the industry’s gain of 12.9%, took a sharp U-turn following the news. As a result, the stock gained 11.1% in after-hour trading session yesterday.Notably, Rent-A-Center’s major shareholder, Engaged Capital and activist investor, Marcato Capital, have been compelling management to look for strategic alternatives. In the past, the company has also rejected buyout offer from Private equity firm — Vintage Capital. Per Rent-A-Center, Vintage offer ""significantly undervalues the company"".Moreover, Rent-A-Center added that in an effort to reduce cost the company will reduce workforce by 250. This effort will not only help the company to “better align” organizational structure but is likely to result in annual cost savings of $65-$85 million from operations under the strategic plan. The layoff of 250 employees will generate $28 million in annual run-rate cost savings, with nearly $20 million to be recognized in 2018.Meanwhile, management has undertaken initiatives to strengthen the performance of its Core U.S. segment. In an attempt to augment cash flow generation from Core U.S. business, the company is focusing on rates, terms and purchase options that are much more aligned with the customer’s needs. Also, it is optimizing product mix, increasing the average ticket price, upgrading workforce, concentrating on lowering delinquency rates and rationalizing existing stores.Despite these efforts, investors remain concerned about the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s waning top and bottom lines. Since the past eight quarters, Rent-A-Center has been witnessing a year-over-year decline across its top and bottom lines. In fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 41 cents a share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 7 cents and a loss of 23 cents incurred in the year-ago period. Total revenue of $639 million also declined 6.6% year over year, missing the consensus mark of $659 million.Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the same space are Monro, Inc. (MNRO  -  Free Report), Weight Watchers International, Inc. (WTW  -  Free Report) and H&R Block, Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report).

93,HRB,"Rent-A-Center, Inc. (RCII  -  Free Report) is revisited by Vintage Capital Management, LLC (“Vintage”) with a proposal to acquire all of its outstanding shares in a cash transaction valued at $14 per share. Interestingly, Vintage has been looking to take over the company for long.Last November, the company received conditional, non-binding proposal from Vintage to buy all outstanding shares for $13 per share.The latest offer comes soon after Rent-A-Center’s board unanimously agreed on Jun 10 to continue with the execution of its strategic plan in the best interest of the company. This decision followed a strategic and financial review of alternatives, including the possible sale of the company. The board announced that its intent to be acquired was turned down due to the non-receipt of any proposal that would meet its target of maximizing shareholder value and have chances of conclusion.  Subsequent to this decision, the company also updated its business plan, which would significantly strengthen the financial profile and aid results.OutlookThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company projects consolidated revenues between $2.640 billion and $2.690 billion for 2018, including Core U.S. revenues of $1.835-$1.865 billion and Acceptance NOW (“ANow”) revenues of $730-$750 million. Finally, management envisions adjusted earnings for 2018 in the band of 65-90 cents.For the second quarter of 2018, Rent-A-Center projects consolidated revenues of $640-$660 million. While Core U.S. revenues are expected to range from $450 million to $460 million, revenues of ANow are likely to come in between $170 million and $180 million. Management expects adjusted earnings per share of about 20-30 cents.Clearly, this guidance reflects management’s confidence in the company’s capability to drive profitability, while enriching shareholders value. Let’s see, if these factors can drive growth for the stock, which has surged 38% in the past three months, outperforming the industry's rise of 13%.Wrapping UpWith strategies in place, Rent-A-Center is well on track to solidify its financial status and enhance results. Markedly, in April, core U.S. same store sales rose 3.3% and same store sales of ANow increased 2.3%. Core U.S. same store sales jumped 3.6% and ANow 2.5% in May.We are also encouraged by the company’s cost-saving initiatives, which are expected to generate annual run-rate savings of more than $100 million and savings of roughly $70 million in 2018. This compares favorably with management’s forecasts issued in February and April.Stocks to ConsiderWeight Watchers International, Inc.

96,HRB,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is in the spotlight again with recent announcements of collaboration with H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report) and launch of DisposeRx.H&R Block to Adorn Walmart’s Products LineupWal-Mart strives to ramp up its digital products portfolio, a strategy well in place with society’s growing online dependency. Well, the company’s latest venture of collaborating with H&R Block is another major stride toward augmenting offerings in this category.Per the terms of the deal, Wal-Mart will provide H&R Block‘s DIY desktop tax software products across the company’s outlets as well as online. The exclusive deal will enable H&R Block’s DIY products to have easier and greater customer access, enabling clients to prepare taxes efficiently. Apart from being priced competitively, these products also provide facilities such as in-person audit representation, unlimited and free tax advices, along with protection against tax identity theft.Looking back, Wal-Mart’s efforts to build an impressive digital brand portfolio include buyouts of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth, and Jet.com. The company has also been successful at developing easy and convenient delivery solutions through its new Mobile Express Returns program and the buyout of Parcel, Inc. In fact, Wal-Mart’s efforts to enhance delivery services resonate with its strategy of growing online grocery sales. Moreover, Wal-Mart also struck a deal with Lord & Taylor to launch a flagship store in spring 2018, which will help the company to offer premium fashion brands on its shopping website, directly sourced from the latter.DisposeRx : A Unique Solution for Reducing Drug AbuseWhen it comes to revolutionizing the retail spectrum and offering products for a quality lifestyle, Wal-Mart is among the trendsetters. This is evident from the company’s latest innovation, The DisposeRx solution. The DisposeRx contains ingredients that destroy unused pills by converting the same into a biodegradable gel. This unique product will aid patients to safely dispose leftover medications and effectively counter misuse of prescription opioids. Prescription narcotics are often unused and pose major health risk to those who come in its contact. Patients can request for a free DisposeRx packet across Wal-Mart’s pharmacy outlets in the U.S., including Sam’s Club pharmacies. The introduction of DisposeRx indicates the company’s willingness to develop a responsible society and fight drug abuse. Wrapping UpThat said, Wal-Mart’s business expansion efforts and strategic growth plans are quite commendable, aiding it to emerge strongly in an industry characterized with stiff competitive pressures and aggressive promotions.

99,HRB,"The stock market is marching higher, hitting multiple fresh highs amid Washington turmoil, geopolitical risks and lofty valuation. In such a scenario, dividend investing seems a perfect choice. These cash payouts are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk.In particular, stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pay high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation.Why Dividend Growth Investing Is Better?Dividend growth stocks offer the best of both worlds –– potential for capital appreciation and rising income even in a volatile market. This is because these stocks belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, while simultaneously offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.Dividend growth reflects a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth stocks quality and promising investments for the long term. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that hike is likely in the future.Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.Here are six of the 24 stocks that fit the bill:Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report): This Georgia-based company is America's fastest growing international carrier that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo in the United States and internationally.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.H&R Block Beats Q4 Earnings & Revenue EstimatesH&R Block reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Apr 30, 2017) adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $3.76 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.51. Increase in earnings was attributed to a rise in revenues during the quarter.GAAP earnings from continuing operations came in at $3.79 per share compared with $3.15 in the year-ago quarter.For full-year fiscal 2017, the company reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.96 per share compared with $1.53 in the prior year.

Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,316 million.For fiscal 2017, the company reported revenues of $3,036.3 million, relatively flat with the prior year.

The stock was allocated a grade of 'A' on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of 'A'. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookThe stock has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

108,HRB,"H&R Block Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report) incurred third-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Jan 31, 2018) loss from continuing operations of $1.16 per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of $1.33. Better-than-expected results were attributable to a rise in revenues during the quarter.Consolidated loss for the quarter came in at $1.18 per share compared with loss of 50 cents in the year-ago quarter owing to changes in effective tax rate resulting from the recently enacted federal corporate tax legislation.          Operational PerformanceH&R Block reported revenues of $488.4 million in the fiscal third quarter compared with $451.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year increase in revenues was attributable to higher return volumes in both Assisted and DIY tax preparation businesses. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $457 million.H&R Block, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  H&R Block, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | H&R Block, Inc. QuoteAs of Feb 28, 2018, total U.S. return volume increased 3.4% with returns from Assisted and DIY businesses increasing 0.7% and 8.2%, respectively. While the Assisted business benefited from the success of early-season promotions including the company's Refund Advance no-interest loan and Free Federal 1040EZ offer, DIY business gained from continued product improvements, enhanced partnerships and the H&R Block More Zero promotion.Total operating expenses increased 2% year over year to $585.7 million due to higher compensation costs.Financial PositionH&R Block exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $187.4 million compared with $221.2 million in the year-ago period.

109,HRB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put H&R Block, Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, H&R Block has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.0, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.0. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, H&R Block’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 31.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that H&R Block has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for H&R Block stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, H&R Block has a P/S ratio of about 1.9. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.6 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, HRB is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, H&R Block currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes H&R Block a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for H&R Block is just 1.0, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.3. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 9.6, which is far better than the industry average of 13.9. Clearly, HRB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though H&R Block might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D. This gives HRB a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current fiscal year as well as the next year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower.As a result, the current fiscal year consensus estimate has risen by 35.9% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has increased 16.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:H&R Block, Inc. Price and Consensus  H&R Block, Inc. Price and Consensus | H&R Block, Inc. QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineH&R Block is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. With a formidable industry rank (among the Top 27%) and strong Zacks Rank, H&R Block looks like a strong value contender. In fact, over the past one year, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

111,HRB,"With a diverse portfolio of products and services, H&R Block, Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report) is a premier player in the consumer tax services market. Headquartered in Kansas City, MO, the company provides tax, accounting and business consulting services and products across the globe.After the divestiture of H&R Block Bank, HRB has been diligently focusing on improving the efficiencies and capabilities of its core businesses. The company made several enhancements to its online digital tax software to improve monetization and conversion. HRB has also forayed into the health insurance brokerage business through collaboration with GoHealth to create additional revenue-generating opportunities. However, HRB continues to face unfavorable foreign currency translation and employment-related lawsuits. Moreover, its debt-to-equity ratio compares unfavorably with the sector average.In the last four trailing quarters, HRB has reported a positive average earnings surprise of 11.4%, beating earnings estimates thrice. With rising operating costs and adverse currency translation effects gradually shrinking margins, investors have been eagerly waiting for the company’s latest earnings report.Currently, HRB has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings report which was just released. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just-revealed announcement below.Earnings: HRB reported narrower loss.

112,HRB,"The Iconix Brand Group, Inc. (ICON  -  Free Report) has recently bought back the remaining 50% interest in Iconix Canada from its joint-venture partner for $19 million. As per the agreement, Iconix paid $12 million, while the remaining $7 million would be paid in the next two years.  Iconix has been forming international joint ventures since 2008 and seeks to monetize its brands through these operations, which have significantly contributed to its revenues. Moreover, expanding international business is a vital aspect in Iconix’s growth strategy. Iconix is quite underpenetrated in Canada. Therefore, acquiring the remaining stakes in Iconix Canada will enable the company to strengthen its business in the region. Iconix Canada was formed in 2013 and has licenses for brands such as London Fog, Rampage, Charisma and Zoo York amongst many others.Similar to that of Canada, Iconix has previously acquired full interest of its business in other territories. In 2015 and 2014, the company acquired the remaining 50% stake in Iconix China and Latin America, respectively. It has also established a joint venture in Middle East and North America.Iconix also announced that it would retain its existing 51% interest in the Buffalo brand. The company had previously considered selling its interest in the Buffalo brand, but refrained from the same as the brand has been performing well in Canada and the U.S. Further, retaining the stake in the brand will facilitate gaining 100% control of Iconix Canada as well as solidify the company’s position for organic growth.Of late, the company has been divesting brands to focus on its core portfolio and spending resources on businesses that generate significant volume. This includes the divestiture of non-core brands such as Sharper Image, Badgley Mischka, Peanuts Worldwide LLC and Strawberry Shortcake brand.Though such divestitures are in line with the company’s efforts to develop a strong and yielding portfolio, they are mainly carried out to reduce its debt burden. We have also noticed that Iconix has been witnessing sluggishness in the women's and men's segments in the last nine consecutive quarters. These headwinds are clearly reflected in the share price of the company. Shares of Iconix have plunged 36.1% in the past six months, underperforming the industry’s 7.7% gain.Despite such challenges, we expect Iconix’s strategic partnerships and consistent efforts for international expansion would improve its performance in the long run. Besides entering into joint ventures, Iconix also tries to achieve growth on the back of direct-to-retail partnerships and licensing agreements. Moreover, the long-term agreements and brand exclusivity contracts are incentives to retailers who make efforts to promote Iconix’ products, which in turn help to boost sales.Iconix currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

H&R Block is also increasing its share in the digital and assisted space as well as growing its international operations.

128,HRB,"Founded in 1946 and headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, H&R Block provides tax preparation services through retail tax offices in the U.S., Canada and Australia with approximately 2500 employees. The companys market capitalization is $4.39 billion.

129,HRB,"Earnings Preview 3/2/12
"
130,HRB,"Earnings season is just about over.  While there will be 273 firms reporting, only three of them will be members of the S&P 500.
"
131,HRB,"Firms reporting this week include Brown Foreman (BF.B  -  Free Report), H&R Block  (HRB  -  Free Report) and Pall Corp. (PLL).
"
132,HRB,"It will also be a busy week for economic data.  Key reports include Durable Goods, Personal Income and Spending, The ISM Manufacturing Index, Auto Sales and the second look at fourth quarter GDP.Monday
"
133,HRB,"The ISM non-manufacturing or service index is expected to fall to 56.0 from 56.8 in January.  As any reading over 50 indicates expansion, that is still a healthy reading, indicating fairly robust growth, just not quite as robust as last month.  However, the ISM manufacturing index delivered a big disappointment for February, so the market is likely to be on guard for a weaker services reading as well.
"
134,HRB,"Factory Orders are expected to have fallen 1.5% in January after rising 1.5% in December.  This would be consistent with the weak Durable goods report last week. Tuesday
"
135,HRB,"Nothing of particular significance.Wednesday
"
136,HRB,"We get the appetizer for the big jobs report in the form of the ADP Employment report.  As the biggest payroll processor for private sector companies, ADP is in a good position to gauge job growth.  However, its numbers and those of the BLS do not always line up exactly, although they do tend to converge after all the revisions are in.  Last month, ADP said that 170,000 private sector jobs were created, well below the 243,000 reported by the BLS.  However, for months before that ADP was noticeably more upbeat than the BLS.  For February, the Consensus is that ADP will show 220,000 jobs created.
"
137,HRB,"We get the second look at Productivity and Unit Labor Costs in the fourth quarter.  The consensus is looking for a slight upward revision to productivity, with growth of 0.8% rather than the 0.7% growth in the first look.  Unit Labor costs are expected to be revised slightly lower, to 1.1% growth from 1.2%.
"
138,HRB,"Consumer Credit, not counting real estate related loans like mortgages, is expected to have increased by $12.0 billion, noticeably slower than the $19.3 billion increase in December. Thursday 
"
139,HRB,"Weekly Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance were down 2,000 to 351,000 last week, but the prior week was revised up by 2000, so effectively unchanged.  The consensus is looking for a slight rebound to 355,000.  The drop in weekly claims well below the key 400,000 level was the first clue that the jobs situation was getting significantly better.  If claims fall again it would be a powerful sign that the momentum is continuing.  The big seasonal adjustments are all in the rearview mirror, so last week’s level is probably about right, but we have recently seen a lot of volatility in the weekly numbers.  Thus the four-week average is the thing to focus on (at 354,000 last week).  We are actually now well below the average level of claims for the last 35 years.  Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.
"
140,HRB,"Continuing Jobless Claims have been in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 2,000 to 3.402 million. That is down 443,000, or 11.5% from a year ago. The consensus is looking for a slight bounce to 3.405 million. Some (most?) of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 17,000 to 3.376 million last week and are down 1.127 million, or 25.0% over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits -- currently at 7.499 million. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.337 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed, all extended benefits will end at the start of March. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.Friday
"
141,HRB,"The big report of the week is the Employment report.  Last month was much better than expected at 243,000 total jobs added, with 257,000 coming from the private sector offset by the loss of 14,000 government jobs.  For February, the consensus is looking for 220,000 private sector jobs added and the loss of 11,000 government jobs for a total of 209,000.  Given the excellent behavior of the initial claims reports, I am expecting even better results, more in line with January.  The unemployment rate will depend on if the civilian participation rate rebounds.  There is a secular decline in that going on as the baby boomers retire, but we should also see a bit of a cyclical rise.  The consensus is looking for the unemployment rate to be unchanged at 8.3%, which along with the job creation totals would suggest a slight rise in the participation rate, although the unemployment rate is derived from the separate household survey.  Average hourly earnings are expected to rise by 0.2%, the same rate as last month, and the average work week is expected to be unchanged at 34.5 hours.
"
142,HRB,"The Trade Deficit is expected to fall slightly to $48.1 billion for January from $48.8 billion in December.  We have seen doing a good job of increasing exports of late, but imports have also been rising.  Higher oil prices make it more difficult to bring down the Trade Deficit.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
143,HRB,"The best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly, a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.  Given how few companies are reporting we omit this section this week.

147,HRB,"We are in a quiet period in the quarterly earnings reporting cycle, with the March quarter results effectively behind us now and a few weeks still to go before we really get into the heart of the Q2 earnings season. But quiet period or not, earnings reports never really stop, with this week bringing in 21 quarterly reports, including 2 from S&P 500 members. In fact, these 2 S&P 500 members reporting results this week – H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) – are officially the last earnings reports of the Q1 earnings season.We will start the tally for the Q2 earnings season the following week, as companies like Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and others start coming out with results for their May-ending fiscal quarters that form part of our Q2 tally.  Expectations for Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +5.7% from the same period last year on +6.5% higher revenues. This would follow +7.4% earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on +3.7% revenue growth, the highest growth pace in all most two years.Estimates for Q2 came down as the quarter unfolded, with the current +5.7% growth down from +7.9% at the end of March. The chart below shows how Q2 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last three months.Please note that while Q2 estimates have followed well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years, the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods. In other words, Q2 estimates have come down, but they haven’t come down by as much.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q1 (please note that we haven’t officially closed the books on Q1 yet, as 2 index members still have to report quarterly results).The chart below shoes Q2 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 6 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, this growth pace is expected to continue through the rest of the year.Recap of the Q1 Earnings SeasonTotal earnings for the 498 S&P 500 members that have reported quarterly results already are up +13.4% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues, with 72.5% beating EPS estimates and 65.5% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 52%.The table provides the current earnings season scorecard, as of June 9th, 2017.Comparing Q1 ResultsThe chart below provides a comparison of the growth performance thus far with what we have seen from this same group of 498 S&P 500 members in other recent periods.As you can see, the Q1 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 498 index members in other recent periods. Importantly, the growth performance is broad-based and not narrowly concentrated. We got the leadership from the Finance space earlier in the reporting cycle, but the baton has since shifted to Tech and host of other areas, including Industrials, Basic Materials, and Energy.Positive Revenue SurprisesThe chart below compares the proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises in Q1 thus far with what we had seen from the same group of 498 index members in other recent periods.The proportion of Q1 companies beating EPS estimates is tracking above historical periods, with positive revenue surprises particularly coming out ahead of what we are used to seeing in the recent past. You can see the same in the chart below that compares the proportion of Q1 companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates with other recent periods.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

149,HRB,"Economy in Focus as Earnings Season Comes to a Close
"
150,HRB,"Earnings aren’t the big news this week, with the focus squarely on top-tier economic reports about jobs and the broader economy. The market will be reading these reports with the Fed’s coming meeting in mind, weighing the odds whether the September 17/18 FOMC meeting will finally usher in the long-awaited ‘Taper’.The Real Time Insight post from my colleague Nick Kalivas captures the issue very nicely – Are We Beyond QE?
"
151,HRB,"The earnings season may no longer be front and center, but it isn’t (technically) over yet, with 41 companies coming out with results this week, including 3 S&P 500 members. For all practical purposes, however, the Q2 earnings season is already over, with results from 494 S&P 500 companies already out (as of Friday, August 30th). Only three of the 16 Zacks sectors have a few reports still awaited and this week’s reports from H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report), Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and SAIC (SAI) will push us further to the finish line.
"
152,HRB,"Most of the recent results have been from the Retail sector and they have broadly been on the weak side. The soft tone set by results from Wal-Mart (WMT), Macy’s (M) and others earlier in the sector’s reporting cycle largely remained in place, with most of the apparel and other soft-line retailers failing to impress. The Q2 earnings and revenue growth numbers for the sector aren’t bad; they are in fact better than what the sector produced in Q1 and the last few quarters.
"
153,HRB,"But many more retailers came out short of expectations, with the earnings and revenue beat ratios for Q2 materially weaker than Q1 and the four-quarter average. The overall tone of guidance was on the weak side as well, prompting analysts to cut their estimates for the sector. Total earnings for the sector are expected to be up +6.5% in Q3, down from +17.3% growth pace expected in mid-July.
"
154,HRB,"The downward adjustment to Q3 expectations is fairly pronounced in Retail, but the issue is hardly confined this sector alone, as estimates have come down for all sectors. Total earnings in Q3 for the S&P 500 as a while are currently expected to up +1.9% from the same period last year, which is down from +5.2% expected in early July. Basic Materials, Industrials, and Technology are the other major sectors experiencing material negative estimate revisions.    The Q2 Earnings Scorecard
"
155,HRB,"Total earnings for the 494 S&P 500 companies that have reported results already are up +2.5%, with 65.6% beating earnings expectations and a median surprise of +2.9%. Most of this growth has come from top-line gains, with total revenues for these 494 companies up +1.9% and 51.8% beating revenue expectations, with a median revenue surprise of +0.2%.
"
156,HRB,"The earnings growth rate of +2.5% compares to +2.3% earnings growth rate in Q1 and the 4-quarter average growth pace of +2.8% for the same set of 494 companies. The earnings beat ratio, which was tracking a bit lower earlier in the reporting cycle, eventually caught on with historical levels. On the revenue side, the growth of +1.9% compares to +1.6% in Q1 and the 4-quarter average of +2.8% for this group of 494 S&P 500 companies. The revenue beat ratio of 51.8%, however, is decidedly better than what we saw in Q1 (42.1%) and the 4-quarter average (45.9%).
"
157,HRB,"Strong results from the Finance sector played a big role in giving respectability to the aggregate Q2 data. It is very hard to be satisfied with the picture once Finance is excluded from the numbers. Total Finance sector earnings are up +30% on +8.5% higher revenues, with beat ratios of 76.9% for earnings and 65.4% for revenues. Finance’s performance has been way better than what we have seen from the group in recent quarters.
"
158,HRB,"Earnings growth was particularly strong at the large national and regional banks, with total earnings at the Major Banks industry, which includes 15 banks  like J.P. Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Key Corp (KEY) and alone accounts for more than 40% of the sector’s total earnings, were up +8.4% from the same period last year. Total earnings for the Major Banks still remained below the group’s record tally in Q1. The insurance industry, the second largest contributor to Finance sector earnings, had to deal with tough comparisons, resulting in negative growth in Q2. The brokerage firms benefited from easier comps, with total earnings for the Brokerage/Investment Management industry up +16%.Not So Good Outside Finance   
"
159,HRB,"Strip out Finance and total Q2 earnings growth for the S&P 500 turns negative – down -2.9%. This is weaker than what these same companies reported in Q1. Weakness in the Technology sector spotlights the broad growth challenge outside of Finance, though Basic Materials (total earnings down -11.1%) and Energy (-12.7%) also played roles.
"
160,HRB,"Total Technology sector earnings are down -10.1% on +0.4% higher revenues, the weakest performance from the sector in a while. Technology is a big area, ranging from hardware makers like Apple (AAPL) and Dell (DELL) to software vendors like Adobe (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT) and chipmakers like Intel (INTC). The hardware and software industries individually bring in roughly 45% and 35% of the Technology sectors total quarterly earnings. In Q2, the modestly positive growth for the software industry was more than offset by weakness at the hardware vendors.
"
161,HRB,"Had Technology been not such a big drag on overall results, the aggregate picture would be somewhat better. Excluding Technology, total S&P 500 earnings would be up +5.4% in Q2.    Expectations for Second half & Next year Remain Positive
"
162,HRB,"The predominant negative tone of company guidance has started showing up in expectations for Q3 and the second half of the year. As a result, full-year 2013 earnings growth expectations have come down despite the typical positive earnings season outperformance in Q2. The recent downtrend in estimates notwithstanding, there is still plenty of room for estimates to come down.  
"
163,HRB,"The chart below plots the current Q3 and Q4 growth expectations in the context of where growth has been over the last few quarters. The current +1.9% expected growth rate in Q3 is down from +2.5% two weeks back and +5.2% in early July.
"
164,HRB,"The chart below looks at the same data as is in the chart above, but takes Finance out of the numbers. As you can see, a lot of the expected growth in the second half of the year, particularly Q4, is from sectors outside of the Finance sector.
"
165,HRB,"Given what we have seen thus far in Q2 and in the last few quarters from sectors outside of Finance (above chart), it doesn’t seem reasonable to expect a strong growth ramp up later this year. What this means is that we will see further acceleration in negative estimate revisions in the coming days as retailers and others guide lower towards Q3 and beyond.  Monday-9/2

179,HRB,"Earnings Preview 8/27/10
"
180,HRB,"Earnings season is just about over, with just a few stragglers, mostly those with fiscal periods ending in July. Many of those are retailers and non-U.S. firms. There will be 83 firms reporting, including just 5 S&P 500 firms. The S&P 500 firms that will be reporting are Brown Forman (BF.B  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report), Heinz (HNZ), H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report) and SAIC (SAI).
"
181,HRB,"With very little action on the earnings front, all eyes will be focused on the economic data, and we will be getting a boat load of it. We start with Personal income and Spending on Monday, and end with the all-important employment report on Friday. In between, we get news on housing prices, pending home sales, auto sales, productivity as well as the ISM indexes for both manufacturing and services. It will be a very busy week for those following the economy.MondayWhile most people will be relaxing and celebrating/mourning the end of summer, we get significant economic information in the form of Personal Income and Personal Spending for July. Personal Income is expected to increase 0.3%, a nice improvement over the 0.0% change in June. Personal Spending is expected to accelerate to a 0.3% increase from a 0.1% increase in June. If both Income and Spending are increasing at the same pace, that implies no real change in the savings rate. The savings rate has been trending higher. While it is good in that it allows consumers to repair their balance sheets, the rise of the savings rate is a major drag on current economic growth. Over time the savings rate needs to rise, but as it does, it creates a very big headwind for the economy. The sources of the increase in personal income will also be of interest. Very little of the increase in personal income that we have seen so far this year has come from growth in wages. Much more has been due to increases in government transfer payments.We also get the report on Personal Consumption Expenditure Prices. While this measure of inflation does not get as much press as the CPI, it is one of the Fed’s favorite measures of inflation. It is expected to show a rise of 0.1% in July after being unchanged in June. I would see that up-tick as good news, since the current danger of deflation is much greater than that of renewed inflation. At any given level, deflation is a much nastier economic disease than inflation.
"
182,HRB," TuesdayThe Case Schiller home price index will probably show that prices of houses continued to increase in June, but the year-over-year gain will probably be smaller than the 4.61% gain recorded in May. The index is actually a three-month moving average, and has a significant lag in reporting (this is June data, after all). However, as a repeat sales index, it is the gold standard for measuring changes in housing prices. The June numbers will still be benefiting from the now expired home buyer tax credit. It is highly likely that housing prices are going to start to fall again in the second half of the year, but it will be a few more months before we get confirmation of that in the Case Schiller numbers.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) is expected to come in with a reading of 57.5, down from 62.3 in July. It is one of the “magic 50 indexes where any reading above 50 indicates expansion, and anything below that means contraction. Thus it is expected to show that manufacturing activity in the upper Midwest continued to expand in August, but at a slower pace than in July. This would be consistent with the pattern we have seen in the other “mini ISM’s.The Consumer Confidence index is expected to have improved to a reading of 51.3 in August from 50.4 in July. That is still a very low reading, and not much cause for celebration. Given the other data we have seen, I think the consensus might be a tad on the optimistic side here. In any case, I am not a big fan of this number since what consumers say in these surveys is often not what they actually do. Still, given that the consumer accounts for over 70% of the economy, it should be a very important number, in theory.WednesdayWe get the appetizer for the employment report in the form of the ADP employment survey. This is expected to show a drop of 15,000 private sector jobs in August, a sharp slowdown from the 42,000 jobs gained in July, according to ADP. As the firm that actually cuts the checks of most companies' payrolls, ADP is in an excellent position to gauge the strength of the job market. However, its numbers are often quite different, and usually lower, than the private sector jobs numbers that are reported by the BLS on Friday.Construction Spending is expected to have declined by 0.4% in July after rising 0.1% in June. I would not be surprised if the decline was larger than that given the weak housing starts and building permit data we have seen, along with the previous weakness in architects billings on the non-residential side.The ISM manufacturing index is expected to come in at 53.3, down from 55.5 in July. As a “magic 50 index, that means that the manufacturing sector of the economy is still expanding, but at  slower pace than last month. The overall index is made up of 10 sub-indexes which often provide the most interesting information. Pay attention not only to the overall index, but also to the sub-indexes covering production, new orders, backlog and employment.In July, Auto sales were running at a 3.80 million pace, and light truck sales were going at a 5.14 million pace. While consensus expectations are not available, I would expect a small increase with light trucks faring better than cars. On a year-over-year basis, sales will be down sharply, since a year ago was greatly boosted by the Cash for Clunkers program.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 31,000 in the last week, to 473,000. After a huge downtrend from mid April through the end of 2009, initial claims were locked in a tight “trading range.  Two weeks ago, they broke out of that trading range to the upside, which was a very bad sign, so the decline last week was very welcome. Look for them to fall modestly next week. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. A rate of over 500,000 signals that the unemployment rate is probably headed back up. Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. Last week they fell by 62,000 to 4.456 million.  That is still down 1.595 million from a year ago. Most of the longer-term decline was due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims rose by 302,000 to 5.837 million. In May, extended benefits ran out. Almost two million were cut off from benefits as the Senate filibuster dragged on. The filibuster was eventually overcome a few weeks ago, and people are streaming back on to the rolls, with a total increase of 2.177 million over the last month. That rebound should be mostly over now, so look for the extended claims numbers to stabilize. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 9.993 million, which is up 240,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 886,000 million above year-ago levels. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.We get the second look at productivity growth in the second quarter. In the original report it fell 0.9%, which reversed a string of very strong gains in the previous four quarters that had pushed productivity growth to a 50-year high. With the downward revision to GDP growth in the second quarter, it is likely that productivity growth will also be revised down. The consensus is looking for a 1.5% rate of decline.Unit Labor Costs were originally estimated to have risen 0.2% in the second quarter. That is expected to be revised to a rise of 1.0%. I suspect that it will be revised up, but not by that much, more like 0.8%.FridayThe most important report of the week is the employment report. Total payrolls are expected to fall by 120,000 after a decline of 131,000 in July. Census workers will continue to be laid off, but not as many as in July (there are not that many of them left). Private payrolls are expected to have increased by 44,000, down from 71,000 in July. That is not going to put much of a dent in the vast army of the unemployed. Revisions to prior month's number will also be important. The unemployment rate is expected to tick up to 9.6%. Much of the change in the unemployment rate will depend on the civilian participation rate. If it continues to decline, the unemployment rate might stay where it is, but if the participation rate stops falling the unemployment rate will likely shoot upwards. The report is also expected to show that average hourly earnings increased 0.1% in August, down from a 0.2% gain in July. The average workweek is expected to be unchanged at 34.2 hours. Over all, that adds up to very weak report. Keep an eye on the duration of unemployment numbers. The median duration of unemployment fell in July to a still sky high level of 22.2 weeks. We need to see that continue downwards.The ISM Services Index is expected to come in at 53.0 for August, down from 54.3 in July, indicating that the non-manufacturing side of the economy is still expanding, but at a slower rate.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceKU6 MEDIA LTD   KUTV       201006 N/A -0.4 -566.67

"
189,HRB,"The Q1 earnings season provided further confirmation of the all-around weak earnings picture. While an above average proportion of companies were able to beat consensus expectations, the growth challenge proved widespread and not just a function of the beleaguered Energy sector. Earnings growth remained in negative territory for the 4th quarter in a row of earnings declines, with the trend expected to continue in the current period as well.
"
190,HRB,"On the positive side, the dollar drag started fading and the magnitude of negative revisions for the current period turned out to be less severe relatively to other recent quarters. Estimates for Q2 faithfully followed the well-trodden path of previous quarters, as the chart below shows.
"
191,HRB,"As negative as this revisions trend looks, it is nevertheless an improvement over what we had seen in the comparable period in the preceding earnings cycle. The improved commodity-price backdrop and the reduced dollar drag are some of the more plausible explanations for this development. But it is also likely that Q2 estimates had already fallen enough at the time when Q1 estimates were coming down and there is simply not that much need for further downward adjustments.
"
192,HRB,"Whatever the reason for the lower negative revisions trend for Q2 estimates, it is nevertheless a potentially positive development, particularly if sustained over the coming months. We will have to wait till July to get a better read on this development after companies start reporting June quarter results and guide towards Q3 estimates. Current estimates for Q3 are showing essentially flat growth from the year-earlier level.
"
193,HRB,"The chart below shows current quarterly earnings growth expectations for the index in 2016 Q1 and the following four quarters contrasted with actual declines in the preceding three quarters. As you can see, growth is expected to be negative in 2016 Q2 and barely in positive territory in the following quarter.
"
194,HRB,"The only meaningful positive earnings growth this year is expected to come from the last quarter of the year, which is then expected to continue into 2017 when earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up in double-digits. We will see if those estimates will hold up as we reach the last quarter of the year. But given what we have seen over the last few quarters, the odds don’t look that favorable.Retail Sector’s Q1 Scorecard
"
195,HRB,"With Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) as the only retailer in the S&P 500 yet to report Q1 results (it reports on June 16th), the reporting cycle has practically ended for the sector. Total Q1 earnings for the retailers that have reported results are up +3.3% from the same period last year on +6.1% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 50% beating revenue expectations.
"
196,HRB,"Positive surprises are more numerous even for the Retail sector, as you can see in the right-hand side chart below.
"
197,HRB,"The growth picture emerging from the left-hand side chart doesn’t look so bad, with earnings growth in positive territory and revenue gains tracking above historical periods. But a lot of that momentum is a function of non-department store results that came out earlier in this cycle, particularly from online vendors like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). The sector’s growth comparisons don’t look so good on an ex-Amazon basis, as the right-hand side chart below does.Q1 Earnings Scorecard (As of Friday, June 3rd)
"
198,HRB,"With results from just four S&P 500 members still awaited at this stage, the Q1 reporting cycle is practically now behind us. The still-to-report list is comprised of Brown-Forman (BF.B  -  Free Report), J.M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report), and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), with the first three reporting this week.
"
199,HRB,"For the 496 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are down -6.6% from the same period last year on -0.9% lower revenues, with 70.7% beating EPS estimates and 55.4% beating revenue estimates. The percentage of companies that are able to beat both EPS and revenue estimates is tracking 45.5% at this stage.
"
200,HRB,"The composite (or blended) picture for Q1, combining the actual results with estimates for the still-to-come reports, is for earnings decline of -6.5% on -1.3% lower revenues, as the table below shows.
"
201,HRB,"The charts below compare the results thus far with what we have been seeing from the same group of 496 index members in other recent periods.
"
202,HRB,"As referred to earlier, the two key takeaways from the results thus far are:First, the growth challenge is not only very obvious, but also widespread. The Energy sector is no doubt dragging the reported growth pace quite a bit, but the growth comparison still remains unfavorable even if we exclude the reported Energy sector reports from the sample of reported results. The right-hand side chart below presents the growth picture on an ex-Energy basis.Second, positive surprises are more numerous, particularly on the revenues side. The big driver of this is the low levels to which estimates had fallen ahead of the start of this earnings season. But as indicated earlier, the improving dollar is helping matters to some extent as well.
"
203,HRB,"This incidence of more numerous positive surprises is visible in the ‘blended’ beats comparisons as well; ‘blended beats’ refer to companies that beat both revenues as well EPS estimates. At present, 45.5% of the 496 S&P 500 members that have reported results are beating both EPS and revenue estimates, which is better than what we saw from the same group of companies in the preceding quarter as well as the 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages.
"
204,HRB,"Even the beleaguered Basic Materials and Industrial Products sectors have beat EPS and revenue estimates more often this time around compared to other recent periods. The proportion of Basic Material sector companies that have beat both EPS and revenue estimates in Q1 is 36.8%, which compares to 4-quarter and 12-quarter averages of 9.2% and 21.9%, respectively. The highest blended beat % are for the Construction, Conglomerates, and Aerospace sectors while the lowest is for Utilities.Note: Want more articles from this author?

"
206,HRB,"With tax season finally over, one company is probably still fresh in Americans’ minds; H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report). This Kansas City-based tax preparation company offers up tax advice, do-it-yourself tax return preparation, and advances on tax refunds across the country.
"
207,HRB,"And though while many Americans certainly used their services this past tax season, competitive pressures are certainly building for this company. This is largely thanks to the advent and popularity of Intuit’s (INTU  -  Free Report) TurboTax software which is eating away at HRB’s core market.
"
208,HRB,"Thanks in part to this pressure, HRB stock has been struggling as of late, as it has underperformed some of its key peers in the past year. Plus, it hasn’t helped that HRB has seen sluggish results in international markets too, as this has forced the company to post pretty horrendous results at earnings season, suggesting that HRB has great trouble in meeting expectationsRecent Earnings
"
209,HRB,"In fact, over the last four quarters, HRB has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate every time, with an average surprise of -226%. The company’s ‘best’ miss did come in the key tax season quarter though, but even then the firm missed by nearly 2% when compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
"
210,HRB,"With this recent weakness in mind and some serious competitive pressures building on its lofty stock, it shouldn’t be too surprising to note that many earnings estimates have been falling for HRB as of late. In the past 30 days, not a single estimate has gone higher for HRB’s earnings outlook, while several have gone lower.
"
211,HRB,"The pain is especially apparent when investors look to the current year and next year time frames, as estimates have gone from $1.67/share for the current year 60 days ago to just $1.62 today. Meanwhile, for the next year period, $2.01/share was the estimate two months ago, but once again this was pushed down, this time to $1.95/share, suggesting that analysts are ratcheting down their expectations for HRB not only in the near term, but over the long haul as well.
"
212,HRB,"These concerns have kept a lid on HRB’s shares, as the stock has added over 65% in the past two years, but just 6% in the trailing 12 months. And from a YTD look, HRB has lost about 4% (underperforming the market) and it could face more trouble at its next earnings report if recent earnings estimate trends are any guide.
"
213,HRB,"This is particularly true when investors consider that HRB has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and that its earnings ESP metric is negative. When combined, these factors are generally a harbinger of negative news at earnings season, and given how sluggish HRB has been at earnings season, it wouldn’t be much of a shock at all to see another lackluster report from this tax preparation firm.Other Picks
"
214,HRB,"If investors are searching for better picks in the consumer services space, it is worth noting that the sector currently has a poor Zacks Industry Rank and that many firms in the segment have seen earnings estimate revisions moving in the wrong direction. However, there is one standout, Outerwall (OUTR), a stock that has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
"
215,HRB,"This security saw a positive surprise in its most recent earnings report, and since its rank just moved from a #3 (Hold) to a #2 (buy), now might be the time to consider this stock instead of the embattled H&R Block, at least until the earnings estimate revision activity turns around for HRB.

"
217,HRB,"Last week, the Chicago Quantitative Alliance (CQA) held its annual fall conference. As a member, I was able to attend this interesting two-day event. The presentation I enjoyed the most was a psychology-based talk centered around the reasons why we don't perform our best and how to move toward optimal performance. It reminded me of a book I recently finished titled The Inner Game of Tennis. It's one of those books that have applications that reach much further than the title suggests. So it could have easily been called The Inner Game of Preparing for Surgery, Stock Investing or Anything Else in Life. 
"
218,HRB,"The basic premise of these psychological performance themes is that we tend to over-think what we're doing and would be better off simply doing. That is, of course, doing only after we've spent hours preparing or practicing to hone our game. Once you are skilled at doing something, just do it. Don't over-think. Over-analysis can cause paralysis. Certain thought processes during analysis could also lead to confirmation bias. Studies have shown that both over-analysis and confirmation bias do impede performance.  
"
219,HRB,"While it's highly important to do your due diligence on stocks, I do believe too many investors buy into the story and become emotionally tied or mentally committed to a stock. It's fairly clear that one should sell if conditions change, and that's harder to do if you're committed to a stock. You've got to be able to let go of a stock that's struggling or avoid it to begin with if something just isn't right.   
"
220,HRB,"People also make the mistake of forming initial viewpoints and then only ""see"" things that confirm their first opinion and ignore items that don't match that preliminary thought. This confirmation bias affects us in all aspects of life, including stock investing. If you bought a stock, you clearly have a favorable viewpoint and will tend to ignore negative aspects that should be heeded. Avoid Potential Mistakes
"
221,HRB,"That's why I take pleasure in investing in quantitative strategies. After I've built a strategy that I am confident has a good economic rationale and superior performance, I follow it even if it tells me to sell a stock that I'd rather hold onto. I remove emotion from the process and allow the strategy to drive returns by indicating when to buy and sell. I feel that's one thing that gives me an edge in the market. I don't buy a ""story"" and am not committed to any specific stock. I simply see them as interchangeable vehicles useful for making money. I believe there are times when investors miss out on profitable opportunities because they're tied to a ""story"" stock whose price remains stagnant versus buying stocks with true return potential. Remember, a good company is not always a good investment.  
"
222,HRB,"Also, I don't mind if a strategy tells me to short a well-known company or buy a company I've never heard of before. So quantitative strategies also help remove familiarity bias, which is when one purchases only stocks he of she has heard of and avoids ones that are unfamiliar. In fact, one of the things I like best about quantitative strategies is that they often unearth unfamiliar stocks. These little-known stocks might provide great opportunities for profits because fewer eyes are watching them. How To Just Do It 
"
223,HRB,"One of the easiest ways to implement a quantitative strategy is though a screen. A screen is a great way to find stocks based on indicators that matter. There is so much information available to investors that it's best to focus your stock-picking on proven ideas.      
"
224,HRB,"The Zacks Research Wizard allows one to shift through hundreds of different data items to determine which are the most important, and then develop a screen that will identify stocks that meet the desired criteria. Once the screen has been tested to determine profitability, just save it and run it as often as you like to generate your list of stocks.  
"
225,HRB,"Since the Research Wizard contains a number of pre-built strategies, we'll take a look at Growth and Income Winners as an example. Here's how that strategy compared to the S&P 500 on a historical test from August 2002- August 2012: 
"
226,HRB,"Those results show that, over time, the strategy significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the last ten years. The annualized rate of return for Growth & Income Winners was 15% higher with a maximum loss of about half as much as the S&P 500. Now that's impressive!  
"
227,HRB,"Here's how to find Growth & Income Winners: First, create a liquid, investible set of the stocks whose price is greater than $5 and average daily trading volume greater than or equal to 100,000 shares (if there's not enough liquidity, it'll be hard for you to trade).Select only those stocks with a current Zacks Rank less than or equal to 3. (You want stocks rated at least a buy or hold.) Select companies with an ROE higher than the S&P 500 median. (You want higher than average profitability.)Next, pick those stocks with a P/E less than the S&P 500 median. (You don't want to overpay for a stock.)Then, choose only those with a Debt/Equity Ratio less than 1. (Some debt is good. Too much is a problem.)Beta should be less than or equal to 1.00. (Low volatility stocks reduce risk.)Finally, select the 2 stocks in each sector with the highest Dividend Yield. (You should be looking for a good dividend as well.) 
"
228,HRB,"Here are five of the ten stocks that passed the screen this week (9/21/12):EC - Ecopetrol S.A.
"
229,HRB,"Ecopetrol, based in Bogota, Colombia, is an integrated oil company that engages in the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas. This company has a better than average valuation (P/E of 13), good profitability (ROE of 32%) and has a 5.9% dividend yield. Ecopetrol also has manageable debt levels (Debt/Equity of 20%) and a low volatility in its stock price. AZN - AstraZeneca PLC
"
230,HRB,"AstraZeneca engages in the discovery, development and commercialization of prescription medicines for gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neuroscience, respiratory, inflammation, oncology and infectious diseases worldwide. This company, which is one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world, has a very attractive valuation based on a P/E of 7. This company also has good profitability measures and a lower than average debt level. The dividend yield of 6.1% is also very appealing. RAI - Reynolds American Inc. 
"
231,HRB,"Reynolds American, through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells cigarette and other tobacco products in the United States. This company has a mildly attractive valuation, but is highly stable and profitable and offers a nice dividend for the price. What I also like about this company is that they beat earnings expectations in the most recent quarter, which leads to its Buy rating on the Zacks Rank.RNF  Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P. 
"
232,HRB,"Rentech engages in the production of natural gas-based nitrogen fertilizer and industrial products for agricultural uses. This highly profitable company, which is one you've probably never heard of, pays a nice dividend and its stock price is up 124% YTD. Even considering the price appreciation, its P/E is still below the S&P 500's. Earnings projections for the company have been revised upward many times, leading to its Zacks Rank #1 rating. HRB - H&R Block, Inc. 
"
233,HRB,"H&R Block, through its subsidiaries, engages in the provision of tax preparation and related services to the general public in the United States. It's interesting that this stock passed the screen this week because it was mentioned at the CQA conference as a stock that would perform better with a Democrat in the Oval Office. H&R Blocks valuation is just a little better than average, but has a strong ROE (38%), high dividend yield (4.8%) and low debt. It has also seen earnings projections for the next couple of years improve--perhaps in anticipation of an incumbent victory in November. Buy Results, Not a Story
"
234,HRB,"Since not all analysis is good, you obviously need to focus on avoiding the bad analysis and concentrate on the good. One of the easiest ways to do that is to implement a quantitative screen. Once you have developed a screen that works; follow it! Its good to confirm the numbers and ensure everything makes sense, but don't over-think the picks and get committed to a specific stock. Get committed to the strategy and the complete portfolio!  
"
235,HRB,"The strategy highlighted in this article picks stocks that have low volatility and pay a high dividend. These are also perfect stocks for a retracting market because there's usually a flight to quality and stability when the market's having an identity crisis. Want to see other picks in the same genre? Or perhaps you have other ideas on how to pick winning stocks? No problem. The Zacks Research Wizard can be used to develop a screen to uncover outperforming stocks for any investing style.

239,HRB,"H&R Block Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report) has delivered seven positive earnings surprises in the last 10 quarters and boasts a dividend yield of 5.01%, sufficiently higher than the industry average of 1.83%.  
"
240,HRB,"Following the fiscal fourth quarter earnings release,  shares of this tax service provider are moving upward. The company currently holds a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy). Fiscal Fourth Quarter Results  
"
241,HRB,"Substantially all of H&R Blocks revenues from income-tax return preparation and related services/products are received during January through April, as most of the clients file their tax returns during that period.  
"
242,HRB,"H&R Block reported its fourth quarter results on June 26, 2012. Earnings came in at $2.01 a share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents, or a little more than 1%. However, this missed the year-ago quarters earnings of $2.09 by almost 4%.  
"
243,HRB,"For fiscal 2012, H&R Blocks adjusted income came in at $1.26 per share, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents.  
"
244,HRB,"Fourth-quarter revenues declined 2.2% year over year to $2 billion. Revenues were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Lower financial product revenue more than offset the 1.2% rise in tax preparation and related revenue, eventually leading to the revenue decline.  
"
245,HRB,"Following the earnings release, analysts have raised their estimates. For fiscal 2013, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently $1.63, which is up nearly 6% in seven days as three of five estimates were revised upward. This outlook also suggests a year-over-year increase of 29%. For fiscal 2014, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 has improved by a penny in that time and represents a year-over-year increase of 13%. Dividend 
"
246,HRB,"Over the last 5 years, the board has authorized a dividend hike three times. The last dividend increase of 33% was announced in December 2011.  
"
247,HRB,"With an annual dividend payout of 80 cents, its dividend yield comes to 5.01%, much higher than its nearest peer Intuit Inc. (INTU) with a dividend yield of 1.01%, as well as the industry average of 1.83%. Valuation Looks Attractive 
"
248,HRB,"Shares of H&R Block currently trade at a forward P/E of 9.9x, a 4.8% discount to the peer group average of 10.4x and its 10-year historical median of 11.8%. On a price-to-book basis, shares are currently trading at 5.5x, a 3.5% discount to the peer group average of 5.7x.  
"
249,HRB,"Given the long-term growth projection of 11%, the PEG ratio comes in at 0.9, marginally below the benchmark of 1 for a fairly priced stock.  
"
250,HRB,"Given a double-digit earnings growth prospect in the current years, the valuation presents a window of opportunity for investors seeking income and growth.  Summing Up 
"
251,HRB,"The performance of H&R Block is tied to the overall health of the economy. Nevertheless, the company has continuously bought back shares and paid a dividend, despite the current economic uncertainties. H&R Block is also increasing its share in the digital and assisted space as well as growing its international operations.

"
253,HRB,"Earnings Preview 11/25/11
"
254,HRB,"There will only be a handful of firms reporting next week, as the third quarter reporting season is almost over. A total of 69 firms are scheduled to report, including 4 of the S&P 500.
"
255,HRB,"The firms reporting next week include Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report), H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report), Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), Kroger’s (KR  -  Free Report), Royal Bank of Canada (RY  -  Free Report), Toronto Dominion (TD) and Tiffany’s (TIF).
"
256,HRB,"While there will not be that much going on with the earnings front, it will more than be made up for on the economic data front. We start the week with New Home Sales and finish the week with the all-important jobs report.
"
257,HRB,"Along the way we get the usual precursors to the employment report, like the ADP survey. We also get the second look at productivity and unit labor costs in the third quarter, the ISM Manufacturing Survey, and the Case-Schiller Index of housing prices. Any of those has the potential to move the market, and combined with the ongoing saga in Europe, it could make for an interesting week.Monday
"
258,HRB,"New Home Sales are expected to fall ever so slightly to a 312,000 rate from a very weak 131,000 in September. That is simply a pathetic level, even if it is slightly off the record low set in January. The records go back to the Kennedy administration. If we do come in at 312,000, that is still lower than any month prior to 2010. Unlike used home sales, each new home sold represents a lot of economic activity. Thus this is a very important report. Normally, new home sales are what leads the economy out of recessions, but they have been a huge drag this time around.Tuesday
"
259,HRB,"The Case-Schiller Home Price index, the gold standard of housing price indexes, is likely to show a year-over-year decline of 3.00% for September. In August, the decline was 3.80%. On a month-to-month basis, the index was up on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, but down when seasonally adjusted in both July and August. Given that there are now 8.0 months worth of used home inventories on the market, when normal is about six months, I think we are going to see a continuation of home price declines for the rest of the year. That is particularly true for the more widely reported non-seasonally adjusted figures (I prefer to work off of the seasonally adjusted numbers, since there is significant seasonality in home prices). However, given very high levels of affordability due to low mortgage rates, and normal -- as opposed to wildly inflated -- prices relative to rents and incomes, the declines should be relatively modest. Continued weakness in used home prices is a big part of the reason that new home sales have been so weak.
"
260,HRB,"Consumer Confidence is expected to edge up to a reading of 43.0 from 39.8 in October. That is still a very weak reading, so don’t get too excited about the increase. Since the Consumer is 71% of the economy, this should be an important indicator. Unfortunately, what consumers say in the surveys and what they actually do, are often very different. Mostly it is a coincident indicator reflecting gasoline prices and the unemployment rate. The situation in Europe played a role in the very soft reading in October, and will probably do so again this month. I think that it, and the similar University of Michigan Survey, are very over rated data points. Still, that is a very low level, and is consistent with the other data we have been seeing. The debt-ceiling circus and the S&P downgrade probably hurt confidence despite falling gas prices and a tick down in the unemployment rate last month.Wednesday
"
261,HRB,"We get the first clue as to how the big Friday jobs report will come in with the ADP employment survey. Last month it reported growth of 110,000 private sector jobs, slightly above the 104,000 reported by the BLS. While ADP, the largest payroll processor, should be in a very good position to judge the employment trends, its numbers are often quite different than the “official” government numbers. However over time they do tend to track pretty well, and the government often revises their numbers in the direction of the ADP numbers. This month, the consensus is looking for ADP to report growth of 120,000 private sector jobs. I will take the ""over"" on that.
"
262,HRB,"The Chicago PMI report, one of the mini-regional ISM’s, is expected to fall to 57.4 from 58.4. This is a “magic 50” index, so any reading over 50 indicates expansion. Thus, it is expected to show that the industrial economy in the upper Midwest is still expanding at a solid pace, but not quite as strong as last month.
"
263,HRB,"The Federeal Reserve releases its’ Beige Book, a compilation of mostly anecdotal evidence from the 12 Federal Reserve districts around the country. It is likely to indicate continued growth in the economy, but at a frustratingly slow pace.Thursday
"
264,HRB,"Weekly Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance recently they broke below the psychologically important 400,000 level. Last week they rose by 2,000 to 393,000, but only after the previous week had been revised upward by 3,000, so it was really more like a 5,000 rise. The consensus is looking for 390,000 this week, although the Thanksgiving holiday might skew it lower, so don’t get too excited if we have a very low number for the week. The 400,000 level is important in that it has historically been the inflection point, below which we tend to create enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate. The week-to-week numbers can be very volatile, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on. Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.
"
265,HRB,"Continuing Jobless Claims have been in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they rose by 68,000 to 3.691 million. However, that is down 735,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week. The consensus is looking for a bounce to 3.650 million. Some (most?) of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 7,000 to 3.452 million last week and are down 1.013 million over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits -- currently at 6.729 million -- which is down 44,000 from last week (there are some timing issues, so the change in continuing and existing claims does not match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.824 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed, all extended benefits will end in January. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.
"
266,HRB,"The ISM Manufacturing index is expected to rise to 51.0 from 50.8 in October. This is also a ""magic 50"" index, so if we come in as expected, it will indicate that the manufacturing economy nationwide is still expanding, but at an anemic pace, just a bit faster than in October.
"
267,HRB,"Construction spending is expected to have increased by a very slight 0.2% in October, matching the increase in September. Hey, at least it is growth.
"
268,HRB,"Auto and Light Truck  Sales are likely to rise slightly from the 13.26 million seasonally adjusted annual rate they posted in October. While that is up nicely from the recession low of under 10 million, it is a far cry from the over 17 million pace that was often seen before the recession started.Friday
"
269,HRB,"The most important report of the week is without a doubt the employment report. It is expected to show that the total number of jobs the economy produced in November rose to 118,000 from 80,000 in October. The October report came in weaker than expected, but the miss was offset by very big upward revisions to the two previous months. Once again, the private sector alone is expected to do better than that, producing 133,000 jobs, up from 104,000 last month. That implies an expected loss of 15,000 government jobs for the month. I suspect that the private sector will do better than the consensus is looking for, given the recent fall in initial claims to below the 400,000 mark, although I also expect more than 15,000 government jobs lost for the month.
"
270,HRB,"The Unemployment Rate, wich is derived from a separate survey than the job creation number, is expected to remain at 9.0%. The number of jobs created according the the household survey was much stronger than that indicated by the establishment survey in both September and October. The key to how much the unemployment rate will change is the participation rate, which rose for the third month in a row, but it is coming off a 27-year low in July. The increasing participation rate is a good sign, and if the unemployment rate ticks up only due to an increase in participation, it is not all that bad. However, if the participation rate starts to decline again, that would be very bad news, even if it resulted in a slightly lower unemployment rate.
"
271,HRB,"Average hourly earnings are expected to rise by 0.2%, the same pace as in October. The average workweek is also expected to remain stuck at 34.3 hours. If employers were seeing more demand, and thus more profitable business oppurtunities, but were holding back on hiring due to uncertainty about regulations or taxes, you would expect them to work their existing workforce longer hours. That has decidedly not been the case over the last year.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
272,HRB,"The best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly, a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.
"
273,HRB,"In the Earnings Calendar below, $999.00 should be read as N.A. Given the very small number of firms reporting next week, there are few good cadidates to make good predicitions of potential positive or negative surprises and thus I omit this section this week.

275,HRB,"Earnings Preview 8/26/11
"
276,HRB,"The second quarter earnings season is almost over. Mostly we are down to the retailers, many of which have fiscal quarters ending in July, not June. There are a few significant non-retailers that will report this week as well. There will be just 70 firms reporting, but 5 of those are in the S&P 500.
"
277,HRB,"By next Friday afternoon, almost 100% of the S&P 500 will have reported. Earnings season has been very strong with seven S&P 500 firms reporting positive surprises for every two that have disappointed. The firms reporting next week include: Brown-Foreman (BF.B  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report), H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report), Joy Global (JOYG) and SAIC Inc. (SAIC).
"
278,HRB,"It will be a very heavy week for economic data. We get key data in the form Personal Income and Spending, Consumer Confidence, Productivity and Unit Labor Costs, Auto Sales and the Case-Schiller Home Price Index. All of that is prelude to the big Jobs report on Friday. Taken together, the data could well help answer the question that the market has been asking lately: Are we falling back into a recession or not?MondayPersonal Income is expected to have risen by 0.4% in July, up from a 0.1% increase in June. Just as important as the total amount of personal income is the source of that income. Recently, growth in income from wages and salaries has been very weak (actually falling in June), with most of the growth we have seen coming from government transfer payments, along with rental income and higher dividends. Personal Spending is expected to rise to 0.5% after falling 0.2% in June. I’ll take the under on both of those. If we hit the consensus expectations it would be pretty solid growth, at least if it were maintained for a full year. Of course, if spending rises by more than income, the savings rate will fall. Over the long term, the economy needs a higher savings rate. A falling savings rate tends to boost the economy. Given the loss of confidence lately, I think it is unlikely that the savings rate fell in July, as the consensus numbers imply.TuesdayThe Case-Schiller Home Price index -- the gold standard of housing price indexes -- is likely to show a year-over-year decline of 4.7% for June. In May the decline was 4.5%. On a month-to-month basis, the index was up on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, but flat when seasonally adjusted in both May and April. Given that there are now 9.4 months worth of used home inventories on the market, when normal is about six months, I think we are going to see a continuation of home price declines for the rest of the year. However, given very high levels of affordability due to low mortgage rates, and normal as opposed to wildly inflated prices relative to rents and incomes, the declines should be relatively modest.Consumer Confidence is expected to fall to a reading of 52.0 from 59.5 in July. Since the Consumer is 71% of the economy, this should be an important indicator. Unfortunately, what consumers say in the surveys and what they actually do are often very different. Mostly it is a coincident indicator reflecting gasoline prices and the unemployment rate. Thus I think that it, and the similar University of Michigan Survey, are very overrated data points. Still, that is a very low level, and is consistent with the other data we have been seeing. The debt ceiling circus and the S&P downgrade probably hurt confidence despite falling gas prices and a tick down in the unemployment rate last month.WednesdayWe get the appetizer for the employment report in the form of the ADP employment survey. The consensus is looking for ADP to report a gain of 100,000 private sector jobs, down from the 114,000 it estimated in July. As the firm that actually cuts the checks of most companies payrolls, ADP is in an excellent position to gauge the strength of the job market. However, its numbers are often quite different than the private sector jobs numbers that are reported by the BLS on Friday. The BLS numbers do tend to be revised in the direction of the ADP numbers. I suspect that the consensus might be a little bit light and the number might match last month's number.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, one of the regional ""mini-ISM’s,"" is expected to drop to 52.5 from 58.8. It is a ""magic 50"" index where 50 is the dividing line between growth and contraction. Thus it would mean slower, but still positive growth for manufacturing in the Midwest. Given how the other “mini-ISM’s have been coming out of late, the risk is that it will be even weaker than the consensus is expecting.ThursdayWeekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They had a very nice decline early in the year, followed by a rough few months, and have recently been bouncing around. Last week they rose by 5,000 to 417,000 (after an upward revision to the prior week of 4,000). Part of the rise in the last two weeks was due to the Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) strike, which is now on hiatus. The 400,000 level is important psychologically in that it has historically been the inflection point below which we tend to create enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate. Thus the dip below that level was very good news and was greeted by the market with a big rise, the rebound above it was met with a big sell-off this week. The consensus looking for it to fall back to the 408,000 level. The four-week moving average will probably stay above the 400,000 level, where it has been for the last four months. The week-to-week numbers can be very volatile, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on. The sharp rise in initial claims were an early warning of the weak jobs report for June. Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 80,000 to 3.641 million. That is down 820,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week. The consensus is looking for 3.660 million. Some (most?) of the longer term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks.  Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 20,000 to 3.638 million. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 7.290 million, which is down 46,000 from last week (there are some timing issues, so the change in continuing and existing claims does not match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.867 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity, finding a new job, and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed (unlikely, given the current Congress) then all extended benefits will end in January. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The ISM manufacturing index is expected to continue its downward trend, falling from 50.9 in July to 48.5 expected for August. It was as high as 61.2 level in April, which indicated extremely fast growth. As another “magic 50"" index, any reading over 50 means that manufacturing is growing. Thus the consensus is looking for an actual decline in manufacturing activity. Given the very poor readings from many of the regional mini-ISM’s, I would say the risk is to the downside on this one.  In addition to the overall index, pay close attention to how some of the key sub-indexes which cover production, new orders and employment are faring.Construction Spending rose by 0.2% in June. The consensus is looking for an increase of 0.1% in July. That seems a tad optimistic to me, but construction has been hit hard for a long time, so maybe it will just stay near the current very depressed levels.Auto and light truck sales probably rebounded a bit from the very weak 12.23 million seasonally adjusted annual rate they posted in July; that is well over the under 10 million pace at the depths of the Great Recession, but a far cry from the 16 to 17 million annual rates that were the norm before the recession. It will be a very long time before we hit those levels again, but we will continue to see vehicle sales slowly recover. The supply chain disruptions (from the Japan disaster) to auto production partially explain the weakness, but that is in addition to a tapped-out consumer. Those supply disruptions have been easing up, which should lead to better results for August. The consumer, however, remains tapped out. I would expect a rate of about 12.8 million units.Productivity is expected to actually declined by 0.3% in the second quarter. Given the big revision to GDP growth, I would expect to see a downward revision to the second-quarter number. The consensus is looking for a decline of 0.5%. While over the long run productivity is probably the most important number there is, since it ultimately governs income per capita, fast productivity in a time of high unemployment is far from an unmixed blessing. The consensus is also looking for unit labor costs to jump by 2.4% in the second quarter, up from the initial read of 2.2%.FridayThe most important report of the week is the employment report. July was better than expected with 154,000 added in the private sector offset by the loss of 37,000 Government jobs (mostly State and Local). Growth should continue in August, but total payrolls will likely again be lower than private sector payrolls, as State and Local governments continue to lay people off to deal with their dismal fiscal situations, and the Federal Government is starting to let people go as well. Consensus estimates expect total growth of about 75,000 in total and 111,000 on the private side. I think the total will be somewhat above where the consensus is, based on the initial claims data we had during the month. I think that August will look a lot like the July report. Revisions to prior month’s numbers will also be important. The last month's revisions were nicely positive, but that was after  two months they were negative. The unemployment rate is expected by the consensus to be unchanged at 9.1%. That was down from its 9.2% June level, but the improvement was an illusion. Much of the change in the unemployment rate will depend on the civilian participation rate, which fell to 63.9% in June, continuing its downtrend. If it continues to decline, the unemployment rate may also decline. If the participation rate starts to rebound, as usually happens in a recovery, the unemployment rate will likely drift upwards. That would not really be all bad. The key measure will be the percentage of people who are actually working. That was at 58.1% in June (down from 58.4%). It is at its lowest level since 1983. The consensus is expecting the report to show that average hourly earnings increased 0.4% in August, after being up 0.4% in July. The average workweek is expected to be unchanged at 34.4 hours. Overall, that adds up fairly weak report, but not as bad as May or June. Keep an eye on the duration of unemployment numbers, which remain at historically very high levels.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
279,HRB,"Historically the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly, a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.

281,HRB,"Earnings Preview 3/06/11
"
282,HRB,"The fourth quarter earnings season is almost over. A total of just 252 firms are due to report and only 5 are S&P 500 firms. A great many of next week’s reporters are retailers, many of which have fiscal years than end in January, not December.
"
283,HRB,"So far the earnings season seems to be going well. With 98.2% of the S&P 500 reports in, total net income is up 30.5% over a year ago. The firms reporting this week include: Brown Foreman (BF.B  -  Free Report), H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report), National Semiconductor (NSM), Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report) and Pall Corp. (PLL).
"
284,HRB,"It will be a relatively light week for economic data. We will get data on Consumer Credit, the Deficits, both Trade and Budget, Retail sales and Inventories, as well as the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey. While some of those numbers can move the markets, it seems likely that National Budget issues and International events are the most likely drivers of the market this week.MondayConsumer Credit (not including mortgage debt) is expected to have expanded by $3.3 billion, on top of a $6.1 billion increase in December. That would be the third rise in a row after a long, and unusual string of declines as consumers have tried to repair their balance sheets. Most of the increase will probably come from non-revolving debt, such as car loans, rather than from increases in credit card debt.TuesdayNo major economic reports are due out. However, there will be a Senate Confirmation hearing for Peter Diamond, last year’s Nobel Prize winner for Economics, to join the Federal Reserve Board.WednesdayWholesale Inventories are expected to have increased by 1.0% in January, matching the 1.0% increase in December.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. After being extremely erratic over the holidays, they have started to fall significantly. Last week they fell by 20,000 in the last week, to 368,000, the lowest level since May 2008. The consensus is for them to bounce to 382,000. Given how volatile initial claims have been, that seems to very possible. Still, even a level of 382,000 seems pretty good compared to the experience of the last few years, and would mean that the four-week moving average is still declining. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims were locked in a tight “trading range."" We now appear to have broken out of that trading range to the downside. This could well indicate that the economy is about to start producing a significant number of new jobs.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 59,000 to 3.774 million. That is down 938,000 from a year ago. A further decline to 3.750 million is expected. Some of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims rose by 57,000 to 4.504 million, and are down by 1.232 million over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 9.236 million, which is up 74,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.301 million below year ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity, finding a new job, and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The Trade deficit is expected to have increased to $41.5 billion in January from $40.6 million in December. That is very bad news since a rising trade deficit slows economic growth. Most of the increase is likely to have come from higher oil prices. The non-oil trade deficit probably declined due to the effects of a weaker dollar. Oil, however, is responsible for more than half of our total trade deficit, and higher oil prices mean a higher trade deficit. It is the trade deficit, not the budget deficit, that is responsible for our increasing indebtedness to the rest of the world and is a much more serious economic problem, particularly in the short term.The Budget deficit is expected to have declined to $196 billion in February from $220.9 billion a year ago. The budget deficit numbers are extremely seasonal, but are not seasonally adjusted. Thus month to month comparisons are worse than useless. February is traditionally a large budget deficit month.FridayRetail Sales are expected to have increased by 1.0% (seasonally adjusted) in February after rising just 0.3% in January. This is a broad measure of retail sales, not just activity at the malls. Much of the increase probably came from better auto sales, which we learned last week were running at a 13.4 million annual pace up from a 12.7 million pace in January. Excluding autos, retail sales are expected to have been up 0.6%. While the numbers are adjusted for seasonal variations like the number of shopping days, they are not adjusted for inflation. As such, some of the “strength in retail sales will probably come from gas stations, and not due to a sudden rise in the number of people eating hot dogs off the rollers and drinking 44oz fountain drinks.The University of Michigan Consumer sentiment index is expected to dip to 76.5 from 77.5. That is well off the bottom, but we probably need to see it get much closer to 60 to indicate the economy is back to being healthy. I am not a big fan of this number, or the related Consumer Confidence number. With the Consumer representing over 70% of the economy, theoretically these numbers should be vital. The problem is that what consumers say in these surveys, and what they subsequently do, are often very different.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises

288,HRB,"Key Points:Second quarter earnings season shaping up as a very strong one. So far, 97.0% of S&P 500 firms have reported (485). Surprise ratio 4.33 with a 6.12% median surprise. 74.0% of all firms beat expectations. Total net income grows 38.2%.Sales Surprise ratio at 1.69, median surprise 1.06%, 59.2% of all firms do better than expected on top line. Total revenue growth 11.0%.Reported Earnings growth among the reported down from to the 47.4% those firms reported in first quarter, slowdown to 17.2% growth expected for third quarter. Revenue growth slightly lower than 12.0% first quarter level. Revenue slowdown to 3.9% growth expected for third quarter.Total net income for the firms yet to report is expected to be 33.7% below second quarter of 2009 levels, and a slowdown from the 4.4% growth those same firms had in the first quarter. A rebound to 17.5% growth is expected in the third quarter, but they are so few that they will not have a material impact on totals for the quarter.Total revenue for those yet to report expected to fall 13.7%, down from the 7.2% growth the same firms reported in the first quarter. Revenue growth expected to rise to 13.4% in the third quarter.Total earnings for the S&P 500 expected to jump 41.6% in 2010, 15.0% further in 2011.Autos, Finance, Basic Materials, and Energy expected to be earnings growth leaders in 2010. Construction expected to move from the red to the black. No sector expected to see earnings decline in 2010.Total revenues for the S&P 500 expected to rise 4.5% in 2010, 6.1% in 2011.Given 12.0% (historic) revenue growth in first quarter, and 11.0% and 3.8% expectations for second quarter and third quarters, there is an implied slowdown in the fourth quarter (or possible increases in full-year estimates).Huge net margin expansion expected to continue in 2010 and 2011.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.97 for 2010, at 1.32 for 2011, substantial improvement from last week. Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 1.80 for 2010, 1.16 for 2011.S&P 500 firms earned a total of $548.5 billion in 2009, expected to earn $776.8 billion in 2010, $893.2 billion in 2011.S&P 500 earned $57.83 in 2009, $82.11 in 2010 and $94.35 in 2011 expected bottom-up. Puts P/Es at 18.6x for 2009, 13.1x for 2010, and 11.3x for 2011.Top-down estimates: $79.38 for 2010, $90.92 for 2011.Verdict Is In: Very Strong Quarter
"
289,HRB,"The second quarter earnings season was a very strong one. A total of 485 (97.0%) of the S&P 500 firms have by now reported. The median surprise so far is 6.12% and there have been 359 positive EPS surprises and only 83 disappointments (surprise ratio of 4.33). As for growth, the total net income of those 485 firms is 38.2% higher than it was a year ago. For those firms, that is down from the 47.4% growth they posted in the first quarter.
"
290,HRB,"As far as the top line is concerned, the story is also upbeat. Positive surprises led disappointments by 287 to 170, or a surprise ratio of 1.69 and a median surprise of 1.06%. Total revenue is 11.0% higher, down from the 12.0% growth those same firms saw in the first quarter. However, there seems to be an asymmetrical response in the market. Firms are not being rewarded if they post a positive surprise, but are punished severely if they disappoint, particularly if they disappoint on the top line.
"
291,HRB,"The remaining firms appear to be very different than those that have already reported, and are expected to show much slower growth, especially when it comes to earnings. But they are so few that they will not have much of an impact on the final numbers. The 15 firms that have not yet reported are expected to show a drop of -33.7% for earnings, and revenue decline of 13.7%. Almost all of that decline comes from a single firm, H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report). Its weak showing is not going to move the needle much for the whole S&P 500, and when all is said and done, growth will be comfortably over 35%.Third Quarter Outlook
"
292,HRB,"Looking ahead to the third quarter, the comparisons continue to get tougher, and growth is expected to drop to 17.2%. For an economic recovery that seems to be very sluggish and lethargic, that is still very impressive. With 9.5% unemployment and very sluggish growth in median real wages, there are lots of reasons for the average American to complain. But for the business community to complain, they show themselves to be nothing but a bunch of spoiled crybabies.
"
293,HRB,"For the full year, earnings are expected to grow 41.6% in 2010, with further growth of 15.0% in 2011. Next year we should once again set a new all time record high for S&P 500 earnings. That will be long before employment returns to record levels. Keep in mind that these results refer to the S&P 500, which are almost by definition ""big businesses"" -- many of which get a majority of their earnings from overseas.
"
294,HRB,"Small businesses have not been faring as well, and have had a hard time getting access to capital. An effort to aid small businesses through a package of loans and tax cuts was recently blocked by a filibuster in the Senate, even though many of the senators that voted to prevent a final vote on the bill were co-sponsors of the legislation. Since small businesses are the principal drivers of job creation, one can only conclude that those U.S. senators want to keep unemployment as high as possible, at least through November.
"
295,HRB,"It is important to note, that when we say “2009 in this report, we mean the last full fiscal year to be reported, even if that year happens to end in June 2010. June is one of the largest non-December fiscal year-end months. Thus, as those firms “switch over not only the projections for 2010 can change, but so too can the “historical 2009 results.Earnings to Fully Recover by 2011
"
296,HRB,"Regardless of some of the technical timing issues, it means that earnings will have fully recovered by mid-2011, and that full-year 2011 earnings will be 9.0% above full-year 2007 earnings (before the Great Recession started).
"
297,HRB,"That is years before we are likely to see a full recovery in the job market. Collectively, the 500 firms in the S&P 500 earned $548.5 billion in “2009, and that is going to grow to $776.8 billion this year and $892.3 billion in 2011.  Translated into “EPS for the index, earnings are expected to rise from $57.83 in 2009 to $82.11 in 2010 and $94.35 in 2011.
"
298,HRB,"In other words, then, the S&P 500 is selling for 18.6x 2009 earnings, but just 13.1x 2010 and 11.4x 2011 earnings. By historical standards, that is quite cheap. Normally, when interest rates and inflation are low, P/E ratios are higher than average. Well we currently have some of the lowest rates of inflation in decades and interest rates are at near record lows.
"
299,HRB,"It only costs the government 2.57% to borrow for 10 years. It is not hard to find good solid blue chip companies that are providing dividend yields of more than that, and not just a bunch of electric utilities, either.
"
300,HRB,"One thing is certain, the coupon on a 10-year T-note will not increase over the next 10 years. The odds of the likes of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), 3.68%), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), 3.84%) or DuPont (DD, 4.07%) increasing their dividend in the next 10 years is pretty high. Currently 149 S&P 500 stocks yield over 2.57%, and 98 of those have payout ratios of less than 60%. Earnings that are not paid out in dividends are reinvested for future growth, or are used to buy back stock, which also lifts earnings per share. Based on this year’s earnings, the earnings yield is 7.63%, and based on next year it is 8.77%.Big Uncertainties Remain
"
301,HRB,"There is still substantial uncertainty about the strength of the economy. The inventory rebuild cycle is just about over, and the effects of the stimulus are wearing off. State and local governments are facing massive budget shortfalls, and will be forced to lay off many municipal workers like teachers and police. This has kept investor sentiment very muted, but provides a big wall of worry for the market to climb.
"
302,HRB,"The time to buy is when others are despondently selling, and the time to sell is when others are greedily buying. This is particularly true when the actual fundamentals are solid and when the market is simply depressed. There is nothing more fundamental than earnings (OK, perhaps the balance sheets, but those look better than they have in decades as well, with about $1.8 trillion in cash sitting on them) and earnings look pretty good, or at least the expectations for them do. Over the next few weeks we will see if those expectations are rational or not.
"
303,HRB,"The key to the bear case based on the earnings data is that the revisions ratios dropped very sharply during the period between earnings seasons. But now that the pace of revisions activity is picking up in response to earnings, so are the revisions ratios, but the response is muted relative to what to what we saw in the first quarter earnings season. This is particularly true for 2011. The revisions ratios now stand at 1.97 for 2010 and 1.32 for 2011.
"
304,HRB,"There is a “mechanical reason for the 2010 estimates to increase in response to a second quarter positive earnings surprise. If the full year estimates do not at least reflect the amount of the surprise, implicitly the analysts are cutting their estimates for the third and fourth quarters. There is no such “mechanical effect for 2011 estimates. This extremely strong earnings season in terms of surprises should be leading to a very high revisions ratio, especially for 2010, but normally that has been true for the next fiscal year as well.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseWith 97% of reports in, it has been a very strong earnings season. A total of 485 of firms have reported. The surprise ratio is 4.33 with a 6.12% median surprise. Total net income is 38.2% higher than last year.Transports, Conglomerates and Business Service have yet to record a disappointment this season. Autos and Discretionary post double digit median surprises. No sector has more disappointments than positive surprises.74.0% of all firms post positive surprises; 77.7% post higher EPS than last year.Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus, this is a very positive earnings season. This is a big enough sample that it would be highly unusual for things to turn around and have the remaining firms turn around an on balance disappoint.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegAuto 808.63% 100.00% 37.73 5 1 6 0Consumer Discretionary 25.37% 94.12% 12.38 27 3 26 6Transportation 73.88% 100.00% 9.09 8 0 9 0Conglomerates -1.81% 100.00% 8.82 8 0 7 2Oils and Energy 95.39% 95.00% 7.77 29 9 28 10Computer and Tech 59.34% 94.44% 7.69 46 13 60 8Finance 40.60% 100.00% 7.18 61 13 55 22Industrial Products 60.93% 90.00% 6.98 16 2 14 4Utilities 6.87% 100.00% 6.90 30 11 28 14Consumer Staples 7.06% 94.59% 6.06 27 6 27 8Aerospace -1.73% 100.00% 5.32 8 2 5 5Construction 1060.00% 100.00% 5.00 7 1 9 2Basic Materials 114.14% 100.00% 4.92 15 6 21 2Business Service 20.01% 94.74% 3.75 14 0 15 3Medical 17.64% 95.74% 3.20 37 5 36 9Retail/Wholesale 16.44% 95.45% 0.44 21 11 31 11S&P 38.23% 97.00% 6.12 359 83 377 106Sales SurprisesSales Surprise ratio at 1.69, median surprise 1.06%; 59.2% of all firms do better than expected on top line.More firms report growing than shrinking revenues, ratio 3.61:1 -- 78.1% of all firms report higher revenues than a year ago.Revenue growth healthy at 11.0% but still greatly lags earnings growth pointing to net margin expansion.Autos and Transports have perfect records of no sales disappointments so far.Utilities and Aerospace have more disappointers than positive revenue surprises.Sales Surprises Sales Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian SalesSurpPos SalesSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegAuto 26.09% 100.00% 6.33 6 0 6 0Construction 7.90% 100.00% 3.16 7 4 7 4Consumer Discretionary 7.97% 94.12% 2.37 22 10 27 5Conglomerates 2.17% 100.00% 2.32 6 2 7 2Transportation 20.20% 100.00% 2.12 9 0 9 0Computer and Tech 22.18% 94.44% 2.02 49 19 61 7Industrial Products 18.43% 90.00% 1.59 12 7 17 2Business Service 7.56% 94.74% 1.47 14 4 14 2Finance 3.74% 101.30% 1.28 36 15 48 30Medical 10.34% 95.74% 1.03 29 16 36 9Oils and Energy 27.63% 95.00% 0.79 21 17 34 4Basic Materials 18.54% 100.00% 0.73 13 10 21 2Retail/Wholesale 5.73% 95.45% 0.14 24 18 36 6Consumer Staples 7.48% 94.59% 0.14 18 17 24 11Utilities 0.60% 100.00% -0.87 18 24 25 18Aerospace -2.25% 100.00% -1.00 3 7 7 3S&P 11.00% 97.00% 1.06 287 170 379 105Reported Quarterly Growth: Total Net Income

"
311,HRB,"The table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. To qualify, the current mean estimate has to be greater than $0.50, and there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
312,HRB,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive, and that two of the firms with the biggest positive estimate momentum have single digit P/Es based on FY1 earnings. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Biggest FY1 Revisions Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstTeradyne Inc TER 48.73% 26.39% 0.86 0.54 3.92 4.37Sunoco Inc SUN 36.97% 4.53% 0.69 0.38 19.41 13.96Ford Motor Co F 34.10% 19.46% 0.92 0.92 6.52 6.21Comerica Inc CMA 32.00% -1.54% 0.47 0.05 47.12 15.90Metropcs Commun PCS 30.31% 19.28% 0.72 0.62 14.12 10.57Cummins Inc CMI 26.96% 17.95% 0.93 0.88 16.14 12.43Capital One Fin COF 25.21% 2.87% 0.84 0.00 7.93 8.74Tellabs Inc TLAB 23.98% 16.36% 0.87 0.60 13.00 13.08Cb Richard Ells CBG 23.62% 9.56% 1.00 0.83 24.33 17.11Valero Energy VLO 19.48% 1.17% 0.55 0.17 11.29 7.42Eastman Chem Co EMN 19.28% 12.71% 1.00 0.91 9.45 9.09Kla-Tencor Corp KLAC 18.37% 60.51% 0.73 0.13 7.51 7.45Wynn Resrts Ltd WYNN 16.08% 18.27% 0.47 0.43 55.44 38.95Ameriprise Finl AMP 15.58% 8.16% 1.00 0.83 10.70 8.75Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 8/19/2010.

All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.

341,HRB,"• Wholesale Inventory data is released and is expected to show a 0.2% increase in January after a 0.8% decline in December. The pace of inventory shrinkage has slowed dramatically in recent months, and now it is expected to turn positive. The slowing in the rate of decline in inventories actually contributed the bulk of the growth of GDP in the fourth quarter. With inventories now expected to actually rise, it looks like there is still some room for inventory lead growth, but that should fade later this year
"
342,HRB,"• The flood of red ink from the Treasury is expected to swell to $202.0 billion in February. That is a huge rise from the $42.6 billion level in January. However, the budget deficit numbers are extremely seasonal, to the point where the month-to-month comparisons are not very worthwhile. The more worthwhile benchmark is the year-ago level of $193.9 billion, when revenues were just $87.3 billion and expenditures were $281.2 billion. Watch the year-over-year numbers on both spending and tax revenues, not just the net deficitThursday • Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 29,000 in the last week, to 469,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims started to rise again, up in 7 of the 8 weeks before last week. Last week was some good progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to near 400,000 to signal that the economy is on-balance adding jobs. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 600,000 on a consistent basis, but still have a ways to go.
"
343,HRB,"• Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. However, that is in part due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. If one factors in the extended claims paid by the Federal government as part of the Stimulus, claims soared last week. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. Last week, regular continuing claims were 4.500 million, down 134,000 from the previous week. Extended claims (paid from Federal ARRA funds) were 5.866 million -- a increase of 197,500. Those numbers might be distorted downwards the shenanigans of Senator Bunning who held up an extension of benefits, although given that the extended claims numbers a week behind the regular continuing claims numbers, look for more of that effect in the following week. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers!
"
344,HRB,"• The Trade Deficit is expected to increase to $40.6 billion for January, up from $40.2 billion in December. While this is well below the rate we were consistently running a few years ago, it has been trending up again after plunging during the credit crisis which caused almost all world trade to come to a dead stop. An increase in the trade deficit is a serious negative, since it directly lowers GDP. It, not the budget deficit, is what causes us to be in hock to the Chinese and OPEC. The budget deficit only indirectly does, and has to go through the trade deficit for that to happen. That’s not an opinion, that is an accounting identity, as true as saying assets have to equal the sum of liabilities and equity on a balance sheetFriday

345,HRB,"• The Retail Sales report is expected to show an increase of just 0.1% overall in February, a sharp slowdown from the 0.5% increase in January.

347,HRB,"• The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey is expected to show a slight rise to 73.7 for March, up from 73.6 in FebruaryPotential Positive SurprisesHistorically, the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. While normally firms that report better-than-expected earnings rise in reaction, that has not been the case so far this quarter. Some of the companies that have these characteristics include:Jo-Ann Stores (JAS) is expected to report EPS of $1.33, up from $0.74 per share a year ago (it's good to stick to your knitting). Last time out, JAS posted a positive surprise of 1.2% and over the last month the mean estimate for its fourth quarter earnings is up 32.7%. JAS has a Zacks #1 Rank.Kirkland’s (KIRK) is expected to report EPS of $0.81, up from $0.59 a year ago. In the 3Q, KIRK posted a positive surprise of 187.5% and over the last month, the consensus estimate for its 4Q earnings is up 7.3%. KIRK is a Zacks #1 Rank stock.Quicksilver (ZQK) is expected to lose $0.13 per share this year, worse than its $0.07 loss a year ago. Those low expectations could be setting it up for a positive surprise. In the third quarter, they posted a 133.3% positive surprise. Over the last month the mean estimate for the 4Q is up 1.9%. ZQK holds a Zacks #1 Rank.Potential Negative SurprisesGastar Exploration (GST) is expected to post a loss of $0.03 a share, versus break even a year ago. Last time they reported 133.3% below expectations. For this Zacks #5 Rank stock, analysts have cut their estimates for this quarter slightly over the last month by 50.0% (OK, it's just a move from a loss of $0.02 to a loss of $0.03).Jackson Hewitt (JTX) is expected to earn $0.51 a share this quarter, down from the $0.74 they earned a year ago. They had a positive surprise of 12.0% last time out, but analysts have cut the estimate for this quarter by 8.6% over the last month. The stock holds a Zacks #4 Rank.H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report) is expected to report a EPS of $0.15, down from $0.20 last year. Last quarter they reported 5.0% above of expectations.

"
352,HRB,"The Federal Open Market Committee will hold its final meeting of the year on Tuesday. The Fed is expected to lower interest rates at this meeting, though whether the cut will 25 or 50 basis points is unknown. Futures are pricing in a strong possibility of a 50 basis point cut.
"
353,HRB,"I think the Fed will cut by 25 basis points and alter its statement to suggest that further cuts could occur. I also expect the Committee to drop ""upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth"" from its statement, thereby implying a bias towards improving liquidity.
"
354,HRB,"The key issue for the markets may not so much be the extent of the cut, but rather the perception that the Fed is willing to do whatever it takes to prevent a recession from occurring. The Fed needs to show that it is being proactive in providing enough liquidity to loosen the current credit crunch.
"
355,HRB,"Investors should keep in mind that the reaction Tuesday afternoon to the Fed's decision may not be indicative of how the markets will trade on Wednesday. I am hopeful for a Santa Claus rally, though.
"
356,HRB,"The economic calendar is fairly light otherwise. Here is a brief overview of scheduled releases:
"
357,HRB,"Tuesday: October wholesale trade
"
358,HRB,"Wednesday: October trade balance and November import prices
"
359,HRB,"Thursday: November producer prices (PPI), November retail sales and October inventories
"
360,HRB,"Friday: November consumer prices (CPI), November industrial production and capacity utilization,
"
361,HRB,"The earnings calendar will also be fairly light. We have confirmed dates for 34 companies, five of which are in the S&P 500: Costco (COST  -  Free Report), H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Lehman Brothers (LEH) and Pall Corporation (PLL).
"
362,HRB,"Lehman Brothers will be the first of the major brokers to report. Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Bear Stearns (BSC) are scheduled to report a week later on Dec 18 and Dec 20, respectively. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) has yet to announced a date for when they will report fourth-quarter results.
"
363,HRB,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Dec 10 - 14Costco (COST  -  Free Report) generated a 6% increase in U.S. same-stores last month and a 21% in international same-store sales. Excluding the impact of higher gasoline prices, U.S. same-store sales rose 4%.
"
364,HRB,"Although the November sales figures do not completely coincide with end of the COST's fiscal first quarter, they do lend support for a positive earnings surprise. The retailer has surpassed expectations during three out of the past four quarters, most recently by a margin of eight cents per share. The most accurate estimate (60 cents per share) is two cents above the consensus estimate and also suggests a positive surprise could be forthcoming. COST is scheduled to report on Thursday, Dec 13, before the start of trading.
"
365,HRB,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Dec 10 - 14
"
366,HRB,"Forecasts for Lehman Brothers (LEH) are continuing to be cut. Within the past seven days, six of the 13 covering brokerage analysts have lowered their projections for fiscal fourth quarter earnings. The consensus earnings estimate of $1.59 is nine cents below the average forecast of a week ago and 25 cents below the average forecast of three months ago. The most accurate forecast is even more bearish at $1.55 per share. LEH has missed expectations twice during the past four quarters. Lehman is scheduled to report on Thursday, Dec 1, before the start of trading.

"
372,HRB,"Earnings Preview 12/7 - 12/11
"
373,HRB,"Next week will be a light one on the earnings front, with a total of only 61 companies reporting, including 8 S&P 500 firms. Among the more noteworthy names reporting will be: Costco (COST  -  Free Report), National Semiconductor (NSM) and Kroger’s (KR  -  Free Report). It will also be a relatively light week as far as economic data is concerned.Monday
"
374,HRB,"•    Consumer Credit is expected to have declined by $9.3 billion following a $14.8 billion decline last month. Declining consumer credit is unusual, but has been the norm so far this year as banks try to pull back on lending.Tuesday
"
375,HRB,"•    Nothing worth talking about.Wednesday
"
376,HRB,"•    Wholesale inventories are expected to have declined by 0.6% last month following a 0.9% decline in September. Eventually inventories will stop going down since they are already pretty lean and will start going back up. When that happens it will provide a powerful, though short-term, boost to the economy.Thursday
"
377,HRB,"•    Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. These have been in a steep downward trend of late, although still at historically high levels. Last week there were 457,000 initial claims. Look for the decline to continue.
"
378,HRB,"•    The highlight of the week will be the Trade Deficit numbers. They are expected to rise to 37.1 billion in October from $36.5 billion in September. The trade deficit has been trending higher in recent months after a very steep drop last winter. That decline happened because imports fell off a cliff faster than exports declined. The more recent increase has happened as imports rise faster than exports.
"
379,HRB,"•    The fiscal budget deficit for November is expected to be $135.0 billion, down from $176.5 billion in October. However, that number is highly seasonal, so the month-to-month difference is not all that meaningful. A year ago, the deficit was $237.2 billion in October and $164.4 billion in November. Thus, if the consensus projections come true, the federal deficit is actually coming down sharply (funny what happens when you look at actual data rather than listening to TV pundits).Friday
"
380,HRB,"•    Total Retail Sales for November are expected to have increased by 0.5% following a 1.4% increase in October (seasonally adjusted).
"
381,HRB,"•    Excluding Autos, retail sales are expected to have risen by 0.5% in November following a 0.2% increase in October.Potential Positive Surprises
"
382,HRB,"Historically, the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Some of the companies that have these characteristics include:National Semiconductor (NSM) - National Semi is expected to post EPS of $0.14, unchanged from last year. That low expectation sets it up for a positive surprise. Last time out they beat by 100%. The mean estimate of those earnings has increased by 2.01% over the last month over the last month and the stock has a neutral Zacks Rank of 3.Costco (COST  -  Free Report) - While the warehouse club chain is expected to post earnings of $0.59, down from $0.65 a year ago, it did post a positive surprise of 7.79% last time out, and the mean estimate for the quarter is up 0.81% over the last month. The stock holds a Zacks Rank of 2.Potential Negative Surprises
"
383,HRB,"In keeping with the overall very positive tone of this earnings season, the potential negative firms are less clear cut. However:H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report) is expected to post a loss of $0.40 a share, even with its loss a year ago (not a lot of people do their taxes in the fall).

384,HRB,"Perhaps a holiday-shortened week is what the market needs to declare independence from the current selling pressure. The U.S. financial markets will be closed on Friday, July 4. The NYSE and Nasdaq will close at 1 p.m. on Thursday, July 3.
"
385,HRB,"June's employment data will be released on Thursday, a day early, because of the holiday. Given that volume will be light, trading could be volatile. Therefore I would strongly caution against reading anything into the reaction to the job numbers.

"
387,HRB,"Monday: Revised June University of Michigan consumer confidence survey
"

"
389,HRB,"Wednesday: May factory orders, weekly oil inventories

402,HRB,"The U.S. stock markets are attempting to recover from the credit worries and appear on track to post modest gains for the third full week of August as I write this on Friday morning. The monthly performance is still in doubt, however, with the major indexes only a days move away from being up or down. More telling, perhaps is the technical picture with the Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq trading just below the 90-day moving average and the 200-day moving average showing signs of flattening.
"
403,HRB,"So will the final five days of August provide the much needed boost? 
"
404,HRB,"Computer maker Dell (DELL) might provide some optimism when it reports on Thursday after the close. However, it is just one of six S&P 500 companies scheduled to report and the others are not bellwethers: Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report), Ciena (CIEN  -  Free Report), H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report), Novell (NOVL) and Sears Holding . Overall, we have confirmed that 80 companies will report.
"
405,HRB,"July existing home sales data will be released on Monday, possibly setting an early tone for the week. New home sales rose last month and prices were mixed (median prices rose, but average prices declined). The Conference Board will publish its August consumer confidence index on Tuesday. Thursday features preliminary second-quarter GDP growth estimates. Friday will be busy with July personal income and spending, July factory orders, August Chicago PMI and the final August University of Michigan consumer confidence index being released. The data will need to be mostly inline with expectations to lend support to the equity markets: better-than-expected numbers will diminish hopes for a rate cut at the September meeting, while weaker-than-expected numbers will fuel worries about the impact the credit crunch is having on the markets.
"
406,HRB,"Although the Fed has been actively trying to encourage lending, there is little sign that credit standards have loosened from a few weeks ago. Rather, I would expect fears about the credit crisis to continue to hang over the markets. The Federal Reserve is not meeting until Sep 18 and there remains uncertainty about what exactly the Fed will do with both the discount and the fed funds rate. (I do expect the Fed to lower both rates as a measure to provide confidence to the markets.) This uncertainty should result in continued volatility within the equity markets. Active traders should also note that Friday, Aug 31, leads into a holiday weekend, meaning volume could be reduced with the possibility of selling pressure ahead of the Labor Day break.
"
407,HRB,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 27 - 31
"
408,HRB,"Two brokerage analysts have raised their quarterly projections on Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days. The revisions were in response to a 5.2% increase in July same-store sales.  Although the second-quarter consensus earnings estimate is unchanged at 10 cents per share, the most accurate estimate is calling for the company to report 12 cents per share. BIG has surpassed expectations during each of the past four quarters by an average margin of 10 cents per share. Big Lots is scheduled to report on Wed, Aug 29, before the start of trading.
"
409,HRB,"Dollar Tree  (DLTR  -  Free Report) recently raised its second-quarter guidance. Based on the 4.4% increase in second-quarter same-store sales, the company said that expects profits to have totaled between 32 and 33 cents per share versus the previous guidance for 29 to 32 cents per share. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, pushing the consensus estimate up by a penny to 33 cents per share. DLTR has topped expectations during three out of the last four quarters. Dollar Tree is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 29, before the start of trading.
"
410,HRB,"Higher chicken prices are leading to raised expectations for Sanderson Farms (SAFM  -  Free Report). One brokerage analyst raised his forecast for fiscal third-quarter earnings, causing the consensus estimate to rise by four cents to $1.93 per share. SAFM has topped expectations during three out of the past four quarters, though its fiscal first-quarter earnings missed analysts estimates. Sanderson Farms is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Aug 28, before the start of trading. 
"
411,HRB,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 27 - 31Joy Global (JOYG) warned last month that sustained weakness in the U.S. coal market would cause fiscal 2007 earnings to be well below the guidance provided in December 2006. (The company had forecast full-year earnings of $2.85 to $3.25 per share). The warning caused the majority of the covering brokerage analysts to lower their projections. These revisions caused the consensus estimate for fiscal third-quarter earnings to drop by seven cents to 71 cents per share. The most accurate consensus is more bearish at 69 cents per share. The manufacturer of mining equipment has missed expectations for two consecutive quarters. Joy Global is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 29, before the start of trading.

417,HRB,"Catalysts? What catalysts?
"
418,HRB,"Anyone who wants for a reason for the markets to move in one direction or another during the week of June 18 is going to be disappointed. Daily market fluctuations, both here and overseas, possible comments out of Fed officials and sentiment are all the market will have to rely on. The list of scheduled events is small, few companies are providing guidance and people are taking summer vacations. Even the Stock Trader's Almanac offers nothing except to say that the week after June triple witching has been negative for the Dow during 14 out of the past 16 years.
"
419,HRB,"To be fair, there are eight S&P 500 companies on deck as the second-quarter earnings preseason continues. The companies are Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Circuit City (CC), Carnival (CCL  -  Free Report), Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report), Jabil Circuit (JBL  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). None of these, however, should wield enough influence to do anything more than cause some potential intraday swings in the market. 
"
420,HRB,"The economic calendar won't add much excitement either. May housing starts will be published on Tuesday. Thursday brings the May Leading Economic Indicators and the Philadelphia Fed's June survey.
"
421,HRB,"Given this backdrop and lack of catalysts, interest rates could continue to play a role. The Fed's next meeting is not until June 27-28 (a two-day meeting) and although the committee should leave interest rates unchanged, the bond markets remain weak on a technical basis. Higher interest rates are a problem for the housing market and for the capital markets since they make more expensive to complete corporate deals. This is why perhaps the best catalyst for the bulls would be a large, private equity takeover - a clear sign that interest rates haven't risen too much. Of course, predicting if and when this will happen is beyond the scope of my crystal ball.
"
422,HRB,"Catalysts. To quote Stephen Colbert, that's the word.
"
423,HRB,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of June 18 - June 22Commercial Metals (CMC  -  Free Report) has had a mixed record when it comes to earnings performance. It has beat expectations and missed expectations twice over the past four quarters. A recent improvement, albeit small, in the consensus estimate suggests CMC might just report bullish fiscal third-quarter reports. A revision by one brokerage analyst pushed the quarterly consensus estimate up by one cent to 78 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is at 79 cents per share. Commercial Metals is scheduled to report on Wednesday, June 20, before the start of trading.
"
424,HRB,"Gerber Scientific (GRB) recently preannounced results for its fiscal fourth quarter. The company, which makes graphics software for signs and apparel, expects to report revenues of $153 to $155 million and earnings of 22 to 26 cents per share. Both numbers were above the company's previous guidance. All of the covering brokerage analysts raised their projections in response, sending the consensus earnings estimate six cents higher to 23 cents per share. GRB has topped profit expectations for four consecutive quarters. Gerber Scientific is scheduled to report on Thursday, June 18.
"
425,HRB,"Two brokerage analysts have raised their projections on Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days. The impact of these revisions has been to push the second-quarter earnings estimate up by a penny to $2 per share. The Most Recent Consensus is considerably more bullish at $2.09 per share. The investment banking and brokerage firm has topped expectations during each the past four quarters by an average margin of 40 cents per share. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report on Wednesday, June 20, before the start of trading.
"
426,HRB,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of June 18 - June 22
"
427,HRB,"About one quarter of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their forecasts for Best Buy's (BBY  -  Free Report) fiscal first quarter. The downward revisions may reflect concerns about weaker sales of LCD televisions and higher gasoline prices. The consensus earnings estimate of 50 cents per share is a penny less than 30 days ago and two cents below the average forecast of 60 days ago. BBY has missed expectations once during the past four quarters. Best Buy is scheduled to report on Tuesday, June 19, before the start of trading.

432,HRB,"November 24th, commonly referred to as Black Friday, officially kicked off the holiday shopping season. Next week analysts will be keeping a close eye on holiday sales and signs of consumer strength or weakness. It will be interesting to see if promotions and expanded hours equate to better sales for retailers. Will consumers be willing to spend this holiday season despite a slowing but still steady economy? 
"
433,HRB,"Next weeks calendar of economic events is going to be a busy one. October durable goods orders will be released on Nov 28 along with existing home sales for last month. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index for November will also be released on Tuesday. On Nov 29, third-quarter preliminary GDP figures will be made available as well as October new home sales data. Lastly, on Dec 1, The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) will announce its index of manufacturing activity for November. 
"
434,HRB,"The number of earnings reports scheduled for next week is fairly light. As of this morning, there are just 40 confirmed earnings reports scheduled. 
"
435,HRB,"Companies That Could Surprise During the Week of Nov 27 to Dec 1
"
436,HRB,"Aeropostale, Inc. (ARO) announced on Nov 2 that October sales at stores open at least one year rose 5.6%. Analysts on average had expected a jump of 3.9%. Total net sales for the four weeks ended Oct 28 increased 18.3% to $99.2 million, compared to $83.9 million for the four-week period ended Oct 29, 2005. The strong results prompted ARO to raise its third-quarter earnings per share guidance to between 60 and 61 cents per share, compared to its prior outlook which called for profits between 58 and 59 cents. Over the past 30 days, the consensus estimate for this quarter jumped two cents to 61 cents. Aeropostale will report on Wednesday, Nov 29, before the open of trading.
"
437,HRB,"Donaldson Company, Inc. (DCI  -  Free Report) reported its 17th consecutive record year in early September, with earnings per share, net income and sales hitting new highs. Fourth-quarter fiscal 2006 profits came in at 43 cents per share, three cents above analysts expectations. Furthermore, the result was 10.3% better than earnings in the prior-year period. The company also set its profit guidance for 2007 above analysts' expectations. The consensus estimate for this quarter currently sits at 43 centsa penny better than the consensus of 30 days earlier. Donaldson will report first-quarter fiscal 2007 results on Monday, Nov 27, after the close of trading.
"
438,HRB,"H&R Block, Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report) is projected to report a second-quarter fiscal 2007 earnings loss of 30 cents per share. Analysts have been growing increasingly pessimistic. The consensus estimate of 30 days prior called for a loss of 22 cents per share. HRB missed analysts expectations in nine out of the past 11 quarters. In early November, the company lowered its fiscal 2007 earnings per share guidance to between $1.20 and $1.45, compared to its previous outlook which called for profits between $1.60 and $1.85 per share. HRB cited changes in the near-term outlook for the mortgage segment as fueling its negative outlook. H&R Block will report its second-quarter financial results on Thursday, Nov 30, after the close of the market.
