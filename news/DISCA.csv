Leon set no conditions on the AT&T takeover.Despite the win, AT&T fell 1.8% to 33.74 in after-hours trades. Time Warner rose 4.7% to 100.70. One analyst said AT&T's slip may involve arbitrage related to the Time Warner transaction.The Department of Justice sued in November 2017 to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner on grounds that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry.

Beyond the sectors affected by the ruling, markets set up in a holding pattern ahead of this afternoon's policy announcement from the Federal Reserve.21st Century Fox (FOX) led early advancers, with Time Warner, Discovery Communications (DISCA) and CBS (CBS) also making strong, related moves. AT&T,  Comcast (CMCSA) and H&R Block (HRB) posted some of the heaviest early declines.The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 fought to hold fractional gains. The Nasdaq Composite gained almost 0.2%.A federal judge in Washington late Tuesday threw out the U.S. Justice Department's effort to block AT&T's $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. The judge said the DOJ case, which echoed promises made by Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, was too weak to consider an appeal.The ruling throws open the door to a broad range of restructuring among telecom and entertainment names struggling to adapt to competition brought by Netflix (NFLX), Facebook (FB), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and other huge new-media venues. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit stock news today)Meanwhile, Disney inched up 0.5%. Disney inked a $52.4 billion deal in December to acquire the bulk of 21st Century Fox. But Comcast also wants those assets, and investors anticipate a bidding war now that the AT&T-Time Warner deal has gone through. In response, Comcast dropped 3.3%. Fox vaulted 7% higher.As a result, 21st Century Fox and Discovery Communications posted the two largest premarket gains among Nasdaq 100 issues. Fox, Time Warner and CBS led the S&P 500.While H&R Block dived to the bottom of the S&P 500 on disappointing quarterly results, Comcast and AT&T held the next-largest declines. Comcast was the worst performer among Nasdaq 100 stocks in premarket trade.On the Dow, Intel (INTC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) set up early leads, up 0.6% apiece.  Merck (MRK) ticked 0.2% higher. The Food and Drug Administration agreed to a priority review to possibly expand the permissible age range for Merck's human papillomavirus vaccine, Gardasil 9.  Merck shares are in a buy range above a 61.10 buy point in a bottoming base.Among FANG stock tech leaders, Netflix jumped 1.8%. The IBD Leaderboard stock is extended above a flat base following a breakout in May.On the IBD 50 list, Twitter (TWTR) again swung to an early lead, up 1.2% at the open.

Shares are up more than 20%, placing the stock in a profit-taking zone.Pivotal Software (PVTL) blasted 19% higher, sending the April IPO to take a new high. Pivotal reported after Tuesday's close fiscal first-quarter revenue that blasted past analyst expectations, while losses were less than forecast. The San Francisco-based company also hoisted second-quarter earnings and revenue guidance above estimates. The stock is extended after clearing an IPO base on June 6, ending Tuesday up 41% from its April IPO at 15 a share.Korn Ferry International (KFY) jetted ahead 20% following its fiscal fourth-quarter report. The staffing services firm's results topped analyst expectations, particularly on the revenue line. Management issued strong first quarter earnings and revenue guidance, and announced a rebranding plan that would collect the company's sub-brands under a single name. Shares are extended, up 25% since clearing a flat base in March.China-based Bitauto Holdings (BITA) jumped 9%. The online auto shopping and marketing service turned in first-quarter earnings slightly below consensus targets. But revenue topped views by a wide margin. The stock ended Tuesday 45% above an April low, attempting to climb the right side of a deep, eight-month consolidation.H&R Block careened 20% lower. The accounting firm reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales and earnings comfortably above analysts targets. Full-year revenue guidance was just below consensus expectations, however, as the company said discount pricing would affect its top-line performance.  The stock had been climbing the right side of an 11-month base.Banks, financial stocks and other interest-rate sensitive portions of the market could kick into action late in Wednesday's session. That would depend on the outcome of the Federal Reserve's policy announcement, which comes out at 2 p.m. ET, and press conference, which begins at 2:30 p.m.  The market has for the most part baked in expectations for a quarter-point rate hike, putting the Fed's target at between 1.75% and 2%. But hints as to whether Fed strategy might include one or two more rate increases during the remainder of the year could cause adjustments, and a shift in tone, late in the session.Oil prices could also factor into Wednesday's action, pending the results of weekly data due out from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET. Weekly data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showed a lighter-than-anticipated 730,000-barrel decrease in oil inventories (vs. forecasts for a 2.7 million-barrel decline). Gasoline supplies unexpectedly rose by 4.3 million barrels.

23,DISCA,"Media baron John Malone says Walt Disney (DIS) would be more attractive to Apple (AAPL) as an acquisition if Disney spun off sports channel ESPN.In an interview with CNBC, Malone praised AT&T's (T) move to acquire media giant Time Warner (TWX), saying it gives the telecom conglomerate much-needed diversification. AT&T announced a deal to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion in cash and stock on Oct. 24.Apple reportedly has passed on making a counter bid for Time Warner, despite the urging of Goldman Sachs bankers.Malone says Apple could be interested in Disney, if it shed ESPN along with billions of dollars in contracts for sports-programming rights.

Apple stock fell 2.8% while Disney stock rose a fraction in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Disney stock has been a laggard and has a Composite Rating, a metric in CANSLIM investing, of only 62 out of a possible 99. Disney stock has edged up since the AT&T-Time Warner deal was announced but is still down about 9% in 2016. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.""If I had to guess what you will see is a split of Disney, with ESPN spun off,"" Malone told CNBC. ""And probably ESPN could be owned and protected by a distributor in the U.S. And Apple would be more interested in (the rest of Disney — movie studio, broadcaster ABC, theme parks).""They would have a lot more in common in terms of international branding, because fundamentally (Apple CEO) Tim Cook's a global player.""Disney's CEO Bob Iger sits on Apple's board. Unlike 21st Century Fox (FOXA) or Viacom (VIA), Disney is not family-controlled.Malone could himself have an angle, depending on what Disney does. In addition to his voting control of Liberty Media (LMCA), Liberty Global and other parts of the Liberty empire, Malone is the biggest shareholder in Discovery (DISCA) and owns stakes in Starz, QVC Group and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).Malone's Liberty Broadband owns about 18% of Charter Communications (CHTR). Charter is the No. 2 cable firm behind Comcast (CMCSA).""If somebody went after Disney, my guess is Apple would have to finally make a decision,"" Malone said. ""Somehow or another there's going to be some solution, because, you know, otherwise Disney should be trading at a substantially higher multiple. … They went long (sports-rights contract renewals) and at the moment that looks adverse.""RELATED:Walt Disney Reports Q4 Earnings Late: What To WatchAT&T, Time Warner Fall After Trump Victory; Is Merger In Doubt?

24,DISCA,"NBCUniversal will invest another $200 million in Buzzfeed, valuing the digital media publisher at $1.7 billion, according to several published reports.NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast (CMCSA) took a $200 million stake in August 2015, but that deal valued Buzzfeed at $1.5 billion.Buzzfeed has generated a lot of, well, buzz, with its catchy listicles and been a leader in branded content. But revenue in 2015 fell well short of expectations. This year, Buzzfeed has redoubled its focus on video.Comcast two years ago also invested $200 million in Vox Media, which has a range of political, sports and news sites such as Recode, Vox, and SB Nation.Last month Discovery Communications (DISCA) invested $100 million in Group Nine Media. Walt Disney (DIS) has invested $400 million in Vice Media, a digital and cable media entity.To a certain extent, old media companies, faced with declining ratings, may be throwing relatively small sums at new media and distribution channels and seeing what sticks.Walt Disney was among the tech and media giants reportedly interested in buying Twitter (TWTR). But Disney appears to have passed on making a deal due to Twitter's reputation for abusive commentators.Also late Thursday, AT&T (T) reportedly has held discussions with Time Warner (TWX) about a deal.RELATED:AT&T, Time Warner Merger Talk Is Back, Merits QuestionedDisney, Salesforce Didn't Bid On Twitter Because Of 'Haters'

25,DISCA,"What's behind AT&T's (T) apparent pursuit of media giant Time Warner (TWX)? AT&T craves rights to more content, as internet giants such as Google, Amazon.com (AMZN) and possibly Apple (AAPL) push into web TV and entertainment services, analysts say.Telecom conglomerate AT&T reportedly is nearing a cash-and-stock deal to acquire media giant Time Warner, with an announcement possible as soon as this weekend or Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported. Media and entertainment stocks jumped Friday on views that internet, telecom and media companies will scramble to acquire content.Time Warner's media empire includes HBO and Turner Broadcasting, which has rights to sports telecasts. It also owns Warner Bros. film studio and cable networks TNT, TBS and CNN. Time Warner owns a 10% stake in internet video provider Hulu, a joint venture of Comcast (CMCSA), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Walt Disney (DIS).AT&T stock fell 3% to 37.49 in the stock market today on the WSJ report, the lowest since the end of February. Time Warner stock jumped 7.8% to 89.48.But after the close, AT&T fell about 1% while Time Warner popped 4%. Bloomberg reported that AT&T is near a deal to buy Time Warner for $110 a share.During the regular session,  Discovery Communications (DISCA), controlled by media baron John Malone, popped 3.6%, while CBS stock rose 1.9% and Walt Disney 1.1%.Shares of 21st Century Fox, which bid for Time Warner in 2014, rose 2.2%, Viacom (VIA) 2.7%, Scripps Interactive (SNI) 5.6% and AMC Networks (AMCX) 3.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Media consolidation has been expected, with CBS and Viacom possibly recombining and John Malone positioned to roll up smaller companies, analysts say. IBD's Media-Diversified group ranks No. 58 out of 197 industry groups, but should move up on M&A speculation. CBS has been the top-ranked stock, and you can find out why at Stock Checkup. Structuring a deal might be challenging for AT&T. Time Warner had a market cap of over $70 billion, and AT&T had just over $7 billion in cash on its books as of June 30. AT&T has about $120 billion in debt, while Time Warner has $24 billion in debt.Any AT&T offer for Time Warner would be mostly stock, says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.""AT&T is much more levered than what it appears,"" Moffett told IBD. ""You have to wonder what Time Warner's appetite would be if a large component of the deal is AT&T equity.""Moffett adds that chances of regulatory approval would only be 50-50.Bloomberg reported that AT&T is in a rush because of other possible bidders. Apple raised the idea of buying Time Warner at a meeting between the two companies in late 2015, but talks never advanced, the Financial Times said in May.Speculation over AT&T's interest in Time Warner follows reports that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google has signed up CBS as its first broadcasting partner for a web TV service.""We believe that hyperscale internet companies will be looking to sell a full suite of communications/cloud services to customers to achieve maximum economies of scale,"" Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan said in a research report. ""As they directly connect content with end users, the carriers will respond. Time Warner should fit in fairly well with AT&T's wireless and (internet video) services.""AT&T's launch of DirecTVNow, an internet video service, might be a factor, analysts say.""The upcoming launch of the DirecTV OTT/mobile product certainly provides a reason for AT&T to want to acquire quality content assets,"" said Colby Synesael, a Cowen & Co. analyst, in a research report. ""However, the price paid for any deal could be overkill and exclusivity is not necessary and in fact may not be a good use of Time Warner's valuable content.""Federal regulators placed tough conditions on Comcast's 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal from General Electric (GE). Most of those conditions sunset in 2018.Amy Yong, analyst at Macquarie Capital, says AT&T would face regulatory scrutiny.""The big strategic question is what sort of operating synergies could the combined company achieve? We presume regulators would require AT&T to maintain arms-length transactions with Turner, HBO and Warner Bros. Industry logic would say AT&T would want or need other networks' content on its pay TV offerings,"" Yong said in a report.While Apple has shelved a web TV service amid stalled talks with media companies, many analysts believe cash-rich Apple could re-emerge as a player. There's been speculation over the years that Apple and Walt Disney could be a match.RELATED:AT&T, Time Warner Merger Talk Is Back, Merits QuestionedGoogle Nabs CBS As AT&T, Amazon, Hulu Seek OTT Partners

"
28,DISCA,"You're sitting courtside, close enough to that glossy NBA hardwood floor to high-five your favorite player. Look left, look right at the roaring crowd, and bask in the knowledge that your seat should normally cost thousands of dollars.But you're not in a maxed-out arena. Instead, the experience is taking place in the sun-bathed lobby of NextVR's Laguna Beach, Calif., office, where you feel like you're watching a basketball game from inside your television.This is the new wave of virtual reality. Not the clunky, pixelated virtual reality of yore, but one of live-streamed sports events, 360-degree news segments and interactive movie trailers in high definition that industry insiders say will deliver dazzling moments. So you can bet that old-school media heavies -- already beset by cord-cutting woes and the rise of streaming-entertainment leaders Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) -- want in on the action, which Digi-Capital estimates could be a $30 billion market by 2020.And despite no guarantees that virtual reality will have staying power as a new medium, the threat of losing more tech-savvy millennial viewers seems very real, giving Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA), Time Warner (TWX) and others a serious case of FOMO -- a Fear Of Missing Out.""It's kind of the perfect storm for VR to be rising at the time it is, because as you know, the media companies are all scrambling to figure out how do you get the millennials, the younger generation,"" NextVR Executive Chairman Brad Allen told IBD in an interview.Virtual reality has already gained traction in video games, with players heartily embracing goggle-based interactive gaming. Hardware is on sale now. Facebook (FB)-owned Oculus and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation were among those showing off their wares at the VR-dominated E3 conference in June. But aside from video games, there is still little to watch with all that fancy VR gear. Enter big media.Comcast Ventures and Time Warner Investments were among those that contributed to last year's $30.5 million funding round for NextVR. The live VR broadcaster also recently inked deals with 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) Fox Sports and Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) as it looks to bring Daytona 500 races and A-list concerts to viewers who can't make it to those venues in person.In addition to NextVR, Comcast has plunked down millions of dollars in VR startups, such as cinematic content creator Felix & Paul Studios, communication platform AltspaceVR, and VR/mixed-reality company Spaces. Come August, Comcast-owned NBC will offer viewers 85 hours of immersive, Zika-free Olympics coverage via the Samsung Gear VR headset.If the scramble to throw money at VR is any indication, big media is taking it seriously. And while other new formats like 3D TV have come and gone, VR looks less like a passing fad and should stick around, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers.""It's not just going from HDTV to 4K TV,"" he said in an interview. ""It's not an incremental change. It's more a transformational change, so I think (big media is) trying to be at the forefront of innovation.""Watching TV in virtual reality is indeed light years away from a regular flat-screen experience. For one thing, it doesn't necessitate a TV, but a headset like Google Cardboard plus a smartphone app like Within or Jaunt. And the potential for nabbing a viewer's full attention is appealing, particularly at a time when young people are inclined to consume content on more than one screen at a time.Strap on a headset and disappear into VR segments from Disney's ABC News in which users can, say, wander through isolationist North Korea or watch a family of elephants lumber through the grasslands in Africa.In one video, ABC News reporter Bob Woodruff plays tour guide outside a replica Eiffel Tower on the outskirts of Shanghai. Glance to the sky, and there's the so-called Eiffel, one-third the size of the real thing and enshrouded in a mix of fog and pollution. To the immediate right is a pile of black sooty stuff, beyond which lies grass and the hazy outline of a few buildings.The video is technically a 360-degree experience and not what some would call ""true VR,"" in which users are able to move freely through the virtual space. Panoramic videos, such as ABC's, keep viewers rooted to the ground. In fact, much of what is termed cinematic virtual reality doesn't allow for mobility. You also can't talk to Woodruff or pet an elephant through some VR version of yourself, but that's not to say that such a capability won't exist somewhere in the future.Regardless, the technology is impressive, and the hardware projections alone are encouraging for those hoping the market will grow. Market tracker IDC projects sales of 9.6 million VR units and $2.3 billion in hardware revenue for the year, thanks to headsets from HTC, Oculus, Samsung and Sony, with sales ballooning to 64.8 million units and $15 billion by 2020.To be sure, the U.S. pay-TV market, which Deloitte estimates will hit $170 billion this year, dwarfs VR. But alarm over the subscription TV environment, spurred by flagging subscriber figures at Disney's ESPN, sent media stocks into a downward spiral last August and made the need to adapt to a digital-first entertainment landscape ever more pressing.Not long after the summer panic, it was announced that Disney had led a $65 million round of funding in Jaunt, a maker of cinematic VR recording equipment that also has an interest in content distribution. The startup's goal is to deliver VR to paying customers.""What we like to say is ... we're trying to be the Netflix of VR,"" Jaunt Chief Business Officer David Anderman told IBD.His aim is for viewers to shell out for ""premium, professionally produced content"" in much the same way that viewers subscribe to over-the-top streaming services.Like Next VR, Jaunt is focusing on sports, music and travel, plus news and documentaries. And Anderman said even gamers, who are among the early adopters in VR, are more interested in travel and adventure cinematic content than they are in games.""People try it, they have the ... 'holy crap' moment,"" he said. ""They can't believe the content they're seeing.""And in April, Nokia said it had forged an agreement with Walt Disney Studios to provide the company with VR cameras and software.The current array of content available is still somewhat spotty, though, and less often a standalone product than a marketing supplement for another show or movie.For example, embedded in Disney's ""Star Wars"" app is ""Jakku Spy,"" a string of VR transmissions to the sandy planet from the Resistance, designed to pump up enthusiasm last year for its long-awaited seventh installment of the hallowed Lucasfilm franchise.Meanwhile, shows like ABC's ""Quantico"" and USA Network's ""Mr. Robot"" have shot scenes in VR, and Syfy International is producing five exclusively VR episodes of ""Halycon"" that can be viewed through the Oculus Rift, in addition to 10 episodes for the linear TV network. (Both USA and Syfy are owned by Comcast's NBCUniversal.)Like media peers Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Lions Gate (LGF), Time Warner has also used a taste of VR to lure moviegoers back to theaters, such as Warner Brothers' VR trailer for its summer horror flick ""The Conjuring 2.""But some viewers, while enthusiastic about VR, are not always sure what to make of big media's efforts so far. Available on gaming platform Steam is Disney Movies VR, a collection of immersive experiences available to HTC Vive users. The hodgepodge includes VR scenes from ""The Jungle Book,"" as well as a 360-degree, red-carpet movie premiere that user reviews deemed ""underwhelming"" and ""painfully boring.""""Generally, all the studios are experimenting with the medium,"" said Piper Jaffray's Meyers. ""I think they're looking forward to VR being sort of the next medium to tell stories. However, I still think we're very early on. The filmmaking process, the storytelling process using VR is very limited at this point, so it becomes more of an experience.""It will be a while -- at least five to seven years away, says Meyers -- before audiences will be able to plop down into a theater seat and watch a full 90-minute to two-hour movie in VR. But exhibitors are already prepping themselves for VR-happy moviegoers anyway.Imax (IMAX) has struck deals with Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google to develop a cinema-grade VR camera, and through a partnership with VR content creator Starbreeze, plans to offer a ""premium VR experience"" in malls and multiplexes.""A lot of Hollywood is waking up to the reality that VR is gonna be huge, "" says Hrish Lotlikar, co-founder and chief business development officer of The Rogue Initiative.The VR entertainment company, which boasts alums from Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks Animation (DWA) and elsewhere, recently struck a deal with Michael Bay of ""Transformers"" fame to create VR content in the director's signature action-heavy style.Content aside, there are several technical kinks that still need to be worked out.Capturing a moving, immersive environment while guiding viewers through a static narrative can be a difficult thing, and the entertainment industry is still in an ""experimental phase"" with the technology, said Meyers.Then there's the sheer cost of the hardware, not to mention the physical limitations of essentially being blinded to the real world by a bulky headset, which could turn off people who prefer the relative ease of augmented reality experiences like ""Pokemon Go.""But assuming that the industry can get it right, potential money grabs lay waiting. And as Hollywood works its way up the VR learning curve for feature-length content, other VR opportunities beckon. Hungry audiences abroad, for instance, might be willing to shell out for tickets for a Steph Curry virtual reality experience.""I don't think (VR is) ever going to replace going to an event ... but a lot of times people can't get there,"" said NextVR's Allen. ""The NBA has 300 million fans in China. ... Now all of a sudden, you have a virtual ticket, and there's a courtside seat that a million people could be sitting in, virtually.""
"
29,DISCA,"Robert Charles (Bob) Wright’s finest business accomplishment was as CEO of NBC, then a subsidiary of General Electric (GE). He took an underachieving broadcast network, kicking and screaming, into the modern media universe, fighting off risk-averse GE execs, NBC honchos who wanted nothing to do with the new world of cable and the network’s many local affiliates, who felt supporting cable would hurt their business.Ignoring naysayers, he managed a stunning victory. When he took over the network in 1986, it showed a profit of $400 million. When he retired 21 years later, profits had risen to $3.1 billion.It was a capstone to a lengthy career, mostly at GE, one that began rather inauspiciously in January 1969, about six months after he earned his bachelor's degree in law from the University of Virginia. It was a staff job at a power transformer plant in Pittsfield, Mass., and, as he describes it in his forthright new memoir, “The Wright Stuff: From NBC to Autism Speaks,” it wasn’t exactly what he expected:“Everyone had their head down, going about their business. I was just a cog in a huge machine.”If it wasn’t a dream job, it did teach Wright, 73, a valuable lesson. In a phone conversation with IBD, he said:“You can get lost in that world. They paid me well, relatively speaking. I met a lot of nice people. But I realized it was going to be difficult to stand out and difficult to sell an idea there to other people.”Rather than turn him off, it fueled his drive: “I realized I was going to have to push hard and do it on my own, and that is fundamentally where I got into that mode.”If there is a single word to describe Wright’s career, it is responsibility. “Whatever it is you hope to achieve,"" he said, ""you must decide how to go about changing your situation and moving forward and then you must accept responsibility for the outcome. You cannot wait for good fortune.”So in 1970, he left GE and accepted a clerkship with a federal judge. He returned to GE in 1973, mostly for the opportunity to work with his mentor, Jack Welch. And, in 1979, Welch appointed Wright to a “job” that ultimately would change his life.GE was about to acquire Cox Broadcasting and sent Wright down to that company's Atlanta headquarters to head the operation. He was there around six months. He’d bought a house, enrolled his kids in school and was building a team when the deal fell through. Fortunately, Cox executives liked what they saw and asked him to join the company as president.Wright liked what he saw, too: a brave new media world. Years before the iPod, before iPads were a twinkle in Steven Jobs’ eye, under Wright’s leadership the company secured cable franchises around the country.Wright says that he loved his time at the family-owned company. It was there, he believes, that he honed the vision that would put him in good stead at NBC. It was there, too, that he learned “the power of empowering others to execute the vision and ideas” he felt strongly about.“I couldn’t believe I went to work every day on top of the world.”Ultimately, however, his ascent was limited. “My name wasn’t Cox,” he said. So when Welch wanted him to come back and head the housewares and audio electronics business, Wright returned to GE again. There, Wright was asked to offer an appraisal of the unit he was supposed to lead.“Jack said to me: I need your honest opinion about the business. I came back to him and said you have every reason to be nervous. We put our best products out there and in three weeks they all become promotional items. We’re never going to make a lot of money and all our science” -- research designing new products -- “is going down the drain.”Welch saw the wisdom of Wright’s analysis -- he ultimately sold those units --  and rewarded him with a plum assignment -- head of GE Financial Services, a job he held until 1986 when GE purchased RCA and Wright was named CEO of RCA’s NBC subsidiary.The television network was in third place in what was then a three-horse race, and frankly, GE didn’t know what to do with it.“It wasn’t in their wheelhouse,” Wright said.  “GE never seemed comfortable with service-oriented consumer companies that were not capital-intensive.”Fortunately, his new assignment was very much in Wright’s wheelhouse. And while his bosses didn’t see it, “I could see that the real game was going to be in cable and we had to be in it.”That insight was not universal. Not only was GE reluctant to invest additional funds into a business it didn’t understand, but NBC executives and its affiliates weren’t pleased with Wright’s plans to expand into cable.David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications (DISCA), spent 18 years working with Wright, as president of NBC Cable Distribution, among other jobs. He told IBD:“I think Bob showed great courage and leadership in the late '80s and early '90s when it was not a popular road for a broadcaster to be investing in cable and championing it within the broadcast culture. Today they go together.""Bob was a great champion of that even when (early on) the cable investments were losing money and (GE was) asking, ‘Why are we doing this?’ ”Wright’s courage, Zaslav added, extended to his dealings with the “strong personalities” whom he supervised (most of whom he hired), people such as Dick Ebersol, Don Ohlmeyer, Andy Lack, and Lorne Michaels -- legendary television executives who freely and sometimes loudly disagreed with their boss.But that didn’t bother Wright. In fact, he thrived in that environment. Zaslav noted that if you sent Wright a report “about a complicated transaction, he read every page and then did his own analysis. He read everything you gave him. If you sat down in a meeting with him, he was very prepared and he loved to debate.”As he noted in his memoir, he knew he’d occasionally have to make “an end run around GE’s aversion to taking risks and investing in emerging businesses such as cable and internet.”“I’m a realist,” Wright told IBD. “Working in a real company you can’t always do what you want when you want.”At the same time, Wright recognized that where there’s a will, there’s very frequently a way. For example, he formed several strategic alliances -- “an absolute necessity to growing a company that is lodged inside a corporation that does not want to invest in your future vision” -- so that GE wouldn’t shoulder all the financial risk of expansion.A partnership with Chuck Dolan of Cablevision led to the creation of Rainbow Programming Services, which gave NBC a 50% interest in several regional sports networks, American Movie Classics and Bravo.An alliance with Microsoft led to the creation of MSNBC. “Both Microsoft and NBC were taking a chance by moving outside their comfort zones,” Wright noted. “But that is the only way to achieve the extraordinary.”Not everything he wanted came to fruition. Wright couldn’t sell a plan to buy a stake in the Discovery networks. Similarly, a proposal to merge with Turner Broadcasting didn’t work out, in part, Wright notes, because mixing Ted and Jack was the equivalent of the proverbial oil and water.But more of Wright’s vision worked than not and, in 2011, When Comcast (CMCSA) bought what was then NBCUniversal, 85% of operating income came from the cable operations. And while people looking at Wright’s career tend to concentrate on his cable successes, it was during his tenure that NBC became “Must See TV,” and had the highest rated shows on the tube, including ""Cheers,"" ""Seinfeld,""  ""Friends"" and others.Wright retired in 2007. Since then he has been active with Autism Speaks, which he co-founded with his wife of 49 years, Suzanne.  He started the group, which sponsors research and creates awareness about autism, after his grandson, Christian, was diagnosed with the disease.Fought the conventional wisdom to bring NBC broadcast network into the cable ageOvercame: Risk aversion of parent company GE and skepticism of NBC and affiliate station executivesLesson: You got to know when to hold ‘em, but also when to fold ‘em.“I knew I couldn’t sell it (buying a 25% stake in Discovery Communications). That would have to wait. I had to keep picking my spots.”

30,DISCA,"Luke Bannister doesn't have to worry about paying for college anymore -- if he even decides he needs to go. At 16 years old, the U.K. drone racer has won a total of nearly $300,000 in two big events so far this year.Some $30,000 of that came just this past Sunday in Los Angeles, where Bannister smoked 11 other top pilots at the DR1 Invitational at the Sepulveda Dam.The kid, who is known as ""BanniUK"" to the drone racing community, is just one of many looking to make a living with the niche sport as the popularity of drones grows. Tommy ""UmmaGawd"" Tibajia quit his business consulting job at a Fortune 500 company to become a full-time pilot, sponsored by PepsiCo (PEP)-owned Mountain Dew. Tibajia won the 2015 Drone Nationals and the International Drone Racing Association (IDRA) California Cup in 2015.Other companies getting in on the ground floor of the sport are Amazon (AMZN)-owned Twitch, which live streams DR1 races. In addition to the DR1 Invitational's live stream, the event will be aired as a special on Discovery Communications' (DISCA) Discovery Channel.Many pilots use GoPro (GPRO) cameras, and have captured big followings by posting their in-flight videos on Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube.Disney's (DIS) ESPN is also involved. The sports network this spring announced a multiyear distribution deal with the IDRA, and the first big race to be showcased will be in early August in New York. You can bet Bannister will be there.He won the IDRA-sponsored World Drone Prix in Dubai this March, where his team captured a whopping $250,000.
"
31,DISCA,"Federal regulators opted to place no conditions related to John Malone’s sprawling media and telecom holdings in approving Charter Communication’s (CHTR) acquisitions of Time Warner Cable (TWC) (IBD) and Bright House Networks.California regulators are expected to approve Charter’s deals as soon as Thursday, the final hurdle to Charter’s makeover. Charter will leap to No. 2 in the cable TV industry, behind Comcast (CMCSA).Comcast owns NBCUniversal and NBCU-related conditions that the FCC imposed on Comcast in 2011, which are set to expire in 2018. NBCU's assets include the broadcast TV network, cable channels and a movie studio.Consumer group Public Knowledge, the American Cable Association and others asked the FCC to look into Malone’s holdings as part of the Charter review. Dish Network (DISH) waged the biggest fight against the TWC deal, while Netflix (NFLX) stayed on the sidelines.Malone controls Liberty Broadband (LBDRA), which will own about 18% of the new Charter and has rights to name three board members. Privately held media firm Advance/Newhouse will own about 13.5% of Charter. Liberty Broadband stock touched a record high for the second straight day on Wednesday.Malone holds a 28.7% voting interest in Discovery (DISCA); a 31.8% voting interest in Starz (STRZA); a 37.7% voting interest in the QVC Group, and a 3.3% voting interest in Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF), which holds a stake in Epix, according to the FCC.While much of Malone’s media holdings will now constitute Charter’s “affiliated programming,”  the FCC says it already has rules in place to govern those companies' relationships with other pay-TV providers.“Because New Charter will lack the incentive or ability to withhold or raise prices of affiliated programming, we further find it unnecessary to extend or modify our program access rules or impose other conditions on the licensing of New Charter’s affiliated content,” the FCC said in its May 6 order approving Charter’s acquisitions.The FCC’s conditions on Charter’s acquisitions aim to protect competition from Internet video providers such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.com (AMZN).Charter will not be allowed to charge data usage-based prices or impose data caps on broadband customers for seven years. Those conditions could impact Comcast if it makes more acquisitions.Some analysts have speculated that Malone could consolidate some of his media assets and/or acquire more.Malone also controls Liberty Global, a Europe-based telecom company.""Malone's ownership of distribution and content assets globally implicitly has a scale larger than even Comcast, but with a much more fragmented ownership structure and working relationships,"" said a Barclays report in January.
"
32,DISCA,"Now that John Malone’s Charter Communications (CHTR) has closed its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, analysts are focused on how much cash the new cable TV industry powerhouse will generate to boost shares.Bryan Kraft, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, says Charter could repurchase up to $5 billion in shares as soon as next year, on gains in its free cash flow — cash from operations minus capital expenditures, a key financial metric. But this estimate assumes the now No. 2 U.S. cable company will pause for breath after making its big acquisitions.“I would caveat this in saying that if Charter has other, more attractive opportunities to invest capital in growing its business either organically or through an acquisition, those opportunities would take priority,” Kraft told IBD.Charter could continue acquiring smaller cable TV companies, or even not-so-small Cox Communications, observers say. Charter might even team with Comcast (CMCSA) to acquire wireless firm T-Mobile US (TMUS), Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, told IBD.Wlodarczak, though, is among analysts that say Charter stock repurchases are in the cards, in any case.""Malone is all about massive share repurchase activity and M&A where it is attractive,"" said Wlodarczak, noting that Liberty Global (LBTYA) and some other Malone-controlled companies have buybacks underway. In its Q1 earnings report May 9, Liberty Global said it plans to repurchase $3.7 billion of its shares by the end of 2017.JPMorgan credit analyst Michael Pace, in a recent research report, also speculates that the new Charter will buy back shares -- if acquisitions don't get in the way. “We expect the company to begin a stock repurchase program in the 2017 time frame, assuming no meaningful M&A opportunities arise,” Pace wrote.Former TWC shareholders own about 45% of the new Charter. Only 1% of TWC shareholders opted to take Charter’s higher cash offer when the deal closed, choosing instead to own more Charter stock.From 2010 through Q1 2016, TWC spent $20.7 billion repurchasing its own stock, says Howard Silverblatt, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. That includes $1.32 billion in Q1. Charter bought back 12.7% of its stock in 2011, but that was before Malone took a big stake in the cable TV firm in early 2013.Malone founded U.S. cable firm Tele-Communications Inc. in the 1970s and convinced Wall Street to value high-capital-spending, debt-laden companies based on free cash flow rather than earnings. He sold TCI to AT&T (T) in 1998 for $52 billion.Charter’s $58 billion purchase of TWC closed on May 18, putting Malone back in the cable TV industry spotlight. Charter has morphed into the No. 2 cable TV firm, behind Comcast (CMCSA). Charter has about 21 million Internet customers and 17.5 million video customers. Charters rivals also include telecom leaders Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T).Malone’s Liberty Broadband (LBRDA) owns about 18% of the new Charter and has 25% of the voting power. Media company Advance/Newhouse has a 13% stake in the new company.Besides TWC, Charter also acquired Bright House, for $11 billion. Charter has about $57 billion in debt on its books, a mix of investment grade and high yield, including about $21 billion of debt assumed from TWC.Fitch Ratings estimates Charter will churn out $4 billion of pro-forma free cash flow in 2016 and 2017. Moody’s Investor Service’s estimate is $2.5 billion “going forward.”Standard & Poor’s says it expects Charter to pay “minimal cash taxes until 2019.” How so? Charter, which exited bankruptcy in 2009, holds some $3 billion in net operating losses as well as other federal tax credits that it plans to use to offset future taxes owed. That’ll boost free cash flow, analysts say.The tax savings might last through 2020, says Morgan Stanley.A big question is whether Charter, described in 2013 by Malone as a “horizontal acquisition machine,” will keep shopping. Analysts say that asset swaps are possible among Comcast, Charter and Europe-based Altice Group, which is buying two U.S. cable companies, SuddenLink and Cablevision Systems (CVC). Approval of the Cablevision deal is pending, while SuddenLink closed near year-end.Charter CEO Tom Rutledge, in a Bloomberg interview, said he’s focused on integrating New York-based TWC and Syracuse, N.Y.-based Bright House into the company. “I think we’ll take a breather,” Rutledge said on possible M&As. “We’ve just gone through two years of transactions and regulatory approval. We don’t have any new transactions in mind.”A lack of M&As would hike chances of stock buybacks.UBS, in a March report, speculated that if Charter keeps its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) at around four times debt, it’ll eventually be in a position to “fund the repurchase” of one-third of its stock float.Malone’s TCI and current Liberty group of companies has used free cash flow and debt to make acquisitions. Malone’s Liberty Global (LBTYA) is the biggest cable TV firm worldwide, with 24 million video subscribers in Europe and Latin America, where U.S. leader Comcast ended Q1 with 22.4 million cable TV subscribers.If Charter puts M&A on the back-burner, some analysts say Malone could consolidate some of his media assets or acquire more. Malone holds stakes in Discovery (DISCA), Starz, QVC Group and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF). Federal regulators did not place any Malone-related conditions involving content providers on Charter's TWC acquisition.Charter, meanwhile, aims to lower the programming fees it pays to companies such as Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA). Those fees will amount to about $9 billion pro-forma in 2016, said Rutledge. With more subscribers, the new Charter should be able to hammer out better deals with content providers.Charter faces a decision on what to do with TWC's legacy sports networks, especially the channel carrying Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games. Other pay-TV providers have not carried the channel, in a long-running dispute.

In all, 200 broadcast rights for 200 live games are up for grabs.

48,DISCA,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode. Europe-based InterXion Holding (INXN) could be targeted, says Oppenheimer.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018These Stunning Stats Reveal Epic Netflix-Amazon-Hulu-Apple War To Come2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year

91,DISCA,"Between Walt Disney (DIS) and NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) would rather sell some of its assets to the Mouse, according to Bloomberg.X Sources told the outlet that Disney is a better strategic fit that likely comes with less regulatory red tape. That follows a late-Friday report from the Wall Street Journal that Disney and Fox were back at the table to discuss the possible acquisition of some of Fox's assets, namely its movie and TV studio, and certain international and cable properties.Amid the Fox-fueled rally Monday, shares of Disney jumped as high as 7% on the stock market today to 112.67, briefly clearing a 110.93 buy point from a double-bottom base that has lows in July and September. The stock closed up 4.7% to 110.22, not far below that entry. Fox shares rose 2.8% to 33.09.Comcast made a definitive jump above its longer-term 200-day line; Journal sources say the conglomerate is also in active talks with Fox. Fox, Disney and Comcast all own 30% of streaming network Hulu.Verizon Communications (VZ) also has been bandied about as a potential wooer of Fox assets.IBD'S TAKE: In the right conditions, the W-shaped double-bottom base in a bull market can translate to solid gains.

"
93,DISCA,"Cable TV companies and media stocks sold off on renewed worries that pay TV cord-cutting is accelerating after AT&T (T) preannounced Q3 financial numbers, including the loss of 90,000 video subscribers.X""We believe cord-cutting continues to gain steam as streaming builds momentum,"" said UBS analyst John Hodulik in a report. He estimated that the pay TV industry will lose about 1 million subscribers in the third quarter compared with 325,000 in the same quarter last year, based on recent management commentary.AT&T plunged 6.1% to close at 35.86 on the stock market today. AT&T also blamed recent hurricanes for video subscriber losses. Comcast (CMCSA), which in early September warned of video subscriber losses, shed 3.3% to 36.19.Comcast had attributed some of its video subscriber weakness to aggressive promotions launched by AT&T's landline ""U-verse""-branded TV service. Analysts say AT&T's DirecTV satellite TV service likely suffered the bulk of its subscriber losses in the third quarter.Shares in satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) fell 5.1% to 49.03 on Thursday. While AT&T bought DirecTV for $49 billion in 2016, analysts say Dish has had trouble finding a suitor amid continued subscriber losses.Both AT&T and Dish have launched internet video services. AT&T said it added 300,000 online DirecTV Now subscribers in the third quarter, offsetting some of the traditional pay TV losses. However, both AT&T and Dish garner less profit from internet services than traditional pay TV, analysts say.While AT&T is losing a net 90,000 video subscribers, it's traditional pay TV customer losses in third quarter are higher — 390,000 — partially offset by the addition of 300,000 internet video subscribers.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.UBS estimates that Dish's Sling service has 1.8 million subscribers and DirecTV Now 760,000. YouTube, the video website of Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, launched a livestreaming TV service in early 2017.So did Hulu, a joint venture of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast and Time Warner (TWX). UBS estimates that YouTube has 180,000 subscribers; Hulu has 175,000.Shares in Charter Communications (CHTR) fell 2.6% to 355.71 on Thursday. Altice USA (ATUS) slipped 2.7% to 25.15.Worries over accelerated cord-cutting also hit media stocks. That's because they garner per-subscriber programming fees from cable-TV and satellite-TV companies. Disney fell 1.6% to 96.93, CBS (CBS) slipped 1% to 56.51, and Discovery Communications (DISCA) shed 3.6% to 19.28.AT&T also disclosed that wireless customers upgraded to new smartphones at a slower rate in the September quarter vs. the year-earlier period, sparking speculation over tepid demand for Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8.Apple stock edged down 0.4% to 156.RELATED:AT&T Stock Falls, Near Key Level For Time Warner DealCan Google's YouTube TV Hit 2 Million Subscribers In A Year?Dish Bulls And Bears Agree On One Thing: What's Coming In Q3

94,DISCA,"Neither Google nor Hulu's owners have disclosed subscriber numbers for their live TV streaming services, but Morgan Stanley says their success is helping give media companies a lift amid cable TV ""cord-cutting.""XBenjamin Swinburne, a Morgan Stanley analyst, estimates in a note to clients that Hulu Live has some 250,000 online subscribers while YouTube TV has 400,000. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google launched YouTube TV on April 5; Hulu Live started on May 3.But incumbent pay-TV companies AT&T (T) and Dish Network (DISH) have the most TV streaming subscribers and are adding to those numbers. Leichtman Research Group estimates that Dish's Sling-branded web streaming service has 1.68 million subscribers, including 240,000 added in the September quarter. AT&T's DirecTV Now service has 787,000 subscribers, including nearly 300,000 added in the third quarter.""At the margin, new virtual (streaming) adoption is a growing offset to traditional declines,"" Swinburne said in the report.AT&T has bundled its DirecTV Now streaming service with wireless products. Satellite TV broadcaster Dish also has not disclosed subscriber numbers.Cord-cutting, a term for consumers that cancel monthly pay-TV subscriptions, is still growing. LRG says the top six cable companies lost about 290,000 video subscribers in the third quarter of 2017, compared with a loss of about 90,000 subscribers a year earlier. Satellite TV services lost 475,000 subscribers vs. a gain of about 5,000 subscribers a year earlier.That's bad news for providers of content. Media companies such as Walt Disney (DIS), Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Time Warner (TWX) garner per-subscriber fees from pay-TV providers.Morgan Stanley's Swinburne, though, says media firms are getting a lift from the subscriber gains of Hulu Live, YouTube TV, Sling and DirecTV Now – even if per-subscriber revenue is lower than pay TV.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Google on Oct. 30 launched a new TV app for YouTube's streaming service, which could boost subscriber growth, analysts say.Hulu's parents are 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Disney, Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner.

97,DISCA,"Discovery Communications (DISCA) agreed to buy Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) for $11.9 billion in a bet that uniting ownership of cable channels like Animal Planet and HGTV will help the company adapt to the changing television landscape.Discovery, one of billionaire John Malone's key holdings, will acquire Scripps for about $90 a share and assume long-term debt of $2.7 billion, bringing the total price of the equity value plus liabilities to $14.6 billion, according to a statement Monday. The price represents a 34% premium over Scripps' closing price of $67.02 on July 18, the day before news of the companies' talks became known.Discovery, based in Silver Spring, Maryland, is grappling with shrinking audiences at some U.S. channels — including the Discovery channel and Animal Planet — as consumers drop cable subscriptions and get more entertainment online from Netflix (NFLX) and others. The deal combines two companies that specialize in so-called unscripted programming, focused on real-life adventures, travel, wildlife and home. With Scripps, Discovery gets the home-improvement channel HGTV, where hits like ""Property Brothers"" and ""Fixer Upper"" have made it one of the more popular cable networks.The combined company will have almost 20% of the ad-supported pay-TV viewership in the U.S., according to the statement. Buying Scripps could also help Discovery boost its international sales, which currently account for half of its annual revenue. Knoxville, Tennessee-based Scripps owns an interest in Polish TV operator TVN and is expanding HGTV to new countries.""This agreement with Discovery presents an unmatched opportunity for Scripps to grow its leading lifestyle brands across the world and on new and emerging channels including short-form, direct-to-consumer and streaming platforms,"" Scripps Chief Executive Officer Kenneth W. Lowe said in the statement.Discovery's offer had forced Viacom (VIAB) to abandon its own efforts to acquire Scripps, people with direct knowledge of the matter said last week.Scripps rose 1.25% to 88 before the opening bell in the stock market today. Discovery Communications dipped 0.4% to 26.69.After being left out of some new online TV packages in the U.S., Discovery has been looking to create a low-cost web-only TV service with its cable channels and those of others for consumers who don't want to pay for sports, people with knowledge of the matter said in April. Neither Discovery or Scripps broadcasts live sports in the U.S.Though smaller, Scripps has an especially valuable asset in HGTV, which was the fourth-most watched U.S. network in prime time this year, with an average of 1.51 million viewers a night through July 16, according to Nielsen data. Parties to the Scripps Family Agreement control 92% of the voting stock.Deal talk is picking up in the TV industry as network owners grapple with the decline in cable and satellite services amid online competition. Liberty Media's Malone also has discussed a deal to buy all or part of Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Holdings, according to people familiar with the matter.Pay-TV distributors like Charter Communications (CHTR) and AT&T (T) have grown through acquisitions in recent years, giving them added leverage in fee negotiations with channel owners like Viacom, Discovery and Scripps. That's led some network owners to conclude they need to sell as well. Time Warner (TWX), owner of TNT and HBO, agreed last year to be bought by AT&T (T) for $85.4 billion.Cable and satellite-TV providers pay fees to channel owners for the right to carry their channels, and the negotiations have grown more tense now that more pay-TV subscribers are cutting the cord.Network owners are also beginning to offer their own online services to compete with Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned YouTube and Netflix. CBS (CBS) offers its flagship network and Showtime as standalone services online. Walt Disney (DIS), which owns ESPN, is developing an online service to reach sports fans who aren't using traditional cable.RELATED:Is Softbank Eyeing Charter Bid, Shotgun Marriage For Sprint?

197,DISCA,"Shares in Charter Communications (CHTR) and its biggest shareholder, John Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBDRA), edged down on Thursday amid more reports that French telecom Altice Group is readying a bid for Charter, the No. 2 U.S. cable TV firm behind Comcast (CMCSA).XShares in Charter have gained 38% in 2017 — spurred on by reports over the months that Verizon Communications (VZ), Sprint (S)-owner SoftBank Group and now Altice are interested in buying it. Some analysts say Comcast looms as another potential buyer.Media baron and cable TV industry pioneer Malone is key to whatever happens, says Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, in a report. Malone's Liberty Broadband owns a 20% in Charter, holds voting rights and has two board members.""Charter will not do a deal that is bad for Malone,"" said Chaplin. ""We assume Malone would never do a deal that is good for him and bad for public shareholders; however, he wouldn't do a deal that is not in his interests, even if some public shareholders may prefer it to the status quo.""Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, said in a report published Thursday that ""(Liberty) has the power to dictate Charter's free cash flow and (merger) path.""Altice founder Patrick Drahi, much like Malone and Softbank founder Masayoshi Son during their business careers, has used debt-fueled deals to build up Altice. Altice owns French wireless firm SFR and much more.Altice USA (ATUS) went public in June. It gobbled up Cablevision Systems and Suddenlink.Altice, however, missed out on a bigger deal. When federal regulators thwarted Comcast's proposed acquisition of Time Warner in early 2015, it was Charter that quickly nailed down a deal with TWC as Altice looked on.Now Altice is back, but Malone may not be ready to cede control. In the media industry, Malone-controlled Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGFA) also are viewed as consolidators.IBD'S TAKE: Comcast stock has climbed 18% in 2017. Comcast has formed a cup chart pattern and is approaching a buy point of 42.28. Comcast split its stock 2:1 earlier this year. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.In January, Malone suggested that Comcast and Charter could attempt a merger during the Trump administration. In May, Comcast and Charter formed a wireless pact.""We have no doubt that Comcast has considered an acquisition of Charter, nor do we doubt that Charter would view this deal as very compelling,"" added Chaplin. ""We believe both management teams are very wary of the long-term regulatory risk. We believe the management teams are likely more concerned about their treatment under the next administration than they are about getting a deal approved under this administration.""RELATED:Sprint CEO: Merger Announcement Should Be Coming In Near FutureComcast, Charter Forge Wireless Alliance, Fuel Merger SpeculationThink Your Wireless Carrier Is Planning A Merger?

No. 1 cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA), when reported earnings on July 27, downplayed its interest in acquiring a wireless firm.

254,DISCA,"X Maybe honesty isn't always the best policy? Walt Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Bob Iger slogged through an array of ESPN-related questions on late Tuesday's earnings call after the sports cable giant logged another quarter of subscriber declines. His bullish reaffirmations hearkened back to calls of earnings past, after he first disclosed in August 2015 that ESPN had sustained subscriber losses.""Give us a little bit of credit for being very candid with you on an earnings call two summers ago,"" he told analysts, asserting that ""we had our eyes wide open"" about ESPN's issues, which allowed the company to deal with them head-on.Disney shares fell in late trade after ending Tuesday's regular session up 0.6% to 112.07 on the stock market today.Overall, Disney turned in a mixed quarter, falling short of second-quarter revenue forecasts late Tuesday with 3% growth to $13.34 billion. Profit of $1.50 per share marked a 10% year-over-year gain, ahead of estimates for 4% EPS growth.The entertainment heavyweight's media networks revenue, which includes both broadcast and cable TV, rose 3%, while operating income fell 3%. Programming costs also weighed on ESPN; cable networks' operating income fell 3%. The Disney Channels and Freeform, which appeal to children, teens and young adults, also lost subscribers during that period.Iger has his eyes on the future, as more people get their sports scores and highlights from mobile devices.While ""there's nothing we can really do to slow that down,"" he said it's important for the network to participate in the new wave of technology. That's translated to development of ESPN's apps, its upcoming streaming platform powered by BAMTech and the network's presence on over-the-top ""skinny"" bundles, which Iger says benefit from the inclusion of ESPN.""They've concluded that launching without ESPN is very challenged,"" he said on the call, adding, however, that despite ""really nice growth,"" subscriber growth on streaming platforms has not made up for traditional cable-package subscriber losses.ESPN found itself in the headlines late last month when it laid off around 100 on-air personalities, another reminder of the troubles facing the traditional pay TV landscape.""We're not sitting on our hands,"" said Iger.Disney's TV woes aside, Iger predictably lauded the studio's many box office successes, calling attention to ""Rogue One"" and ""Beauty and the Beast,"" each of which have brought in at least $1 billion globally.Still, theatrical results were only ""comparable"" to the prior-year quarter due to the strength of ""The Force Awakens"" and ""Zootopia"" in 2016, according to the earnings release. Studio revenue dipped 1%, while operating income grew 21%.The theme parks segment logged the greatest revenue growth, up 9%. Operating income grew 20%, thanks to higher attendance and more spending on food and drink.Lastly, revenue at Disney's consumer products and interactive media unit dropped 11%, as strong ""Frozen"" and ""Star Wars"" sales last year provided tough comparisons. Operating income grew 3%.Up until last week, shares had been on a fairly steady upward march, making their way back up to 2015 highs. But Disney tumbled last week, falling below a buy point and its 50-day moving average.That was part of a broader media stock sell-off, spurred by sector jitters about ad revenue and subscriber losses following quarterly results from Viacom (VIAB), Time Warner (TWX) and others, plus the introduction of Hulu's live-TV beta service. (Disney is a joint owner of Hulu.)Broadly, investors appear to remain nervous about the power of cord-cutting and the state of the traditional pay TV system.During the session, Viacom fell 0.5%, while Time Warner sank 0.3%. 21st Century Fox (FOXA), which will report earnings on Wednesday, dipped 0.6%.Discovery Communications' (DISCA) results Tuesday revealed a ""slight decline"" in subscribers in its U.S. networks segment.

257,DISCA,"A Republican-led FCC may give AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon Communications (VZ) and other pay TV providers more tools to counter the threat from Google TV, Hulu and other nascent internet video services, says a Cowen & Co. analyst.Ajit Pai, named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission by President Trump in January, has signaled that he'll scale back net neutrality rules that bar internet service providers from throttling, blocking or prioritizing web traffic. Under the Obama administration, the FCC sought more authority under utility-type regulations.Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says ""MVPDs"" a regulatory term for pay TV incumbents, could seek interconnection fees from YouTube TV or Hulu. Gallant warned that MVPDs like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon might tap other tools to counter the threat from internet video services, also called over-the-top, or OTT, services. Broadband caps on data usage are another possibility, Gallant says.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) on Tuesday announced YouTube TV, a $35 monthly paid subscription service. YouTube TV will offer access to all four major broadcast networks (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox), and the cable channel offerings owned by their parent companies, such as sports channel ESPN.IBD'S TAKE: Quanta Services, Primerica and Nucor are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Google aims to set itself apart with unlimited cloud storage for users to record content. Google will seek advertising revenue from YouTube TV, say analysts, who contend that $35 monthly fees might not be enough to make the service profitable.Hulu — a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), Fox-parent 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast's NBCUniversal — is set to launch yet another live TV streaming service in the spring.""With the rising OTT threat and a newly Republican Washington, MVPDs may now have greater incentive and ability to employ tactics to manage the threat from OTT,"" Gallant said in a research report. ""Whether they take these steps — and whether it draws influential companies like Google, Facebook (FB), Walt Disney, Fox and others into the net neutrality debate — could be important for the longer-term balance of power within the internet ecosystem.""""We suspect the new FCC will be much more open to ISPs charging interconnection fees to high bandwidth services, mainly video providers,"" Gallant added.He says Google could respond by imposing a ""Cable Company X Tax"" on its subscribers.YouTube TV will compete with other internet video services, such as AT&T's DirecTV Now and Dish Network's (DISH) Sling. YouTube TV does not provide channels from Viacom (VIA), Time Warner's (TWX) Turner Broadcasting, Discovery (DISCA) , AMC Networks (AMCX) and Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI).Alphabet stock slipped a small fraction in the stock market today to 849.08 and is about flat since the YouTube streaming announcement.RELATED:$35 DirecTV Now Live Streaming Deals Lives On After Promotion EndsAT&T Streaming Foray Hits Snag; Did Apple Avoid Black Eye?Google Advertising Plans Key In YouTube TV Launch Vs.

Liberty Global (LBTYA) is the biggest cable TV player in Europe.""There are very few companies with a $150 billion market cap with so little of their revenue coming from outside the U.S.,"" Burke said. ""We see it as a huge opportunity. I think whether it's M&A activity or organic growth, international is a huge opportunity for us and it's something we'll pursue over the next five to 10 years.""Comcast also is building a $3.3 billion Universal theme park in Beijing with local partners.Burke said NBCU garners some 20% of revenue internationally. Discovery Communications (DISCA), with 51% of 2014 revenue outside the U.S., has the most international exposure. Fox (FOXA) garnered 33% of revenue outside America, followed by Time Warner (TWX) at 30%, Viacom (VIA) at 26% and Disney at 25%. Growing international revenue is key for media firms amid falling TV ratings and advertising woes, says MoffettNathanson.Burke said Comcast is interested in acquiring more live sports content and is investing in new content for millennials as video viewing habits shift to the Internet.

One big question is how much Google-owned YouTube's advertising revenue will grow as it adds live TV and original content for paid subscription services.Google on Tuesday took the wraps off YouTube TV, which will be ""available soon in the largest U.S. markets and will quickly expand to cover more cities across the country,"" the company said in a blog.YouTube TV will compete with other internet video services, such as AT&T's (T) DirecTV Now and Dish Network's (DISH) Sling. Hulu — a joint venture of Disney (DIS), Fox parent 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal — is set to launch yet another live TV streaming service in the spring.YouTube TV will offer access to all four major broadcast networks (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox), and the cable channel offerings owned by their parent companies, such as sports channel ESPN. Missing from the content lineup, though, are channels from Viacom (VIA), Time Warner's (TWX) Turner Broadcasting, Discovery (DISCA), AMC Networks (AMCX) and Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI).YouTube TV starts at $35 monthly, similar to AT&T's DirecTV Now service, but it's unclear whether YouTube's will eke out profits even with fewer channels. Alphabet stock rose 1.4% to 856.75 in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Alphabet stock is up 8% in 2017 and has cleared an 824.40 buy point from a cup-with-handle base.

347,DISCA,"Verizon Communications (VZ) and media baron John Malone's Charter Communications (CHTR) are exploring a merger, according to multiple reports Thursday.Media baron Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBRDA) is the biggest shareholder in Charter, which acquired Time Warner Cable in 2015, emerging as the No. 2 cable TV firm behind Comcast (CMCSA). Malone and Liberty Media's assets include stakes in Discovery (DISCA), Starz, QVC Group and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF). Malone is chairman of Liberty Media.In Europe, Malone-controlled cable TV firm Liberty Global (LBTYA) has forged partnerships with wireless firms such as Vodafone Group (VOD). Liberty Global and Vodafone backed away from merger talks in 2015, however. Malone, a cable TV industry pioneer, led Tele-Communications Inc. in the 1980s and 90s. The old AT&T acquired TCI in 1999, and most of its assets eventually were sold off to cable firms.Charter stock shot up 7.4% to close at 333.15 in the stock market today, at a record high for the fifth straight trading day as M&A rumors have swirled in the communications services field. Verizon shares ended 1.3% lower Thursday. Verizon stock slumped 4.4% Tuesday on disappointing 2017 guidance and is trading at two-month lows.The Wall Street Journal initially reported that Verizon had approached Charter, with the Financial Times following up by saying the companies have hired advisors for merger talks.IBD'S TAKE: Seacoast Banking, Inphi, GrubHub and NetEase are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters.Speculation over Verizon-Charter negotiations first surfaced in mid-December. Verizon's CEO Lowell McAdam told sell-side analysts in a meeting that a merger would make ""industrial sense.""Verizon also has been linked to Dish Network (DISH), which had wireless assets but needs a partner. Dish stock lost 6.8% Thursday on the Charter report.Charter and Comcast have an agreement to lease access to Verizon's wireless network on a wholesale basis. Comcast plans to launch wireless services in mid-2017.Merging with a cable TV firm would dovetail with Verizon's strategy to launch 5G wireless services. 5G services require connections to fiber-optic networks in dense urban areas.""We believe a combination of Verizon and Charter is feasible but difficult on the financials, but Comcast's overall size and NBC ownership make a deal with Verizon a nonstarter as the regulatory review process would likely be quite difficult,"" JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick wrote Monday in a broad research report on telecom industry M&A scenarios.Speaking at a Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. investor event in early January, Malone speculated that cable firms could buy T-Mobile US (TMUS).

"
412,DISCA,"Three years ago, the New York Times was already writing headlines like ""A Late-Adopter to the Cupcake Phenomenon."" But specialty cupcake stores kept proliferating, a long time after Manhattan's Magnolia Bakery was credited with starting the craze in 1996.
"
413,DISCA,"""The cupcake business has been really steady; it's stayed the same,"" said Katherine Kallinis Berman. She's half of the team of sisters that runs Georgetown Cupcake in Washington, D.C., and this week pre-opened a new branch in Beverly Hills, Calif., to much fanfare. ""Even when times are tough, it's not hard to splurge on a cupcake, which is only $2.75, but it really is a gourmet cupcake.""
"
414,DISCA,"""Facebook (FB) and Twitter are two really great resources for us,"" Berman said, adding that they've helped build a fan base for the store's more than 100 cupcake flavors from Butterscotch Pudding to Lavender Earl Grey Teacake. Though it doesn't hurt that the sisters have a TV show, DC Cupcakes, on Discovery Communications' (DISCA) TLC.

Hostess Brands has made Twinkies cakelets — ""golden sponge cake with creamy filling"" — since they were invented in 1930.

But it certainly didn't take long for 1,985 eBay (EBAY) auctions to pop up selling boxes of Twinkies to distraught fans, including at prices as high as $5 million — with free shipping.Twinkies maker Hostess Brands is going out of business but designer cupcake startups might have staying power, fueled in part by social media.Three years ago, the New York Times was already writing headlines like ""A Late-Adopter to the Cupcake Phenomenon."" But specialty cupcake stores kept proliferating, a long time after Manhattan's Magnolia Bakery was credited with starting the craze in 1996.""The cupcake business has been really steady; it's stayed the same,"" said Katherine Kallinis Berman. She's half of the team of sisters that runs Georgetown Cupcake in Washington, D.C., and this week pre-opened a new branch in Beverly Hills, Calif., to much fanfare. ""Even when times are tough, it's not hard to splurge on a cupcake, which is only $2.75, but it really is a gourmet cupcake.""""Facebook (FB) and Twitter are two really great resources for us,"" Berman said, adding that they've helped build a fan base for the store's more than 100 cupcake flavors from Butterscotch Pudding to Lavender Earl Grey Teacake. Though it doesn't hurt that the sisters have a TV show, DC Cupcakes, on Discovery Communications' (DISCA) TLC. Nor that cupcake blogs and Pinterest boards clog the arteries of the Internet, keeping the dream alive and iced. Blog directory Technorati counts 459 blogs relating to cupcakes out of 14,197 food blogs.The average food blogger has 763 Twitter followers, while the most active 10% have an average of 4,656 each, according to a 694-person food blogging survey in February by Foodista and Zephyr Adventures. The bloggers cited an average of 817 Facebook fans and likes and the top 10% an average of 6,059.Georgetown Cupcake, which opened branches in New York and Boston earlier this year, claims 56,409 Twitter followers and 212,719 Facebook likes. The small-business bakers egged on interest during election season with a cupcake pool.""The Democrats were ahead by 10% the entire time,"" Berman said. ""I don't know if we could tell which way the election was going, but we could tell which party had the bigger sweet tooth.""Food trucks, too, have benefited from social networking and general hipness. A few years ago, Rutgers University professor Kathe Newman set about charting New York City gentrification by how many new cupcake stores opened in an area. This year, an issue of the Journal of Urban Design featured a study by Ginette Wessel noting that ""place, social media and mobility in this food truck phenomenon are the basis for a methodological approach that aims to uncover new social dynamics occurring in cities.""The fate of iconic mass-market cupcakes is far different from that of some select pricey-cupcake entrepreneurs. Hostess Brands has made Twinkies cakelets — ""golden sponge cake with creamy filling"" — since they were invented in 1930. Production reportedly ceased Friday as the bankrupt food company sought court permission to end business after failing to get the wage and benefit cuts it sought from thousands of striking workers. A hearing was set for Monday.Twinkies might have had their heyday long before the arrival of the Internet and social media fandom. But it certainly didn't take long for 1,985 eBay (EBAY) auctions to pop up selling boxes of Twinkies to distraught fans, including at prices as high as $5 million — with free shipping.

426,DISCA,"Discovery Communications (DISCA) stock jumped Monday on speculation that the multichannel television producer is a takeover target.A report late Sunday by the Australian Financial Review said that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) held preliminary merger talks with Discovery about two weeks ago. A Fox spokesperson responded to the article, saying, ""The story is categorically untrue."" Discovery declined to comment.The idea that Discovery might be in play excited Wall Street.""If the parties, as they maintain, are not talking, we think they ought to have a chat,"" Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger said in a research note Monday. ""We believe a merger between FOXA and DISCA would make strategic sense on a number of levels.""Discovery owns such channels as Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and Science, with such popular shows as ""Gold Rush,"" ""Deadliest Catch"" and ""MythBusters.""The combination of Discovery and Fox would create a dominant player in international cable networks, he said. It would allow for a natural combination of the Discovery Channel and Fox's National Geographic channels, as well as Fox's Sky Sports networks and Discovery's Eurosport in Europe, Juenger said.Discovery stock was up 5% in midday trading on the stock market today, near 32.50. It had been up as much as 9% in morning trading but has been in a downtrend since August.On Thursday, Discovery reported its first year-over-year decline in earnings per share in eight quarters. Sales growth was the slowest for the company in seven quarters.In the December quarter, Discovery earned 38 cents a share, down 7% from the year-earlier quarter, on sales of $1.68 billion, up 9%.

428,DISCA,"New Internet television services from Dish Network (DISH), Sony and possibly Apple are unlikely to please either potential cable TV cord-cutters or cord nevers, Bernstein Research said in a report Thursday.The over-the-top video services announced or rumored so far are too narrow for existing pay-TV subscribers and are too expensive for people who have opted not to subscribe to traditional pay-TV services, Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger said in the report.His findings were based on comments made at focus groups in New York City and San Francisco. The groups were composed of people who identified themselves as ""highly likely to cut the cord in the next six months,"" as well as people who felt just the opposite.Based on the focus groups, Juenger is pessimistic on the prospects for Sling TV from Dish Network, PlayStation Vue from Sony (SNE) and a rumored Apple (AAPL) TV service.""A strong body of evidence is emerging that suggests to us that none of these services are likely to gain much traction,"" he said. ""Simply put, for existing pay-TV subscribers, the content is too limited (relative to the cost savings); and for cord-nevers, the price is too high (relative to the appeal of the content).""The OTT services are handicapped by having fewer networks in order to achieve a lower price, but not enough networks to make the service appealing.""Cord-cutting, in large numbers, isn't likely to happen,"" Juenger said. ""It's one of those ideas that sounds great in the abstract but crumbles when faced with the reality. OTT services seem poised to garner few subscribers, which is more good news than bad. We believe it's better for the pay-TV ecosystem to remain in the status quo than to add millions of OTT subscribers at the cost of blowing the whole system apart.""One of the big problems with ""skinny"" TV bundles is that individuals differ on what the ideal package of networks should be.Content Companies Cutting InAs Dish and others are putting together online programming bundles, some content companies are making stand-alone subscription video-on-demand services. These include Time Warner 's (TWX) HBO Go service, set to launch next month on Apple TV hardware; CBS All Access; and Nickelodeon's Noggin from parent Viacom (VIAB).Complicating matters even more are subscription streaming video services like Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Hulu, which offer original programming as well as licensed TV shows and movies.The concept of over-the-top television is appealing because many people hate their cable TV providers but are stuck with them unless an effective alternative emerges.""The vitriol toward the cable companies was intense"" in the focus groups, Juenger said. ""A surprising number of participants are currently subscribing to pay-TV only because it is actually cheaper than buying high-speed Internet on its own.""Bernstein rates Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner as outperform.It rates AMC Networks (AMCX), CBS (CBS), Discovery Communications (DISCA), and Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) as market perform; and Viacom as underperform.RELATED:Apple building new set-top box for its Internet TV serviceSony pursues cord cutters with over-the-top TV service.

457,DISCA,"Apple (AAPL) has been trying for years to break into the Internet television business with plans to offer a package of basic cable channels that could serve as an alternative to traditional pay-TV services. But Apple hasn't been able to secure the content deals needed to make it happen.Now that Dish Network (DISH) and Sony (SNE) have blazed a trail with such services, Apple once again is looking to enter the over-the-top television business. Apple is now negotiating with TV programmers and has shown demos of its proposed service, Re/code reported Wednesday.Apple's talks with TV programmers are at an early stage, and details like pricing and timing still need to be worked out, Re/code said.Meanwhile, Apple's streaming video box, the Apple TV, is overdue for an upgrade. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company hasn't come out with a new version of the $99 set-top box in two years.Dish Network began rolling out its Sling TV service last month after earning rave reviews with its introduction at the 2015 International CES show in Las Vegas.For $20 a month, Sling TV will deliver live sports, lifestyle, family, news and information channels, video-on-demand entertainment and the best of online video to broadband-connected devices at home and on the go. The base package includes 12 channels: ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, ABC Family and CNN. Dish also will sell add-on packs costing $5 a month focused on sports, news and kids channels.Sony's PlayStation Vue will launch soon with about 75 channels from CBS (CBS), Discovery Communications (DISCA), Fox (FOXA), NBCUniversal, Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) and Viacom (VIAB).

459,DISCA,"Time Warner's (TWX) upcoming negotiations to renew programming deals with pay-TV service operators will be key for the media and entertainment giant's growth prospects, analysts say.Time Warner, which on Wednesday reported Q4 earnings that topped estimates, has upcoming talks with Comcast (CMCSA), satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) and Time Warner Cable (TWC). Federal regulators are reviewing the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger.""The pivotal question for Time Warner investors is whether management will successfully complete the U.S. affiliate deals in 2015 needed to drive a dramatic acceleration,"" said UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson in a research report. ""We expect TWX will be successful with renewals.""Analysts say that the biggest content providers — such as Time Warner, Walt Disney (DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) — may have an edge over smaller programmers as pay-TV distributors look to lower programming costs.Pay-TV companies are shifting to slimmer programming packages, offering consumers fewer channels either in new ""over-the-top"" Internet video services or in ""broadband-first"" deals. To target cord cutters looking for ""a la carte"" packages, Comcast, Cox Communications and AT&T (T) have stepped up promotions of cheaper, $40 to $50 monthly plans that feature high-speed Internet and basic TV — without ESPN, Discovery (DISCA) and other high-cost channels.Larger content firms have a better chance of having their cable networks included in slimmed down TV packages, analysts say. That's why Viacom (VIA) and CBS (CBS) are reportedly exploring a merger to gain more negotiating clout.""(Time Warner's) outlook for growth beyond 2015 appears much more reliant on a meaningful acceleration in revenue growth, which is likely to require successful renegotiation of the last two major domestic (pay-TV) deals and highly successful box office performance,"" said Andy Hargreaves, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a report. Time Warner owns the Warner Brothers film studio.Dish Network has rolled out a new TV Web-only offering called Sling. It's called ""skinny"" because the satellite TV broadcaster's Web-based offering includes only 12 channels, but for just $20 monthly.Dish's deal includes programming from Disney, Time Warner's Turner network, Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) and AMC Network (AMCX). Left out of the Dish Sling TV package were the big four national TV networks — ABC, CBS, Fox and Comcast's NBCUniversal — as well as cable channels from CBS, Discovery, Fox, NBCU and Viacom.Some media firms plan to go it alone with their own Web offerings. Time Warner plans to sell HBO on the Webin 2015, and CBS has launched a subscription streaming service. The Web streaming services target young adults and other consumers that ""cut the cord,"" industry jargon for the growing number of people that disconnect pay-TV service in favor of more affordable online video options and on-demand content.

491,DISCA,"Hasbro's (HAS) hand in the entertainment industry helped it leverage action-hero hits to increase product sales in the third quarter as the toy maker reported earnings that edged analyst expectations.Earnings climbed 11.5% to $1.46 a share, excluding a $11.6 million pre-tax charge related to its Hub Network joint venture. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting EPS of $1.45.Revenue increased 7.3% to $1.47 billion, in line with views.Shares rose 4% to 56 in the stock market today. Hasbro has a Relative Strength rating of 78, meaning its shares currently outperforming 78% of all stocks on the market.The boys category captured 32.6% of Hasbro's quarterly revenue at $478.5 million, a 22% surge from last year. Hasbro credits the growth to Transformers, Marvel, Star Wars and Nerf toys.Hasbro's action figure sales benefited from several 2014 blockbusters, with the premiere of ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" on June 27, just days before the start of the third quarter.This year has also been a big year for Marvel movies, with the most recent film, ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" hitting theaters Aug. 1. And while not premiering in the third quarter, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" movies were released in April and May, respectively, giving Hasbro more opportunities to sell those toys in the third quarter, as their movies make the transition to DVD and Blu-ray.Revenue for the girls segment rose only 5% from last year to $407.7 million, but Hasbro made a deal with Disney (DIS) in late September to make dolls based on the popular animated movie ""Frozen"" and other Disney Princess stories, a blow to rival Mattel (MAT). Starting in 2016, global rights to the dolls transfer from the Barbie maker to Hasbro.In addition to the big screen, Hasbro has also used the small screen to garner more attention for its toy characters. Hasbro has a TV joint venture with Discovery Communications (DISCA), previously called Hub Network, which was renamed Discovery Family Channel on Oct. 13. The deal also reduced Hasbro's stake in the partnership from 50% to 40%.The new name and new structure will help the company ""broaden its programming focus to serve families in primetime"" and continue to show Hasbro Studios children's content in daytime, according to the company. The restructuring of Hasbro's investment led to a pre-tax charge of $11.6 million, or 6 cents a share, in Q3.During the quarter, Hasbro repurchased 2.4 million shares at an average price of $52.56 per share, costing the company $124.5 million and bringing its total share repurchases for the first nine months of 2014 to 6.4 million.The company did not issue any forward-looking statements in its press release, but said in its conference call with analysts that it has ""entered the holiday season well-positioned.""Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter: @IBD_AWilliams.

"
605,DISCA,"He says Google's entry into Kansas City isn't a serious threat to Time Warner Cable, because the cable firm has only about 100,000 subscribers there, or less than 1% of its U.S. customer base.

"
618,DISCA,"""Google might be able to leverage YouTube, which is increasingly offering more professionally produced content,"" said Jayant.Content, especially sports, looms as a game-changer as Google (GOOG) jumps into the pay-TV business.Google is ramping up high-speed Internet and TV service in Kansas City, where Time Warner Cable (TWC) is the biggest incumbent service provider.In Kansas City, Google has built an advanced fiber-optic network, capable of delivering a gigabit-per-second broadband service to homes, 100 times faster than what most U.S. households get.Google said in a corporate blog on Sunday that 180 out of 202 Kansas City neighborhoods, what it calls ""fiberhoods,"" are eligible to get its services.Analysts estimate some 24,000 city residents pre-registered with Google for its service, after a push by community groups. Consumers put down a $10 deposit to register. Google says it will extend its network first to neighborhoods with the highest percentage of homes pre-registered for service.But Google still faces a big challenge acquiring TV content that's competitive with the fare offered by Time Warner Cable and other local pay-TV providers, such as AT&T (T), analysts say.Google's TV lineup initially included channels from Viacom (VIA), Discovery (DISCA), Starz and NBC Universal, controlled by Comcast (CMCSA).

622,DISCA,"The rise of original programs on Internet-based streaming video services will drive content costs higher as competition heats up between the services and traditional cable TV networks, says Standard & Poor's in a report.Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Hulu have stepped up spending on original shows, aiming to create hits that attract more online viewers. Yahoo (YHOO) and Microsoft (MSFT) also are looking to make an impact in online video with original TV shows.The so-called ""OTT,"" or ""over-the-top,"" video providers are vying for content vs. the four national TV broadcast networks as well as cable TV channels such as Time Warner's (TWX) HBO; Comcast's (CMCSA) USA Network and Syfy; AMC Networks (AMCX); and Discovery (DISCA).""OTT providers have the potential to disrupt margin and growth potential of cable networks, and we believe that over the longer term they will,"" said the S&P report. ""OTT providers and cable networks are already bidding for the same shows. For example, both HBO and Netflix bid for 'True Detective,' which HBO ultimately won. Heightened competition for original content will drive content costs higher.""Movie studios Lionsgate Entertainment (LGF) and DreamWorks Animation (DWA) are among content producers benefiting from increased demand from customers such as Amazon and Netflix, analysts say.While cable networks are competing for original content, they are getting a boost from licensing older shows to Internet video providers, notes S&P analyst Andy Liu.Liu said Google's YouTube is ""creating an ecosystem of its own"" and also poses a threat to cable TV channels and broadcasters.As millennials, the generation now ages 18 to 30, grow older, the threat to the cable TV system ecosystem will increase, says S&P.""We believe the threat posed by OTT providers to traditional cable networks is real, but likely will be evident only over a longer time horizon. We believe that cable networks will increase their investments in original content and try to distinguish themselves from their peers. It is unlikely that many consumers will quickly change their TV viewing habits,"" said the S&P report.""However, as younger generations weaned on other content streams grow up, we will see a meaningful acceleration of cable displacement, which will in turn affect the profitability and credit ratings of cable networks.""

674,DISCA,"The fees the distributors pay content owners have been climbing almost 11% a year. Thus, content firms have been winning most recent squabbles over money.
"
675,DISCA,"Pay-TV providers also pay the big four TV broadcast networks fees, just like cable channels. And they've started to pay for rights to distribute content at subscriber-only websites.
"
676,DISCA,"Content firms have been on a roll, but Time Warner Cable aims to slow them down. The cable firm says an iPad or similar tablet computer is just another kind of media-viewing screen.
"
677,DISCA,"And it says it has the right to send programs to all Web-connected screens.
"
678,DISCA,"But content firms say cable and all pay-TV firms must pay extra for iPad viewing rights. They say they need that extra fee in part because iPad viewership isn't helping them boost their ad rates, because Nielsen and others aren't counting those viewers.
"
679,DISCA,"Viacom and Time Warner Cable traded lawsuits in the first week of April, and observers say the courts could rule either way.
"
680,DISCA,"Time Warner Cable has pulled a dozen channels from its iPad lineup to appease content owners, but it still offers 30-plus channels as a perk to its subscribers.
"
681,DISCA,"Time Warner Cable and all distributors will in the long run be forced into bargaining with content providers, says Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey. Content firms depend on pay-TV providers' programming fees, he says.
"
682,DISCA,"Multiple Screens
"
683,DISCA,"But revenue-sharing models are in flux as consumers watch content on multiple screens — standard TVs, computers and mobile devices.
"
684,DISCA,"Cable firms aim to be the preferred partners of content firms, McQuivey says, hoping to prevent more programs from moving to Netflix.
"
685,DISCA,"""Time Warner Cable and other (cable firms) hope to expand their rights without too much fuss and keep revenue in the pay-TV world,"" McQuivey said. ""They're presuming that would make Viacom and others happy.""
"
686,DISCA,"Netflix is encroaching on pay TV, McQuivey says. Netflix has an iPad app.
"
687,DISCA,"And Netflix subscribers also can download programs to laptop computers, game players or Blu-ray players that can be tethered to TVs.
"
688,DISCA,"""It's getting harder to monetize content on the basis of what devices consumers are using,"" McQuivey said. ""Netflix has been writing the rules. If you're a Netflix subscriber, you can access Netflix's content on any device.""
"
689,DISCA,"Nomura Securities analyst Mike McCormack also says cable TV firms will wind up paying for iPad rights.
"
690,DISCA,"""IPad apps are likely going to be an additional payment trigger for programming fees,"" McCormick said.
"
691,DISCA,"Amid the dust-up, Disney's ESPN plans to release its own iPad app in May. It also plans to sell advertising on its iPad platform.
"
692,DISCA,"And ESPN's content might appear on Time Warner Cable's iPad lineup. ""We're in talks with them,"" said ESPN spokeswoman Amy Phillips.
"
693,DISCA,"One issue is that TWC's system doesn't black out local sports events, a capability that ESPN needs under its own broadcast rights, says Phillips. The WatchESPN app coming in May will require iPad users to supply cable-account information, so viewers would have to subscribe to a pay-TV partner.
"
694,DISCA,"Broadcast networks NBC Universal and ABC have launched their own iPad apps, but neither provides live streaming TV.
"
695,DISCA,"Comcast (CMCSA), the No. 1 cable TV firm, acquired NBC Universal in January, which might be why Comcast isn't joining TWC in taking on content firms. Comcast has released its own iPad apps, but unlike TWC, none of them provide the live programming.
"
696,DISCA,"Comcast Plans To Stream
"
697,DISCA,"Comcast plans ""to launch in-home streaming of live TV on tablets later this year,"" said Comcast spokesman Peter Dobrow.
"
698,DISCA,"Time Warner Cable and Comcast aim to make their customers happier by providing iPad viewing perks. Kraft says that makes good marketing because consumers need to order both TV and broadband service in order to get iPad viewing.
"
699,DISCA,"Cable TV firms aim to give subscribers more options, with the goal of setting themselves apart from satellite rivals DirecTV Group (DTV) and Dish Network (DISH). The satellite broadcasters don't provide their own broadband services to homes.
"
700,DISCA,"At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, cable firms showed apps running on Web-connected TVs.
"
701,DISCA,"Cable TV firms run a risk that customers will need fewer set-top boxes if they're watching TV on iPads or Web-connected TVs. Consumers pay about $10 to $15 a month for extra set-tops and digital service. While cable TV firms could lose that revenue, they'll save on costs to send out field technicians for service calls, says Kraft.
"
702,DISCA,"In January, Time Warner Cable CEO Glenn Britt said tablets and intelligent DVRs will change the industry's business model.
"
703,DISCA,"""You're beginning to see video on any video display in the home,"" he said. ""And for us, over a very long time period, we may not have set-tops at all.
"
704,DISCA,"""And that means a less-capital-intensive business, fewer service calls and happier consumers, so I think this is all good.""Live from media capital New York, it's an iPad controversy.Content owners led by Viacom (VIA) and News Corp. (NWS) are feuding with some content distributors — pay-TV providers Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Cablevision Systems (CVC) — over live programs whisked to iPads via wireless Internet connections in homes.All the companies are New York-based, but the fight has industrywide ramifications as the players try to figure out who gets paid what as viewers start watching content on more types of screens.Content firms have warmed up to the idea of distributing old movies or taped TV shows on the Internet through Netflix (NFLX) and others. But streaming something like ""Saturday Night Live"" fresh to an iPad is not something most content firms are ready to do. Not unless they're paid extra, that is.""The entertainment companies that have an iPad issue aren't saying it's a bad business idea,"" said Evercore Partners analyst Bryan Kraft. ""It's about money and monetizing their programming in as many ways as they can.""$24.8 Billion For ProgramsPay-TV providers — cable, satellite and phone companies — ponied up about $24.8 billion in programming rights in 2010 to content owners such as Viacom, Time Warner (TWX), News Corp., Disney (DIS) and Discovery Communications (DISCA), says market research firm SNL Kagan.The fees the distributors pay content owners have been climbing almost 11% a year.

The move pushed it back above its 10-week line, which it has traded below since late January.

783,DISCA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Discovery, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Discovery has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.2x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Discovery’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 51.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Discovery has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 8.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Discovery stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Discovery has a P/S ratio of about 1.8. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, DISCA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Discovery currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Discovery a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Discovery might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B. This gives DISCA a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen three up and five down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 8.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and Consensus  Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and Consensus | Discovery Communications, Inc. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineDiscovery is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 40% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large, as you can see below:However, with a Zacks Rank #3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

784,DISCA,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is DISCA due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsDiscovery delivered first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 53 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents.The figure excluded restructuring costs and other Scripps related transaction costs, primarily legal and financial fees from legacy Scripps and included $226 million (37 cents per share) of after-tax restructuring costs and other transaction costs.Adjusted earnings (excluding the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, net of tax) were 16 cents per share compared with 41 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Revenues surged 43% year over year to $2.31 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and the Scripps Networks Interactive, The Enthusiast Network and the Oprah Winfrey Network transactions (collectively called “Transactions”), revenues increased 14%. On a pro forma basis, revenues advanced 10% from the year-ago quarter.Distribution revenues (45.6% of revenues) increased 22.9% from the year-ago quarter to $1.05 billion. Advertising revenues (43.9%) rose 47.3% to $1.01 billion. Other revenues were $244 million compared with $71 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Segment DetailsU.S. Networks (50.9% of revenues) increased 41.6% from the year-ago quarter to $1.17 billion. Excluding the impact of “Transactions”, revenues inched up 3%, as distribution and advertising revenues grew 2% and 4%, respectively.On a pro forma basis, U.S. Networks' revenues grew 2%, driven by 2% growth in distribution revenues and 2% improvement in advertising revenues.Distribution revenue growth was driven by increases in affiliate fee rates, partially offset by a decline in affiliate subscribers. Advertising revenues primarily came on the back of continued monetization of digital content offerings as well as higher volumes, partially offset by lower linear delivery.On a pro forma basis, subscribers to Discovery’s fully distributed networks declined 3%, while subscribers to the company’s total portfolio fell 5% in the quarter.International Networks revenues (47.6% of revenues) soared 47% year over year $1.09 billion. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Scripps and currency effects, segment revenues increased 28%, driven by 10% growth in distribution revenues, 11% increase in advertising revenues and significant improvement in other revenues.On a pro forma basis, International Networks' revenues increased 26%, driven by 9% increase in distribution revenues, 11% growth in advertising revenues and significant increase in other revenues.Discovery’s international networks’ distribution revenues benefited from increased digital revenues and higher contractual rates in Europe, solid contributions from content deliveries under licensing agreements in Asia and increased rates in Latin America.However, subscriber count declined in Latin America, contractual rates were down in Asia. These hurt international networks’ distribution top-line growth.Advertising revenues benefited from increased pricing and volume across key markets in Europe as well as higher ratings from coverage of the Olympics. However, lowered pricing and delivery in Latin America and Asia negatively impacted revenues.Education revenues (1.5% of revenues) declined 5.4% year over year to $35 million in the reported quarter.Operating DetailsIn the first quarter, adjusted operating income before depreciation & amortization (OIBDA) increased 15.6% from the year-ago quarter to $697 million. Excluding the impact of the “Transactions” and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted OIBDA decreased 9%.U.S. Networks grew 3%, which was fully offset by a 37% decline at international networks, primarily attributed to the timing of costs associated with the Olympics. U.S. Networks’ profitability was negatively impacted by higher content spending and digital media production costs.On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency, adjusted OIBDA declined 6%. U.S. Networks’ adjusted OIBDA grew 1%, which was fully offset by 30% decline in international networks’ adjusted OIBDA.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Mar 31, 2018, cash & cash equivalents were $812 million as compared with $7.31 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.Long term debt was $19.21 billion, much higher than $14.76 billion at the end of the previous quarter.Cash flow from operating activities was $160 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and Consensus Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and Consensus | Discovery Communications, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, DISCA has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for value and growth investors than momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

785,DISCA,"In keepingwith its strategy to focus on core operations, Meredith Corporation (MDP  -  Free Report) has decided to offload Meredith Xcelerated Marketing (“MXM”) to Accenture. Management believes that this digital and customer relationship marketing agency will better integrate with Accenture Interactive. MXM is a creative agency, which develops and delivers custom content and customer relationship marketing programs for many of the world's leading brands.The company did not disclose the financial terms of the transaction. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company believes that the deal will not have any major impact on its fiscal 2018 financial results.The news of divestiture followed Meredith’s announcement of new sales and marketing structure for its National Media Group and strategic plans to smoothly integrate its recent buyout of Time Inc. This strategy mainly involves the reviewing of media asset portfolio and divestiture of non-core brands; augmenting advertising as well as circulation feat of the Time Inc. properties; increasing revenue and profits of Time Inc. digital assets; and generating cost synergies of $400-$500 million annually in the first two years of operations. On completion of portfolio review, Meredith intends to vend the TIME, Sports Illustrated, Money and Fortune magazine brands.

786,DISCA,"Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) has been one of the top-performing stocks to-date in 2018 driven by its robust and ever expanding content portfolio. The company’s strategy of producing quality original content and strong programming slate will continue to help it in attracting and retaining subscriber base.Netflix’s massive spending on content can primarily be attributed to high production values. Notably, the solid budget also attracts well-known Hollywood stars, which definitely make the shows more attractive.Hollywood stars like Will Smith (Bright), Brad Pitt (War Machine), Jake Gyllenhaal (Okja), Henry Cavill & Nicholas Hoult (Sand Castle), Angelina Jolie (First They Killed My Father), Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Guillermo Del Toro and Meryl Streep (Five Came Back) have already worked with Netflix, either in the capacity of an actor or a director. Jennifer Aniston is the latest addition to this bandwagon. Per Variety, Aniston will star opposite Adam Sandler in Netflix’s new comedy show Murder Mystery. In 2011, they were paired opposite in movie Just Go With It, which was a runaway hit, earning $103 million in the United States and $215 million worldwide.Notably, Aniston is also working in an unnamed show along with Reese Witherspoon for Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report). Netflix, Inc. Price and Consensus Netflix, Inc. Price and Consensus | Netflix, Inc. Quote Netflix Dominates on Portfolio StrengthThe streaming market is expected to heat-up with upcoming services from the likes of Apple and Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report).Apple’s aggressive bidding for original content has been a headwind for Netflix in recent times. The iPhone-maker is reportedly spending more than its stipulated budget of $1 billion.Further, the recent acquisition of several major 21st Century Fox assets is a significant addition to Disney’s portfolio. Additionally, the company’s distribution agreement with Netflix also ends in the coming year, which means new movies will only be available on Disney’s streaming service in the United States.However, Netflix continues to dominate the streaming market based on its ever-expanding content portfolio, well-supported by the whopping budget. The company is expected to spend a whopping $7.5–$8 billion in 2018 and it is anticipated to increase further to $12.2 billion in 2020.Notably, Netflix intends to produce/acquire 80 films throughout the year. The company plans to release 30 international original series this year, including programs from India, Korea and Japan.Netflix recently expanded its push in the global video streaming market with its first Philippine series to be released on Apr 9. The company collaborated with Filipino media company, TV5 Network to stream the 12-episode mini-series Amo, which is based on the controversial drug war of Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte, per media reports.Although enormous spending on marketing (almost $2 billion in 2018 compared with $1.3 billion in 2017) can dent Netflix’s profitability, we believe that the company’s expanding content portfolio will rapidly drive subscriber growth in the long haul.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Netflix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report) with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is a stock worth considering in the same sector.

Shares have lost about 16.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is DISCA due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Fourth Quarter ResultsThe company’s earnings (excluding $2.46 from non-recurring items) of 47 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. The bottom line, however, declined 9.6% on a year-over-year basis owing to higher costs.Discovery’s fourth-quarter revenues of $1,864 million improved 11.5% on a year-over-year basis. Also, the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,783 million. In fact, revenue growth was witnessed across all major divisions of the company. Quarterly adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) increased 10% year over year.Performance DetailsRevenues from Discovery’s U.S. Networks division rose 10% to $892 million. Segmental growth was driven by 7% and 8% growth in distribution and advertising revenues, respectively.Distribution revenues came in at $402 million compared with $375 million a year ago. Higher affiliate fee rates contributed to the increase. However, total portfolio subscribers decreased 5% while subscribers of the company’s fully distributed networks declined 3% in the quarter.Advertising revenues came in at $456 million compared with $421 million a year ago.  Revenues from other sources increased to $34 million from $16 million in the previous year. The substantial improvement was primarily owing to Discovery's joint venture with TEN for automotive media. Also, adjusted OIBDA was up 7% year over year at the segment. On the contrary, adjusted OIBDA margin declined to 54% from 55% a year ago.International Networks revenues rose 13% to $927 million. While Distribution revenues in the segment improved 15% to $479 million, advertising revenues increased 11% to $419 million.

Adjusted OIBDA margin slid to 27% from 28% a year ago.Revenues from the Education and Other division increased 10% to $45 million. This upside was primarily owing to increased International and digital textbook revenues at Education.LiquidityThe company exited 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $7,309 million and $14,755 million of debt (non-current portion) compared with $300 million and $7, 841 million, respectively, at the end of 2016.

788,DISCA,"On Mar 27, the Conference Board reported U.S. consumer confidence data for the month of March. In February, consumer confidence index was at its 18-years high. Although the data shows a moderate dip from the previous month, primarily due to stock market fluctuations, it still remains at a strong level.Expected improvement in income, jobs and after-tax pay of U.S. consumers are most likely to offset worries about rising interest rates and stock market volatility. A robust job market, massive tax cuts and solid economic data are likely to increase consumer spending in the months to come. At this stage, investment in consumer discretionary stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank will be a prudent move.Moderate Dip in March DataFor March 2018, the Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence index stands at 127.7 compared with 130.0 in February, which was the highest in 18 years. March’s reading also came in below the consensus estimate of 130.4. The Present Situation index plummeted from 161.2 to 159.9, while the Expectations index dropped from 109.2 last month to 106.2 this month.Persistence of volatility in the stock market, expectation of a global trade war followed  by President Trump’s Tariff policies and anticipation of an aggressive interest rate hike by the Fed led to the marginal decline in the consumer confidence index.However, March’s reading of 127.7 was the second highest since the November 2017 index of 128.6. Notably, the reading for March 2017 was just 124.9.U.S. Economy on Strong FootingRecession is unlikely to occur as the U.S. economic fundamentals remain healthy. Several important macro-economic reports released in this month indicate as much.U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February 2018, exceeding the consensus estimate of 208,000. Moreover, the total labor force stands slightly below 162 million. This was the highest since September 2003.The Department of Commerce’s data showed that new orders for durable goods increased 3.1% in February after declining for two straight months. Orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, grew 1.8%, reflecting biggest gain in five months. Core capital goods shipments increased 1.4%, the largest increase experienced since December 2016.Industrial production improved 1.1% in February as against a dip of 0.3% in January. Manufacturing production increased 1.2% in February, reflecting largest gain since October 2017. Total industrial production in February was 108.2%, up 4.4% year over year.Finally, on Mar 21, the Fed raised the economic outlook for 2018 from 2.5% to 2.7% and provided robust estimates of several key economic metrics post the Federal Open Market Committee’s latest policy meeting.How to Identify the Potential Winners?Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.  Strong consumer confidence data indicates that the space is likely to witness robust growth in the coming months. Consequently, adding consumer discretionary stocks to your portfolio makes sense at this point. However, picking winning stocks can be a difficult task.This is where our VGM Score comes in handy. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select the winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a good VGM Score.

789,DISCA,"It can be very difficult to find companies that are both flying under the radar, and still might have potential for gains. Many times, stocks are off investors’ radar screens for a reason, though there are some hidden gems that could be worth uncovering by those with a high risk tolerance.One way to find these underappreciated stocks is by looking at companies that haven’t seen their share prices move higher lately, but have observed analysts raising earnings estimates for their stock. This trend could signal that investors haven’t quite embraced the rising estimate story yet, but that the potential for a big move higher is definitely there.One such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain, but has been overlooked by investors lately, is Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report). This Broadcast Radio and Television stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 12.8%.

790,DISCA,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (LYV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, after market close. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 3.64%. Live Nation surpassed/met expectations in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being a positive 20.58% owing to a strong second-quarter 2017 beat.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to affect the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results.All segments (Concerts, Advertising and Ticketing), especially the Concerts segment, have been witnessing revenue growth backed by higher ticket sales over the last few quarters. We expect this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Additionally, various digital initiatives undertaken by Live Nation are likely to improve the ticket booking experience and further drive the top line. Meanwhile, its food and beverage initiative at amphitheaters continues to improve on-site experience, consequently driving increased spend per customer. This initiative, coupled with the addition of more points of sale as well as continuous refinement of its product assortment and pricing are anticipated to boost concert business profitability.Moreover, Live Nation's ticketing business that operates under the well-known brand, Ticketmaster, has been posting solid revenues for the last few quarters. Also, the company boasts a significant presence in this high-margin agency business where it charges a fee for selling tickets on behalf of its clients. Thus, we expect the momentum of revenue growth to continue in the Ticketing segment.Meanwhile, its sponsorship & advertising business has been well-balanced between sponsorship and online advertising, with both parts of the business growing revenues and adjusted operating income in double digits through the first nine months of 2017.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s sales is pegged at $2.06 billion, reflecting an increase of 14.9% year over year.However, the overall macro environment might dent Live Nation’s revenues to some extent. Per management’s last conference call, forex had an adverse impact of 1% on the company’s business in the third quarter but was becoming less of an issue in the quarter under review.That said, the company typically experiences lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as its outdoor venues are primarily used and festivals primarily occur during May through October. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company is anticipated to report a loss of $1.08, showing a deterioration of 86.2% year over year.Quantitative Model PredictionOur proven model shows that Live Nation does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat in the fourth quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at -3.06%.Zacks Rank: Live Nation has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

793,DISCA,"The Q3 earnings season is moving full steam ahead with multiple reports lined up for release this week. Per our Earnings Outlook report as of Oct 27, out of the 272 S&P 500 companies that have come up with their quarterly numbers, approximately 75.7% posted positive earnings surprises, while 66.2% beat top-line expectations.According to the report, earnings for the 272 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far are up 8.7% from the same period last year, while revenues have increased 6.7%. Further, the report projects that earnings for the total S&P 500 companies will improve 5.4% from the year-ago period with total revenues rising 5.5%.Let’s Take a Glance at Consumer Discretionary SectorHowever, in the thick of the Q3 earnings season, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to witness mixed results. Total earnings of the sector are likely to decline 1.1%, while revenues are estimated to increase 2.8% year over year. Notably, broadcasting stocks form part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.Turning our focus to the Broadcasting Radio and Television industry, we note that only a few players have reported results so far. Among the broadcasting radio stocks which have reported their quarterly numbers, Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) posted mixed results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beat the same. Meanwhile, SIRIUS XM Holdings Inc.’s (SIRI  -  Free Report) has surpassed both top and bottom-line estimates in the third quarter.Let’s take a sneak peek at two broadcasting stocks lined up to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2.CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) is slated to report results, after the closing bell. The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether CBS will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.10, reflecting a year-over-year increase of nearly 5% and approximately 6% sequentially. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,295 million down from $3,396 million reported in the prior-year quarter. However, the consensus estimate portrays sequential growth of 1.2%.From the above discussion, it is apparent that CBS top-line is expected to decline 3% year over year in the third quarter. We believe that this might be due to fall in revenues from advertising sales and content group. Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect adverting revenues to be $1,123 million, down 23.6% year over year.CBS remains highly vulnerable to the advertising market, as it derives a major portion of revenues from the sale of advertising on its broadcast as well as cable networks and television, syndicated programming, and online properties. Notably, broadcast TV is losing ground to the internet and digital media. Consequently, analysts remain concerned about the company’s broadcast TV performance, which is a major revenue and profit contributor.Nevertheless, the company’s sustained focus on increasing subscription-based revenues is likely to drive long-term growth. In the third quarter, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues from affiliate and subscription fees to increase by more than 27% year over year.

(DISCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its quarterly numbers, before the opening bell.Discovery’s joint venture with The Enthusiast Network (“TEN”) in August for automotive media is likely to aid results in the third quarter. This move marks the company’s entry into direct-to-consumer offerings. Discovery will take a majority controlling interest in the new venture with options to acquire 100% of its business.Notably, Discovery has inked multiple deals to expand presence. In September, the company renewed distribution partnership with AT&T. The long-term carriage deal is aimed at expanding portfolio of networks across more platforms. Following the renewal, the company's networks are available on all platforms of DirecTV. Moreover, this strategy is expected to fuel results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.We believe these efforts will certainly help the company to report year-over-year increase in both the top and bottom lines in the third quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 55 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of nearly 53%. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,637 million up from $1,556 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Meanwhile, advertising revenues which witnessed a decline of nearly 1% year over year in the preceding quarter is likely to witness a gain of 3.4% in the third quarter owing to gain in international advertising revenues.

Notably, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 6.4%.

Further, the company has an extensive library of premium content that it monetizes over multiple platforms.

795,DISCA,"Scripps Networks Interactive  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Nov 1, after market close.In the last quarter, the company’s earnings (excluding special items) of $1.79 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. Also, the bottom line improved 26.1% on a year-over-year basis on the back of a 3.6% growth in revenues.Notably, Scripps Networks has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 17.7%.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on Scripps Networks’ third-quarter results.Below-par advertising revenues are expected to hurt the performance of the company’s flagship division - U.S. Networks. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter segmental advertising revenues is pegged at $491 million, much lower than the $553 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.  Total revenues from the U.S. Networks division is pegged at $711 million, much lower than the $779 million in the preceding quarter.The International Networks segment is also expected to disappoint in the third quarter of 2017. In fact, the pessimism regarding the sector can be made out from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter adjusted profits from the unit that is pegged at $5.27 million, much lower than the $38.78 million in the second quarter of 2017.Increased programming, selling, general and administrative expenses are also likely to hurt the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Evidently, shares of Scripps Networks have declined 3.1% over the last month, as against the Zacks Broadcast Radio And Television industry’s growth of 0.7%.Despite all the pessimism surrounding the stock, an earnings beat might not be too difficult for Scripps Networks in this quarter owing to reduced expectations. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter seems to be pretty conservative, 40.6% below $1.65 per share reported in second-quarter 2017.However, we believe that more than the earnings numbers, investors await updates on the impending acquisition of Scripps Networks by Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report).What Does our Model Say?Our proven model shows that Scripps Networks is likely to beat earnings in the soon-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Scripps Networks has an Earnings ESP of +5.10% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 5 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents per share.

Let’s delve deep and find out the factors impacting the results.Strategies on Track, Ad Revenue a ConcernThe New York Times Company is diversifying business, adding new revenue streams, strengthening balance sheet and restructuring portfolio. It has offloaded assets in order to re-focus on core newspapers and pay more attention to its online activities. The company has been adding diverse revenue streams, such as a pay-and-read model, to stay less vulnerable to economic conditions. It is not only gearing up to become an optimum destination for news and information but is also now focusing on service journalism, with verticals like Cooking, Watching and Well.The New York Times Company has been struggling with dwindling advertising revenues for quite some time now. Analysts pointed that increasing online readership has made the print-advertising model redundant. Print advertising revenue fell 10.5% in the second quarter of 2017, following a decline of 17.9% in the preceding quarter. Although, total advertising revenue increased marginally by 0.8% during the second quarter, the company hinted that it is likely to decline in the mid to high-single digits in the third quarter.How are Estimates Shaping Up?The New York Times Company’s diversification strategy to counter dwindling advertising revenues is likely to have a favorable impact on the top and bottom lines. Analysts polled by Zacks expect third-quarter revenue to be $388 million, up 6.7% from the year-ago quarter. However, we note that the rate of growth is likely to decelerate from 9.2% registered in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, earnings are projected to surge 50% year over year in the quarter, following an increase of 63.6% in the preceding quarter.

798,DISCA,"Time Warner Inc. , which accepted the buyout offer of AT&T, Inc., is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Oct 26. In the trailing four quarters, this media and entertainment company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 16.7%. In the preceding quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 11.8%.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Time Warner surpasses earnings estimate even this time. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.How are Estimates Shaping Up?After registering an increase of 3% in the bottom line, Time Warner is likely to witness a year-over-year decline in the third quarter of 2017. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.53 down from $1.83 reported in the year-ago period. We also note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased by a couple of cents in the past seven days, which indicates that analysts are not very optimistic about the company’s performance.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7,412 million, up 3.4% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the rate of growth is likely to decelerate from 5% registered in the preceding quarter.Time Warner Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Time Warner Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Time Warner Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing This QuarterWe believe that Time Warner’s foray into new markets, focus on original programming, cost reduction and increasing investments in key areas bode well. Additionally, the company has been expanding digital presence to enable consumers to access content from several platforms and devices. Its investments in video content and technology continue to drive results. All these initiatives are likely to be reflected in the quarter to be reported.However, decline in overall advertising spending and currency headwinds may adversely impact performance. Further, management had earlier projected that Turner division's total advertising revenue is likely to decline in the low-single digits in the third quarter. We also note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate of revenues for the segment, which is currently pegged at $2,777 million, is down from $3,102 million reported in the second quarter but reflects year-over-year growth of 6.4%.Time Warner's Home Box Office (“HBO”) segment is expected to generate revenues of $1,555 million, up 9% from the year ago period. Management had earlier guided that Home Box Office’s subscription revenue growth rate would rise in the second half of 2017 and total revenues is projected to increase at a higher rate in the second half compared to the first half.Analysts polled by Zacks envision revenue to decline at Warner Bros., which may weigh on the company’s top-line. Total revenues for the segment is projected to be $3,326 million, down 2.2% year over year.What Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Time Warner is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Time Warner carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) but has an Earnings ESP of +5.23%, consequently making the surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.77% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.61% and a Zacks Rank #3.Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.29% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

799,DISCA,"Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) shares climbed on Tuesday morning after Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) upgraded the media giant’s stock.Wells Fargo upgraded Disney from ""market perform"" to ""outperform"" and raised its price target to $116 a share from $109 a share, which would mark a 14% gain from Friday's close. The firm pointed to Disney’s new commitment to enter the streaming and over-the-top programming sector as the key reason for its renewed faith in the media powerhouse.Disney recently announced that it expects to introduce a Disney brand direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019. The company also hopes to roll out a streaming version of the struggling ESPN channel as soon as 2018.“With DIS’s foray into direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming, we can’t help but believe the TV ecosystem will soon embark on an accelerated over-the-top (OTT) path,” Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker wrote in a note to clients Monday. “Thus, investors may need to start thinking about increasing exposure to those media cos. with solid streaming strategies, such as CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), FOXA (FOXA  -  Free Report), and DIS…”Disney announced in early August that the company would leave Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) to set up an exclusive streaming platform for all Disney and Pixar movies.""We like the entry point for DIS even if we're early. … We view the risk/reward as heavily skewed to the upside,"" Ryvicker noted. ""We continue to believe Disney is a premium brand with one of the best management teams in media.""Wells Fargo also said that if Disney’s move into video streaming is successful that “we might even see the stock return to trading at a 1-2x premium to the market, putting the stock at $128/share.”Disney’s stock has had an up and down year thus far, and shares of the conglomerate have dropped significantly from its 52-week high water mark of $116 a share that it reached in April.Shares of Disney popped over 1% in morning trading on Tuesday, but now hover around 0.50% higher than Friday’s closing price at $102 a share.Other Note Highlights Ryvicker upgraded Disney based on a strong belief in the company’s ability to successfully progress into the world of digital streaming. The same Wells Fargo note cautioned investors about media companies that don’t have enough exposure in nonlinear television.The analyst pointed to three companies—Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report), Scripps Networks , and Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report)—as media outlets that could potentially be hurt as the shift towards streaming continues to heat up.Ryvicker singled out Viacom as being particularly exposed and downgraded the stock accordingly. Ryvicker downgraded Viacom’s non-voting stock to “market perform” from “outperform.” The analyst also lowered her price target from $43 a share to $32 a share. Shares of Scripps Networks fell marginally, while Discovery Communications saw its stock price sink by around 1% to touch a new 52-week intraday trading low of $21.89 a share.Viacom’s class B shares dropped by over 3.20% to hit a new 52-week intraday trading low. The company’s voting  shares dipped by roughly 2%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

800,DISCA,"Millions of Americans flocked to high-visibility locations on Aug 21 to catch a glimpse of the first solar eclipse in 99 years to cross the entire U.S. continent.Stock markets have historically gained momentum after such solar eclipses. Such a once-in-a-lifetime event provides great business opportunity to travel and leisure companies. This calls for investing in solid stocks from such areas.Stocks Rally on Solar EclipseLPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick stated that “history has shown us that since 1900, any time a total solar eclipse has been seen in the U.S., equity prices have gone up”. According to him, one year after the last 15 other total solar eclipses visible in the U.S., equity prices have gained an average of 17.2%. Stocks have, in fact, gained a whopping 39.6% after the eclipse in June 1954, while the markets rallied nearly 32% after one eclipse in June 1918.Detrick also figured out that the broader markets tend to rise an average 0.9% in the month following an eclipse, while it climbs 7.2% over the next six months. On a lighter note, he added that “it appears our biggest worry isn’t what stocks might do, but whether those glasses we bought online are officially approved by NASA!”Of course, there are other drivers that correspond with the solar calendar including robust quarterly earnings and economic conditions gaining traction at a steady pace. The Q2 earnings season has almost come to an end, with 474 S&P 500 members having reported quarterly results so far. Total earnings for these companies are up 10.6% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 74.9% beating EPS estimates and 68.4% surpassing the revenue mark (read more: No Shortage of Positive Retail Sector Surprises).Americans, in the meanwhile, have spent more in the spring driving the U.S. economy beyond the $19 trillion mark for the first time. Real gross domestic product rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the preceding quarter (read more: US GDP Crosses $19TN for the First Time: 5 Best Gainers). Here is LPL’s full breakdown of past performance, post-eclipse:Date of EclipseS&P 500 (1-Month Return)S&P 500 (6-Month Return)S&P 500 (12-Month Return)06/08/19184.9%4.5%31.8%09/10/1923-5.6%4.5%10.6%01/24/1925-0.3%10.7%29.9%06/29/19278.5%20.5%22.6%08/31/1932-3.7%-17.4%32.7%02/04/19435%11.5%10.8%07/09/1945-3.5%22.1%20.1%06/30/19545.7%22.4%39.6%10/02/19590.4%-2.9%-6.7%07/02/19635.1%13.4%23%03/07/19700.0%-7.3%11.8%07/10/1972-1.3%10.5%-2.4%02/26/19794.9%11.2%16.7%07/22/1990-9.4%-6.8%7.8%07/11/19912.7%10.8%9.9%Average0.9%7.2%17.2%% Positive53.3%73.3%86.7% Solar Eclipse Gives Public Companies Hopes of Better BusinessAs the total solar eclipse bisected the United States on Aug 21, some of the firms are expected to benefit immensely. CEO and COO Larry D. De Shon of car rental company, Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report) said that eclipse helped push rental prices higher. Maven, the on-demand car sharing brand from General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), had offered a $10 discount code ECLIPSE for travelers to move towards the eclipse lookout point.  And with millions of Americans hitting the road to catch a glimpse of the once-in-a-century solar eclipse, such a move will surely lift the company’s margins.Financial and bank holding company, First Interstate Bancsystem Inc (FIBK  -  Free Report) has more than 120 offices in the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, Wyoming and Washington. These are some of the key states that experienced the total solar eclipse and with millions flocking to these states, the bank’s business will surely get a shot in the arm.Many brands also geared up to cash in on this rare event. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL aptly named its cruise Total Eclipse, where Bonnie Tyler sang “Total Eclipse of the Heart”. And for those who haven’t traveled, Discovery Communications Inc’s DISCA Science Channel gave live eclipse coverage all through the day.Solar Eclipse a Bonanza for Airlines, HotelsAirlines have largely benefitted from this once in a lifetime event, as many traveled to large parts of the country that are typically rural regions and don’t see much tourist traffic. In fact, Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report) organized for invitation-only flights for “astronomy enthusiasts” who wanted a sighting of the eclipse in the skies. Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) also earmarked certain flights that helped travelers view the eclipse from high above the clouds.CNBC’s Eric Chemi noted that hotel bookings in some parts of the country, which were mostly along the eclipse path, skyrocketed 400%. Representatives from online marketplace and hospitality service, Airbnb declared that the site logged more than 40,000 guest bookings as of Jul 31.Many hotel chains like Marriott International Inc (MAR  -  Free Report) offered packages to commuters who head to cities in the path of the eclipse. The company reported that the number of rooms booked in 16 locations was up 60% from last year. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT  -  Free Report) is another firm that tried to entice customers with special offers, while InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG  -  Free Report), another large hotel chain, said last month that two of its three Nashville, Tennessee, hotels were sold out.Top 5 WinnersWith solar eclipse primarily being a boon for airlines, cruises and hotel industries, investing in fundamentally sound stocks from such areas seems prudent.

804,DISCA,"The Dow finished at an all time high on Monday buoyed by the rally in shares of Goldman Sachs, Home Depot and Boeing. However, the technology sector slumped due to familiar overvaluation concerns, pulling the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to end in the negative territory. Although seven out of eleven major sectors of the S&P ended in the green, led by financials, a selling in major tech stocks such as Facebook and Google owner Alphabet negated such gains.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today’s Ahead of Wall Street article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) touched an all-time intraday high of 21,929.80, earlier in the session. However, the blue-chip index pulled back to close at 21,891.12, also an all-time high, rising by 0.3% or 60.81 points in the process. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 0.1%, dwindling 1.80 points to close at 2,470.30. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,348.12, declining by 26.55 points or 0.4%. A total of around 6.3 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.0 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,495 to 1,017. On the Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,278 to 971.Boeing Lifts Dow to Fresh Record The Dow’s stellar showing was powered by excellent earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report). A rally in the shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) also helped Dow’s excellent performance. Moreover, low sovereign bond yields along with these results have essentially helped the Dow notch a record high on Monday.Technology Stocks Suffer, Drag S&P 500 and Nasdaq LowerOngoing tech overvaluation concerns led the investors to indulge in portfolio reshuffling toward the end of the month. A sell off in stocks of tech giants dragged the Nasdaq lower. During the session, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 1.2%, 3.2% and 1.3% respectively. Apple Inc is due to report on Tuesday and investors are hopeful of a good show from Apple.  The analysts expect Apple to control much of the tech sector over the coming week.Upbeat earnings from Chevron CVX and the growth in housing market boosted energy and bank shares. Broad based gains for the S&P 500 came from what has been an amazing earnings season all around. Further, there was a hike in oil prices as a result of production-curb commitments from OPEC and Saudi Arabia’s decision to curtail oil export to the States. However, the S&P 500 declined 1.8% to finish at 2,470.30. This fall was a result of the slump in tech stocks.Materials also contributed to the decline in S&P 500. The Materials Select Sector SPDR declined 0.8%. Seven of the eleven sectors of the S&P 500 were high, with the financial sector turning up in good numbers. The Financials Select SPDR was up 0.6%. However, this was negated by the losses incurred in the technology sector which turned out to be one of the worst performers. The Technology Select SPDR was down 0.5%.White House Drama Keeps Markets on the EdgeThe latest White House upheaval was marked by Anthony Scaramucci’s resignation from the post of White House communications director. Scaramcci stepped down just ten days after being nominated to the post. Moreover, the Trump administration’s failure to push through a bill to repeal the Obamacare has hurt the investor sentiment. Market watchers are increasingly losing faith in the promises made by President Trump in the run up to presidential elections. Trump's failure to keep his campaign trail promises has made investors doubtful about his ability to further his wider pro-growth agenda.Economic DataThe National Association of Realtors announced that its Pending Home Sales Index, increased 1.5% in June based on contracts signed last month. This was more than what the economists’ expectation of a 0.7% increase. For the record, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index declined to 58.9 in July from 65.7 in June.Monthly RoundupFor the month, the Dow increased 2.5% and the S&P 500 rose 1.9% whereas the Nasdaq increased 3.4%. The Dow’s great run has been supported by excellent earnings for the month. Leading companies which posted better-than-expected earnings include the likes of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), McDonalds MCD, Boeing, Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), Facebook and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report).However, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 lost out on some of the gains made earlier in the month. The tech rally initially gained on strong tech earnings expectations which were expected to justify high valuations of the tech stocks.  Gradually, investors took profits off the table by selling off tech stocks and this weighed on the broader markets, curbing gains for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.Also, Trump administration’s inability to repeal Obamacare hurt investor sentiment. Market watchers lost their faith in Trump’s ability to bring about tax reforms and increasing spending on infrastructural growth among other items on his pro-growth agenda. Moreover, the Fed’s call to leave rates unchanged aided rate-sensitive industries and helped in broad based gains. Pegged at 1.4%, inflation still remains well below the targeted 2.0%, hurting investor sentiment.Stocks That Made Headlines:Discovery Lags Q2 Earnings, To Buy Scripps NetworksSilver Spring, MD-based Discovery Communications, Inc.

805,DISCA,"Deal Frenzy in EntertainmentA lot of attention has been paid of late to the battle developing between the Walt Disney Corporation (DIS  -  Free Report) and cable giant Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report).  Disney has made an all-stock bid of approximately $52B for a significant portion of the assets of 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and is currently working on obtaining regulatory and shareholder approval.Though there has been no official announcement yet, the word on the street is that Comcast is scrambling to arrange financing for an all cash bid of $60B.  In the event of competing bids, the decision would fall to Fox Shareholders.  Rupert Murdoch owns 17% of those shares and has expressed a preference for the Disney deal, even though it carries a lower nominal price.It’s also anticipated that in the event of a bidding war, Comcast could sweeten the pot by combining it with the purchase of U.K. TV provider SKY, which would likely push the value of the deal toward $100B.Last year, Disney announced its intention to pull its content from Netflix (NLFX) in order to start its own streaming video service as a Netflix competitor.  Hunger for ContentThe most important commodity for streaming video providers is content.  They can choose to purchase finished productions, engage in licensing deals with the owners of content or produce their own original movies and shows.  Netflix engages in a combination of all three.  It’s easy to see how the 21st Century Fox acquisition would aid Disney in its aspirations to compete in the streaming market.Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report) just put up a great quarter and looks poised to continue the growth with its recent acquisition of Scripps Network Interactive, adding to its production of over 8000 hours per year of original programming. Discovery expects the Scripps deal to add to its demographic reach and international appeal, both of which increase the value of its offerings to advertisers.Discovery’s $2.86B in revenues in the quarter topped Q1 2017 results by 64%, and net earnings of $0.53/share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45/share.  Four recent analyst upward revisions now have expected 2018 earnings at $2.77/share, up from $2.48/share 60 days ago.  Thanks to the upward revisions, Discovery is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Discovery currently trades at a P/E Ratio of 8.2X, considerably lower than the Broadcasting/Radio-TV sub-industry average of 29X.Speculating on future takeovers is a dicey business because the world and business conditions change quickly, but in an era of consolidation in the entertainment business, it’s easy to see how Discovery’s earnings potential, vast content library and extremely low valuation would be attractive to either a huge entertainment company starting its own streaming service or a Cable TV conglomerate that’s continually adding to its portfolio. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.  Click for details >>

807,DISCA,"Extended Stay America, Inc. (STAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 7.9%. Extended Stay surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters, the average being a positive 14.2%.Let’s discuss the factors that will likely influence the company’s fourth-quarter results:The transformational initiatives undertaken by the company are expected to continue driving RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room) as hotels that have been renovated are witnessing increased Average Daily Rate (ADR) and occupancy levels. For the fourth quarter, the company expects comparable RevPAR growth between 0% and 2%.Additionally, various sales and marketing initiatives, and limited exposure to inbound international travel are likely to drive the top line. Also, franchise sales in the quarter might add to revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $301.06 million, implying a 1.8% decline. However, we note that the company’s lack of exposure to emerging markets might limit its revenue growth potential. That said, the same also limits its exposure to volatile oil markets and unfavorable currency impact, which may boost results.The company’s expense containment and cost-saving measures have been supporting margins. In the first nine months of 2017, operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 55.7%. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company incurred approximately $0.3 million in expenses in the prior quarter owing to the post-hurricane maintenance efforts. The company anticipates to incur the same amount in the fourth quarter mainly for landscaping.The company expects adjusted EBITDA between $127 million and $132 million in the fourth quarter, lower than the prior-year quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 17 cents, implying 15% a year-over-year decline.Quantitative Model PredictionOur quantitative model shows that Extended Stay America does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — that are needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: Extended Stay America has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Extended Stay America carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Extended Stay America, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Extended Stay America, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Extended Stay America, Inc. QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the Consumer Discretionary sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.38% and a Zacks Rank #3.

808,DISCA,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Discovery Communications is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for DISCA in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 41 cents per share for DISCA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for DISCA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +4.70% heading into earnings season.Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Discovery Communications, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that DISCA has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Discovery Communications, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

809,DISCA,"SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (SEAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 17.95%. SeaWorld surpassed expectations in only one of the last four quarters, the average being a positive 38.39% owing to a strong second-quarter 2017 beat.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to influence the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results.Historically, the first and the fourth quarters of each year are seasonally weak for SeaWorld. During the first nine months of 2017, the company’s revenues declined 7% from the prior-year period. The trend is expected to persist in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $260.7 million, implying a 2.6% decline from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, costs related to marketing and reputation campaigns as well as investments in new attractions might hurt profits. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company is anticipated to report a loss of 18 cents, showing a deterioration of 28.6% year over year.Moreover, SeaWorld’s total revenue per capita has been under pressure primarily due to lower attendance. Attendance in the first nine months of 2017 declined approximately 1.1 million guests, thanks to lower domestic and international attendance. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, we are optimistic about the company’s sincere efforts to control costs without denting efficiency and improve financial standing through debt refinancing. These factors are expected to drive upcoming results to some extent.Quantitative Model PredictionOur quantitative model predicts that SeaWorld does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: SeaWorld has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

810,DISCA,"Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 21.8%. Its earnings (excluding 5 cents from non-recurring items) of 43 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. The bottom line, however, expanded 19.4% on a year-over-year basis. Third-quarter revenues of $1,651 million improved 6.1% on a year-over-year basis. Also, the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,638.2 million.However, things are looking up for the company lately. Shares of the company have surged 35.4% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 19.9% rally.  Moreover, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings being revised 5.3% upward over the last 30 days.What Does our Model Say?Our proven model  shows that Discovery is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: Discovery has an Earnings ESP of +6.58%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at 43 cents per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. A positive Zacks ESP is indicative of a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Discovery carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Notably, stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating estimates, further when combined with a positive ESP.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Discovery Communications, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely at PlayThe U.S. Networks division is expected to perform well in the fourth quarter, thereby driving results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter U.S. Networks revenues stands at $853 million, above $812 million reported a year ago.Discovery has been inking multiple deals of late to expand its reach. These are likely to aid results in the fourth quarter.In December 2017, the company decided to increase its stake in Oprah Winfrey Network (“OWN”) by 24.5% to acquire a majority interest in the company. Following completion of this deal, Discovery will have 70% stake in OWN.Additionally, Discovery entered into a joint venture with The Enthusiast Network for automotive media, which marks its entry into direct-to-consumer offerings space.Further, the company has renewed its distribution partnership with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report). This long-term carriage contract is aimed at expanding its portfolio of networks across more platforms. Following the renewal, the company's networks will be available on all platforms of DirecTV.The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through buybacks are another positive.However, quarterly results might be negatively impacted by challenges plaguing the advertising market in the United States. Discovery expects ad revenues to be flat in the fourth quarter. Escalated debt levels and high costs pose further threats to its earnings release in the to-be-reported quarter.Discovery’s decision to acquire Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.  is anticipated to be closed shortly. Updates on the buyout will be available on fourth-quarter conference call.Another Stock to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector may also consider AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.

811,DISCA,"New York-based, Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 3, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 33.90%. The company has an impressive track record of beating estimates in each of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 17.07%.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayViacom’s proposed merger with CBS Corp. (CBS  -  Free Report) has been called off. National Amusements Inc., which owns the majority voting shares of both the companies, has decided that the companies should function as separate entities. This is a concern for the investors as a merger would have been beneficial for Viacom, as that would have provided it with the much-needed cost synergies. However, a lack of this development might affect the company’s results in the third quarter. Also, its high debt levels remain a big concern and are anticipated to hurt results in the to be reported quarter.Due to these headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the last three months. The stock has lost a massive 16.29% compared with the industry’s 2.67% loss.However, Viacom is expected to perform well on the top-line front in the fiscal third quarter, owing to higher revenues at its Filmed Entertainment segment.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Viacomis likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Viacom has an Earnings ESP of -4.72%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although Viacom’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its negative ESP doesn’t make us confident of an earnings surprise.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Viacom Inc.

However, both earnings and revenues improved on a year-over- year basis.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlaySirius XM might struggle in the second quarter of 2017 due to high debt levels. Increased leverage coupled with stiff competition from its rivals will also act as headwinds for the company this quarter.However, the company’s healthy net subscriber growth is encouraging which might drive its second-quarter results.The company’s efforts to expand its product portfolio also raise optimism. In April, the company acquired Automatic Labs, a provider of connected vehicle services for consumers and enterprises based in San Francisco.

814,DISCA,"The New York Times Company (NYT  -  Free Report), a diversified media conglomerate, is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27. In the trailing four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 31.4%. In the preceding quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 83.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Let’s take a closer look as to how The New York Times Company, which forms part of the Consumer Staples sector, is expected to contribute this earnings season. As per the latest Earnings Preview report, total earnings and revenues for the sector are anticipated to increase by 3.1% and 1.2%, respectively. We noted that the Consumer Staples sector has underperformed the broader market in the past three months. In the said time frame, this Zacks categorized sector has gained 1.5%, while S&P 500 Index has advanced 4%.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether the company will be able to continue with its positive earnings surprise streak in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 13 cents compared with 11 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable lately. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $394.4 million, up about 6% from the year-ago quarter.New York Times Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  New York Times Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | New York Times Company (The) QuoteFactors at PlayThe New York Times Company is diversifying business, adding new revenue streams, strengthening balance sheet along with restructuring portfolio. It has offloaded assets in order to re-focus on core newspapers and pay more attention to its online activities. We believe these moves will have a favorable impact on the quarter to be reported. The company is not only gearing up to become an optimum destination for news and information but is also now focusing on service journalism, with verticals like Cooking, Watching and Well. The company has launched digital subscriptions for NYT Cooking, its popular recipe site and app.However, advertising revenue remains an area of concern for the company. We observed that the company has been struggling with dwindling advertising revenue for quite some time now. Total advertising revenue dropped 6.9% during the first quarter of 2017, following declines of 9.7%, 7.7%, 11.7% and 6.8% witnessed in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of 2016, respectively.

822,DISCA,"Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp. (VAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this vacation ownership company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23.7%. Moreover, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is 14.5%.Let’s discuss how the company’s top and bottom line will shape up in the fourth-quarter 2017.Hurricane Impact to ContinueIn spite of continuous momentum in marketing platforms and sales distributions, the adverse impact of the hurricanes that took place in the third quarter is expected to mar Marriott Vacations’ fourth-quarter revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $497 million, implying 11.9% decline. In fact, the company anticipates a negative impact of $20 million on full-year contract sales due to the hurricanes.Increased Expenses to Dent ProfitThe company’s increased marketing expenses might pressurize margins as it is extensively marketing-oriented and relies heavily on sales initiatives to attract customers. Additionally, management expects that the utilization of rental availability for preview room nights to increase tours can dent rental margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, for the fourth quarter, the company expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $64 million and $69 million. This compares unfavorably with the prior-year quarter, due to the change in the company’s reporting calendar. Since the first three quarters of 2017 benefited from an additional 22 days of operating results, the offset was noticed in the fourth quarter with 20 days less of operating results compared to 2016.These might have an adverse impact on the company’s profits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.16, implying 36.6% decrease.Our Quantitative Model Suggests a MissConsidering the headwinds, our quantitative model predicts that Marriott Vacations does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: Marriott Vacations has an Earnings ESP of -1.30%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Marriott Vacations carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

823,DISCA,"Times are changing for the global media industry, with several major companies jousting for positioning as consumers continue to search for quality original content and streaming options. These big names are getting all the attention, but interestingly enough, smaller—but still recognizable—media moguls like Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report) look even stronger.Discovery is a mass media company with a focus on non-fiction content. It operates Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science, TLC, and other spin-off networks. Discovery also recently completed the acquisition of Scripps Network Interactive, which owned Food Network and HGTV, among others.DISCA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and looks like a great option based on the strength of its content library, its improving earnings outlook, and its attractive valuation metrics.Latest Earnings and OutlookIn its most recent quarter, Discovery saw adjusted earnings of $0.53 per share, topping our consensus estimate of $0.45. Meanwhile, quarterly revenue of $2.3 billion was in line with estimates and marked year-over-year growth of nearly 44%.Since then, earnings estimates for Discovery’s fiscal 2018 and 2019 have been moving higher. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company is now calling for profits of $2.77 per share, up from just $2.43 per share in just 30 days. Over the same time, our consensus projection for the company’s 2019 earnings has moved 18 cents higher.It is also worth noting that our Most Accurate Estimate—which only includes the most recent analyst estimates—for 2018 is 20 cents higher than the consensus. This implies that analyst sentiment has been heating up strongly recently, which is a great sign for the stock.All in all, Discovery is expected to report earnings growth of 24% on the back of 58% revenue growth this year.

824,DISCA,"Meredith Corporation (MDP  -  Free Report) unveiled strategic plans to smoothly integrate its recent buyout of Time Inc. This strategy mainly comprises reviewing of media assets’ portfolio and divestiture of non-core brands; augment advertising as well as circulation feat of the Time Inc. properties; increasing revenue and profits of Time Inc. digital assets; and generate cost synergies in a band of $400-$500 million annually in the first two years of operations.With the completion of portfolio review, Meredith intends to sell the TIME, Sports Illustrated, Money and Fortune magazine brands. This follows the recent divestiture of Time Inc. UK and Golf media brands. Meredith, which reaches 175 million American consumers every month, has divested Time Inc. UK to Epiris.Management cited the reason behind these potential divestitures, to diverse target viewers and advertising bases as these iconic brands have a huge customer base. Therefore, it believes that each of these brands will be efficiently managed by their respective new owners, positioning them well for growth. Meredith also revealed that it has received certain offers for the brands, however, it suspended any further talks until final agreements have been made.Meredith is planning a modern brand-centered sales organization and go-to-market strategy, which is expected to leverage the new media portfolio comprising the enhanced digital footprint. These plans will be further highlighted in all-employee meetings starting Mar 28.In an another move, Meredith, the publisher of Family Circle and Better Homes & Gardens, retrenched 200 positions to achieve cost synergies of $400-$500 million. Further, it is well on track to cut 1,000 additional positions in the coming 10 months. These job layoffs have not resulted from the aforesaid potential divestitures, but forms major part of Meredith's previously announced strategy of eradicating duplicative positions and consolidating definite functions at its headquarters, where operational expenses are considerably low.Earlier, the media behemoth had laid-off nearly 600 positions due to the transitioning of a Time subscription fulfillment functions to a lower-cost provider.The merger of Time Inc. and Meredith has created a leading media company serving nearly 200 million Americans across industry-leading digital, television, print, video, mobile, and social platforms positioned for growth. The combined mega company is a diversified media and marketing hub.This merger has brought together the strong television business of Meredith as well as the trusted, premium multiplatform content creation of both Meredith and Time Inc., which are capable of serving consumers and advertisers alike.Stock PerformanceHowever, shares of Meredith lost 2.9% in the past six months against the industry’s 24.9% upside. The decline can be attributed to the waning print media trends due to shift from traditional advertising.Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has enough potential to turnaround in the near term.

826,DISCA,"Markets ended slightly higher on Tuesday with all the major benchmarks ending in positive territory. Investors speculated about the effects of a possible trade war triggered by the imposition of import tariffs by President Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan dissuaded Trump from moving ahead with his protectionist policies as they might not bode well for the economy. Meanwhile, North Korea has expressed its willingness to denuclearize and is eager to hold talks with the U.S and its Southern neighbor in a bid to improve relations.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.04% to close at 24,884.12. The S&P 500 gained 0.3% to close at 2,728.12. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,372.01, increasing 0.6%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 8.5% to close at 20.33. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,701 to 1,098. On Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumber the declining ones by 1,692 to 1,144.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow added 9.4 points to end in the green on Tuesday. The blue-chip index has lost as much as 166 points earlier in the session. This fall followed a surge of 120 points in the Dow.The S&P 500 gained 7.2 points to also end in positive territory.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trade War Fears Keep Investors on TenterhooksOn Friday, Trump said that the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum. Such protectionist trade measures triggered a lot of concern among corporations and consumers. Tariffs will increase the cost of companies that rely heavily on aluminum and steel, like auto and plane makers.Trump’s contentious tariff announcement raised apprehensions about retaliation from China and other major U.S. trading partners. China cautioned America to abide by multilateral trade rules and not to harm the delicate global economy.Trump’s plan however, faced opposition from House Speaker Paul Ryan and a few other fellow-Republicans. Ryan, in particular, cautioned Trump about the negative ramifications that the latter’s protectionist policies might have on the economy and discouraged him from pursuing such plans. Further, he openly criticized the idea of a trade war and stated that such a development would negate the overall positive impacts of the tax overhaul. Trump, however, stated that he wouldn’t be ‘backing down’ and that any imposition of new tariffs would not lead to a trade war.Meanwhile, the President also stated that Canada and Mexico could be exempted from such tariffs if they agreed to ‘fairer’ terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He also commented that Canada must ensure proper treatment of “our farmers” and that Mexico should put in more effort to check the drugs from flowing into the U.S.Trump Speculates Cohn’s ResignationBloomberg reported on Tuesday that President was skeptical about economic advisor Gary Cohn continuing in his role if import tariffs are imposed. Also, CNBC reported that a source close to Cohn stated that the latter was ‘contemplating’ about whether or not to continue with his current role.Bloomberg also reported that Cohn has been working to prevent the tariffs from being imposed. He had also organized meetings between Trump and some important executives from the U.S. metals industries to discourage Trump from imposing tariffs.North Korea Considers DenuclearizationSouth Korea’s presidential office announced on Tuesday that the country had agreed with its Northern counterpart to hold their first summit in the last 10 years. This news comes after a senior delegation met North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang on Monday, in a bid to improve strained relations between the two countries.South Korean media also reported that the North had indicated its intent to denuclearize and would also completely stop weapons testing by the time the summit is held. The report also stated that North Korea was eager to enter into talks with the United States regarding denuclearization and improving its troubled relations with the country.Stocks That Made HeadlinesChevron Sets Dividend Growth & Other Priorities for 2018Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) recently issued a statement at its latest annual analyst day, bringing in pleasant news for its investors.NCI Building Q1 Earnings & Revenues Top, View UpbeatNCI Building Systems, Inc. (NCS  -  Free Report) delivered adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share for first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Jan 28, 2018), which surged nearly three-fold from 5 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Target Pulls Itself Up to Take On Amazon & WalmartRetail is no longer restricted to brick-and-mortar.

827,DISCA,"Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) has finally completed the much-awaited acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. The combined entity of both companies under the name, Discovery, Inc., will likely offer a complementary and dynamic suite of brands and emerge a new global leader in the space.The acquisition was initially announced in July 2017. The company received an approval for the same from the U.S. Department of Justice only last week. The cash-and-stock based transaction was valued at $14.6 billion including Scripps’ approximate net debt of $2.7 billion.Per the merger agreement, Scripps’ shareholders are entitled to receive around $90 per share inclusive of $65.82 per share in cash and $1.06 in Series C common shares of Discovery stock.In fact, Shares of Discovery have been on an uptrend since the past few months with the company nearing closure of the integration. The stock has rallied 24.2% in the last three months, marginally outperforming the industry’s 23.9% gain.  The buyout is likely to boost the stock further.Benefits of the MergerThe consolidated unit is likely to produce around 8,000 hours of original programming content on a yearly basis, reaching fans across 220 countries and territories in 50 different languages. Additionally, it is expected to generate 7 billion short-form video streams per month, expanding its presence across new video and social media platforms.The two entities will have nearly 20% of ad-supported pay-TV audiences’ share in the United States. Further, the joint body plans to strengthen its global network of female subscribers. It will feature five of the top pay-TV networks for women, accounting for more than 20% female viewership of primetime pay-TV within the country.The acquisition widens Discovery’s international footprint, providing the audience with a varied range of Scripps’ brands, programming feed and talent. Scripps’ strong position in core international markets like the United Kingdom and Poland will aid Discovery’s existing content pipeline in the areas including Discovery’s Home and Health network across Latin America.Moreover, the transaction is expected to be accretive to the combined entity’s adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow in the first year after its conclusion, besides generating cost synergies of approximately $350 million.The conglomerate will include brands namely Discovery Channel, Food Network, HGTV, Investigation Discovery, TLC, Eurosport, Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) as well as a stake in Group Nine Media.Notably, in December 2017, Discovery had announced to purchase a majority interest in OWN. Last November, the company along with others provided funding to Group Nine Media to become a stakeholder.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has long maintained a dominant status among broadcasters by dishing out audiences with unscripted shows involving nature, mankind and animals. However, leading players like Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Amazon.com, Inc.  (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc.

828,DISCA,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 26, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.1%. Moreover, it has an impressive earnings history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 10.6%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Scripps Networks is likely to beat on earnings with the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: Scripps Networks has an Earnings ESP of +1.36%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.25 per share is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24. Moreover, a positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Scripps Networks holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Notably, stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates.

(DISCA  -  Free Report) this year, is expected to perform well on the top-line front in the fourth quarter. Strong growth in distribution revenues in its U.S. Networks division should aid results.The company’s expansion efforts are a further positive. It has acquired TVN, Poland’s popular multi-platform media company, to fortify its position in the European market as well as enhance its advertising business. Additionally, it extended its food network partnership with Tribune Media Company (TRCO  -  Free Report). These deals are likely to boost results in the quarter.However, escalated costs are likely to hurt the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter as in the previous one. Weakness in the U.S. advertising market also poses a threat to its results in the soon-to-be-reported period.Another Stock to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector may also consider Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.  (NCLH  -  Free Report), as the stock has the right combination of elements to beat estimates in its next release.Norwegian Cruise Line has an Earnings ESP of +0.64% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

829,DISCA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Discovery Communications has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.6. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Discovery Communications’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 30.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Discovery Communications has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Discovery Communications stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Discovery Communications has a P/S ratio of about 2.1. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.6x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, DISCA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Discovery Communications currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Discovery Communications a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Discovery Communications is just 1.2, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, DISCA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Discovery Communications might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D. This gives DISCA a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower, while the full year estimate has seen two up and no down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 5.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and Consensus Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and Consensus | Discovery Communications, Inc. QuoteDespite this favorable trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineDiscovery Communications is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 35% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past three years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

830,DISCA,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 22, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.2%. Norwegian Cruise Line has also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of approximately 3.8%.Notably, the stock’s impressive earnings history is well reflected in its robust price performance in a year's time. While the company has gained 24.7%, the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry rallied 20.5%.Things look rosy for the company in the soon-to-be reported quarter as well. Strong passenger ticket revenues are likely to boost results.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings has remained stable at 63 cents per share over the last 30 days. However, this reflects a year-over-year improvement of 12.5%. The consensus mark for sales of $1.26 billion also indicates a 11.9% increase from the prior-year quarter.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.We expect Norwegian Cruise Line’s top line in the fourth quarter to be aided by increased ticket revenues. Additionally, improved pricing and an increase in Capacity Days should aid the company’s revenues. The impressive demand for cruise travel also seems to bode well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for passenger ticket revenues in the quarter is pegged at $841 million, above $759 million reported by the company in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Additionally, Capacity Days are projected to increase approximately 9% year over year. Gross yield is anticipated to be higher on a year-over-year basis.Furthermore, the company is expected to benefit from robust marketing initiatives in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, we expect high costs to limit Norwegian Cruise Line’s bottom-line growth in the quarter. Investments undertaken by the company to upgrade the facilities for travel are also pushing up costs. Moreover, an increase in fuel prices is further likely to prove detrimental to the company’s earnings growth.What Does Our Model Indicate?Our proven model shows that Norwegian Cruise Line is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the stock has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Norwegian Cruise Line has an Earnings ESP of +0.32%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Norwegian Cruise Line carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

832,DISCA,"After three consecutive days of gains, benchmarks finished in the red on Tuesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments renewed concerns over increase in the pace of rate hikes. Powell in his speech to Congress indicated that the U.S. economy is strengthening and signaled that the key rate might be increased at a gradual pace. However, investors fretted that the central bank’s move to stop the economy from overheating might lead to not just three but even four more rate increases this year. How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1.2%, or 300.96 points, to close at 25,410.03. The S&P 500 fell 1.3% to close at 2,744.28. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,330.35, losing 1.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 17.7% to close at 18.59. A total of 7.4 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, considerably lower than the last 20-session average of 8.3 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 3.38-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 3.07-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets Stumbles as Rate Hike Fears LoomIn his first appearance on Capitol Hill, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell presented an encouraging picture of the U.S economy. Powell expressed confidence that the coming few years will be “good years for the economy”. After all, Americans are willing to spend more and business houses have ramped up their investments, helping to boost productivity.Consequently, traders predicted that an upbeat economy will fuel inflation further and prompt the Fed to step in and hike rates at a faster pace.  Many of them are already predicting the Fed will increase rates four times instead of three.

833,DISCA,"Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch.When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So, the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.What’s the Optimum Strategy?However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book, price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), which develops, manufactures and sells data storage devices and solutions, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.2% in the trailing four quarters.

836,DISCA,"Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) performed well in the fourth quarter of 2017, wherein revenues and earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s earnings (excluding $2.46 from non-recurring items) of 47 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. The bottom line, however, declined 9.6% on a year-over-year basis owing to higher costs.Discovery’s fourth-quarter revenues of $1,864 million improved 11.5% on a year-over-year basis. Also, the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,783 million. In fact, revenue growth was witnessed across all major divisions of the company.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Discovery Communications, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Discovery Communications, Inc. QuotePerformance DetailsRevenues from Discovery’s U.S. Networks division rose 10% to $892 million. Segmental growth was driven by 7% and 8% growth in distribution and advertising revenues, respectively.Distribution revenues came in at $402 million compared with $375 million a year ago. Higher affiliate fee rates contributed to the increase. However, total portfolio subscribers decreased 5% while subscribers of the company’s fully distributed networks declined 3% in the quarter.Advertising revenues came in at $456 million compared with $421 million a year ago.  Revenues from other sources increased to $34 million from $16 million in the previous year. The substantial improvement was primarily owing to Discovery's joint venture with TEN for automotive media. Also, adjusted OIBDA was up 7% year over year at the segment. On the contrary, adjusted OIBDA margin declined to 54% from 55% a year ago.International Networks revenues rose 13% to $927 million. While Distribution revenues in the segment improved 15% to $479 million, advertising revenues increased 11% to $419 million.

Adjusted OIBDA margin slid to 27% from 28% a year ago.Revenues from the Education and Other division increased 10% to $45 million. This upside was primarily owing to increased International and digital textbook revenues at Education. In fact, the company intends to sell the majority stake in its Education business 2018 to Francisco Partners for $120 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close by Jun 30, 2018.LiquidityThe company exited 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $7,309 million and $14,755 million of debt (non-current portion) compared with $300 million and $7, 841 million, respectively, at the end of 2016.

The deal, subject to fulfilment of customary closing conditions, is expected to close by Mar 31, 2018.The merged entity will cater to nearly 20% of the ad-supported pay-TV audiences in the United States.

838,DISCA,"Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13%. However, Melco Resorts’ bottom line surpassed the consensus mark in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 50.4%.Q1 ExpectationsThe question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Melco Resorts will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 26 cents, higher than 24 cents in the year-ago quarter. Of late, the company’s earnings estimates have been stable. In the fourth quarter of 2017, it witnessed earnings growth of 58.9% on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $1,324 million, up 3.6% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s delve deeper to find out how the company’s top and bottom line will shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayWe believe the Melco Resorts’ revenues in the first quarter are likely to be driven by mass and premium mass gaming revenues in Macau. Further, the company’s integrated resort offerings are expected to boost traffic and revenues.  Per Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (“DICJ”), gross gaming revenues (GGR) rose year over year in all the three months of the quarter. This, in turn, indicates that the casino hub is firmly on road to recovery. We thus expect Melco Resorts’ performance in the region to get a boost in the to-be-reported quarter. Increased focus on non-gaming segments like rooms as well as food and beverages are further expected to drive the quarter’s results.Furthermore, the Philippines gaming industry is being supported by the country's robust economic growth and its expanding inbound tourism strategy. City of Dreams, Manila, continues to deliver year-on-year growth across all gaming segments in the Philippines, Thus, Melco’s Entertainment City property therein is poised to largely benefit from this improvement.However, the company’s first-quarter results might be affected by stringent capital controls by the Chinese government and increased audits of the junket industry by DICJ.Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Melco Resorts is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

839,DISCA,"SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (SEAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 numbers on May 8, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3%. Notably, in three out of trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings missed the consensus mark.Q1 ExpectationsThe question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether SeaWorld will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at a loss of 76 cents, wider than the loss of 66 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $197.7 million, up 6.1% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s delve deeper to find out how the company’s top and bottom lines will shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayHistorically, the first and fourth quarters of each year are seasonally weak for SeaWorld. The company’s top line is expected to decline sequentially but is poised to witness year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, SeaWorld is increasingly focusing on its marketing strategy to highlight brand attributes and new additions. All of these are expected to boost attendance in the quarter under review. Further, in an effort to drive attendance, the company is introducing new rides at most of its parks. However, declining attendance in California, Texas and Florida markets has been a cause of concern for the company.Furthermore, the company earlier launched tactical pricing initiatives at several of its locations. The combination of direct price increases and dynamic pricing initiatives might drive admissions per capita in the quarter under review. Nevertheless, we are optimistic about the company’s sincere efforts to control costs without denting efficiency and improve financial standing through debt refinancing. The company expects to achieve net cost savings of $40 million by the end of 2018.SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.

842,DISCA,"Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017) results on Feb 8, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company’s earnings (on an adjusted basis) of 77 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents. The bottom line, however, expanded 11.6% on a year-over-year basis owing to lower expenses and higher revenues.Quarterly revenues increased 2.9% year over year to $3,319 million. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,240.5 million. The outperformance was primarily owing to growth in the Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment units.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider This QuarterViacom’s results, in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, are likely to be hurt by weak affiliate revenues in the United States owing to loss of subscribers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2018 affiliate revenues is pegged at $1, 076 million, below $1,150 million in the previous quarter.In the United States, the company expects affiliate revenues to remain weak, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2018.  On the domestic front, the same is projected to decline in mid-single-digits in the current year.Apart from soft affiliate revenues, advertising revenues are likely to remain weak in the fiscal first quarter. In fact, soft advertising and affiliate revenues are likely to hurt the company’s primary division — Media Networks. Below-par performance of the company’s principal revenue generating division will naturally hurt its overall results. Moreover, higher programming expenses have the potential to hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company’s performance on the international front is anticipated to be much better. Additionally, strong growth in international consumer products is likely to boost ancillary revenues. Similarly, internal growth should boost total advertising revenues, mitigating the weakness on the domestic front. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2018 advertising revenues stands at $1,313 million, above $1,220 million in the previous quarter.Performance of the company’s other division — Filmed Entertainment — is likely to be hurt by a decline in theatrical revenues in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for theatrical revenues is projected at $89 million, well below $115 million in the preceding quarter.Apart from the earnings numbers, investors are likely to keenly await for detailed commentary on the potential Viacom - CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) merger.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not show conclusively that Viacom will beat earnings in first-quarter fiscal 2018. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Viacom has an Earnings ESP of -1.64% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 2 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Viacom carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction inconclusive. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings reflects a 5.8% decrease on a year-over-year basis, mainly due to weak advertising and affiliate revenues. The same for sales is projected at $3.1 billion, down 5.5% year over year.Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Viacom Inc. QuoteStocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector may consider the following stocks, possessing the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their next releases.Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.50% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company will report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27.Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.48%. The Zacks #3 Ranked company is expected to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 20.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

843,DISCA,"With media giant, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 6, investors are hoping for change in fortune after a disappointing 2017. In fiscal 2017, the company not only witnessed decline in both the top and bottom lines but also witnessed sharp fall in the operating income. Let’s find out how the company is going to fare in the quarter to be reported.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Disney will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 is currently pegged at $1.60. We observed that the consensus estimate has increased by a penny in the past 30 days, which reflects a year-over-year increase of nearly 3.2%. This ushers some confidence in the stock that had witnessed an earnings decline of 3% in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues of $15,196 million, up 2.8% from the year-ago period.Unleashing the Key SegmentsMedia Networks Likely to GainAfter witnessing a decline of 3% in the preceding quarter, the segment is likely to register a year-over-year improvement of 1.8% to $6,346 million, per analysts surveyed by Zacks, driven by gain in revenues at Cable Networks. Meanwhile, per analysts polled by Zacks, Cable Networks and Broadcasting are anticipated to report revenues of $4,531 million and $1,813 million up 2.3% and 0.4%, respectively.Falling subscriber base and higher programming costs at ESPN remain major concerns. Fresh NBA agreement and increase in contractual rate for NFL programming has been driving the overall programming cost higher for ESPN.Disney is striving to bring back ESPN’s golden days. However, it will take some time before the segment makes a strong come back. In an effort to attract online viewers, the company has inked a deal with video streaming, data analytics as well as commerce management company BAMTech. Moreover, the company will start online streaming services for ESPN sports in early 2018 and its branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 will carry Disney movies as well as TV shows. The ESPN-branded multi-sport streaming service will give an option to enjoy 10,000 live international, national and regional games every year. Tournaments like Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis, and college sports will be live streamed.Parks & Resorts Continues to Attract VisitorsDisney’s Parks & Resorts division, which have done exceptionally well in fiscal 2017, is likely to sustain the momentum in first-quarter fiscal 2018. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the segment reported revenue increase of 6% following gains of 12%, 9% and 6% in the third, second and first quarter, respectively. The consensus mark for revenues from the segment for the first-quarter is pegged at $4,866 million, up 6.8% year over year. Disney is focused on deploying its capital toward expansion of the Parks and Resorts business, consequently increasing market share and creating long-term growth opportunities.Star Wars: The Last Jedi to Lift Studio SegmentDisney’s Studio segment, which impressed investors with blockbuster hits in 2016, has somewhat disappointed in 2017 as the year has been dull for the movie industry. However, the company’s latest flick, Star Wars: The Last Jedi has performed well at the box office. Moreover, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco were also released during the quarter and did solid business at the box office. So far, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco have garnered above $1.3 billion, $850 million and $680 million, respectively. Analyst polled by Zacks expects Studio segment revenues of $2,767 million, down 9.8% year over year.Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walt Disney Company (The) QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Disney is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

844,DISCA,"Time Warner Inc. , which accepted the buyout offer of AT&T, Inc., is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Feb 1. In the trailing four quarters, this media and entertainment company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 11.8%. In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.2%.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Time Warner surpasses earnings estimate even this time. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors likely to impact the results.How are Estimates Shaping Up?After registering a marginal gain of 0.5% in the bottom line, Time Warner is likely to witness a sharp increase in year-over-year earnings in the fourth quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.45 up from $1.25 reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable over the past 30 days.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,460 million, up 7.2% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the rate of growth is likely to accelerate from 2.7% recorded in the preceding quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterWe believe that Time Warner’s foray into new markets, focus on original programming, cost reduction and increasing investments in key areas bode well. Additionally, the company has been expanding digital presence to enable consumers to access content from several platforms and devices. Its investments in video content and technology continue to drive results. All these initiatives are likely to be reflected in the quarter to be reported.However, management expects Home Box Office (“HBO”) programming cost to increase at a higher rate in the final quarter due to the timing of original programming and availability of acquired content. Further, management hinted that operating income at Warner Bros. is likely to decline in the final quarter of 2017 due to the number and mix of theatrical home entertainment releases, including the comparison with the release of Suicide Squad in the year-ago period. It will also be affected by rise in costs related to the mix of theatrical releases and television series production. Decline in overall advertising spending and currency headwinds may also impact the performance.Time Warner's expects HBO subscription revenue growth rate to rise in final-quarter 2017 relative to the quarter under review. Although programming cost is projected to increase at a higher rate, growth in revenue will suffice to offset the same. Consequently, the company anticipates operating income growth during the fourth quarter.Time Warner Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Time Warner Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Time Warner Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Time Warner is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Time Warner has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% and a Zacks Rank #3.

845,DISCA,"CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15, after the closing bell.In the previous quarter, the company reported earnings beat of 3.7%. The bottom line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether CBS will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $1.15, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 3.6%. In the past 30 days, the consensus estimate has moved down by 2 cents.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,714 million up from $3,518 million in the prior-year quarter. The current estimate reflects a sequential growth of 17.1%.Factors Influencing This QuarterFrom the above estimates, it is apparent that CBS’ top and bottom lines are expected to grow year over year. We believe the company is likely to gain from increasing demand for content, rise in retransmission rates, expansion of direct-to-consumer business, sturdy digital presence, upfront fees from traditional distribution partners and higher international content licensing fees. Also, with the launch of Showtime's streaming service; online news channel, CBSN; and over-the-top service, CBS All Access, the company has started generating incremental revenues.CBS’s sustained focus on increasing subscription-based revenues is likely to drive long-term growth as well. In the fourth quarter, analysts surveyed by Zacks anticipate revenues from affiliate and subscription fees to increase by more than 15% year over year to $888 million. Furthermore, the company has an extensive library of premium content that it monetizes over multiple platforms.Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues from adverting to be $1,779 million, down 0.9% year over year. Meanwhile, CBS remains highly vulnerable to the advertising market as it derives a major portion of revenues from the sale of advertising on its broadcast and cable networks and television, syndicated programming and online properties. Additionally, broadcast TV is losing ground to the internet and digital media.CBS Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise CBS Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CBS Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that CBS is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

846,DISCA,"Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report) moved a step closer to buying fellow U.S. company — Scripps Network Interactive  — following the receipt of antitrust clearance from the European Commission (EC).The company intends to buy Scripps Network in a cash and stock deal worth $14.6 billion (inclusive of the assumption of Scripps’ net debt of approximately $2.7 billion). The deal was announced in July 2017. Approval by the EC is a positive step toward the completion of the deal.However, clearance from the EC is not without conditions. In a bid to mitigate the threat of Discovery's increased bargaining power in Poland, following the completion of the acquisition, the commission has imposed concessions. Approval has been granted subject to the condition that Discovery will permit the distribution of TV channels — TVN24 and/or TVN24 BiS — by third parties on a non-exclusive, unbundled basis in Poland. We note that national commercial broadcaster in Poland – TVN – is owned by Scripps.Moreover, the commission has reportedly turned down a request from Poland for referring the proposed takeover deal to the Polish competition authority.Following the European approval, Discovery would be hoping to get the same from regulatory authorities in the United States among others. The deal is expected to close by Mar 31, 2018.Discovery Communications, Inc. Price Discovery Communications, Inc. Price | Discovery Communications, Inc. QuoteThe merged entity will cater to nearly 20% of the ad-supported pay-TV audiences in the United States. On completion, the acquisition is likely to substantially expand Discovery’s product portfolio and boost its earnings (adjusted) as well as free cash flow in the first year. Additionally, the shareholders of Discovery and Scripps Network will own 80% and 20% of the combined entity, respectively.Notably, both companies have struggled in the recent years as more and more consumers are moving from having cable subscriptions to online TV subscriptions. The rise of streaming platforms like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) has not helped matters in this respect. Zacks Rank & Key PickDiscovery carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

847,DISCA,"As 2018 fast approaches, we can’t help but look back on the past 12 months, a year that was a whirlwind politically, socially, culturally, and economically.While the U.S. dealt with everything from natural disasters and gun violence to protests about racial inequality and the sexual harassment reckoning, the stock market reached extraordinary highs.The market hit 62 daily all-time highs in 2017, notes CNBC, and the S&P 500 has returned almost 20% so far. And, the top performing sector, technology, which is up around 38% year-to-date, surpassed the worst-performing sectors (energy and telecom) by over 43 percentage points.Even with this overall positive economic sentiment, which has gotten a big boost from the new tax bill, merger and acquisition activity in 2017 has been relatively quiet; deals were down 35% year-to-date through mid-November.The deals that were announced this year, though, were major, and revolved around some of the biggest consumer and technology names. Here are 15 of the best mergers and acquisitions of 2017.1. Amazon Buys Whole FoodsEarlier this summer, e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced that it would be buying high-end organic grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion; the deal officially closed at the end of August. While the acquisition has been off to a rocky start, it gives Amazon hundreds of physical stores and provides the company a strong entryway into the competitive grocery and food industry.2. Intel Acquires MobileyeIntel INTC said in August that it had completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of Mobileye, a company that develops sensors and cameras for Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS); the Israel-based company is also known for its computer vision and machine learning technology. The $15.3 billion deal gives Intel a huge advantage in the growing self-driving car industry, a market they estimate will grow to $70 billion annually by 2030.3. United Technologies Buys Rockwell CollinsIn a major industry deal, United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) agreed to buy Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) for roughly $23 billion. This is one of the biggest moves in aviation history, and gives rise to an aerospace giant that will focus on the manufacturing of aircraft parts like touchscreen cockpit displays and jet engines, among many other things. United plans to combine its aerospace business with Rockwell Collins, creating a new unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.4. Disney To Buy Some of 21st Century Fox’s AssetsJust a few weeks ago, Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and 21st Century Fox FOXA announced a historic $52.4 billion deal that would see Mickey Mouse’s parent scoop up a good chunk of the media conglomerate’s assets, including the film studio 20th Century Fox, the company’s TV production arm 20th Century Fox Television, Fox-owned cable networks (including FX and National Geographic), and FOXA’s stakes in international networks like Star TV and Sky; Disney will also gain majority control of streaming service Hulu. The deal, however, will likely face intense regulatory scrutiny.5. JAB Holdings Acquires PaneraFor $7.5 billion, European investment firm JAB reached a deal to buy bakery-café chain Panera Bread earlier this year, creating a formidable food-focused portfolio that includes Keurig Green Mountain, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet’s Coffee & Tea, and Caribou Coffee Company. Additionally, Panera is a restaurant that has managed to post steady comparable sales growth and rising revenue at a time when many chains are hurting.6. Michael Kors Acquires Jimmy Choo“Affordable” luxury retailer Michael Kors KORS agreed to buy footwear brand Jimmy Choo, a popular name in the fashion world known for its towering stilettos, for about $1.2 billion in July. The purchase had been a long-rumored one, and Kors plans on using its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo’s footprint. This likely won’t be Kors’ last acquisition either, as the company is now focused on forming a new, “luxury group.”7. Coach Buys Kate SpadeCoach, now Tapestry Inc. TPR, shook up the fashion industry back in May when the company announced that it would be purchasing its smaller rival, Kate Spade, for $2.4 billion. The deal is both an effort to reach younger consumers—it recently signed a deal with millennial and Instagram icon Selena Gomez—and to rebrand itself as a broader “lifestyle assortment company.”8. CVS Buys AetnaAfter weeks of rumors and speculation, drugstore chain CVS CVS announced that it would acquire insurance provider Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for $69 billion. The two companies said this blockbuster deal would rein in health care costs and transform CVS’s 9,700 pharmacy storefronts into community medical hubs for primary care and basic procedures. It’s expected to close in the second half of 2018, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.9. Gilead Acquires Kite PharmaIn October, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) shelled out $11.9 billion for Kite Pharma, marking its biggest acquisition ever. The deal gives the biopharmaceutical company access to a promising cancer therapy, and hopefully makes it less reliant on antiviral treatments like its Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. In particular, the cancer therapy is a CAR-T drug, which many in the industry believe will transform the cancer treatment market.10. Cisco Acquires BroadSoftIn a move that will grow its software footprint, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) paid nearly $2 billion for BroadSoft , a company that sells cloud-based call control software, a product that is often re-labeled and sold by traditional telephone companies to their customers. This acquisition is what IT vendors dub “the future of work,” as it uses technology meant to make it easier for workgroups to communicate with each other.11. Apple Buys ShazamRecently, iPhone maker Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) confirmed that it has acquired Shazam for $400 million, a company that lets users identify songs, movies, TV shows, and commercials from short audio clips. The tech giant will be able to use Shazam to boost Apple Music. It also hopes to integrate Shazam more deeply into iOS, and utilize the app’s augmented reality technology to improve its ARKit efforts.12. Arby’s Roark Buys Buffalo Wild WingsJust last month, Arby’s owner Roark Capital Group announced that it would be acquiring chicken wing chain Buffalo Wild Wings BWLD for $2.4 billion. Arby’s has successfully executed a turnaround strategy by specifically emphasizing its unique fast-food menu selection; the firm hopes to apply this similar formula to Buffalo Wild Wings. Arby’s will also assume the debt of BWLD.13. Meredith Corp. Buys Time Inc.The Meredith Corporation MDP closed a $2.8 billion deal in November to buy Time TIME that would create a publishing giant. The Des Moines–based Meredith publishes the magazines Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, and Shape, among others, while Time owns Time, People, Sports Illustrated, Fortune, Entertainment Weekly, and many other print and digital media properties, and has been in business since 1922.14. Discovery Acquires Scripps Networks InteractiveIn November, Discovery’s (DISCA  -  Free Report) $14.6 billion acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive  received overwhelming shareholder support.

848,DISCA,"Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report) has faced multiple headwinds like dwindling advertisement revenues, escalated debt levels and high costs so far in 2017. Consequently, shares of the company have declined 28.3%, significantly underperforming its industry’s rally of 10.3% on a year-to-date basis.Lets have a deeper look into the headwinds.Like its fellow-players in the broader media sector, Discovery is struggling due to the sluggish overall advertising market in the United States. The prevalence of cord cutting and the rise of online video streaming providers like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) are huge challenges for companies like Discovery.Moreover, Discovery’s third quarter 2017 results suffered due to the 5% decline in portfolio subscribers in the company's U.S. Networks unit. This loss in U.S. subscribers was higher than the comparable year-ago figure.  The accelerating loss U.S. subscribers by Discovery is very concerning.Below-par performance of the Education and Other unit is hurting the company as well. Furthermore, the fact that Discovery is a highly leveraged company poses a threat. This is indicated by the fact that the ratio of its long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) is currently over 200. This compares unfavorably to the figure of 82.9 for the S&P 500 Index.Again, Discovery's trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undercuts its growth potential. Not only has the company’s ROE of 22.2% declined in a year, it compares unfavorably with ROE of 39.3% and 16% for its industry, reflecting the fact that it is efficient in using shareholders’ funds.Additionally, high operating expenses are hurting the company’s bottom line. Though positive on Discovery’s impending acquisition of Scripps Network , we note that costs are likely to increase further in the event of the materialization of the deal.Not a Broker FavoriteDiscovery's earnings estimates reflect the pessimism surrounding the stock. The company has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 37.7% downward, over the last 60 days. Also, the current-year earnings estimates have moved down 13% in the same time frame.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreTaking into account the above-mentioned headwinds, we believe that investors should stay away from the stock right now. Discovery's Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) also supports our view, indicating that the stock is likely to underperform the broader market over the next one to three months.Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of F highlights its short-term unattractiveness.Stock to ConsiderInvestors interested in the sector may consider NTN Buzztime (NTN  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

849,DISCA,"Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) has decided to buy another 24.5% stake in Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) for a consideration of $70 million. After the completion of the deal, Discovery will command 70% stake in OWN. Notably, the talk-show network was established in 2011 as a joint venture between Discovery and Harpo Inc. of Oprah Winfrey.OWN, a video channel, is immensely popular with U.S. African-American women and carries high brand value across all distribution platforms. Per the deal, Oprah Winfrey will remain CEO of OWN with an exclusivity commitment through 2025.Facing stiff competition and dwindling advertisement revenues, the media sector is witnessing large scale concentration. Discovery has decided to acquire lifestyle media giant Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.  in a $14.6 billion ($11.9 billion excluding debt) deal, which is expected to be closed in early 2018.Upon completion, the acquisition is likely to substantially expand Discovery’s product portfolio, plus boost its earnings (adjusted) as well as free cash flow in the first year following closure. The combined company will have nearly 20% of ad-supported pay-TV viewership in the United States.We are also encouraged by Discovery's joint venture with TEN for automotive media. The move marks Discovery's entry into direct-to-consumer offerings. Discovery will take a majority controlling interest in the venture with the option of acquiring 100% of the new venture. Discovery's decision to renew its distribution partnership with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) is also a long-term positive.Nevertheless, Discovery stated that the total portfolio subscribers in the company's U.S. Networks unit declined 5% in the third quarter of 2017. This loss in U.S. subscribers was higher than the comparable year-ago figure. Although advertising revenues increased in the quarter, the overall advertising market in the United States is facing challenges. Discovery expects ad revenues to be flat in the fourth quarter. Escalated debt levels and high costs pose further challenges to the company.Price Performance of Discovery CommunicationsDiscovery’s shares have declined 4.62% compared with the industry’s loss of 3.36% in the last three months. The company currently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). A better-ranked stock from the same space is NTN Buzztime Inc. (NTN  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

850,DISCA,"Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp. (VAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 numbers on May 3, before the opening bell.The company’s call transfer, Encore and linkage programs have substantially helped it in driving tours in 2017 and the trend is expected to have continued in the first quarter as well. Also, higher sales along with benefits from reduced loyalty fee and lower cost of Marriott Rewards points are expected to have driven earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.However, shares of the company have risen 8.6% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 25.3%.Let’s discuss how the company’s top and bottom line will shape up in the first quarter of 2018.Factors at PlayThe company’s distinguished marketing programs and continued surge in newest sales distribution have effectively aided sales in 2017. In 2017, the company’s total revenues increased 7.9% year over year and the northward trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter as well. Subsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $534.07 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.6%.Meanwhile, Marriott Vacations expects to directly benefit from reduced royalty fee, lower cost of Marriott Rewards points from Marriott and incremental co-marketing funds provided by Marriott’s credit card agreements. In 2017, the company’s net income rose 65.1% and the trend is expected to have continued in the first quarter of 2018 as well. The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.50, suggesting 23% growth from the prior-year quarter.Despite high expenses associated with hotel operations, we believe that the company’s first-quarter earnings will grow on higher sales from various initiatives and cost savings resulting from joining Marriott on the reward program.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Suggest a BeatOur quantitative model predicts that Marriott Vacations does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Marriott Vacations has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marriott Vacations carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

851,DISCA,"As we enter the month of May, the current economic expansion has just become the second longest in U.S. history. Currently, the Fed is meeting to deliberate whether to raise rates, as part of the process of winding down monetary stimulus, which largely fueled a turnaround. But at 106 months, or eight years and 10 months, the current economic expansion shows no signs of cooling off. Experts believe that the low and slow nature of this expansion is the primary reason for its longevity. Several sectors such as investment and housing are facing multiple headwinds at this point. But low unemployment and resilient consumption levels are likely to remain constant in the near future. This is why it makes sense to add hiring and consumer discretionary stocks to your portfolios.Slow & Steady Pace Fuels LongevityImmediately, after the 2008 crisis, individuals and corporations alike were unwilling to accept high levels of risk. After all, debt taken on during the last boom period was still being worked off. The severity of the last economic crisis was such that investment occurred at a slow and steady pace.The slow pace of growth and sluggish inflation helped the Federal Reserve maintain a low rate environment for an extended period. This helped equity markets to expand to levels near four times higher than those witnessed during March 2009, when they hit rock bottom. The gradual nature of growth is possibly why economists don’t think that a near-term recession is in the offing. Most of them believe that the recovery will extend until July 2019, which would make it the longest on record.Labor Market Strong, Consumption SteadyHowever, several components of GDP are facing serious challenges at present. For instance, Trump’s trade-related actions versus China could significantly impair business investment. Further, the spike in materials prices due to Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum could impede manufacturing. Soaring home prices and mortgage rates are also threatening the housing recovery.But a strong labor market and, consequently, steady consumption levels are likely to fuel growth in the future. Though evidence of higher inflation has recently become available, the cost of living remains more or less constant. Economists believe that this factor along with tax cuts and strong hiring will fuel household spending. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remains at a 17-year low of 4.1%, one which usually signifies full employment. Fresh evidence of wage growth has also become recently available.Our ChoicesThe current economic expansion has just become the second longest on record. A slow and steady level of growth is likely to ensure its longevity, at least until next year. A strong labor market and steady consumption levels are likely to fuel growth in the future.Investing in consumer discretionary and hiring stocks looks like a winning option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

853,DISCA,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (LYV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, after market close.Live Nation delivered its seventh consecutive year of record results in 2017 with revenue growth across all its segments — concerts, sponsorship and ticketing. The company expects strong consumer demand, and decent supply of new and established artists to continue driving the top line. In fact, driven by a robust brand portfolio, Live Nation’s shares have rallied 22.2% in the past year, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 0.8%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to have affected the company’s first-quarter 2018 revenues and earnings.Top Line Likely to Face Pressure Despite Sales-Building EffortsThough Live Nation's various initiatives to drive sales encourage us, we remain slightly apprehensive of revenue growth in the first quarter. The company typically experiences lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year, as its outdoor venues are primarily used for festivals from May through October. Resultantly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.34 billion, reflecting 5.4% decline from the prior-year quarter.Nonetheless, various digital initiatives undertaken by Live Nation to improve ticket booking experience should continue to drive revenues, going forward. Meanwhile, sponsorship & advertising business has been well balanced with both parts of the business growing revenues in double digits throughout 2017.High Costs to Dent EarningsFrom these rigorous sales building efforts, Live Nation incurs high expenses. Especially since the first quarter is a slower volume quarter, the company’s cost burden is likely to increase. Also in 2017, total operating costs increased 27.4% year over year and the trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter as well.Subsequently, per the consensus estimate, the company is anticipated to report a loss of 29 cents, showing a deterioration of 31.8% from the prior-year quarter.Quantitative Model PredictionOur proven model shows that Live Nation does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.66%.Zacks Rank: Live Nation has a Zacks Rank #3.

In the last reported quarter, sales of $52.7 million improved 27% year over year and the upside trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well.As far as adjusted earnings are concerned, the consensus mark is pegged at 16 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 700%. The anticipated rise in the metric is likely to be driven by margin expansion, resulting from the company’s continuous focus on product and channel mix improvement, lower levels of discontinued merchandise, and stabilization of sourcing revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted earnings per share was 15 cents, up from a penny in the fourth quarter of 2016, thereby setting a positive trend.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.  The sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.

857,DISCA,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in DISCA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen six estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with two upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $2.23 a share a month ago to its current level of $2.02.Also, for the current quarter, Discovery Communications has seen four downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 45 cents a share from 61 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 7.6% in the past month.Discovery Communications, Inc.

859,DISCA,"News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether the company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, this diversified media conglomerate outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 88.2%.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions to get a clear view of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable in the last 30 days and is currently pegged at 19 cents, flat year over year. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenue of $2,133 million, up from $2,116 million in the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing Q2News Corporation is diversifying its revenue streams through strategic acquisitions and operational enhancement. The company is expanding its digital offerings, emphasizing on real estate businesses and augmenting digital subscriber base. Further, it has been concentrating on cost cutting.However, advertising, which forms a major part of total revenues, continues to be highly vulnerable to the economic conditions. Advertising revenues in the News and Information Services segment remained flat during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This is because contributions from the buyouts of Australian Regional Media and Wireless Group, favorable foreign currency fluctuations and modest rise in digital advertising revenues were offset by sluggishness in the print advertising market and lower free standing insert revenues at News America Marketing.Previously, management had highlighted that FOX SPORTS Australia is likely to struggle against higher costs during the second quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year.Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues from News and Information Services division to decline marginally by 1%. However, revenues in Cable Network Programming and Digital Real Estate Services segments are expected to increase 10.6% and 13.6%, respectively. Book Publishing division is expected to register revenue growth of 1.5%.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | News Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that News Corporation is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

860,DISCA,"The New York Times Company (NYT  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. In the trailing four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 49.2%. In the preceding quarter, this diversified media conglomerate delivered a positive earnings surprise of 44.4%. Therefore, investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the company surpasses earnings estimate even this time.Analysts polled by Zacks expect fourth-quarter revenues to be $467 million, up more than 6% from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the bottom line is anticipated to remain flat year over year. Being stable in the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at 30 cents.Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Strategic Endeavors on TrackThe New York Times Company has been realigning cost structure and streamlining operations to increase efficiencies. It has offloaded assets that bear no direct relation with the core operations in order to concentrate on online activities. The company is fast acclimatizing to the changing face of the multiplatform media universe, and has already included mobile and reader application products in its portfolio.Furthermore, the company is concentrating on online activities as evident from its pay-and-read model. Notably, its pricing system for NYTimes.com was launched on Mar 28, 2011. The company notified that the number of paid digital subscribers reached 2,487,000 at the end of the third quarter of 2017 — rising 154,000 sequentially and 59.1% year over year.Apart from gearing up to become an optimum destination for news and information, The New York Times Company is now focusing on service journalism with verticals like Cooking, Watching and Well. In this regard, it acquired The Wirecutter and its sister site — The Sweethome — that recommends people about technology gear, home products and other consumer services.Ad Revenue a ConcernThe U.S. newspaper publishing industry has been grappling with sinking advertising revenues. This downturn in the industry witnessed in the last few years aggravated with a fall in print readership as readers started opting for online news. Consequently, the print-advertising model became increasingly redundant.The New York Times Company’s print advertising revenues fell 20.1% in the third quarter of 2017, following a decline of 10.5% in the preceding quarter. Total advertising revenues decreased 9% during the quarter under review. The company had earlier hinted that total advertising revenues in the final quarter are likely to decline in the high-single digits.New York Times Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  New York Times Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | New York Times Company (The) QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model shows that The New York Times Company is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

861,DISCA,"World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 financial numbers, before the opening bell on Feb 8. In the previous quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 40%.The company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters by an average of 7.4%. Here’s a discussion of the determinants of the fourth-quarter results.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether World Wrestling Entertainment will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 20 cents, in comparison with year-ago quarter earnings of 10 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by a penny over the past 7 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $206 million compared with $194.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterHaving garnered stellar revenues in 2017, WWE has become investors’ favorite now. In the first, second and third quarter of 2017, the company registered top-line growth of 10%, 8% and 13.5%, respectively. We believe WWE will continue to garner record revenues as it has not only extended its earlier deal but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program — Raw and SmackDown — in different countries. Further, subscriber growth and worldwide increase in TV rights fees are likely to provide an impetus to the top line further.Revenues from international sponsorship, which increased 29% in the first nine months of 2017, will receive an additional stimulus from WWE’s agreement with sports marketing agency Lagardère Sports. We believe with increasing subscription-based video streaming services, WWE Network, through its vast presence in more than180 countries, will be able to capitalize on the trend.Moreover, management is optimistic about achieving another great year of adjusted OIBDA growth. For the fourth quarter, adjusted OBIDA is projected in the range of $31-$35 million buoyed by top-line growth, WWE Network subscribers and contractual television rights fees.However, WWE which distributes home entertainment content in both physical (DVD and Blu-Ray) as well as digital formats has been reeling under lower revenues. In 2016, home entertainment net revenues came in at $13.1 million in comparison with $13.4 million and $27.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Further, the trend continued in the first, second and third quarter of 2017, with home entertainment revenues declining 27%, 3.2% and 8%, respectively. The decline can be attributed to consumers’ consistent shift to digital formats, downloaded or streamed over the Internet. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

862,DISCA,"Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF.A  -  Free Report), producer and distributor of motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video release, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8, after the closing bell. Over the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 75.5%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing the QuarterLions Gate’s strategic acquisitions and alliances to enhance its competitive position and maximize returns, along with building a diversified portfolio, bode well for the company. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the Media Networks segment formed after the acquisition of Starz reported revenue growth of 7% year over year, largely gaining from strong subscription growth at Star.  Incidentally, Starz witnessed subscription growth of 400,000 on a sequential basis, aided by Power and Outlander. Notably, the addition of Starz is aiding Lions Gate to emerge as a major player in the TV space and helping it regain lost ground in the streaming network. Moreover, the company has invested in The Immortals to capitalize on the increasing popularity of eSports. It expects the eSports market to grow more than$1 billion in 2018.However, fewer movie releases in fiscal 2018 compared with the previous year might hurt Motion Pictures revenue performance. Dismal television production performance in the past few quarters has also been a concern for investors. In the fiscal second quarter, Television Production revenues declined 4.7%, following a fall of 18.6% in the preceding quarter. Further, the escalating cost of motion picture production and marketing in recent years may jeopardize Lions Gate’s margins.Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lions Gate is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter.

863,DISCA,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, before the market opens.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.9%. Norwegian Cruise Line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of approximately 5.9%.However, things do not look rosy for the company in the soon-to-be reported quarter. High costs owing to the upsurge in fuel prices are likely to hurt results.In fact, the stock has been grappling with high operating expenses for quite some time. This is evident from the company’s disappointing price movement in a year’s time. While the stock has shed  2.9% of its value, the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry gained 0.8%.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.We expect high costs to limit bottom-line growth at Norwegian Cruise Line in the first quarter of 2018. In the last reported quarter, an increase in cruise operating expenses affected the company’s earnings growth and the first quarter is unlikely to be any different. Rise in fuel costs are primarily responsible for pushing up total expenses. The company expects fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, to be $450 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Also, oil prices have been on an uptrend lately and were up approximately 8% in the January-to-March period. We note that high oil prices do not bode well for travel-focussed companies like Norwegian Cruise Line as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures.This apart, investments undertaken by the company to upgrade the facilities for travel are also pushing up costs, which are likely to hurt the bottom line in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Net Cruise Cost per Capacity Day in the quarter is pegged at $154, above $145 unveiled by the company in the fourth quarter of 2017.Moreover, foul weather, which was prevalent in the January-to-March period, might hurt results as well. In fact, higher marketing and promotional expenses along with increased cruise costs are likely to dent margins.However, increased ticket revenues should boost Norwegian Cruise Line’s top line in the soon-to-be reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for passenger ticket revenues in the first quarter of 2018 stands at $875 million, above $787 million unveiled by the company a year ago.  Additionally, Capacity Days are projected to increase approximately 11% year over year.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. QuoteWhat Does Our Model Indicate?Our proven model shows that Norwegian Cruise Line is unlikely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.

The company’s earnings (excluding 10 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.05 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents.

865,DISCA,"Discovery Communications, Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 4.2%. Its earnings (on an adjusted basis) of 68 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents. Also, the bottom line contracted 4.23% on a year-over-year basis.Discovery’s second-quarter revenues of $1,745 million improved 2.2% on a year-over-year basis. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,764.4 million.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Discovery is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: Discovery has an Earnings ESP of +0.46%, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A positive Zacks ESP is indicative of a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Discovery carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Notably, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Discovery’s joint venture with The Enthusiast Network (“TEN”) in August for automotive media is likely to aid results in the third quarter. This move marks the company’s entry into direct-to-consumer offerings. Discovery will take a majority controlling interest in the new venture with options to acquire 100% of its business.Notably, Discovery has inked multiple deals to expand its reach. In September, the company renewed its distribution partnership with AT&T. The long-term carriage deal is aimed at expanding its portfolio of networks across more platforms. Following its renewal, the company's networks are available on all platforms of DirecTV.  This strategy is further expected to buoy results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The company’s initiatives to reward shareholders through buybacks are also impressive.However, declining advertising revenues have been hurting Discovery for quite some time now, besides foreign currency movements and higher costs. This might hit the top line in the third-quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter advertising revenues stands at $693 million, much below the previous quarter’s reported figure of $805 million.Additionally, high costs are expected to affect the bottom line in the third quarter. Total costs are expected to grow in the range of high single to low double digits in the third quarter.Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Discovery Communications, Inc.

866,DISCA,"Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues beat the same. Both earnings and revenues improved on a year-over-year basis.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlaySirius XM’s bottom line in the third quarter is likely to be affected by a spike in costs. Also, the company completed the $480 million Pandora (P  -  Free Report) investment in the third quarter. This is likely to further pressurize the bottom line. The slowdown in subscription growth may also hurt results in the third quarter. The company added 0.70 million subscriptions in the first half of 2017, significantly below the number, added a year ago.The company’s high-debt levels are another cause for concern. Increased leverage coupled with stiff competition from rivals may also act as headwinds for the company in the third quarter.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders with dividends and buybacks are impressive.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Las Vegas Sands has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the third quarter. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Sirius XM has an Earnings ESP of +3.17%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though the company’s positive ESP increases confidence about an earnings surprise, its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.Hence, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Sirius XM Holdings Inc. QuoteStocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector may consider the following stocks with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this quarter:Discovery Communications, Inc.

867,DISCA,"Leading media and film entertainment firm Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) has decided to strengthen its foothold in Europe. Recently, Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN), a division of Viacom, acquired Italian free-to-air channel LCN 49 from Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. . Viacom will use this channel to facilitate the launching of its Italian version of Spike TV network in October 2017.Viacom already has a footprint in Italy. It operates Paramount Channel and VH1 FTA DTT channels in the country. Moreover, on Aug 25, Viacom entered into a 50-50 joint venture with media group De Agostini Editore for Super! which is FTA channel for children.The company looks to become the fifth-largest TV broadcaster in Italy within a year. Last month, The Hollywood Reporter stated that VIMN plans to offer a new subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) -- Paramount+ -- in Denmark, Sweden and Norway from October 2017.Facing stiff competition and dwindling advertisement revenues, the media sector is witnessing large scale concentration. Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) has decided to acquire lifestyle media giant Scripps Networks in a $14.6 billion ($11.9 billion excluding debt) deal, which is expected to be closed in early 2018.Meanwhile, the $85.4 billion mega merger deal of AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Time Warner Inc.  is currently under review by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and competition authorities in other foreign countries. The deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017.Viacom is leaving no stone unturned to turn around its fortunes. In order to combat the challenges, Viacom unveiled a new strategic plan in February 2017. As part of the five-point plan, it is focusing on six of its core brands -- BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr. and Paramount. At this stage, we believe expansion of operations in Europe will bode well for the company in the future.Price Performance of ViacomViacom’s shares have declined 22.83% compared with the industry’s loss of 2.53% in the last three months.

868,DISCA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Discovery Communications has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Discovery Communications’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 26.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Discovery Communications has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Discovery Communications stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management, and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Discovery Communications’ P/CF ratio of 3.94 is much lower than the broader industry average of 30.9, which indicates that the stock is significantly undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookDiscovery Communications currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Discovery Communications a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Discovery Communications might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of F. This gives DISCA a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen two up and three down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped 5.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and Consensus  Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and Consensus | Discovery Communications, Inc. Quote Despite the bearish analyst sentiments, the stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Thus, we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near termBottom LineDiscovery Communications is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 38% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

Shares have lost about 8.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Discovery Lags Q2 Earnings, To Buy Scripps NetworksDiscovery Communications performed disappointingly in the second quarter of 2017 reporting lower-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company’s earnings (on an adjusted basis) of 68 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents. Also, the bottom line contracted 4.23% on a year-over-year basis.Discovery’s second-quarter revenues of $1,745 million improved 2.17% on a year-over-year basis, despite the adverse impact of foreign currency movement. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,764.4 million.The increase in revenues witnessed in the U.S. Networks and International Networks units was somewhat mitigated by the dismal show of the Education and Other division. However, quarterly adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) increased 2% year over year.Quarterly PerformanceRevenues in the US Networks division rose 2% to $890 million. Segmental growth was driven by a 13% rise in Other revenues to $18 million. While Distribution revenues increased 4% to $400 million, revenues from Advertising sources were flat at $472 million. Also, adjusted OIBDA was up 4% year over year for the segment.

Also, adjusted OIBDA decreased 4% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted OIBDA margin slid to 29% compared with 31% a year ago.However, revenues from the Education and Other division fell 4% to $44 million. This decline was primarily due to the impact of sale of the Raw and Betty production studios of the company.LiquidityThe company exited the second quarter of 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $206 million and $8,158 million of debt (non-current portion) compared with $300 million and $7, 841 million, respectively, at the end of 2016.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and Consensus  Discovery Communications, Inc. Price and Consensus | Discovery Communications, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for value based on our styles scores.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are looking for an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

871,DISCA,"While I thought the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand was lost forever to the late ‘90s-early ‘00s era, I clearly was not paying attention. On Friday, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment Inc. announced that it completed its $30 million initial public offering, selling 2.5 million shares at $12 each.The company will begin trading later today on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “CSSE.”Chicken Soup’s IPO is the largest public offering to be completed under Regulation A+, a format created by the JOBS Act that aimed to give smaller companies access to capital; this will also be the first Reg A+ IPO to list on the higher tier Nasdaq Global Market.""We are extremely pleased with the investor demand for our IPO,"" said William J. Rouhana, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. ""Our fans and customers are truly loyal and passionate about our brand, and we are thrilled to have them join us as shareholders. To accommodate such demand, we upsized the offering repeatedly until we reached the $30 million maximum under our offering circular.""Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment was actually created last year as a subsidiary by its then parent company, Chicken Soup for the Soul Holdings, to focus specifically on video production.The company has produced series like Chicken Soup for the Soul’s Hidden Heroes for CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), and Project Dad for TLC network, owned by Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report). CSSE also recently launched CSS Network, which the company describes as “our branded direct-to-consumer network” that will offer “original and third-party video content on a fee-per-view, subscription or advertising-supported basis.”But the Chicken Soup brand goes back much farther. Founded in 1993, Chicken Soup for the Soul was created by motivational speakers Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, and is a well-known name among self-help book fans. It has a portfolio of around 250 books, which consist of inspiring stories for targeted audiences ranging from teenagers to mothers to pet owners, among many others. Many of the books have become best-sellers, and the company says it has sold 11 million copies worldwide.Chicken Soup’s founders sold the company back in 2008 to a group that included Mr. Rouhana. Since then, the company has expanded to sell foods, pet foods, apps, and advertising through its YouTube (GOOGL  -  Free Report) channel, in addition to its video ventures.Looking at its financial numbers, CSSE’s 2016 revenue totaled $8.1 million, growing from just $1.5 million a year earlier, according to its SEC filing.

875,DISCA,"CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 7, after the closing bell. In the previous quarter, the company reported earnings beat of 9.5%. Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 6.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether CBS will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 97 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of nearly 4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has improved by a penny in the past seven days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,114 million compared with $3,287 million reported in the prior-year quarter.We note that the stock has underperformed the industry in the past six months. The company’s shares have increased 2.7%, while the industry has gained 13%.Unlikely to Beat EstimatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that CBS is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The Most Accurate estimate is at 94 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 97 cents. So the ensuing difference – the Earnings ESP – is of -3.09%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with the negative Earnings ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Influencing this QuarterCBS, which has surpassed our estimate for nine straight quarters, might struggle to beat the same in the to-be-reported quarter. Analysts remain concerned about the company’s broadcast TV and radio performance, which are the major revenue and profit contributors. Both broadcast TV and radio are losing ground to the internet, digital media and cable television networks.Moreover, CBS remains highly vulnerable to the advertising market, as it derives a major portion of revenue from the sale of advertising on its broadcast and cable networks, television and radio stations, syndicated programming, and online properties. The deterioration in the economy of the major markets where it operates is likely to result in a fall in advertising demand, and in turn will impact the company’s revenue generating capabilities.Nevertheless, CBS’s sustained focus on increasing subscription-based revenues should drive long-term growth. Further, the company has an extensive library of premium content that it monetizes over multiple platforms. Moreover, CBS crossed $1 billion mark in revenues from retransmission consent and reverse compensation in 2016, a year earlier than anticipated. In 2017, management expects retransmission and reverse compensation to increase 25% from the prior year. The company aims to achieve $2.5 billion of revenues from retransmission and reverse compensation by 2020.CBS Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  CBS Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CBS Corporation QuoteStocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.

In the trailing four quarters, this media and entertainment company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 16.5%. In the preceding quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 15.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.How are Estimates Shaping Up?Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Time Warner surpasses earnings estimate even this time. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.19 down from $1.29 reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by a penny in the past seven days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7,340 million, up about 6% from the year-ago quarter.Time Warner forms part of the Consumer Discretionary sector, which occupies a space in the bottom 44% of the Zacks Classified sectors (9 out of 16). As per the latest Earnings Preview report, total revenues for the sector are anticipated to increase by 8.1%, while earnings are expected to remain flat.Time Warner Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Time Warner Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Time Warner Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing This QuarterWe believe Time Warner’s foray into new markets and digital endeavors augur well for its operational performance. We also think that management’s focus on original programming, cost reduction and increasing investments in key areas will enhance profitability. Additionally, the company has been expanding digital presence to enable consumers to access content from several platforms and devices. Its investments in video content and technology continue to drive results. All these initiatives may be reflected in the quarter to be reported. However, decline in overall advertising spending and currency headwinds may adversely impact performance.What Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model shows that Time Warner is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.21 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.19.
