6,SYK,"Medical supplier stocks collectively toppled to a 10-month low intraday Tuesday with Becton Dickinson (BDX) among the biggest losers after reports emerged that Amazon.com (AMZN) is planning to sell supplies to hospitals.X But analysts largely doubted Amazon could put pressure on manufacturers of ""higher tech"" products, including implantable devices.This would insulate companies like Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK), Cantel Medical (CMD), Conmed (CNMD) and Teleflex (TFX), Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote in a note to clients. In other industries, Amazon has typically disrupted the middlemen more than the manufacturers, he said.""In our view, Amazon's model may work for 'lower tech' products but is unlikely to work with 'higher tech' products,"" Matson said.Among lower-tech products he lists lower-priced single-use items that don't require service and are typically used without a sales representative present. Higher-tech items are often implantable, need service and require a sales rep present during their use.""Perhaps not surprisingly, lower-tech products are already typically sold through distributors such as Owens & Minor (OMI), while higher-tech products are typically sold directly by the manufacturer,"" he said. ""In our view, Amazon would simply represent another distribution channel for lower-tech products.""IBD'S TAKE: The stock market remains off its 2018 high. With the market still in the throes of a correction, it's important to keep tabs on key action by visiting The Big Picture.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar says Amazon could be a ""formidable player"" in the basic medical supplies category, which includes plastics, gloves, drapes and simple catheters. Two companies he covers in that group are Becton and Baxter (BAX).But Becton and Baxter are likely ""happy supplying to Amazon as well as other distributors,"" he said in a report to clients.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Becton sank 1.6% to finish at 215.40, after earlier falling as much as 2.5%. Collectively, medical supplier stocks toppled as much as 3.9% to a low last seen in April 2017. The group ended the day down 1.7%.Baxter, which trades in the medical products group, dipped 0.6% to 64.63. Medical product stocks broadly fell as much as 1.9% but were down marginally at the close.RELATED:Why Payers Won't Balk At $292,000 Price Tag For Vertex's New DrugIs Teva's Pharma's Restructuring Plan Actually 'More Reasonable'?Regeneron Could Benefit From 'Lackluster' Data Presented By These Rivals

11,SYK,"Many stock mutual fund managers are basking in the warm glow of 2017's hot performance numbers for the broad market. The S&P 500 index rose 1.11% in December, lifting the fourth quarter's gain to 6.64% and capping a 21.83% year. The Dow Jones industrials surged 28.11% for the year, on the way to topping 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday.X The S&P 500 is already up another 2.63% so far this year. The Dow is up 2.20%.U.S. diversified stock mutual funds edged up 0.73% on average in December to extend their gains in Q4 to 5.13% and in 2017 to 18.26%, according to Lipper Inc. World equity funds, powered in part by a weaker dollar, turned in gains of 2% in December, 4.92% in Q4 and 28.52% last year.General domestic taxable bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.57% on top of a 0.39% December move. They finished the year up 4.86%.But fund managers and investment strategists have also turned their eyes to 2018, where many expect more-modest gains overall.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersTop Mutual Funds In Q4Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWhy Buffalo Discovery Fund Keeps OutperformingWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Fund managers and strategists expect to rely more on foreign stocks and on value equities for their gains. Still, fund managers certainly have not abandoned U.S. equities totally, having 2018 bets on stocks like First Solar (FSLR), part of the S&P 500; Amazon (AMZN), a key piece of the Nasdaq Composite; and Boeing (BA), the best performing Dow Jones industrial average stock in 2017.One reason fund managers and strategists expect to search further afield overall for big returns in 2018: history. Since 1963, the S&P 500 has rallied more than 15% annually in 19 years. And each time it did that, in the following year the broad market's gains averaged just 7.5%.Two more reasons for the expected rotation into more foreign stocks and value equities: Cheaper valuations for many foreign equities give them more room to run in '18, and forecasts for faster economic growth abroad.""We're in a synchronous growth pattern,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist for Nuveen Asset Management and manager or co-manager of seven of its stock mutual funds with a combined $1.7 billion in assets. ""It's rare that we have growth in the U.S. as well as in key markets abroad. In this sort of economic environment, value (stocks) overall should beat growth (stocks).""Stocks should also continue to get a tailwind from the Federal Reserve's slow tempo of interest rate hikes. ""The slow pace is reassuring to investors,"" said Allen Bond, a manager of $6.6 billion Jensen Quality Growth Fund (JENSX), which outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as the past three and 10 years, and just fell short over the past five years.One key reason why Doll expects value to outperform is that corporate earnings have been on a roll and should remain that way. That's indicative of a rising economic tide that lifts stocks of all stripes, including modestly priced value-oriented ones, Doll said. Further, as the strengthening economy lifts earnings of both types of stocks, investors are likely to flock to value stocks, which are more attractively priced than growth stocks.""Inflation and interest rates have been behaving themselves and letting earnings growth go to the bottom line,"" he added.Doll added that U.S. tax reform should boost corporate earnings. Also, both corporate CEO and consumer confidence is up. And demand is strong for many goods and services, especially in the technology, health care and certain consumer areas.IBD'S TAKE: To see how tax reform impacts individuals like you, check out this IBD report.""Much of the consumer area has been doing OK, with capital spending improving before the tax bill, (enactment of which) will accentuate capital spending,"" Doll said. ""That should be good for industrials and many tech stocks.""Within the tech space, Doll likes software companies and credit card companies, which use software to facilitate digital payments for transactions. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) were among the top four holdings of Doll's largest portfolio, $563.8 million Nuveen Large Cap Core (NLCIX), as of Nov. 30.Among health care stocks, ""I would highlight diversified biotech companies and managed care providers,"" he said. ""I'm less interested in pharmaceuticals and some equipment companies. . . . We prefer diversified biotech to pharma as they have faster growth and similar valuation characteristics.""Nuveen Large Cap Core also held cloud computing services provider Red Hat (RHT). Red Hat enables a client's noncloud enterprise software to jibe with cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was a third holding. UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.Additional holdings included First Solar, Amazon and Boeing. Solar energy company First Solar was new to the fund in November. It posted Q3 results on Oct. 27 that crushed analysts' expectations. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 0% and 64% the past two stanzas. Hot as a solar flare in 2017, the stock gained 110.41%.Trading around 125, First Solar is extended. It has a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Its IBD SMR Rating is A. That means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Amazon soared nearly 56% last year. The e-commerce leader slid on Dec. 29 amid reports that President Trump had called for Amazon — also a leader in cloud services — to pay the U.S. Postal Service higher fees for package deliveries. Separately, the FAANG stock says it shipped more than 5 billion items in '17 through its Prime program, for which customers pay $99 a year.Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1,213.51.And aerospace and defense titan Boeing gapped up more than 2% on Dec. 12 after saying it would raise its dividend 20%, to $1.71 a share, up from $1.42, giving shares a 2.3% dividend yield. Boeing also increased its stock buyback program.In 2018, Dow-component Boeing is up 4.19%.In the tech sector, Jensen's Bond likes stocks that benefit from the ongoing transition to cloud computing. He likes companies that help themselves by making the switch or that make money by helping others shift to the cloud.Microsoft (MSFT) is a dual beneficiary, he says. Oracle (ORCL) enables customers to use on-premises enterprise software or to shift to cloud computing. ""They are a go-to database software provider for companies with extremely sensitive information that can't have things go wrong,"" Bond said.He also likes Alphabet (GOOGL). ""GOOGL is more of a player in the cloud infrastructure space,"" he said. ""If a customer needs access to a cloud structure, they sell that. But most of their business is from their core advertising model, resulting from their ubiquitous position in online search and online ad buying.""Bond also likes specific themes in health care. One such theme is growing affluence in emerging markets. That enables patients to be able to afford better health care.""When a health care system starts to grow and develop in an emerging market, needles and syringes are some of the first things they need to make that work,"" he said. As a result, he likes Becton, Dickinson & Co. (BDX), a leading maker of needles and syringes.The company acquired CareFusion, a maker of infusion pumps (which deliver medical liquids over time), in 2015.And last month Becton Dickinson said it and C.R. Bard had agreed to divest two product lines to win regulatory approval for their merger. Bard makes catheters and biopsy devices.Bond also likes Stryker (SYK), whose orthopedic implants, surgical tools and medical devices enable it to capitalize on aging populations in the U.S., Europe and Japan.The $174 million Kinetics Internet Fund (WWWFX) was one of the top performing U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in 2017, posting a 57.43% gain, according to Morningstar Direct.The fund had 36 holdings as of Sept. 30, including a 12% stake in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). The cryptocurrency, which is volatile, rose about 1,166% last year. ""We're not afraid to be wrong,"" said co-manager Peter Doyle. ""A lot of people won't participate in the upside of 'consensus money' and cryptocurrencies because they need outside reinforcement. We don't say cryptocurrencies can't fail. But we control our risk by controlling the size of our position.""Doyle said the fund's stake is ""much higher"" than what it has formally disclosed, due to appreciation.For investment opportunities in general, the fund is looking beyond many popular large caps that enjoyed large run-ups in 2017 and other recent years. Their high valuations leave them insufficient room to post additional gains, said co-manager James Davolos.For one thing, the fund holds stock in nine companies in which noted investor and Liberty Global (LBTYK) chairman John Malone holds large blocks of shares, including Liberty Media (LSXMK), Liberty Broadband (LBRDK) and Liberty Global. ""If you've trusted John Malone (by owning shares in his companies) over the years, almost without exception you've done well,"" Doyle said.Kinetics Internet also likes Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). The company helps popular music performers earn a living through live performances and through concession sales, corporate sponsorships and advertising, Doyle said.The fund managers also like Copart (CPRT), which conducts salvaged vehicle auctions. ""This company keeps gaining market share by providing value to both buyers and sellers of vehicles by providing price transparency and lower transaction costs,"" Davolos said.S&P 500 index funds led all U.S. diversified categories in Q4 with an average gain of 6.76% after tacking on 1.28% in December.World equity funds trailed U.S. diversified stock funds in Q4, averaging a 4.92% advance after a 2% December return. India region funds paced all foreign stock fund categories by soaring 12.64% in Q4, helped by a 4.77% December romp.Global natural resources funds beat other major sectors by posting a 6.45% Q4 gain, aided by a 4.96% December geyser. That gave them an 8.49% return for the year. But commodities base metals funds did even better with gains of 7.68% in December, 10.97% in Q4 and 28.69% for the year.Consumer services funds added 2.52% in December, which lifted its gains to 8.42% in Q4 and 18.23% in 2017.Loan participation funds were tops in Q4 among general domestic taxable bond categories, rising 1%. Their December gain was 0.35%.Among world income funds, emerging markets hard currency funds enjoyed the best Q4, gaining 0.73%, a shade better than their December return.Municipal bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.44% after returning 0.81% in December.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsHow Did Mutual Funds Perform In 2017?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

12,SYK,"Stocks were quiet ahead of the long weekend as Nike (NKE) weighed and Bitcoin continued a volatile week of trade. Apple (AAPL) was flat.X SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.2% each, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gave up 0.1%. Emerging markets extended their gains for a third straight session as iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) rose 0.8% in the stock market today.Nike provided the biggest drag on the Dow with a 3% tumble. Apple, meanwhile, was flat after entering positive territory. It's less than 1% below a 176.34 flat-base buy point it initially crossed on Monday.Telecom, banks and health care led the downside among sector funds. Gold miners, energy and real estate were among the biggest gainers. Gold futures leapt 0.7% to $1,278.90 an ounce; West Texas intermediate crude prices were about flat at $58.35 a barrel.Bitcoin crashed pared its loss 10% at $13,979.01, according to CoinDesk, after earlier jumping to nearly the $16K level. The cryptocurrency had topped $20,000 on Sunday. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which has made double-digit moves the past five session, reversed upward for a 12% gain. It's on track to snap a three-session slide, after paring a steep early loss of 35%. GBTC is now 43% off its Tuesday intraday high and looks set for a 27% drop on the week.It's been a tumultuous week for the cryptocurrency. The string of declines was sparked by Coinbase's announced support for Bitcoin offshoot Bitcoin Cash and a subsequent probe of possible insider trading. A growing number of global central banks have issued warnings about the potential risks of Bitcoin and other digital currencies.Medical stocks are often considered a defensive play, but names such as Abbott Laboratories (ABT) have also proven their growth potential.IShares U.S. Medical Devices (IHI) has been testing support at its 50-day moving average this month. A solid advance off the line could mark an opportunity to buy shares. It rose 8% from a late September rebound off the 50-day to its Nov. 30 intraday high.The fund, which marked its 11th anniversary in May, has amassed $1.5 billion in assets. It tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index, which is made up of U.S. makers and distributors of medical devices including magnetic resonance imaging scanners, prosthetics and pacemakers.Health care equipment represented the lion's shares of assets at around 86%. Life sciences tools and services contributed 12%, while health care supplies, technology and services made up the rest. Top holdings as of Dec. 20 included Medtronic (MDT), Abbott Labs, Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), Danaher (DHR) and Stryker (SYK). The top five accounted for 38% of assets.Abbott shares have rallied 48% this year. Thermo Fisher has risen 35%, Stryker is up 29% and Danaher has advanced 21%.IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts.

The S&P 500 has returned 11.3%, 15.6% and 8.9% for those same periods.IHI bears a 0.44% expense ratio.RELATED: Apple, Banks Boost Dow Near Record; Can Bitcoin Stop Its Slump?Apple Sets Sights On Buy Point; Bitcoin Dives; Nvidia Gearing Up?Here's Why Apple Is Weighing On Dow, Techs; Bitcoin Off Highs

13,SYK,"As the current bull market approaches its ninth year and signs of sector rotation and a possible top emerge, now is a good time to see who joins Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Bank of America (BAC) on IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds.X Over the last three months, these leading fund managers have continued to pick up shares in semiconductor-related stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN), building sector names like leading homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and construction products manufacturer Masco (MAS), as well as several industrial machinery companies, including Parker-Hannifin (PH) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).With tensions around North Korea's nuclear missile program rising, it's not surprising that these funds have also been investing in defense contractors, including Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) and Heico (HEI).Apple, Intel and BofA topped the list in terms of money invested. Seventy-four funds invested an estimated total of $2.3 billion in Intel, while 97 funds scooped up nearly $2 billion of Apple shares. Eighty-nine funds put $1.3 billion into Bank of America.Apple broke out on Oct. 27, but after a short rise has eased back to form a new flat base showing a possible 176.34 entry. Intel has pulled back after making a solid gain from an early October breakout. The chip giant is now testing support at its 10-week line and appears to be setting up a new base with a possible 47.40 buy point.BofA remains extended after clearing a 25.45  entry on Sept. 27. The financial titan is currently 13% above the buy point.Several stocks on this month's list are in or near a potential buy zone, but keep in mind that recent selling pressure in the major indexes and pullbacks by several leading stocks means the current uptrend could be starting to roll over into a correction. If that happens, it will be difficult for individual stocks to make a sustained upward climb.Orthopedic implant maker Stryker (SYK) is working on a first-stage base-on-base with a 160.72 entry. Look for the relative strength line to get closer to new high ground and for the stock to find support at its 50-day moving average. Stryker closed below that benchmark line on Thursday in rising volume.Heico has found support at its 10-week moving average as it tries to complete a flat base with a 93.10 entry. The pattern is part of a long, first-stage base-on-base formation.Fellow defense contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne is also working on a base, but is trading below its 10-week moving average with a lagging RS line.Regional bank stock Synovus Financial (SNV) jumped past a 47.77 entry on Nov. 28, but has now pulled back to test that buy point once again.Three stocks on the list currently pay a dividend yielding at least 2% on an annualized basis: Texas Instruments (2.5%), Intel (2.5%), New Mexico-based electricity utility PNM Resources (PNM) (2.4%) and Dover (DOV) (2%).For a look at how to generate income with stocks and mutual funds without taking on undue risk, see IBD's new special report on income investing.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of new sells, with 94 net sellers (163 funds selling minus 69 buying). But recent chart action may be telling a different story.Like BofA and other big bank stocks, JPMorgan has gotten a bump as the likelihood of Donald Trump and Republicans passing tax reform has risen.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had 55 net sellers (130 selling, 75 buying), while Aetna (AET), which will merge with CVS (CVS) if the deal clears regulatory hurdles, had 35 (94 selling, 59 buying).Johnson & Johnson is working on a flat base as part of a longer first-stage, base-on-base formation. The buy point is 144.45. The stock ended Thursday's session 2% below the entry.RELATED:Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsIncome Investing: How To Find The Best Dividend Stocks

14,SYK,"Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter expectations early Tuesday on strength in its pharmaceutical unit and boosted its 2017 guidance — prompting shares to pop in premarket trades.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, J&J stock jumped 3.4% to finish at 140.79. Shares broke out of a flat base with a buy point at 137.18 on Oct. 12.For its third quarter, J&J reported $19.7 billion in sales and adjusted income of $1.90 per share, up a respective 10.3% and 13.1% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $19.28 billion in sales and $1.80 a share in earnings.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro attributed J&J's sales beat to upside in its pharma unit. Global sales were $300 million above his forecast and $360 million above the consensus.Pharma revenue topped Novarro's estimate by $270 million, but medical device sales lagged.Worldwide pharma sales of $9.7 billion increased 15.4% on a year-over-year basis. Key products included cancer drugs Darzalex, Imbruvica and Zytiga, with the latter beating Novarro's views by $125 million. Sales from the new Actelion brands were $30 million below Novarro's model.IBD'S TAKE: J&J isn't alone in reporting quarterly results this week as earnings season kicks off in earnest. Keep tabs on IBD's Investing Action Plan for what's on deck each day.Medical devices sales grew 7.1% to $6.6 billion, but that included some shortfalls and was slightly below Novarro's view for $6.61 billion. Orthopedic and vision care revenue both were light by $25 million and $40 million, respectively, he wrote in a note to clients.J&J's consumer unit grew 2.9% to $3.4 billion and were just ahead of the RBC estimate for $3.31 billion. On an operational basis, over-the-counter and beauty sales each grew 4.4%, but all other categories fell ""highlighting the continued pressure in the segment.""The firm also raised its 2017 guidance to sales of $76.1 billion to $76.5 billion, up from $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion. It sees adjusted income of $7.25-$7.30 per share vs. earlier expectations for $7.12-$7.22, Novarro wrote. Analysts had modeled $75.9 billion in sales and $7.19 in per-share earnings.J&J disclosed that its medical devices segment sustained a negative impact of 30 basis points following hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. J&J is among a number of firms with manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico. Investors have been wary of the effects of the storms.The negative impact was attributed to lost surgery days in areas affected by stormwater, wrote Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges in a note to clients. There was no supply disruption and all six of the firm's sites in Puerto Rico are open with generator power and running at different capacities.Porges notes that J&J's results could extend to others in the biotech space.""Given J&J's reliance on Puerto Rico for pharmaceutical manufacturing, and their lack of disclosure regarding demand and supply impacts, we are increasingly confident that companies in our biopharma coverage will not experience material storm-related Q3 headwinds,"" he said.But RBC's Novarro is a bit less bullish. J&J's results point to ""continued soft U.S. market trends"" in medical devices and diagnostics, he said. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, J&J's medical devices and diagnostics unit grew just 1.2% year over year.Overall, U.S. hospital admissions were down 50 to 100 basis points with U.S. surgical procedures down about 250 basis points, on a year-over-year basis, Novarro wrote. J&J's orthopedic sales were short on weak performance in its knee and spine segments.""Weak knee performance was blamed on the negative impact of India implant pricing legislation,"" he wrote, estimating a $10 million sales impact in the quarter. Worldwide, knee revenue declined 4.4% year over year. Revenue from hip products, though, grew 1.5% on pricing declines.J&J likely lost share to Stryker (SYK) in its knee-products unit, Novarro said. Global spine-product sales declined 7%. It's losing share in its U.S. spine-product segment, which benefits NuVasive (NUVA) and K2M Group (KTWO). This also suggests continued weak growth in the quarter for the U.S. spine-product market.Separately, it looks like J&J lost some share of the U.S. trauma-product market to Stryker, though worldwide sales grew 2.1%.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Medtronic (MDT) are taking pieces of J&J's surgery unit, Novarro said.RELATED:Why It Might Be Time To Buy Dow's J&J, A 'Dividend Machine'Dow's J&J Flirts With Buy Point On Bullish Pre-Earnings ReportThese Medtech Players Are Flailing On Hurricane-Related Headwinds

20,SYK,"Bellwether Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) second-quarter report bodes well for the biotech sector, an analyst said Tuesday, after the Dow component topped profit expectations and narrowly lagged sales views.On the stock market today, J&J stock climbed 1.8% to 134.46, as biotech stocks dropped nearly 1% as a group. Generic drugmakers inched down 0.3%.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges remains bullish on the biotech sector and Needham analyst Mike Matson says J&J's second-quarter results point to a stable period for medtech players like Boston Scientific (BSX), Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).During the quarter, J&J's drug sales grew 4.7% sequentially, though they fell 2.6% vs. the year-earlier period. Porges partially blamed a one-time positive rebate adjustment in 2016 which eliminated 4% of year-over-year volume/price growth in the second quarter.Sales of J&J's immunosuppressant Remicade declined 14% year over year. But rivalry from biosimilars contributed to just 5% of that decline, which is lower than guidance for a 10%-15% decline in 2017, Porges wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Cancer and rare-disease specialists are expected to do well in the second half of 2017 as positive sentiment returns to the biotech space. Visit IBD's Industry Snapshot for a look at who may outperform in the second quarter.J&J also expects currency headwinds to subside in the second half of 2017 and called for acceleration in its pharmaceutical unit as well as positive trends in sales outside the U.S. Based on the presumed currency impacts, the firm raised its outlook for adjusted profits to $7.12-$7.22 a share.Outside the U.S., drug sales grew 7% sequentially in the second quarter, beating views for 3% growth, Porges said.""(This) supports our expectations for sequential outside-U.S. revenue growth for our companies due to a weakening dollar in the second quarter,"" he said.Porges expects guidance increases for biotechs during the second quarter. Earlier in the week, he called for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to easily beat June quarter sales views and for Gilead Sciences (GILD) to handily top profit expectations.""Our covered companies will not be negatively impacted by the same prior period adjustments as J&J, and those with current or imminent biosimilar competition may surprise consensus if the Remicade market dynamics can be viewed as a proxy,"" he said.AbbVie (ABBV) could see some pain, though. Sales of cancer drug Imbruvica grew 40% in the U.S. and 64% outside the U.S., J&J said. J&J is partnered with AbbVie on Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J typically books 40% of U.S. Imbruvica sales, Porges said. This translates to about $501 million for AbbVie's Imbruvica sales.This would be a ""miss vs. consensus of $514 million and our estimate of $537 million,"" he said. ""For AbbVie, Imbruvica is considered the largest growth driver beyond the Humira patent cliff, but continued missed consensus expectations repeated in the second quarter would be a negative for the stock.""RELATED:'Stars Align' For These Biotechs To Crush Earnings ConsensusThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsHow Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

21,SYK,"Two large-cap funds are among those setting up for potential breakouts as the stock market remains near all-time highs.XFirst up is iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA (USMV), which is just shy of a 50.13 flat-base buy point. It briefly cleared a prior flat-base entry in late April, pulled back below the buy point, and bounced off its 50-day moving average en route to a 4% gain.The $13.5 billion fund tracks the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index, which comprises domestic stocks that tend to be less volatile than the broader U.S. equity market. It carries a 0.15% expense ratio.USMV's biggest sector weighting was health care as of July 31, at just over 19% of assets. Information technology followed at nearly 19%, consumer staples 13% and financials 11%. Health care names accounted for half the top 10: Becton Dickinson (BDX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Stryker (SYK), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).The fund's top 10 names made up less than 15% of total assets. USMV also helps limit volatility by keeping each holding to about 1.5% or less and has a relatively low annual turnover of 28%.Its year-to-date gain of 11.5% through July 31 is in line with the S&P 500, according to Morningstar Inc. The ETF outpaced the benchmark index over the past three years at 13.1% vs. 10.9%, and slightly underperformed the past five years at 13.5% vs. 14.8%. It has a dividend yield of 2.05%.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF), which tracks the Northern Trust Quality Dividend Index, is near a 41.85 buy point of a flat base.The fund, which launched in December 2012, targets stocks with a sustainable yield. That leads to profitable companies that should have the ability to keep paying dividends. Top holdings as of July 28 included Procter & Gamble (PG), Boeing (BA), Pfizer (PFE), Apple (AAPL) and Merck (MRK).Its top 10 stocks accounted for about 27% of assets; annual turnover is 85%. QDF has lagged the S&P 500 this year and over the past three years. That's despite an annualized yield of 3%, which is well above the benchmark index's 1.91% average yield. Its expense ratio is 0.37%.Tuesday was a good day for many foreign ETFs, including WisdomTree International Equity Fund (DWM) and iShares MSCI Hong Kong (EWH). DWM is still in buy range from a 53.51 entry and EWH from a 24.32 flat-base buy point.The stock market pared early gains Wednesday, leaving only the Dow Jones industrial average in positive territory.Despite a 5% earnings-fueled jump by Apple (AAPL), SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) held only a 0.15% gain. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) slipped 0.2% and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) edged 0.1% lower.Stocks sold off across the board with telecom, retail and real estate leading the decline. SPDR S&P Telecom (XTL) fell 1.5%, slipping below its 50-day line for the first time in two weeks.But VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) reversed to a 0.1% advance. West Texas intermediate crude prices, down 1% early, reversed 0.6% higher to $49.45 a barrel.Among the few sectors bucking the decline, Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) rose 0.4% and Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) climbed 0.2%.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) was up 0.3% but VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) gave up 0.3%.

34,SYK,"Baxter (BAX) stock fell Monday on worries related to a Department of Justice investigation into potential price fixing of intravenous fluids — allegations an analyst deemed ""extraordinary.""On the stock market today, Baxter stock fell 0.8% to 52.82 after the Justice Department sent a grand jury subpoena to one of Baxter's employees.The subpoena was received Friday and relates to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department's antitrust arm. It asks for documents and testimony related to manufacturing, pricing, selling and shortages of intravenous solutions, and Baxter's communications with rivals.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted that the price-fixing allegation isn't new. It stems from a 2-year-old investigation that began in New York and an ongoing class-action suit in the Northern District of Illinois related to supply shortages.The shortage was triggered by the flu season in 2013-14 and benefited manufacturers like Hospira, which in the third quarter of 2014 saw 43% growth in its unit that produces intravenous fluids, Kumar said. Hospira was acquired by Pfizer (PFE) in 2015.But the class action lawsuit alleges that manufacturers of intravenous fluids falsely created the shortage to justify spiking prices in 2014. Baxter, which has filed for a motion to dismiss the suit, called the allegations extraordinary.""The idea of a public company voluntarily creating supply shortage in the hopes competitors would similarly restrict output in order to raise prices seems a stretch,"" Kumar told clients in a note.IBD'S TAKE: Baxter stock trades in IBD's 120-company Medical-Products industry group which is led by Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Boston Scientific (BSX) in terms of market cap. Medtronic, Boston and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) compete in the heart-valve replacement market. Check out this edition of Sector Leaders to see how they stack up.FDA regulators regularly inspect manufacturing facilities, he noted. The class action lawsuit seems to imply that Baxter and other intravenous-fluid manufacturers were able to ""hoodwink"" inspectors to post shortage notices, he said.Baxter said in 2015 that it incurred about $150 million in costs to comply with increased FDA regulatory requirements and meet supply constraints. Meanwhile, price increases only contributed $70 million to $90 million in 2016 growth, Kumar said.In 2016, intravenous-fluid solutions contributed two-thirds of that segment's growth, implying that pricing was up 6% on average, Kumar said. Assuming a bag of intravenous fluid costs $1.50 to $2, this equates to increases of 15 to 20 cents per bag.Apart from price collusion, prosecutors will have to argue whether Baxter's earnings on increased intravenous fluid prices were reasonable. Kumar estimates that after hiking prices on intravenous fluids Baxter had 15%-16% margins on its earnings before interest and taxes.RELATED:Boston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, EdwardsMedtronic, Edwards Among Five Best 'Stocks To Own': Analyst

35,SYK,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) are medtech stocks to own going into earnings season, but several others could be put on buy lists on pullbacks, an analyst says.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said Wednesday that among large-cap medtech stocks, Johnson and Zimmer offer the best risk/reward into the first-quarter earnings season. Zimmer is the cheapest in its arena and Johnson has lagged the group.""While investor sentiment has turned more favorable for Johnson in recent weeks, we anticipate further multiple expansion on the back of strong first-quarter results, and consensus estimates moving higher throughout the year,"" he wrote in a research report.The consensus of analysts polled by Yahoo (YHOO) broadly expects Johnson to report $18.01 billion in sales, up 3% year over year, and $1.76 a share in adjusted earnings, dipping 1.7%.Johnson is also on the cusp of closing its acquisition of Actelion Pharmaceuticals in the second quarter. It and Sanofi (SNY) were locked in a battle late last year to take over the Swiss biotech. Johnson's $30 billion bid won it the company.For Zimmer, the company ""just has to hit consensus estimates for the stock to move higher,"" Novarro said. The consensus models 3% year-over-year sales growth to $1.96 billion and $2.11 adjusted earnings per share, up 4.5%.Novarro, however, says Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Boston Scientific (BSX), Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Stryker (SYK) may be attractive on pullbacks. He sees all delivering solid results and reaffirming 2017 guidance. Investors will likely track ongoing litigation for Abbott with Alere (ALR), and heart-valve replacement sales for Edwards.Boston likely will comment on its voluntary recall of its Lotus heart-valve replacement. The company recalled the Lotus device after discovering a malfunction that resulted in the premature release of a pin during implantation.""Medtronic's (MDT) Onyx stent launch represents near-term challenges"" for Boston, but ""we still want to own Boston for 2018,"" Novarro said.In the small- and midsize-cap world, Novarro recommends NuVasive (NUVA), Wright Medical Group (WMGI) and K2M Group (KTWO). The potential for a takeout is likely baked into the stock prices for NuVasive and Wright, he said.IBD'S TAKE: This isn't the first time Edwards has been listed as a best ""stock to own."" Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Edwards is holding strong.K2M remains his top pick in the small-and-midsize medtech group.""We expect K2M to play catch-up to the group as investor focus shifts to the company's impressive new product lineup and improving international sales growth after the company experienced some distributor issues in 2016,"" he wrote.Like Novarro, Needham analyst Mike Matson also prefers K2M and Zimmer, but also has strong buy ratings on shares of Inogen (INGN) and MiMedx (MDXG). He sees the cardiovascular and orthopedic markets as slowing while the diagnostic market improved in the quarter.Matson models cardiovascular market growth as decelerating to 6.3% from 7.3% in the fourth quarter, and the orthopedic market advancing by 3.5%, vs. 4% growth in the prior quarter. In diagnostics, sales likely grew 3.6% from 2.1%, he said.But there were some standouts, Matson said. He models the transcatheter aortic valve-replacement market — where Boston, Edwards and Medtronic operate — as having grown 23%. In orthopedics, Matson models 9% growth for the extremities market.RELATED:Medtronic Does Heart-Valve Study And Rivals Reap The BenefitsBoston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, Edwards

36,SYK,"Medtronic (MDT) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) stocks dipped Monday despite a series of bullish reports, including one that called the heart-valve replacement rivals ""stocks to own near term.""In midday trading,Shares of Medtronic ended virtually flat at 81.03 on the stock market today while Edwards closed up 0.3% at 95.87. But RBC analyst Glenn Novarro expects both to have strong catalysts in the near term.In a note to clients Sunday, Novarro said he sees Edwards, Medtronic, Stryker (SYK), Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) and K2M Group (KTWO) as ""stocks to own near term."" He calls Edwards and Medtronic the ""best ideas in cardiovascular."" Both work in heart-valve replacements.A recent study by Medtronic, showing that a new method of inserting a heart valve could be superior to open-heart surgery, is encouraging, Novarro said. The results could help stoke growth in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement market, he said.Check Out The IBD Best Mutual Fund AwardsFollowing Novarro's report, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar upgraded Edwards stock to a buy rating and raised his price target to 110 from 98.50. Needham analyst Mike Matson reiterated his buy rating and 91 price target on Medtronic stock.Matson expects Medtronic to maintain mid-single-digit sales growth and double-digit earnings growth after overcoming ""temporary"" product cycle and competitive issues in the fiscal third quarter.""We believe Medtronic's product cycle remains very strong and that it can effectively fend off competitive product launches despite investor concerns,"" Matson wrote in a note to clients.Medtronic competes against Edwards Lifesciences, a smaller outfit, in heart-valve replacements. Boston Scientific (BSX) also is looking to break into the transcatheter aortic valve replacement market in the U.S., but doesn't yet have FDA approval.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific is working to catch up with Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences via a strategic acquisition. Read on in Sector Leaders.Over the next 18 months, Medtronic has a number of launches that should help boost growth. The company sees strong growth in its emerging markets segment, which makes up 14% of total sales and has seen double-digit growth in recent quarters.""We believe Medtronic can sustain double-digit growth in these markets, driven by market development, channel optimization and public/private partnerships,"" Matson said. Saudi Arabia should see a return to growth soon.RBC's Novarro expects Medtronic to continue gaining share in the implantable cardioverter defibrillator market. The devices are used to manage tachycardia. He expects transcatheter aortic valve replacements and drug-coated balloons to perform well in 2017.Novarro calls for in-line to slightly better first- and second-quarter metrics for Edwards. He expects Medtronic's launch of its CoreValve Evolut-R to drive growth also for Edwards' Sapien XT.Both devices are transcatheter aortic valve implants for patients with hardened heart valves unable to undergo open-heart surgery. Novarro recommends owning Edwards stock going into the second half of 2017 on expectation for market growth.Evercore's Kumar notes that Edwards stock is a growth stock and therefore volatile by nature.""With lowered investor expectations, we believe Edwards shares are poised for a 'catch-up' trade and offer asymmetric risk-reward at current levels,"" he wrote in a research report. He sees 15% upside at current stock levels.Kumar was previously sidelined on Edwards stock with competition from Boston Scientific in international markets. But Boston pulled its Lotus valve off the market in late February, giving Edwards ""its first break in six months.""Still, the companies are likely at a patent standoff until the first half of 2018.RELATED:Medtronic Does Heart-Valve Study, And Rivals Reap The BenefitsBoston Scientific Wins In Patent Battle Vs.

37,SYK,"Medtronic (MDT) could use $5 billion in potential proceeds of a major divestiture to add 11 to 24 cents to its 2018 earnings, Needham analyst Mike Matson suggested Monday as Medtronic stock dipped.In the stock market today, Medtronic stock slipped 0.47% to 75.98. But its shares are trading well above their 50-day moving average and are up 6.7% this year. Meanwhile, IBD's 121-company Medical-Products industry group is up only 1%.Bloomberg first reported Jan. 31 that Medtronic is considering selling its Covidien-acquired medical-supplies unit. The business comprises commoditized products including products used in nursing care, incontinence, medical surgical and OEM products.According to insiders cited by Bloomberg, the deal could fetch up to $5 billion. The unit has a $500 million EBITA (earnings before interest, taxes and amortization) and Matson estimates $320 million in operating income. The sale could dilute Medtronic's earnings per share by 20 cents.""We think that dilution from the sale should be mostly offset by use of the proceeds for share repurchases, debt retirement, or M&A,"" Needham's Matson wrote in a research report Monday. ""Additionally, a sale would improve Medtronic's revenue growth and operating margin.""IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Edwards Lifesciences are often seen in a battle for market share. Late last year, Boston Scientific said it would acquire Neovasc's tissue business, taking aim at its rivals. Get the bigger scoop on IBD's Sector Leaders.But Medtronic could add 24 cents to its earnings in 2018 by repurchasing stock at $80 per share. Or, Medtronic could use the $5 billion to retire debt at a 4% interest rate, adding 11 cents to EPS, Matson wrote.""Medtronic could also use the cash for M&A but it's hard to predict the impact of an unknown deal,"" he wrote.Matson kept his buy rating and 84 price target on Medtronic stock.Medtronic is ranked first by market cap in its industry group, leading Stryker (SYK) and Boston Scientific (BSX). Medtronic declined to comment on ""rumors of potential M&A and divestitures"" to IBD.RELATED:Medtronic Downgraded On Increases Boston, J&J, St. Jude RivalriesEdwards Heart-Valve Guidance Lags On Medtronic, Boston

40,SYK,"Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham on Thursday said he expected Gilead Sciences' (GILD) 2017 outlook to be hindered on limited hepatitis C sales. He also sees Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) issuing sluggish views, though he is more bullish on Biogen (BIIB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).RBC Capital on Wednesday said much the same about Gilead, and also was more bullish on Biogen as well as on Amgen (AMGN).Hepatitis C drug prescriptions dipped 6%-7% quarter over quarter in Q4, according to market tracker IMS.

If data are strong, Merck could open itself up to a larger patient population vs. the 25%-30% of patients with a 50%-plus PDL1 expression. Keytruda is already approved as a monotherapy in high-expressing PDL1 patients with NSCLC.RELATED:Merck, Biogen, Lilly Top 2016 Approvals Despite FDA SlumpTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug ConferenceWill Trump Break With Republicans And Push Major Drug Reform?

The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.4%. Volume in the stock market today was running about 15% below the previous session's pace.Q3 GDP surged 2.9%, its best growth in two years and above estimates for 2.5%.

49,SYK,"Shares of Boston Scientific (BSX) surged Monday after a report by the Wall Street Journal that it had been approached by Stryker (SYK) about a deal between the two medical-device makers.It's unclear whether Boston Scientific is open to a takeover, the Journal said, citing sources it didn't identify. Boston Scientific shares soared by as much as 17%, and ended the regular trading session up 7.4% to $34.32. Stryker shares fell 5.1% to close at $169.78. Trading on both stocks was halted just before 1 p.m. Monday, but neither company commented on merger rumors.A deal between the two companies would be the latest in a series of large acquisitions in the industry, which has been consolidating to win market share and to package sales to hospitals, doctors and health clinics.Boston Scientific makes heart devices such as pacemakers and stents, among other products, and is worth an estimated market value of nearly $50 billion.

A representative for Boston Scientific didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Many of their largest competitors have already executed large takeovers in recent years.Abbott Laboratories (ABT) last year bought St. Jude Medical, which makes heart devices, for about $25 billion, then months later completed a takeover of medical testing and diagnostics supplier Alere for about $5 billion.

It's also likely Boston won't OK any deal for less than $40 per share.""It would combine two of the premier growth companies in the (medical device) space, and there would be limited product overlap,"" he said. However, ""the bar for value creation is set high given the potential valuations of both companies.""A combined Stryker-Boston Scientific would have 2019 revenue of around $25 billion. It stands to grow at a sustainable 6% or higher compound annual growth rate in the medium term, Novarro said. It would have an enterprise value of about $61 billion.Canaccord analysts called the potential deal a ""merger of equals."" Stryker is only about a third larger than Boston. It could also lead to further med-tech consolidation.""If consummated, this would create four $100 billion behemoths in (medical devices) with Stryker/Boston Scientific joining Abbott (ABT), J&J and Medtronic,"" they said.

58,SYK,"With artificial intelligence now firmly entrenched in many hospital operating rooms, the field of robotic surgery is starting to get competitive.Giant companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are training their sights on Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), the king of robotic surgery companies. But analysts say the booming medical technology segment has lots of room to run.Robotic surgery is an area that could grow by billions of dollars as more machines are used to treat patients. Intuitive commands the space with $3.3 billion in annual sales. Its signature da Vinci robotic surgeons, however, are limited in the types of procedures they handle. The multi-limbed da Vinci can be used in a variety of procedures — including cardiac, colorectal, gynecological, head and neck, thoracic and urologic surgeries — but only as long as they're minimally invasive.How big the market could be is still unclear, yet analysts agree the potential has yet to be tapped. So more players are moving in, and quickly.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""I think investors need to understand that the robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) revolution is happening, and it's touching every sector of the economy,"" said Jeremie Capron, the director of research and managing partner for Robo Global, an index and advisory firm specializing in robotic industry investments. ""This is a technological revolution that investors can't afford to miss.""Analysts say that in March, Auris Health became the first company to pose a formidable threat to Intuitive when its catheter-based Monarch Platform gained U.S. approval. Intuitive will counterpunch by seeking approval for a flexible catheter similar to the Auris device, likely this year, RBC analyst Brandon Henry said in a recent report.Meanwhile, others are working in areas where Intuitive Surgical doesn't have a foothold. Smith & Nephew (SNN) has a robotic assistant for knee replacements. Stryker (SYK) has a robotic joint replacement system. Mazor Robotics (MZOR) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) have robotic offerings in brain and spinal surgery. Mazor alone could see around $3 billion in sales just from its systems.But these players have a long way to go to take Intuitive Surgical's throne.In 2005, Intuitive had a market cap of $1.3 billion. Today, it's worth nearly $52 billion. Capron calls Intuitive ""an amazing stock.""""I think the investment community has been scratching their heads trying to figure out the impact of those new entrants for Intuitive Surgical,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""We feel pretty relaxed about it. The size is big enough for small players to come in.""Shares of medical tech companies have been relatively insulated from the woes frustrating biotech and pharmaceutical stocks of late. The stocks of medical equipment makers such as Intuitive and Mazor have collectively spiked 15% year to date.Intuitive's ""blowout quarter"" in April helped to spur excitement, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said in a recent note to clients. Recent investor days from J&J and Medtronic are helping to drive that frenzy.""Robotic surgery is the topic currently in medtech with a blowout quarter from Intuitive Surgical hinting that the pace of manual-to-robotic transition might be picking up,"" Kumar said. ""The topic of competition elicits various responses from investors.""Intuitive Surgical stock is up 33% this year, after climbing 78% in 2017. Kumar expects Intuitive Surgical's competition to become more apparent over the next 12 to 18 months. Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System now boasts ""five million patients and counting.""The da Vinci systems are also moving deeper into hernias and are seeing early-stage adoption in bariatrics surgery performed to induce weight loss.Myriam Curet, executive vice president and chief medical officer for Intuitive, noted in an email to IBD that an estimated 82% of prostatectomies in the U.S. are performed via robotic-assisted surgery. The same is true for about 80% of malignant hysterectomies.""General surgery is our fastest-growing specialty, and one where we are still in early stages of adoption for procedures such as ventral and inguinal hernia repair, colorectal and bariatric surgery,"" she said. ""We believe there is substantial opportunity to expand robotic usage in these categories, and we are developing additional tools and technologies to do so.""For the year, Intuitive guided on its first-quarter earnings conference call to 12%-15% growth in the number of procedures performed with its systems this year. That followed what many considered a strong fourth quarter in which recurring revenue — including instruments and accessories for its da Vinci systems — grew 11%. Recurring revenue represents 73% of the sales pie.Still, even Intuitive Surgical sees itself in the early innings and expects robotic surgery to present a huge total addressable market. The number of da Vinci procedures performed each year grew nearly 68% from 2013 to 2017.Among other robotic surgery companies, Intuitive's closest competitor, Auris, doesn't trade publicly. Until recently it was in ""stealth mode,"" Kumar said. But in May the medical technology company signed a commercialization agreement with a division of J&J. The agreement came two months after Auris' Monarch system grabbed approval in the U.S.Monarch is a flexible catheter. Surgeons thread it through a patient's mouth and into the lungs by remote control. Before its approval, investors believed ""credible competitors"" to Intuitive would be years away, Kumar says. But Monarch got approval months ahead of views. Intuitive Surgical plans to seek approval of its own flexible catheter later this year.On its website, Auris says Monarch's first target is lung cancer. Some experts estimate half a million lung biopsies are performed in the U.S. each year. Surgeons could also use flexible catheters in urinary tract procedures, which number roughly 400,000 procedures a year.Intuitive isn't sweating the competition. Auris' chief executive, interestingly, is Frederic Moll, who founded Intuitive Surgical in 1995. Intuitive's current CEO, Gary Guthart, joined the medical technology firm in 1996 and took over as CEO in 2010.""We have built technologies and made decisions about our architecture based on first principles, not by looking over our shoulder at what other people are doing, but by really engaging customers deeply and understanding their clinical needs,"" Guthart said on a recent earnings call.RBC's Henry notes Auris' Monarch has a 25% larger catheter than Intuitive's to allow for its camera. Intuitive sees a benefit in a smaller catheter that can move deeper into the lungs, Henry wrote in a recent report. That would allow surgeons to potentially use it to remove diseased tissue.Meanwhile, J&J has teamed up with Google on a company called Verb Surgical. Analysts are unsure what system the team is creating. They do expect it to enter the robotic surgery market in 2020, though.At the same time, Medtronic is partnered with Mazor. Medtronic also expects its own robotic surgery system to launch in 2020.It's not unreasonable to suggest Intuitive could keep 80% of the market, Evercore's Kumar told IBD. New robotic surgery companies will have to differentiate themselves.""They can't have a straightforward, 'me too' product,"" he said. ""Investors have put a pretty punchy marketable valuation on Intuitive Surgical because we're still in the early stages of this robotic conversation.""But, he added, ""This market is big enough to sustain multiple players.""That's where companies like Mazor and Zimmer Biomet, which makes systems called ROSA, come in. Both have systems that surgeons use in brain and spinal procedures.Like others, Mazor CEO Ori Hadomi says sizing the opportunity for robotic surgery companies is difficult. Surgeons use the $1.1 million Mazor X system in spinal surgeries. The company's Renaissance system can perform spinal and brain surgeries and costs $500,000.Disposable instruments and materials comprised 40% to 60% of Mazor's revenue, Hadomi told IBD. For each surgery performed with the Mazor X, the list price is $1,500 in terms of disposable items. An estimated half a million procedures would generate $750 million.Stakeholders expect spine procedures to grow rapidly.""People are being more and more active,"" he said, meaning they will suffer more injuries and require surgery more often. ""The procedures will become less invasive. The safer the procedures will become, the more patients will be willing and interested to be treated, to be operated on.""The benefits of robotic surgery are plentiful, Hadomi says. Revision surgery — surgery to correct mistakes or tweak prior surgeries — are significantly lower with a robot assisting. The precision of the robot helps to curb potential errors, he says.Last October, Mazor unveiled the results of a 379-patient study. It found a fivefold reduction of complications for surgeries performed with its Mazor robotic surgery technology. Notably, there was also a sevenfold reduction in revision surgery compared with freehand lumbar fusion surgeries.""There's no doubt from the patient's perspective, I would not consider going to surgery without the robot there knowing the chance of going through revision (surgery) is seven times higher,"" he said. Revision surgery is also costly for the hospital, which can face reimbursement hurdles.All agree that robotic surgery won't replace human surgeons.

64,SYK,"IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) is one of the year's top ETF Leaders as it rides some of the best parts of a mixed health care sector.This year, the medical sector has diverged, with some of its industries faring much better than others. Biotechs and other drugmakers are down roughly 20%. But IBD's medical products and equipment industry groups are up about 14%. Only the diversified medical companies are doing quite as well in 2016 in health care.Much of the outperformance in medical devices owes to superior results at some of the top manufacturers, where innovation has played a key role in igniting industry leaders.Of 47 stocks in the ETF, Medtronic (MDT) is the largest holding, with more than 12% of the portfolio. Shares have climbed as much as 12% from the 79.60 buy point of a breakout in April.The stock has performed decently despite the fact that earnings have been basically flat for five quarters. The outlook is improving, though: Analysts expect profit to rise 7% in the fiscal year ending in April and 11% the next year. At its investor day in June, Medtronic forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth as it develops its product pipeline and draws on its diversified markets.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is another stock that has shouldered the ETF's advance. Shares are near all-time highs. The main move this year was on April 4, after the company announced that its Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement was shown to reduce deaths from heart attacks in patients at moderate risk from open-heart surgery. Shares soared 17% on the news.Medtronic's CoreValve competes with Edwards in heart valve replacements for patients not able to have open-heart surgery. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity remained bullish on the stock following the earnings report, saying it dominates the market for transcatheter aortic valve replacements and shows potential for market expansion.Shares of Stryker (SYK) -- which has the broadest range of orthopedics products among its peers -- have climbed as much as 34% this year, but fell sharply after its July 22 earnings report. There was no clear explanation for the slide, other than some softness in emerging markets.Other key contributors to iShares U.S. Medical Devices are Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), which makes equipment for medical research, and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), which just posted its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade. Becton Dickinson (BDX) had been trending higher, but fell sharply Thursday after it cut its full-year sales forecast, citing currency headwinds.The ETF is extended from a breakout in April and from a pullback to the 50-day moving average in June. But it remains near the 142.47 buy point of a three-weeks-tight pattern that formed during July. The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

65,SYK,"While many medical stocks have been having a tough year, makers of medical devices and systems have been popular lately, especially large-cap names that offer stability in uncertain times. This week some of the biggest names will show whether their Q2 performance justifies investors' trust.Reporting late Tuesday, robotic-surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is expected to continue its recent growth rebound, though at a slower pace as year-over-year comparisons have been made tougher by a strong 2015. Analysts currently expect both earnings and sales to grow 9% over the year-earlier quarter, after growing 24% and 12%, respectively, in Q1.In a July 15 preview of the second half of the year, Leerink analyst Richard Newitter wrote that he'll be watching the continued uptake of the da Vinci Xi surgical system, whose 2014 launch helped Intuitive Surgical turn around after a rough couple of years.""Importantly, we see Intuitive Surgical at a turning point as it transitions to its next leg(s) of growth (general surgery, outside-U.S. expansion) -- amid stabilization in urology/gynecology franchises -- and increasingly begins to benefit from the Xi new product cycle,"" Newitter wrote.Intuitive Surgical's stock hit an all-time high of 681.59 on July 11, after moving out of a flat base in June. Intuitive rose fractionally to 670.54 on the stock market today.On Wednesday morning, medical-device titan Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and the company it's in the process of acquiring, St. Jude Medical (STJ), are both due to report earnings. Both companies have struggled in the growth department in recent quarters, but St. Jude's top line has been accelerating: from 1% in Q4 to 8% in Q1 and an estimated 10% in Q2. Abbott, which did not grow at all the previous two quarters, is expected to report single-digit percentage growth on both the top and bottom lines.The global footprint of both companies hit them with foreign-exchange headwinds, which RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro expects to continue in the Q2 report.""Given a stronger U.S. Dollar, especially against several emerging-market currencies, we are lowering our 2016 sales forecast (for Abbott) by $55 million to $20.7 billion (up 1% reported, up 4% constant currency),"" Novarro wrote in a July 11 preview note. ""Despite the greater FX headwind for 2016, we would expect management to reaffirm its 2016 revenue guidance (up low-single digits reported, up mid-single digits constant currency) and EPS guidance range.""Abbott has also said it would buy diagnostics company Alere (ALR) for $5.8 billion, but the closing has been in doubt since the company has admitted to accounting problems. Last week Alere reported preliminary 2015 and Q1 financials, leaving some analysts to believe the deal will go through. They will no doubt be interested in what Abbott's management has to say about this on the conference call.Abbott shares shaved off a penny to close the day at 42.09. St. Jude shares inched up 7 cents to 80.56. Alere slipped 0.8% to 43.26.IBD'S TAKE: Medical device stocks have lately been a mainstay of IBD's Big Cap 20, stocks chosen for strong potential gains without the volatility of smaller growth stocks. See who else is on the Big Cap 20 list.Finally, late Thursday orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK) is set to report a Q2 of modest but accelerating growth, with an estimated 15% sales rise that would be the highest since 2011. Stryker's been having a gangbusters 2016, with its stock up more than 30% and an IBD Composite Rating putting it in the top 6% of all stocks.""Stryker has been growing its top line in the 5.0%-6.0% range for the last couple of years, and we see this momentum continuing over the next several years, as U.S. reconstructive volumes are stable, U.S. hospitals' capital spending is stable, and recent tuck-in acquisitions should drive faster sales growth than the corporate average,"" analyst Novarro wrote in a preview note Friday, in which he raised his estimates and his price target on Stryker. ""Furthermore, the company is gaining share in each of its core segments (Orthopedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology/Spine).""Styker stock ended trading down 0.4% to 121.62.
"
66,SYK,"Medical-device giant Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high in early trading Thursday after it announced a restructuring plan late Wednesday, and received a favorable initiation report from Guggenheim.Boston Scientific didn't release many details, but its 8-K filing said that it furthers the company's plant network optimization strategy, ""which is intended to simplify the Company's manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities."" It expects no overall reduction in head count, but said it will reduce annual operation expenses by $115 million to $150 million by 2020.RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro wrote that the move isn't surprising since Boston Scientific has committed to margin expansion. Operating margin was about 22% last year, but the company is targeting 25% in 2017 and 28% to 30% long-term.""We believe the restructuring efforts announced today should help the company deliver on its margin leverage goals and help Boston Scientific produce low-to-mid-teens EPS growth, which is above the industry average,"" Novarro wrote in a research note.The company said the program will incur charges of $175 million to $225 million, but non-GAAP EPS and revenue guidance for this year remains the same.Also late Wednesday, Guggenheim analyst Chris Pasquale launched coverage on Boston Scientific with a buy rating and a price target of 26. He noted that before current CEO Mike Mahoney took over in 2012 revenue was shrinking, but since then growth has averaged 3.9%.""While this resurgence has been propelled in some cases by improved market conditions, we see the bigger driver as a renewed focus on innovation that has played out across each of Boston’s business units,"" Pasquale wrote in his initiation report.Boston Scientific was one of a number of medtech stocks Wednesday that Pasquale launched coverage on. He highlighted Stryker (SYK) as his top pick, with Endologix (ELGX) and Spectranetics (SPNC) as other choices, alongside Boston Scientific.Boston Scientific stock rose 2.3% to 23.32 on the stock market today, building on its 11% one-day move following its Q1 earnings report in April. The stock holds a strong Composite Rating of 97, and is ranked seventh in the large Medical-Products industry group.

LinkedIn stock plunged on Feb. 5 after the Mountain View, Calif., company forecast full-year 2016 revenue below consensus estimates, owing to an advertising slowdown.But RBC's Mark Mahaney says a survey of human resource professionals shows LinkedIn is “reasonably well positioned against very large recruitment and advertising TAMs (total addressable markets).”LinkedIn shares climbed 2%.Wunderlich raised its PT on Proofpoint to 75 from 67. The security software firm hosted an analyst day Thursday in San Francisco, where it introduced 2020 financial targets, including reaching $1 billion in revenue.Proofpoint, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 43 out of a possible 99, fell 1.8%.Guggenheim Securities initiated coverage on medical product makers Boston Scientific (BSX) and Stryker (SYK) with buy ratings.Boston Scientific has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a possible 99 and climbed 2.3% Thursday, while Strykers has a CR of 94 and added 0.9%.Guggenheim started coverage on Spectranetics (SPNC)  with a buy rating while Edward Lifesciences (EW) and Medtronic (MDT) both have neutral ratings.Raymond James, Longbow Research, Deutsche Bank and UBS downgraded Restoration Hardware (RH) to neutral.

70,SYK,"Spinal-product stocks were on the move Tuesday, as LDR Holding (LDRH) agreed to be acquired by device giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), coming after NuVasive (NUVA) made a smaller buyout late Monday.LDR stock soared 64% on the stock market today to 37.03, roughly the price that Zimmer agreed to pay in a deal that would amount to a total of $1 billion. Zimmer said it's buying LDR for its technologies in cervical disc replacement, which it called ""the fastest-growing segment within the $10 billion spine industry."" LDR's technology is designed to make spinal surgery simpler and less invasive.LDR, founded in 2000, is still losing money, but Zimmer said it should have no impact on EPS this year or next.RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro said the buyout should boost Zimmer's profile in the fragmented spine industry.""The combined portfolio raises Zimmer's spine market share from 5% to 7%, putting the company within striking distance of Strkyer (SYK) and NuVasive, who hold 8% and 9% of the market, respectively,"" Novarro wrote in a research note. ""Currently, LDR reps cover approximately 50% of U.S. spine surgeons. By utilizing the combined sales force, Zimmer should be able to quickly expand the coverage footprint for both Mobi-C and the MiVo suite of products, both locally and abroad.""Zimmer stock, which touched a record high of 123.43 on May 27, closed down 1.7%. The stock ranks No. 40 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.Zimmer stock has the highest-possible Composite Rating of 99. Learn more with IBD Stock Checkup.NuVasive stock jumped briefly to an all-time high of 59.71 in early trading Tuesday, finished up 0.9% at 57.86 by the close. Late Monday, the company said that it agreed to pay $98 million in cash for Biotronic NeuroNetwork, which makes systems that monitor patients' nervous systems during surgery.NuVasive said the buyout will expand its clinical-services arm, doubling its U.S. footprint, which supplement its surgical products to offer ""spine solutions"" to surgeons.Another spine startup, Globus Medical (GMED), rose 1.8% in unusually high volume Tuesday, perhaps buoyed by further buyout possibilities in the space.Leerink analyst Richard Newitter also noted that industry giant Medtronic (MDT) said at its analyst day Monday that it expects growth to pick up in the spine business after a few years of lagging, which he sees as positive for the smaller players.""We still believe Medtronic's recent spine growth improvement stems more from underlying market stabilization/improvement (and less bad inFuse erosion) vs. enhanced competitive positioning vs. smaller players, and thus we have our doubts whether the company will become sustainably more effective at fending off market-share loss from players such as NuVasive (and) Globus Medical,"" Newitter wrote in a research note.Newitter wrote that he prefers NuVasive to Globus as a stock, and IBD's rating system agrees: NuVasive has a Composite Rating of 90, while Globus has a 75 CR.
"
71,SYK,"Orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK) beat Wall Street's Q1 estimates and raised guidance Wednesday, sending its stock up about 1% in after-hours trading.Stryker reported earnings of $1.24 a share, up 12% from the year-earlier quarter and topping analysts' consensus of $1.20, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales rose 5% to $2.5 billion, slightly above consensus. On a constant-currency basis, sales grew 6.1% in the quarter.Stryker added half a percentage point to its full-year organic sales-growth guidance, now 5.5% to 6.5%. EPS guidance was raised and tightened to $5.65 to $5.80, from $5.57 to $5.77. For the second quarter, Stryker guided earnings of $1.33 to $1.38 a share, on the high side of Wall Street's estimate of $1.34.Stryker's sales grew across all three of its divisions — orthopedics, MedSurg and neurotechnology/spine — which CEO Kevin Lobo said provided the confidence to raise organic sales guidance this early in the year.""I feel very good about the strength of our entire business portfolio,"" he said on a conference call with analysts.The major weak point was international sales — contributing more than a quarter of total revenue — which declined 4.6% on a reported basis and by a fraction on a constant-currency basis. The economic troubles in China and Brazil have been affecting the company since last year, but Lobo said he expects the impact to ease in the second half of this year. Last year's Q1 was especially strong in emerging markets, sharpening the most recent quarter's decline, he said. Also, he noted, ""the inventory bleeds will eventually bleed out.""Analysts were also impressed by the 21% organic growth in the Neurotechnology unit, the fastest-growing subdivision in the company. The bulk of the business comes from Stryker's line of catheters, stents and coils for treating hemorrhagic stroke, but the company also is seeing growth from its newer products treating ischemic stroke, which is a new market.""There are many strokes that hadn't been treated prior,"" Lobo said on the call. ""When you're creating a new market it's difficult to predict the pace of growth, but there's no doubt the growth will be very significant. Obviously, that contributed to the strong performance of neurovascular.""Orthopedics and MedSurg (a division of surgical products) both reported 4.6% organic growth in the quarter. Spinal products rose 8.9%.Analysts on the call also remarked on the improvement Stryker's operating margin, which rose to 24.2% from 20.8%. Stifel analyst Rick Wise questioned how sustainable this was, given the ups and downs of margins in prior quarters, but Lobo sounded confident.""I'm not going to promise 90 basis points (of improvement) every single quarter, but we are committed to driving leverage at the operating level,"" Lobo said. ""You'll see that this year, and you'll see that when we provide guidance for you in 2017.""Interest expenses were somewhat higher than normal in the quarter due to three recent acquisitions: Sage Products, which makes oral, skin-care and cleaning products; Physio-Control International, which makes monitors and defibrillators; and Synergetics, which filled out the neurology & spine portfolio. Stryker management noted that both the Sage and Physio-Control deals had closed ahead of schedule, in early April.Stryker stock is up about 19% for the year, hitting a series of new highs since it broke out of a consolidation last month. Despite its recent pattern of single-digit growth, it has attained a strong Composite Rating of 91. In regular trading on the stock market today it rose 0.9% to 110.73 after hitting an intraday high of 110.97, a penny short of the all-time high it hit the previous day. About 90 minutes after the close, the stock had cracked 112.

73,SYK,"Robotic-surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) beat Wall Street's Q1 earnings estimates late Tuesday, but the stock was down 1% in after-hours trading.Intuitive Surgical's earnings totaled $4.42 a share, up 24% from the year-earlier quarter and topping analysts' consensus of $4.33 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales gained 12% to $595 million, vs. analysts' $593 million.Intuitive Surgical is one of the highest-rated stocks in the Medical Systems group, which is collectively doing well at No. 24 on IBD's ranking of 197 industry groups. Shares hit a lifetime high of 630.67 last Wednesday, and have hovered within 1% of that mark since then. The stock closed down a fraction in regular trade on the stock market today, at 623.71.Intuitive Surgical is the second of three hot medical stocks reporting earnings this week. Earlier Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) hit a new high of 113.95 after it beat Q1 estimates and raised its full-year guidance due to diminishing foreign-exchange headwinds. Stryker (SYK), which also hit a new high of 110.98 early Tuesday but gave back its gains later, is due to report earnings Wednesday after the close.
"
74,SYK,"Medical giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat Q1 estimates and raised guidance Tuesday morning, sending its stock to its fifth recent record high.J&J reported earnings of $1.68 a share, up 8% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales rose 0.6% to $17.48 billion, matching consensus. J&J said that the foreign-exchange impact knocked 6.6 percentage points off sales growth.Nonetheless, the forex headwinds finally seem to be abating. J&J cited the improved forex outlook as the reason it was raising full-year sales guidance by $400 million, to $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion. It also added 10 cents to EPS guidance, now $6.53 to $6.68.IBD's Take: Johnson & Johnson rated No. 1 in its group, but CR is iffy.""Our Pharmaceuticals business continues to deliver impressive levels of growth, we have steady improvement in our Consumer business, and we are seeing momentum in our Medical Devices businesses, all of which are fueling our optimism for the full-year ahead,"" J&J CEO Alex Gorsky said in a statement.J&J stock was up 2% in early trading on the stock market today, touching a record high of 113.60 intraday. The stock is up more than 10% for the year so far, and it is the first of three medical stocks that are hitting new highs and are reporting this week, the others being Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) this evening and Stryker (SYK) late Wednesday.""This morning, J&J continued the growth momentum the company has seen in recent quarters, again delivering organic sales growth acceleration and its second consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth on an adjusted, operational basis,"" wrote Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy in a research note.She noted that, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, M&A activity and shrinking sales of hepatitis C drug Olysio -- which was made obsolete when Gilead Sciences (GILD) released Harvoni in late 2014 -- sales rose 6.9%. Operating EPS growth was just above 10%.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote that the pharma sales beat was driven by the immunology franchise -- Remicade, Simponi and Stelara -- as well as its stroke prevention treatment Xarelto.But another top seller, diabetes drug Invokana, missed consensus by 19%. Investors had been wondering if Invokana would take a hit from Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance, which last September proved that it could dramatically cut deaths from heart failure but didn't get a sales bump from this in Q4.
"
75,SYK,"The medical industry has a lot to prove in the upcoming Q1 earnings season, as the last round of earnings and guidance didn't do much to reassure investors who were already nervous for other reasons. However, some major stocks in the sector have been hitting new highs lately, especially on the hardware side of the group. Here are three such companies reporting earnings this week:• Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) takes its traditional place at the head of the line as it reports its earnings early Tuesday, the first of the big drug companies to report in this cycle. Its growth is expected to be modest, due to both its gigantic size and the foreign-exchange headwinds that have been dragging on global companies' earnings this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that Q1 revenue rose 0.7% over the year-earlier quarter to $17.5 billion. Earnings are estimated at $1.66 a share, up 6%.Despite its muted growth, Johnson & Johnson stock hit a record high of 110.40 in trading Friday (closing the day at 110.18, up a fraction), and has maintained an IBD Relative Strength Rating in the 80s for the last six weeks.The mood on Wall Street going into the quarter seems bullish. Late Thursday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro raised his estimates based on his reading of drug-prescription and foreign-exchange trends.""IMS (IMS) script trends for several key drugs suggest another strong pharma quarter in 1Q (+9% year-over-year ex-FX and Olysio),"" Novarro wrote. (Olysio is a hepatitis C treatment.) ""Additionally, our analysis of currency movements since the beginning of the year suggests the negative FX impact on full-year results should be less than initially expected.""Novarro noted that one likely topic of conversation on the conference call will be this month's FDA approval of Pfizer’s (PFE) Inflectra, a biosimilar version of J&J's blockbuster immunology drug Remicade.• Robotic-surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is due to report after the close Tuesday. Analysts estimate that its Q1 earnings rose 21% over last year's Q1 to $4.33 a share, with sales up 11.5% to $593 million.Intuitive Surgical has also been a top-performing stock lately, as the company has been making a comeback financially with the rollout of its da Vinci Xi surgical system and improving procedure growth. Intuitive Surgical stock hit a new high of 630.67 on Wednesday, up more than 15% this year, and boasts an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 98. It closed Friday at 624.22.""Heading into 1Q, the key question for investors is whether the stock is baking in too much optimism or is this the start of a new product cycle,"" Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in an email to clients Friday. ""We expect procedure volumes to be healthy, with growth in general surgery leading the way (extra day from leap year should also help).""• Similar concerns about an over-optimistic market seem to be dogging orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK), which is due to report after the close Wednesday. The stock has also been on a roll, on Wednesday hitting a new high of 110.40 that was 19% above where it wound up last year. Shares closed Friday at 109.80.Stryker stock kept climbing last week even though Robert W. Baird downgraded it to neutral and Barclays resumed coverage at underweight. The latter wrote that Stryker's valuation appears to be full going into its Q1 and that it's facing more competition from a rejuvenated Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).Analysts covering Stryker estimate that sales rose 3.9% in the quarter to $2.47 billion, with earnings up 8% to $1.20 a share.

76,SYK,"Some pockets of the health care sector are ailing. Others have perked right up.IShares U.S. Medical Devices (IHI) bounded to a 52-week high of 129.93 Thursday as it eyes a fourth straight weekly gain.Its relative strength line -- a gauge of its performance vs. the S&P 500 -- is bolting higher in defiance of the overall stock market mood. The market uptrend has come under pressure this week.IHI is a targeted bet on a health care niche. It invests in 47 U.S. companies that manufacture and distribute medical devices. Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is a top-rated IBD stock within this industry group, based on measures of technical and fundamental health such as earnings and sales growth.IHI counts Edwards among its top 10 holdings and gives it a 4.4% portfolio weighting.Edwards' stock has jumped 39% in the past three months. The California-based company is battling for the top spot in the heart-valve market. Its Sapien 3 received FDA approval for treatment of high-risk patients suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis. Its chief rival is Medtronic (MDT), the No. 1 holding in the IHI portfolio.Edwards will report quarterly results April 26 after the close. Wall Street stock analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters expect an 18% gain in earnings for the quarter and 17% for the year.

77,SYK,"Two major stocks held by IHI reported this week.Late Tuesday, surgical-robot maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) beat Q1 earnings estimates and the stock hit a new high Wednesday after receiving a series of price target hikes. On Wednesday, orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK) also beat expectations and raised guidance.Both Stryker and Intuitive stocks have fallen since then in volatile trade.IHI also has smaller weightings in Cantel Medical (CMN), Steris (STE) and Cynosure (CYNO) -- device specialists with top-notch IBD Composite Ratings of 99, 98 and 97, respectively.Steris provides products to prevent infections and control contamination. It reported a 31% jump in sales in its latest reported quarter, helped by the buyout of U.K.-based Synergy Health.Small-cap Cantel Medical is also in the infection control and prevention business.

The company forecast 2015 sales of around $230 million, about $14 million ahead of consensus and up from an estimated $175 million to $176 million last year.

""Their average yield is about 1.5%, which is below the S&P 500's 1.9% on trailing earnings,"" he said. ""Retail chains are well built out, so they're not doing a lot of spending, which leaves them more to return to shareholders.""
"
137,SYK,"He added, ""Home Depot (HD) is a good example of a consumer discretionary stock that should benefit from (those) tailwinds."" Consumers are increasingly comfortable making home upgrades and repairs because home values are up, the economy is stable and jobs feel more secure, Kirby says.

He sees its capital adequacy ratio rising. ""At the same time, their litigation expenses should be declining, while their loan growth is anemic,"" Kirby said. ""So they'll have more cash for shareholders.""Their legal costs stem from such missteps as the ""London whale"" trading losses and practices related to mortgage-backed securities.He also likes the prospects of CME Group (CME). Rising interest rates tend to stoke stock market volatility. Money managers often hedge to defend against volatility. ""As a derivatives exchange, they would see more volume,"" he said.Retailers' StocksAnd Kirby sees potential dividend growth of at least 20% for the consumer discretionary sector. ""Their average yield is about 1.5%, which is below the S&P 500's 1.9% on trailing earnings,"" he said. ""Retail chains are well built out, so they're not doing a lot of spending, which leaves them more to return to shareholders.""He added, ""Home Depot (HD) is a good example of a consumer discretionary stock that should benefit from (those) tailwinds."" Consumers are increasingly comfortable making home upgrades and repairs because home values are up, the economy is stable and jobs feel more secure, Kirby says.Kirby dislikes the dividend prospects for smaller U.S. energy exploration-production firms, since low oil prices could hurt their earnings.But he says that large, multinational, integrated majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSB), Total (TOT) and BP (BP) ""will be able to maintain dividends by taking on debt, selling assets and reducing capital expenditures. And Total and Shell don't do share buybacks, which will leave them more for paying dividends.""Taylor likes large-cap tech names with ample dividend yields, such as Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM) and Apple (AAPL).And he likes holdings that are likely to echo this year's dividend hikes in 2015. He cites pump maker Pentair (PNR), insurer Erie Indemnity (ERIE), control-device maker Johnson Controls (JCI) and medical-devices maker Stryker (SYK).David Spangler, who runs the equities parts of two Thrivent funds, says that investors should not look for the highest dividends. Instead, seek companies strong enough to raise dividends.

143,SYK,"December is usually a quiet month for medical tech news, but this year will bring a few potentially stock-moving events worth keeping an eye on.As you digest your Thanksgiving turkey, here are the top five in chronological order:By Dec. 5, biotech Incyte (INCY) is looking to get an important expansion of the label on its sole marketed drug, Jakafi. As explained in the recent Incyte profile in The New America, Incyte and its partner Novartis (NVS) have been pulling in respectable income on Jakafi as a treatment for a rare bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis. The FDA is pondering whether to add an indication for polycythemia vera, a milder but more common condition. While uptake for that condition is expected to be fairly slow, it's expected to help push Incyte into more consistently profitable territory next year.Two days later, hot medical-device company Edwards Lifesciences (EW) will hold its annual investor day, in which it is expected to give 2015 guidance for the first time. The company impressed the Street last month with its strong Q3 report and Q4 guidance, on the strong launch of its latest Sapien artificial heart valve. Currently, analysts are forecasting 2015 sales of $2.47 billion, up 7% from this year's estimate. Earnings per share are expected to rise 17% to $3.95.Then, sometime before Dec. 21 (which likely means Dec. 19), the FDA is due to issue its verdict on AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis C combo of Viekirax and Exviera. The clinical-trial data was so good, the Street would probably be less surprised if a meteor hit Manhattan than if the FDA rejects the drug, but what has analysts all on pins and needles is what the price will be. A price significantly lower than Gilead Sciences ' (GILD) recently launched Harvoni, which costs $94,000 for a 12-week treatment, would help AbbVie gain market share and certainly please pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts (ESRX), which has been hoping to start a price war to drive down the suddenly high cost of hepatitis C treatment. However, most analysts are expecting AbbVie to price only a little bit lower. Also affected by all this will be Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA), which licensed a component of Viekirax to AbbVie.Speaking of hepatitis C, sometime before the end of the year the Street is expecting to hear phase one clinical-trial data on Achillion Pharmaceuticals' (ACHN) ACH-3422. The drug belongs to the coveted nucleoside inhibitor class, to which Gilead's mega-blockbuster Sovaldi (also a component in Harvoni) belongs, but which has otherwise shown enough safety issues that there are few left in development. Especially since Merck (MRK) acquired Idenix Pharmaceuticals for its ""nuc,"" speculation that Achillion could be the next target has driven up its stock price, but the Street has seen little real data about the safety and effectiveness of ACH-3422. The data would help analysts determine just how much the company is worth.Speculation exists about whether two aborted takeover attempts earlier this year will be re-upped. The Street seems to have mostly given up on the possibility that Pfizer (PFE) will make another bid for AstraZeneca (AZN) after the six-month cooling-off period mandated under U.K. takeover rules expired on Wednesday. Astra's CEO Pascal Soriot threw more cold water while appearing on CNBC Thursday, saying the deal would have fallen apart even if it had been made because of proposed restrictions on tax-inversion deals in the U.S. However, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro is still holding out hope for a union of orthopedics firms Stryker (SYK) and Smith & Nephew (SNN). Stryker didn't bid for the company, but since a news report leaked that it was working on one, it got slapped with the U.K.'s six-month cooling-off period anyway, which expired Nov. 28.""We believe a SYK/SNN deal could provide more recon (reconstructive surgery) scale, particularly in international markets, expand SYK's presence in trauma/sports medicine, and bring cost synergies,"" Novarro wrote in a note Friday.

145,SYK,"Medical equipment makers Becton Dickinson (BDX) and CareFusion hit new highs on the stock market today after their $12.2 billion buyout deal was announced Sunday evening.

146,SYK,"On a conference call with analysts Monday morning, company leaders said the two firms complement each other both technologically and geographically. CareFusion (CFN) sells mostly in the U.S. while BD sells mostly outside of it, and the combined portfolio of products and services should offer a full suite for the $20 billion medication management industry, they said.
"
147,SYK,"They also fielded questions about why BD is making such a large buyout, which does not fit its recent history of tuck-in deals. In response, they cited the consolidation of the customer base, the need to cut costs and the necessity of a global presence when most growth in the industry is coming from emerging markets.
"
148,SYK,"Such factors have been driving consolidation in the medtech market, with both Medtronic's (MDT) $43 billion buyout of Covidien (COV) and Zimmer's (ZMH) $13.35 billion acquisition of Biomet already in the works.

149,SYK,"""As the third big MedTech deal to be announced this year, this transaction will likely be viewed as yet another indication that scale is taking on an increasing level of importance to management teams as they plan for future positioning of their companies,"" wrote Leerink analyst Richard Newitter in a research note. ""It could add pressure to companies with strong balance sheets (and often talked about as likely acquirers) like Stryker (SYK) or Abbott (ABT) to put capital to work sooner rather than later and potentially toward a larger-sized transaction.""
"
150,SYK,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro echoed the point in his note and added that ""acquisition of smaller cap medtech companies may continue to be pushed out as large-cap medtech companies digest their recent sizeable acquisitions.""

179,SYK,"On Jul 6, we issued an updated research report on Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report). While we are encouraged by the company’s global accepted advanced therapies, its escalating costs and expenses raise concerns. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of Medtronic have outperformed the industry. The stock has grown 9.2% compared with the industry’s 8.8% rise.Notably, Medtronic exited fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected fourth-quarter performances. All major business groups contributed to its solid top-line growth at CER, highlighting sustainability across groups and regions in addition to displaying a successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. Also, a gradually stabilizing Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) market buoys optimism on the stock.The receipt of FDA approval for the DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) therapy as an adjunctive treatment to reduce partial-onset seizures raises hope for the company in the target medical market. Medtronic is also focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. The company is highly positive about its foray into the $1-billion standalone CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) market with its Guardian Connect.We are currently upbeat about the latest FDA nod to its MiniMed 670G system for patients with type 1 diabetes between seven and 13 years of age.Significantly, Medtronic’s new restructuring initiative — Enterprise Excellence plan — is aimed at $3-billion annual growth run rate savings by the end of fiscal 2022. Per the company, this new program has been designed to increase its effectiveness and growth-related reinvestment ability along with providing a consistent boost to its margin expansion as well as driving the EPS leverage.On the flip side, the company has been exposed to steep costs and expenses, weighing heavily on its margins. Also, its 2019 guidance remains conservative on the apprehension of lackluster Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG) plus Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG) performances. This in turn, dampens investors’ confidence in the stock.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

181,SYK,"Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2018 results are scheduled for release on Jul 24, after market close. The company’s acquisition-driven strategy is expected to boost growth by expanding product offerings across all segments.We expect the company to witness steady growth in sales from Orthopaedic Implant — one of its major revenue-generating components. While this is projected to drive second-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments, especially MedSurg, will help the company drive impressive results.Notably, in the last reported quarter, Stryker posted earnings of $1.68, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5%.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.32 billion, reflecting a rise of 10.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at $1.73, indicating a year-over-year increase of 13.1%.Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Stryker Corporation QuoteOrthopaedic Implant in FocusOrthopaedic Implant contributed 37.7% to net revenues in the last reported quarter. In the last reported quarter, revenues at the segment were up 5% organically. The upside can be attributed to a significant year-over-year increase in Mako robot installations. The coveted Mako platform also recorded strong performances in Japan, South Pacific and Canada. Globally, Stryker installed 28 Mako robots, of which 24 were in the United States.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orthopaedic Implant for the quarter to be reported is at $1.23 billion, reflecting a rise of 8.1% year over year.Other Factors at PlayMedSurg Unit to Drive GrowthMedSurg Equipment products include surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.In the last reported quarter, the segment accounted for 44.1% of the company’s net sales. Revenues in the segment grew 9.1% at constant currency (cc) to $1.43 billion.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MedSurg equipment revenues is pegged at $1.48 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.4%.Domestic & International RevenuesStryker is well balanced on its high domestic and international revenues.In the last reported quarter, domestic revenues accounted for a significant 71.3% of net sales. Meanwhile, international sales accounted for 28.6% of total revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stryker’s domestic sales is pinned at $2.39 billion, up 8.7% year over year. The same for international revenues stands at $920 million, up 13.4% year over year.AcquisitionsStryker completed the buyout of Entellus Medical for $662 million. Entellus is integrated within Stryker’s core Neurotechnology & Spine segment. This will enable physicians to conveniently perform a broad range of ENT procedures. However, the acquisition is expected be dilutive initially to Stryker’s 2018 adjusted earnings per share by approximately 4 cents. This is likely to affect the top line in the quarter to be reported. (Read More: Stryker Closes Entellus Buyout, Bolsters Neurotechnology Line)Stryker was lately in news for making an offer to take over Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report). However, no further terms of the deal have been revealed by Stryker.

182,SYK,"On Jul 5, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). We are currently looking forward to the company’s Rite Aid store purchase, expected to benefit the company in the long run. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Walgreens Boots reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Solid pharmacy sales growth encourages us. Moreover, the company has been gaining from strategic tie-ups. We are also upbeat about Walgreens Boots’ alliance with Express Scripts, aiming to expand both companies’ existing group purchasing efforts.This latest pact is likely to improve Express Scripts’ supply chain, making medicines including biosimilars affordable and accessible to patients.This apart, the Rite Aid deal seems to benefit Walgreens Boots in more ways than one. Accordingly, the collaboration allowed Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreens Boots’ affiliate at a cost equivalent to the company’s for about 10 years, which buoys optimism. Also, Rite Aid provides Walgreens Boots with certain transition services for up to three years post the deal closure.The deal’s financial value is attractive. Post the transaction’s initial completion, synergies of $300 million are estimated to be realized within a span of four years. The amount will be derived, primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.We are hopeful about Walgreen Boots’ global footprint expansion with its decision to acquire a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores, a subsidiary of China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. On its culmination, this investment should add a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business. Notably, Shanghai-based GuoDa is a large national pharmacy chain in China.However, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of fierce competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to reap benefits from its growth initiatives, major business tycoons are already advancing in pharmacy businesses, flaunting a fair market share.Notably, a slowdown in generic introduction over the last few years has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. Also, an escalated reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been denting Walgreens Boots’ margins significantly.In June 2018, Walgreens Boots sold a 30% interest in Chinese drug wholesaler Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The alliance was formed back in 2008 as an equal partnership between Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Co Ltd and legacy Alliance Boots. Although, this sell-off follows a lucrative cash return offer, its overall impact on the company’s business may induce an adverse impact.Over the past three months, shares of Walgreens Boots have underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 1.7%, wider than the industry’s 1.4% gain.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) and Integer Holdings Corporation (ITGR  -  Free Report).Genomic Health projects an earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the to-be-reported quarter.

183,SYK,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Cryterion Medical, Inc. — a privately-held developer of a single-shot cryoablation platform for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.Through this acquisition, Boston Scientific will become the only company to boast a comprehensive portfolio, covering both the cryothermal and radiofrequency single-shot, balloon-based ablation therapies.Cryterion Medical plans to submit the clinical evidence from the ongoing study of its cryoablation system to get the CE Mark in early 2019. Further, the company plans to submit an investigational device exemption application to the FDA to seek regulatory approval in the United States.Financial Terms of the DealBoston Scientific has an existing investment in Cryterion Medical and is going to make a net upfront payment of approximately $202 million in cash for the remaining stake of around 65%.However, the transaction is not expected to be accretive to the company’s adjusted earnings per share through 2020.Glimpse of EP BusinessBoston Scientific’s EP business develops less-invasive medical technologies to diagnose and treat disorders of heart rate as well as rhythm.In first-quarter 2018, revenues in this division improved 11.5% year over year to $75 million, organically. The upside was driven by the higher uptake of the new RHYTHMIA HDx platform. Management continues to roll out the HDx platform in Europe and it recently launched the platform in the United States as well as Japan.Overall, the company continues to expand the toolkit that supports RHYTHMIA HDx, providing ablation technologies that match the excellence of its Mapping System. Additionally, it focuses on adding tools that expand the reach and utility of RHYTHMIA HDx in different procedures.Moreover, to expand its EP business, Boston Scientific recently announced the acquisition of Securus Medical Group, Inc — a privately-held developer of the thermal monitoring system for the continuous measurement of esophageal temperature.Market PotentialBoston Scientific’s strategy to boost the EP business seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global cardiac monitoring and cardiac rhythm management market is expected to reach a value of $32,216 million from 2016 to 2022, at a CAGR of 7.6%.Per the company, the global EP market is expected to worth $5 billion in 2018. Further, growing at double digits, single-shot ablation therapies are estimated to be the most rapidly growing sub-segment within the EP market.Thus, the addition of the single-shot cryoablation platform will help Boston Scientific cash in on the abundant opportunities in the global cardiac monitoring and cardiac rhythm management market.Share Price PerformanceBoston Scientific has been gaining investors’ confidence on consistently positive results.

Resultantly, earnings estimates increased around 8.2% to $6.20 per share.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year revenues of $2.30 billion reflects an improvement of 6.4% year over year.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Solid Global ProspectsIn first-quarter 2018, Bio-Rad derived around 62% of its net sales globally. While Europe happens to be the largest international market for the company, first-quarter revenue growth in the region was apparently sluggish. Offsetting this softness, Bio-Rad performed reasonably well, primarily in North America, China and the Asia-Pacific region.Growth in All LinesBio-Rad witnessed sales growth across all channels in the first quarter. Sales in the Life Science segment were driven by higher demand for Droplet Digital PCR, process chromatography and cell biology product lines. Further, rising net sales at the Clinical Diagnostics indicated growth in immunology, diabetes and quality control product lines.Impressive Synergies From RainDanceBio-Rad completed the acquisition of RainDance Technologies, Inc. in February 2017. The acquired entity was integrated into its Life Science segment in a bid to solidify its position in the Droplet Digital PCR space.Further, Bio-Rad has begun to realize synergies from the RainDance acquisition. In first-quarter 2018, Bio-Rad recorded $6 million of RainDance sales in comparison to $2 million in the previous year.

186,SYK,"It seems that Insulet Corporation (PODD  -  Free Report) is pulling out all the stops to strengthen its international operations. Following its news of commencing direct commercial operations in Europe, the company once again hit headlines with another major development via its Omnipod Insulin Management Systemin Canada.Per the news release, Omnipod — Insulet’s tubeless insulin pump technology — has been selected as the preferred insulin pump for diabetic patients in the province of British Columbia, Canada, under the expanded British Columbia PharmaCare insulin pump program.This is a big breakthrough for the company to fortify its foothold in Canada as from now on,any eligible patient, requesting an insulin pump for the first time or for its replacement, will receive a coverage under the Omnipod System.Insulin Pump Prospects in CanadaOmnipod’s huge market potential in Canada is evident from its only tubeless insulin pump system sold in the region. The system supplies continuous insulin for up to three days without the use of tubes, which eliminates the worry of administering multiple daily injections. Currently, Omnipod is available for all age groups in British Columbia.With growing prevalence of diabetes in Canada, we believe this development by Insulet to be well-timed. According to Research and Market data, Canada insulin pump market has immense growth opportunities with its value projected to reach nearly CAD 1 billion mark by the end of 2024.

With the coverage widening beyond 25 years of age, the company anticipates insulin pump adoption to increase significantly.While Insulet’s Omnipod earned the status of a preferred insulin pump for diabetic patients in British Columbia, Medtronic’s MiniMed insulin pump system is another popularly-used diabetes management device in Canada, but in tubing category.Share Price PerformanceOver the past six months, shares of Insulet have consistently outperformed the industry it belongs to.

188,SYK,"Insulet Corporation (PODD  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has commenced direct commercial operations in Europe for its Omnipod Insulin Management System. This development is a major breakthrough in the company’s international portfolio. Going forward, Insulet will provide sales, distribution, customer support and product services for its diabetic support system, Omnipod.With the Europe insulin pump market projected to reach a value of more than $2.4 billion by the end of 2024 (data by Market Research Hub), this achievement by Insulet is touted to be timely and strategic.Insulet’s objective to assume direct commercial operation in Europe surfaced last July. Previously, the company used to run its European business with the assistance of a local distributor named Ypsomed. The termination of the exclusive distribution agreement with Ypsomed saw Insulet form a European team of above 100 employees with extensive diabetes knowledge and expertise within the European markets.Insulet currently has 140,000 Omnipod users worldwide. We expect this number to grow fast with the latest progress in Europe. The company is confident about the infrastructure and believes, it is well-positioned to cash in on the rapidly-growing European customer base and enhancing gross margins.In this context, Insulet has tied up with Teleperformance and HealthLink, which will provide local customer care and product support along with distribution and logistics services. Insulet also entered into distribution agreements with Theras Group and Nordic Infucare in order to receive complete service distribution of Omnipod in Italy as well as in the Nordic markets.Insulin Pump Growth Prospects in EuropeGoing by a Market Research Hub report, the European insulin pump market has extremely high potential, backed by the surging diabetes population. Factors contributing to the growth of insulin pump in Europe are the increasing ageing population, rising prevalence of diabetes, growing awareness on the benefits of insulin pump, higher per capita disposable income and progressive diabetes infrastructure.With insulin pumps gradually gaining popularity over traditional techniques, the adoption rate has shot up among diabetes patients in Europe. Needless to say, this latest strategic initiative by Insulet is going to reinforce the company’s global operation to a large extent.Share PerformanceOver the past six months, Insulet has consistently outperformed the industry it belongs to.

189,SYK,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the earlier-announced joint venture (JV) with Internet Brands, a KKR portfolio company, in a bid to fortify its Dental business. The companies have named the joint venture Henry Schein One. However, financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Henry Schein One has integrated the portfolio of practice management systems under its dental practice management software company — Henry Schein Practice Solutions — with Internet Brands’ web-based software applications. The new company is expected to deliver integrated dental technology to help improve practice management, marketing as well as patient communication.Per Henry Schein, the newly formed JV will combine Henry Schein Practice Solutions' products and services like Dentrix, Dentrix Ascend, Easy Dental and TechCentral, Henry Schein's international dental practice management systems including Software of Excellence, Logiciel Julie, InfoMed, Exan and Labnet with the dental businesses of Internet Brands including web-based solutions such as Demandforce, Sesame Communications, Officite and DentalPlans.com. The combined entity registered pro-forma 2017 sales of approximately $400 million. Of this, approximately $100 million is drawn from Internet Brands’ dental businesses. Excluding the impact of around $4.5 million one-time transfer taxes, Henry Schein had earlier anticipated the deal to be immaterial to the rest of 2018 earnings per share and be accretive to its bottom line thereafter. Furthermore, annual synergies between $20 million and $30 million are expected to be realized by the end of the third year of the joint venture initiation.Dental Business — Major Growth DriverHenry Schein’s Dental business accounts for 48.1% of total revenues in the last reported quarter. Accordingly, it has been leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its foothold on this business. Moreover, Henry Schein signed distribution agreements with DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY) only last year, to distribute the latter's entire product line.We are also encouraged by Henry Schein’s reliance on part of its strategic plan, which is digital dentistry. The company is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Per management, the company’s solid performance can be attributed to its continued focus on offering a diversified portfolio and value-added services along with a favorable end market. Thus, we believe that Henry Schein’s latest tie-up is a strategic leap taken by the company.Market PotentialPer the company, a rise in oral healthcare expenditure within the dental industry, is predicted in tandem with the increase in middle-aged population (45 years and above).

190,SYK,"On Jul 12, we issued an updated research report on QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report). The company's business is expected to get a boost from its flourishing molecular diagnostic market, international expansion, extended test menu and growth-driving strategic collaborations.Meanwhile, over the past month, shares of QIAGEN have underperformed its industry. The stock has lost 1.37% versus the industry’s 3.7% increase.Declining HPV sales in the United States persist to be a drag for QIAGEN. Slowing APAC sales also remain soft due to sluggish applied testing business.Moreover, QIAGEN is exposed to stiff competition. The company is facing a severe rivalry from firms providing similar pre-analytical solutions and other products used by its customers. This incites a fierce cut-throat contest within the industry. QIAGEN's woes are further aggravated by the highly aggressive and price sensitive markets for some of its products. Also, a heavy reliance on collaborations and declining HPV (Human papillomavirus) sales in the United States act as other negatives for this industry player.QIAGEN N.V. Price QIAGEN N.V. Price | QIAGEN N.V. QuoteOn a positive note, we are upbeat about QIAGEN's progress with the test menu expansion strategy. In April, the company announced the receipt of FDA's pre-market approval for PartoSure.

The company is planning to launch the QIAstat-Dx  test in the United States as well as across other geographies in 2019. Additionally, QIAGEN introduced two novel liquid biopsy panels, namely AdnaTest ProstateCancerPanel AR-V7 Kit and AdnaTest LungCancer Kit.During the first quarter of 2018, QIAGEN announced receiving an approval from Japan's Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare for QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) as an in vitro diagnostic to detect tuberculosis (TB) infection. Further, the recently-changed guidelines issued by the World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and International Panel Physicians Association will add an impetus to the rising popularity of proactive latent TB screening and treatment.We also look forward to the implementation of the recently-drawn strategies to boost top-line contributions from the NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) portfolio.Zacks Rank & Key PicksQIAGEN currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks from the broader Medical space include Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

The Act has lowered corporate tax rates to 21% from the earlier 35%, which buoys optimism. Additionally, the Senate’s decision of postponing the Medical Device tax, which will be put into effect on Jan 1, 2020, has instilled confidence in investors.

194,SYK,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Jul 25.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.5%. Moreover, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.4%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, we are upbeat about solid contributions from Boston Scientific’s Cardiovascular business which comprises Interventional Cardiology (IC) and Peripheral Interventions (PI). In the last reported quarter, the company generated 39.2% of its total revenues from the highest revenue generating segment.We are optimistic about the IC business that will help the company maintain impressive global growth, courtesy of an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams. The division performed well in the last reported quarter, despite the LOTUS recall in Europe. Worldwide IC growth came on the back of strength in Structural Heart and complex PCI (percutaneouscoronary intervention) portfolio. However, the upside was partially offset by weak performance by the drug-eluting stents.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteWithin Structural Heart, we are looking forward to Boston Scientific’s WATCHMAN, ACURATE and IRIS product lines that are expected to contribute to the top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. The company expects revenues from WATCHMAN and ACURATE TAVR franchise to total approximately $400 million in 2018.The WATCHMAN program depicted impressive performance in first-quarter 2018. The product has been used in more than 50,000 implants, worldwide. Moreover, the company expects continued growth in this platform on the back of increased utilization and geographical expansion.Additionally, recent launches within the IC business like the WOLVERINE cutting balloon and the company’s next-generation rotational atherectomy platform — ROTAPRO — are expected to contribute significantly to the top line in the upcoming quarterly results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IC revenues is pegged at $658 million, indicating an increase of 9.1% on a year-over-year basis. The company is expected to keep gaining strength in the business.In the last reported quarter, the PI business performed impressively on the back of higher sales of Drug-Eluting Eluvia Stents and Ranger Balloon in Europe. Geographically, the company witnessed strength in Asia as well. Boston Scientific’s Atherectomy Jetstream platform also performed well in the first quarter of 2018.The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter PI revenues is pegged at $296 million,  reflecting a rise of 8.4% year over year.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $2.47 billion indicates an increase of 9.6% from the prior-year quarter’s tally. Also, the earnings estimates of 34 cents reflect a 6.3% rise on a year-over-year basis.Other Factors at PlayAmong the other segments, MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also projected to surpass market levels, driven by investment strategies in the key international geographies.We are impressed with Boston Scientific’s recent acquisitions that have added several products (though many are under development) with immense potential. NxThera and nVision buyouts in Urology and Pelvic Health along with EmCision buyout in Endoscopy deserve a mention.The company is gradually strengthening its presence in the emerging markets  of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). In first-quarter 2018, business from the emerging markets registered a 17% growth. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 23% year over year). The company is currently looking forward to an improved performance ahead in China, following the recent approval of SYNERGY in this region.Boston Scientific is gaining traction in India as well. It is currently targeting about 10 emerging markets for additional emphasis. The company is also optimistic about core cardiology segment which is gradually stabilizing with growth in the BRIC nations. This trend is expected to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter’s results.However, although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports have raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move might affect the top-line numbers in the upcoming quarters.The company also provided second-quarter 2018 financial outlook. Adjusted EPS are expected in the range of 33-35 cents on revenues of $2.450-$2.500 billion. Here’s What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

196,SYK,"On Jul 2, we initiated a research report on Insulet Corporation (PODD  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about the company’s achievement of two milestones with respect to expansion of Omnipod’s market reach, while a tough competitive landscape raises concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of the Omnipod Insulin Management System has been outperforming its industry over the past year. The stock has gained 68.1% versus the industry’s 10.3% rise. Insulet kick-started 2018 with positive reimbursement updates. To begin with, CMS issued guidance in January which required Omnipod to be covered under the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program.Moreover, effective Apr 1, Express Scripts and Magellan, two of the Medicare Part D plan sponsors, added Omnipod as a covered benefit. Starting April 2018, Insulet received access to in-network coverage of Omnipod with UnitedHealthcare.Insulet has also taken over its new role as a direct seller of Omnipod System in Europe starting Jul 1. The company is confident about the infrastructure and believes it is well positioned to cash in on the rapidly-growing European customer base.We are also upbeat about the year-over-year revenue growth in the last reported quarter on solid uptake of Omnipod System in the United States and other geographies. Expanding global customer base along with consistent strength across all markets drove revenues.Meanwhile, Insulet operates in a highly competitive environment, dominated by firms ranging from large multinational corporations with significant resources to start-ups. Also, the competitive and regulatory conditions in the markets where the company operates limit Insulet’s ability to switch to strategies like price increases. The company’s Omnipod System primarily competes with Medtronic plc’s (MDT) market-leading MiniMed system.Also, the company is exposed to risks associated with a weaker global economy and lower reimbursement rates.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

198,SYK,"Cardinal Health, Inc’s (CAH  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 results are scheduled for release on May 3, before the market opens. While results are likely to show a decline in the core Pharmaceutical segment, growth across other segments is likely to make up partially.In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.51 per share, up 12.7% from the prior-year quarter and also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14. Revenues came in at $35.19 billion, up 6.1% on a year-over-year basis, outpacing the consensus estimate of $34.69 billion.Notably, Cardinal Health has a negative average earnings surprise of 0.3% for the trailing four quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.51, reflecting a decline of 1.3% year over year.

QuoteLet’s delve deeper.Pharmaceutical Segment in FocusIn the last reported quarter, this segment accounted for an enormous 88.5% of the company’s revenues. Revenues in the segment came in at $31.15 billion, up 4.7% on a year-over-year basis.The segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and also gained a huge number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers.However, it saw a 4% drop in profits to $514 million, thanks to generic pharmaceutical pricing and the recent investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics program performance. Per management, growth in the segment was further impeded by the expiration of a large mail order from Prime Therapeutics.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in at $29.63 billion, down 4.9% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayGuidance LiftedConsidering the benefits from the slashed federal tax rate, Cardinal Health raised the fiscal 2018 outlook. The company expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.25-$5.50, as compared with the previous range of $4.85-$5.10.Medical SegmentIn the fiscal second quarter, this segment accounted for 11.5% of the company’s revenues.

Medical segment profits increased 38% to $220 million, courtesy of higher contributions from new and existing customers and acquisition of the Patient Recovery business.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the segment is pegged at $4.07 billion, up 0.7%, sequentially.Medical Gloves UnitCardinal Health offers a robust portfolio of medical gloves including surgical gloves, exam gloves and clean-room gloves. The company has been lately facing challenges in the exam-glove sub-segment. In the last reported quarter, commodity pricing and supply disruptions were major drags for the section.For fiscal 2018, lower expectations for the Medical segment due a troubled exam-gloves segment raise concerns.Our quantitative model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Cardinal Health this earnings season.

199,SYK,"Have you been paying attention to shares of LeMaitre Vascular (LMAT  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12.2% over the past month. LMAT hit a new 52-week high of $41.28 in the previous session. LeMaitre Vascular has gained 25.8% since the start of the year compared to the -2.2% move for the Medical sector and the 3.8% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 21, 2018, LeMaitre Vascular reported EPS of $0.21 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.19 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0.5%.For the current fiscal year, LeMaitre Vascular is expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share on $111.06 million in revenues. This represents a 13.95% change in EPS on a 10.1% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.12 per share on $122.35 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 14.96% and 10.17%, respectively.Valuation MetricsLeMaitre Vascular may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for LMAT? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.LeMaitre Vascular has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 41X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 36.4X versus its peer group's average of 19.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.73. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.LeMaitre Vascular, Inc. Price and Consensus  LeMaitre Vascular, Inc. Price and Consensus | LeMaitre Vascular, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, LeMaitre Vascular currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if LeMaitre Vascular fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though LMAT shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does LeMaitre Vascular Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of LeMaitre Vascular have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), ICU Medical (ICUI  -  Free Report), and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for LeMaitre Vascular. Still, the fundamentals for LMAT are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.

200,SYK,"PerkinElmer, Inc.’s (PKI  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, expected to release on Apr 30 after market close, are likely to show steady growth in the core Diagnostics business. While this might prove to be a major driver, declining revenues in all other segments might mar overall results.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company reported adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Meanwhile, revenues were approximately $641.6 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617 million. Revenues also surpassed the year-ago quarter’s $567 million.Notably, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.9%. The same for revenues is pinned at $615.86 million, indicating 19.8% growth.PerkinElmer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.6% for the trailing four quarters.PerkinElmer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  PerkinElmer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | PerkinElmer, Inc. QuoteLet’s dig deeper.Diagnostics Revenues in FocusDiagnostic revenues accounted for 30.1% of total revenues in the last quarter. Revenues in the segment rose to $193.4 million, up 23.3% from $193.4 million a year ago. This also reflects an improvement of 6% organically. The segment has been fortifying the company’s market position in terms of exclusiveness of services in the respective markets.For the Diagnostics market, the company offers products that are used to detect genetic disorders. PerkinElmer also provides digital x-ray flat panel detectors and infectious disease testing solutions in its Diagnostics portfolio. The first-quarter results are likely to indicate strong growth in the Diagnostic revenues.In the last-reported quarter, operating profit margin for the segment, as a percentage of revenues, was 30.8%, up 20 basis points (bps) year over year.It is also encouraging to note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Diagnostics segment is at $235 million, up 21.5% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayEUROIMMUN Buyout: A PositiveThe divestment of medical imaging business and the acquisition of EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics AG have been major drivers for the segment. PerkinElmer announced the completion of the EUROIMMUN buyout for approximately $1.3 billion in cash in December 2017. EUROIMMUN is an autoimmune testing company and an emerging player in the infectious disease and allergy testing space.Per management, the EUROIMMUN buyout has expanded PerkinElmer’s capabilities and helped it gain considerable traction. It has led to an increase in Diagnostics employees by more than 3000, strengthening the company’s R&D platform. The company is optimistic about increasing its R&D spending by 30% in 2018 from 2017 which is likely to account for 8.7% of product revenues.In the fourth quarter, EUROIMMUN contributed revenues of approximately $360 million, representing growth of 13-15%. It is also likely to add 100 bps to PerkinElmer’s organic growth.Discovery & Analytical Solutions (DAS)Revenues from DAS totaled $448.2 million in the fourth quarter, up 9.3% from $409.9 million in the year-ago quarter. PerkinElmer has been focusing on finalizing the organizational changes associated with the life sciences business under DAS.Lately, the company has collaborated with Helix to develop and commercialize exome sequencing-based tests that will help consumers take proactive health management decisions.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is at $381 million, down 15% sequentially.Guidance SolidThe company issued adjusted earnings guidance for 2018. Adjusted earnings are expected at $3.50 a share. Further, it expects reported revenues in the range of $2.72-$2.74 billion, which includes approximately $25 million in foreign exchange tailwinds and around $360 million from EUROIMMUN. PerkinElmer projects 5-6% organic revenue growth for 2018.Thus, PerkinElmer is confident about improving growth trajectory in the first quarter.Our quantitative model shows an earnings beat for PerkinElmer this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for PerkinElmer is +0.52%.

201,SYK,"Only a handful of S&P 500 players have released their numbers so far this earnings season. We expect the first quarter to see strong revenues as reflected by the solid upward trend in estimate revisions.Meanwhile, three back-to-back events in the quarter have rattled the global economy. The first was the U.S.-China trade war chaos, then came the tech backlash stemming from Facebook’s (FB) data fiasco, and finally, the chemical attack in Syria paving ways for fresh troubles between America and Russia.Furthermore, apprehensions related to further rate hikes by the Fed continue to do the rounds.Is Medical Device a Safe Haven?It is said that the stock market runs on sentiments and any unforeseen event in a particular sector has a ripple effect on others. Going against this notion, the Medical-Device sector within the broader Medical universe has proven to be a refuge for investors. Shrugging off the ongoing tensions, the sector has returned 2% year to date, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s return of 1.1%.This is because, Medical-Device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, focus on emerging market and tax abolition.In fact, our latest Earnings Preview gives an encouraging picture with the broader Medical space expected to register year-over-year earnings growth of 7.8% on revenue growth of 6.3%.So, it would rather be interesting to see how the Medical-Device companies are placed ahead of the reporting cycle and what are the major factors shaping up the releases.Growth DriversGoing by a CISION report, the United States is the largest Medical-Device market in the world, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. It has been a very profitable investment space of late.Considering the ageing population, changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) & big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, the Medical-Device sector appears to be in pink of health. Here are the latest headlines from the space:Taxes Abolished!A bipartisan two-year suspension of a ‘Medical Device’ tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, has been a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect on Jan 1, 2020.The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based Medical-Device manufacturers, instilling investor optimism in them.The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.Digital Revolution Takes MedTech by StormThe latest trend of robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space have been gaining prominence.Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Evidently, companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits of Medical-Device companies of late.Buyout RushLately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key Medical-Device players have expanded customer base, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. This has also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts (ESRX) by Cigna, which follows just three months of drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp’s (CVS) announcement of plans to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna, is important. Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX) takeover of C. R. Bard is also worth a mention.Zacks Methodology to the RescueGiven the existence of a number of players in the Medical-Device industry, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings banking on the above factors might quite an intimidating task.Our proprietary Zacks methodology, however, makes it fairly simple for you.One can narrow down choices by focusing specifically on the ‘medical instruments’ and ‘medical product’ stocks (specialized chunks under the Medical-Device subcategory), that sport the desirable combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Going by this criterion, we hereby present four stocks that are poised to beat estimates this quarter.Our PicksEdwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Irvine, CA, Edwards Lifesciences deals in products and technologies aimed at treating advanced cardiovascular diseases, especially structural heart disease in critically ill patients.The company’s strong pipeline of products and solid performance delivered in the TAVR market bolster our confidence in the stock. Although Edwards Lifesciences’ higher operating expenses might have made investors apprehensive, it is a respite as the funds were used for adopting advanced initiatives to drive overall sales.Edwards Lifesciences will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, after the market closes.We believe the company is set to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.36%.Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Bedford, MA, Hologic develops, manufactures, and supplies diagnostics, medical imaging systems and surgical products which cater to the healthcare needs of women. The company is focused on mammography systems for breast examination and osteoporosis assessment.The company will release results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on May 2, after the market closes.  Hologic’s Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.94% raise possibilities of a beat this quarter.Meanwhile, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Kalamazoo, MI, Stryker is one of the world’s largest Medical-Device companies operating in the orthopedic market.Mako is Stryker’s robotic-arm Assisted surgery platform which provides a predictable surgical experience when performing joint replacement surgery.Recently, Stryker launched the robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty application for use with the Mako System. Notably, this is the first and only robotic technology which can be used for total knee, hip and partial knee replacement procedures. Notably, Mako Total Knee utilizes both Stryker’s robotic platform and Triathlon Total Knee System, guided through CT-based 3D modeling of bone anatomy. The system also allows for intra-operative planning and assists in bone resectioning procedures.Stryker will report first quarter of 2018 results on Apr 26, after market close.  We believe Stryker is poised to trump the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it has the encouraging combination of a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.16%.Teleflex Incorporated (TFX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Wayne, PA, Teleflex develops, manufactures, and supplies single-use medical devices for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications worldwide.The company’s strong focus on High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy (HFNCT) is likely to lend it a competitive edge in the niche space.Solid growth in the preloaded anti-microbial and anti-thrombogenic VPS PICCs platform is likely to strengthen the vascular platform. In the surgical segment, new products like EFx and Ae05 fortify the company’s foothold. Finally, the company’s flagship LMA unique product strengthens its Anasthesia product line.The company is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3.We expect an earnings beat for this stock which has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.71%.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

202,SYK,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision-making. It provides an insight into product demand and pricing power. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can easily understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is important to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and disappointing financial performance. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but can’t rev up enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is essential to support the bottom line.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are seven of the 23 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Lincolnshire, IL, Zebra Technologies Corporation (ZBRA  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures and sells a range of automatic identification and data capture products.

204,SYK,"Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results are scheduled for release on Apr 26, after market close. The company’s acquisition-driven strategy is expected to boost growth by expanding existing product offerings in all business segments.We expect the company to witness steady growth in Orthopaedic Implant sales — one of the major revenue components. While this is projected to drive first-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments, especially MedSurg, will help the company generate impressive results.Notably, last quarter, Stryker posted earnings of $1.96 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.20 billion, reflecting a rise of 8.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.60, indicating an increase of 8.1% year over year.Let’s delve into other factors which are likely to impact Skryker’s first-quarter 2018 results.Orthopaedic Implant in Focus – Mako RobotsOrthopaedic Implant contributed 62.5% of net revenues in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orthopaedic Implant stands at $1.21 billion, reflecting a rise of 6.3% year over year.Recently, Stryker introduced the robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty application for use with its Mako System. Notably, this is the first and only robotic technology which can be used for total knee, hip and partial knee replacement procedures.Notably, Mako Total Knee utilizes Stryker’s robotic platform and its Triathlon Total Knee System, guided through CT-based 3D modeling of bone anatomy. Per Stryker, the system enables intra-operative planning and assists in bone resectioning procedures.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Mako Total Knee platform drove Stryker’s earnings. Mako robot installations totaled 35 globally, with 27 in the United States. Additionally, the company had its first robot sale in Japan, where the approval for Mako is expected by the end of 2018.The company exited 2017 with 372 Mako robots installed in the United States.Stryker Corporation Price and Consensus  Stryker Corporation Price and Consensus | Stryker Corporation QuoteOther Factors at PlayMedSurg Unit to Drive GrowthMedSurg Equipment products include surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.In the last quarter, management announced MedSurg as a high-growth segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MedSurg-Endoscopy revenues surged 12.6% year over year to $420 million.Acquisition-Driven StrategyStryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to drive growth. Recently, Stryker acquired Entellus Medical, Inc. in an all cash transaction for $24 per share or an equity value of approximately $662 million. This will enable physicians to conveniently perform a broad range of ENT procedures.Of late, Stryker acquired VEXIM, which specializes in the development and sale of vertebral compression fracture solutions for €183 million. VEXIM's flagship product is the SpineJack system, a mechanical expandable VCF implant for fracture reduction and stabilization. VEXIM's portfolio is highly complementary to the interventional spine business of Stryker.Stryker's Instruments division includes an extensive and innovative portfolio for vertebral augmentation, vertebroplasty and radiofrequency ablation procedures along with a diagnostic tool and decompression treatment advances for contained disc herniations.Lower Demand for Healthcare ProductsStryker persistently faces challenges from lower demand for health care products. Additionally, the company’s spine business in the United States was plagued with supply issues in fourth-quarter 2017. In fact, Stryker expects to face these headwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.The company has been facing challenging economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Western Europe. Additionally, lower reimbursements for medical products and services may impose a downward pressure on the prices for the company’s products, longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies, which will ultimately impact the top line.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for Stryker this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

Per data from technavio, the global niche market is expected to witness a CAGR of around 4% by 2020.Wright Medical’s top-line growth will be supported by the series of new product launches, including internally developed products and those from acquisitions.

208,SYK,"The U.S. Medical Products industry has been seeing steady growth of late on an ever-increasing grey population, long life expectancy and increased demand for technologically-superior medical devices. The industry has also gained from the recent deferral of the 2.3% Medical Device tax.According to an article published in Xtalks, the Medical Device tax was responsible for a $34-million reduction in R&D spending along with a $188-million decline in overall sales.Thus, companies expect to ramp up R&D spending which will likely lend them a competitive edge over the long haul.Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) are two close contenders in the Medical Products space.Notably, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here, we make a detailed analysis of the companies’ fundamentals to determine which stock is currently better positioned.With a market cap of $39.54 billion, Baxter is a global medical technology company. Meanwhile, Michigan-based Stryker is one of the largest medical device companies operating in the global orthopedic market. The company has a market cap of $63.10 billion.Factors Driving the StocksStryker’s robotic-arm assisted Mako surgery platform has been consistently driving the top line. In the last reported quarter, the platform recorded 28 new robot installations, globally.Robust demand for Baxter’s CRRT, injectable pharmaceuticals, U.S. IV solutions and peritoneal dialysis therapies is a major positive.Price PerformanceBaxter's shares rallied 22.6% in a year's time, edging past Stryker's return of 22.2%. The Medical Products industry returned 10.3% in the same time frame.Estimate RevisionEarningsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Baxter’s current-year earnings per share is pegged at $2.89, up 16.5% year over year. The consensus mark for Stryker’s current-year earnings is pinned at $7.23, reflecting 11.4% improvement year over year.Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus | Baxter International Inc.

209,SYK,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 earnings performance before the opening bell on Jul 24.Last reported quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the metric outperformed the consensus mark in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.41%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn a positive note, Quest Diagnostics seems well-aligned with its growth agenda to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Per its new long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017), revenue increase for the period 2017-2020 is expected to be 3-5% with 1-2% growth projected from acquisitions. Earnings for the period are anticipated to rise faster than the top line in the mid-to-high single digit range.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteThe company estimates revenue growth for the period 2017-2020 at 3-5%.  Per the company, its increasing number of partnerships with other health care leaders and strategic acquisitions is creating promising opportunities for the top and bottom-line growth while improving the patient experience and reducing the overall cost of care.In first-quarter 2018, the company satisfied all five elements of the above-mentioned growth agenda and strongly expects to continue with the momentum going forward.Going by the first element of the growth strategy to inch up 1-2% through strategically accretive acquisitions, the company achieved this upside for the fifth consecutive year in 2017.In this regard, the recent buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service MedXM should fortify Quest Diagnostics’ mobile provider capabilities and population health management solutions for health plans. This transaction should further garner favorable results in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Accounting for the second element of the growth strategy — to expand relationships with hospital health systems — in April, Quest Diagnostics along with four other leading health care organizations, namely– Humana, MultiPlan and UnitedHealth Group’s Optum and UnitedHealthcare launched a pilot program applying blockchain technology to improve data quality and reduce administrative costs associated with changes to health care provider demographic data.In March, the company entered into a professional lab services agreement with an integrated healthcare delivery system in New England.Considering the third element of the company’s growth strategy that offers the broadest access to diagnostic innovation, key growth drivers in the second quarter were prescription drug monitoring, QuantiFERON and non-invasive prenatal screening. We are also optimistic about the company’s successful execution of its strategy to build an esoteric testing business as well as boost profitability.About the fourth element of the growth strategy, which is to act as the provider of choice for consumers, the company’s relationship with Walmart has already started to add value with higher patient traffic and this positivity is expected to soon find reflections in its second-quarter earnings performance. The Walmart locations are helping Quest Diagnostics expand into different markets and the company expects to open many more locations throughout the ongoing year.The fifth element of Quest Diagnostics’ growth strategy is to support population health within analytics and extended care services. According to the company, the inclusion of MedXM is allowing it to close gaps between patients and healthcare professionals.We expect these active growth drivers to replicate the company’s success story in its upcoming quarterly results. Also, the performance is likely to drive the same primary metrics like the preceding quarter.We strongly believe all these recent developments to have significantly contributed to the company’s top line in the second quarter.The company expects 2018 revenues in the range of $7.7-$7.77 billion (annualized growth of 4-5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $7.68 billion, slightly below the company’s projected band. Excluding the impact of special items, amortization expense and ETB (excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation), adjusted EPS for the full year is projected to be $6.50-$6.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.61 falls within this guided range.On the flip side, after a persistently dull phasefor several quarters in the company’s revenue per requisition performance, the last three quarters saw a slim rebound. However, it still remains to be seen if this upside is here to stay or not.The company’s two Professional Lab Services engagements — WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) — also carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.Further, we should take into consideration the unrelenting headwind of unit price, which was moderately down in less than 100 basis points. Excluding the effect of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), the company expects unit price headwinds in 2018 to remain below 100 basis points with PAMA adding an extra headwind of approximately 50 basis points to it. This should also get highlighted in the impending quarterly results.Overall, we believe that dearth of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives will continuously dent the company’s volumes (measured by the number of requisitions) till the economy recovers.What Our Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +1.33%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this to-be-reported quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.97% and a Zacks Rank of 1.

210,SYK,"Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT  -  Free Report) Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business has been recording operational sales growth in the last few quarters. We expect this strength to further get reflected in second-quarter 2018 results, scheduled for release on Jul 18.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q2 performance is likely to pan out.Key CatalystsThe EPD business majorly focuses on the emerging markets wherein key areas include India, Russia, China and numerous regions in Latin America as well as Brazil alongside other countries. Sales in the key emerging markets increased 6.8% organically, driven by double-digit growth in India, China and Brazil in the last reported quarter.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuotePer the company, key emerging markets represent the most attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbott's branded generics product portfolio. Management believes that these markets will continue to offer immense opportunities with favorable demographics.  Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $903 million for EPD revenues from the key emerging markets indicates a 13.1% rise from the year-ago quarter’s tally.Favorable currency translation also left a positive impact of 3.1% on EPD revenues in the first quarter of 2018. Moreover, it is encouraging to note that management expects foreign exchange to continue acting as a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter.However, management seems concerned about the decelerating revenue growth rate of EPD in Russia due to a temporary disruption in distribution channel dynamics based on certain distributors’ consolidations. Per the company, this should continue through the second quarter too.Also, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports, has raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move might affect their sales performance in China in the near term.Overall, we are upbeat about management’s anticipation of double-digit organic growth in EPD sales during the second quarter. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPD revenues of $1.15 billion shows a 12.9% increase from the prior-year period.In EPD, Abbott’s consistent focus on enhancing local capabilities and expanding product portfolio within core therapeutic areas is aimed at specifically addressing local market needs. These efforts from the company also continue to consolidate its leadership position in the EPD markets. Abbott’s sale of developed market businesses along with acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia has contributed to its EPD business.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here are a few medical stocks worth considering from the same space as these comprise the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:ResMed Inc.

Last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%. Moreover, Abbott delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 1.99%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayOver the past few quarters, Abbott has been riding high on a healthy growth within its Diabetes Care business.

215,SYK,"“At some point in every person's life, you will need an assisted medical device … as you age and you have a hip replacement or a knee replacement or a pacemaker.”In the current context, nothing appears to be more apt than this remark made by Aimee Mullins (an American athlete). Considering the growing prominence of the orthopedics industry, it seems that the ''prosthetic generation is indeed all around us!''Per a new market intelligence report by BIS Research published by CISION, the global orthopedics devices market was worth $40.20 billion in 2016. It is estimated to be worth $61.02 billion by the end of 2023, at a CAGR of 6.1% with joint reconstruction and replacement devices segment being the highest revenue generator.In 2015, North America (51.4%) had the highest share in the orthopedics devices market and is expected to lead the same through 2024. Encouragingly, Asia Pacific is also estimated to catch up with a CAGR of 8.6% through 2024 in the niche space (per a Grand View Research report published by Becker's Healthcare).Thus, for investors who are keen on placing a bet on the healthcare space for long-term gains, the orthopedics market undoubtedly holds immense potential.Here, we take a look at five major factors that have been driving  the global orthopedic industry in the last couple of years.Major Market MoversAgeing PopulaceOne of the major factors driving the orthopedic market is aging population. Per a WHO report published by Global Market Insights, the population above 60 is expected to be 2 billion globally by 2050.Poor Life StylePoor eating habits, smoking, drinking and lack of physical activity will also drive demand for orthopedics market. Rising healthcare expenditures, unhealthy lifestyle practices along with expanded treatment options have been driving demand. Per a report by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published by Advisory Board, U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP (based on the assumption that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).Rising Incidence of DiabetesDiabetes and obesity will also fuel growth of this market. Globally, the diabetes market is expected to touch $66,053.1 million, at a CAGR of 6.7% between 2016 and 2025 (per a Transparency Market Research report).Positive Tidings on the Regulatory FrontThe orthopedic market is riding high on recent FDA nods and product launches. Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report)  reached a new milestone in the field of total shoulder arthroplasty with the recent FDA approval for its SidusStem-Free Shoulder system. Furthermore, the company launched the Vitality+ and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States, along with the global launch of Persona Partial Knee System.NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) announced the receipt of FDA clearance for the company's PRECICE system from NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics (NSO). Further, Smith & Nephew (SNN  -  Free Report) announced the full commercial release of bi-cruciate retaining JOURNEY II XR total knee arthroplasty (“TKA”) in the United States and Japan recently.Robotic Surgery Boosting OrthopedicsMedical technology companies are trying to expand through robots rather than complex surgeries. Per a report by Technavio, the global orthopedic surgical robots market is estimated to witness CAGR of around 47% by 2021. In view of the abovementioned factor, a number of bigwigs are spending a lump sum on R&D to continuously innovate and develop devices with improved efficacy and no side effects.In this regard, one of the most noteworthy is Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). Mako is Stryker’s robotic-arm assisted surgery platform. Recently, Stryker launched the robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty application for use with its Mako System.Medical device major Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Orthotaxy. This is a privately-held developer of software-enabled surgery technologies, including a differentiated robotic-assisted surgery solution.3D Printing in ActionAnother technology which orthopedic device companies are trying to leverage is 3D printing. Per a report by Future Market Insights published by CISION, orthopedic implants in the application category of the global 3D printed medical devices market are expected to be worth $970 million in the 2017-2027 time frame at a CAGR of 19.2%. In this regard, Stryker’s Tritanium TL Curved Posterior Lumbar Cage is a 3D-printed interbody fusion cage intended for use as an aid in lumbar fixation. This device recently won FDA nod.3 Stocks in FocusWe have selected three companies, which we believe are well poised given the encouraging prospects of the orthopedics market.Stryker Corporation: This company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.8%.  The current-quarter estimate revision trend for the stock has been encouraging with five estimates moving upward, compared to two downward movements in the past two months.

216,SYK,"The medical device tax suspension up to Jan 1, 2020, is one of the very few amendments that have garnered the maximum number of bipartisan votes in the House.Since its enactment in 2013, the 2.3% tax has been quite a menace for the medical device industry. Per a statement by the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, the tax had a significant negative impact on medical innovation and employment. Considering this, the House placed a suspension on the tax from January 2016 to December 2017 only to bring it back on Jan 1, 2018.But recently, the House came up with a $31-billion bill on tax cuts, which included the abatement of the infamous medical device tax.While the MedTech fraternity has been cheering the latest repeal, the share price and net margin performance of the medical device manufacturers is showing a different story. Let’s delve deeper.How Glitzy is the Repeal for MedTech?Innumerable reports claim that the repeal will ramp up domestic production, increase hiring of skilled professionals and lower the nation’s overdependence on offshore production.Further, MedTech bigwigs are expected to enhance the R&D, improve margins, launch products, reduce capital depreciation, invest in early-stage MedTech companies, execute clinical trials and in turn fuel the next generation of U.S. Medical-Device industry by reinvesting profits (tax savings).Notably, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) shelled out a lump sum $180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014. Meanwhile, medical device giant Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) reported net earnings of $1.14 billion and paid approximately $229 million as medical device excise tax in 2015 — nearly 16% of earnings (data from a Med Device Online report). If the tax didn’t exist, analysts believe the companies could have used the cash to expand and improve their pipelines.This drew heavy criticism, compelling the Democrats and the Republicans to lift the tax.History Says a Different StorySince the tax was abolished in 2015-end, the companies were expected to rake in profits and also put up an impressive show on the bourses starting 2016. However, the price performance and margin trend contradicted expectations.In fact, the tax repeal news created quite a stir amongst analysts back in 2016, dealing a blow to shares of medical device manufacturers. Our data shows that the broader Medical-Products industry has underperformed the S&P 500 market in the last two years. The industry’s 31.3% cuts a sorry figure in comparison to the S&P 500’s 34.5%. Here we take a sneak peek at the net margin trend of companies since the last tax repeal. Although no single metric can determine the profitability of a business accurately, investors can count on net margin to get a fair idea of the amount of profit a company is making. A declining net margin post the tax repeal amendment throws light on the enormous risks and costs associated with the R&D and compliance requirements of MedTech manufacturers. This also raises a question on how will the tax repeal provide an impetus to the MedTech space, if it could do nothing significant two years back.5 Stocks Grappling With Declining Prices & Net MarginHere we have five MedTech stocks that have witnessed significant margin contraction despite the tax repeal in 2015.We would like to draw your attention to the share price and net margin performance of companies following the tax’s abolition in 2015.Over the past two years, Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has been observed to underperform the broader markets. As per the latest share price movement, the stock lost 7%, comparing unfavorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 35.4%.The company has been facing escalating costs and expenses that are weighing on its margins. Also, the company’s reiteration of 2018 guidance despite the projection of favorable foreign currency translation fails to lift investors’ spirits. Over the past two years, Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has underperformed the S&P 500 index. The stock has lost 18.8%. We are disappointed with the continued deterioration in the company gross, operating and net margins, thanks to higher cost of sales and expenses. Also, a tough competitive landscape and pricing pressure weigh on the stock.The U.S. healthcare products and service distribution industry is highly competitive and consist principally of national, regional and local distributors. In the North American dental products market, the company faces stiff competition from Patterson Dental business of Patterson Companies Inc. and Benco Dental Supply.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.’s (XRAY  -  Free Report) share price movement has been disheartening over the past two years. The company has lost 7.1% in the period. A lackluster margin trend over the same time frame indicates the company’s failure to garner profits post the tax repeal.For the days to comeDENTSPLY expects gross and operating margins to remain flat to decline slightly from 2017 levels as underlying margin rate improvement is expected to be offset by adverse foreign exchange and target inventory equipment reduction.Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. (MDRX  -  Free Report) has underperformed the broader market in terms of price in the past two months. Notably, the stock has returned 5.2%, compared with the S&P 500’s rally of 35.4%. Further, the company’s margins have contracted significantly in the past two years.Allscripts also expects a modest increase in operating expenses. The company faces sluggishness in the international market and competition from larger players.Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report) has underperformed the broader market in terms of price in the past two years. The stock has returned just 10.3%, much lower than the S&P 500 market. Further, the company’s margins have declined steeply in the past two years.Bruker conducts 80% of its business in international markets. As a result, currency fluctuations continue to result in foreign currency transaction losses.Will the latest MedTech tax overhaul paint a different picture for these stocks?Will History Repeat Itself?Our analysis clearly shows that the broader industry hasn’t reacted positively to the tax repeal amendment that was legislated in 2015. If we consider the repeal’s effect on the MedTech space, the trend is expected to continue this time around as well!However, the MedTech industry has been favored by a massive change in consumer behavior lately. This coupled with changing market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation of the U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Further, the strategic application of Artificial Intelligence in every sphere of healthcare can provide boost productivity in the MedTech space. Companies that have adopted AI technologies witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and are expected to record strong margin expansion as well.You never know, the current favorable trend might turn the tables for the MedTech industry!More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

219,SYK,"With a market capitalization of approximately $10.61 billion, Varian Medical Systems Inc (VAR  -  Free Report) has been riding high on revenue opportunity from the growing adoption of Proton Therapy and strong overseas presence in emerging countries.However, cutthroat competition in the niche spaceis a major headwind.For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $2.85 million, reflecting an increase of 0.9% year over year. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $4.48 per share, showing an increase of 24.4% year over year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a quick look at the major factors that have been plaguing Varian Medicaland discuss the prospects that ensure near-term recovery.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteFactors Plaguing Varian MedicalIntensifying competition is expected to increase R&D expenditures in the growing proton therapy market, which will keep margins under pressure.Further, Varian Medical competes with large electronic companies along withsmaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers.Thus, cutthroat competition in the niche space is likely to raise the company’s expenditure in the near term. The oncology business in North America is witnessing a drop in capital expenditure on account of uncertainty emanating from health care reform and anticipated changes in reimbursement.Although international sales, as percentage of revenues,areincreasing, higher demand for lower-margin products from China, India and Brazil is expected to keep margins under pressure over the next several quarters.Why Should You Hold The Stock?Apart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe proton therapy also holds significant promise for Varian Medical. Proton therapy falls under the Particle Therapy business.Recently, the company announced the installation of a Varian Medical ProBeam cyclotron at the proton beam therapy center at University College Hospitals London NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) in London, England. The cyclotron is a core piece of equipment of the ProBeam proton therapy system. Its installation is a key milestone for every new proton therapy center.Varian Medical’s ProBeam Compact proton therapy system is superior to other external beam radiotherapies in precisely locating cancerous tumors, thereby causing lesser side-effects to surrounding tissues. Proton therapy system hasthe same interface used in theTrueBeam platform.Recently, Varian Medical has upgraded its ProBeam system software to ProBeam version 2.5 to enhance workflow at the site and provide better images generated by the system's integrated imager. The upgraded product will drive the company’s market share going forward.In Mar 2018, Varian Medical announced the first patient treatment at the St. Petersburg Proton Therapy Center in Russia, an important step in expanding access to proton therapy around the world.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has an expected earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the current quarter.

McKesson expects adjusted earnings per share of $13.00-$13.80. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $13.33, which is within the guidance. Per management, the fiscal 2019 outlook represents mid- to high-single digit percentage growth year over year, indicating stable market conditions.Free cash flow is expected at around $3.0 billion. The guidance projects full-year adjusted tax rate in the range of 21-23%, which may vary from quarter to quarter.McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus  McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus | McKesson Corporation QuoteHowever, following the announcement, the company’s shares inched down1.8% in the last trading session and closed at $135.80. Not to forget, during fourth-quarter earnings call, management announced that the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions is expected to deliver low- to mid-single digit revenue growth. Per management, European Pharmaceutical Solutions is likely to deliver flat to mid-single digit revenue growth in fiscal 2019. Additionally, Medical-Surgical Solutions is expected to deliver low-double digit revenue growth.In the past year, shares of McKesson have declined 17.4% against the industry’s rise of 5.6%. The current level is also lower than S&P 500 index’s gain of 12%.Major Factors to Drive ResultsMcKesson has been actively pursuing deals, divestitures and acquisitions to drive growth. Recently, the company has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Medical Specialities Distributors for $800 million. The deal is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2019. Management expects the deal to expand the company’s manufacturer value proposition in specialty capabilities.However, the company distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price fluctuations. The Distribution Solutions segment had experienced weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends, which continue to persist. Continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs, significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches can have a material adverse impact on McKesson’s prospects.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMcKesson has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has an expected earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the current quarter.

221,SYK,"With a market capitalization of approximately $56.58 billion, Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report) continues to benefit from growing adoption of the company’s da Vinci system, increasing procedure volumes, consistent innovation and solid recurring revenue base.However, unfavorable foreign exchange, procedure adoption risk, lower capital spending by hospitals and increasing regulatory headwinds are major concerns.For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $3.61 billion, reflecting an increase of 15.2%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings is pegged at $10.26, showing a rise of 14.1%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a quick look at the primary factors that have been plaguing Intuitive Surgical and discuss the prospects that ensure near-term recovery.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteCompetition Mar ProspectsIntuitive Surgical has been enjoying a monopoly in the market for robots used in abdominal surgery since the launch of its flagship device called da Vinci back in 2000.Post the regulatory approval of Transenterix's surgical robot for abdominal surgery in 2017, competition for Intuitive Surgical has intensified. Reports suggest that the news had a negative impact onthe company’s price movement, even though the device is not expected to compete directly with da Vinci.MedTech giant Medtronic is another major threat. Per sources,the company has been working on its surgical robot and plans to launch it in 2018.Why Should you Hold?The da Vinci surgical system enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that allows surgeon’s hand gestures to be translated into smaller, precise movements of tiny instruments inside the patient’s body. da Vinci has bolstered the company’s foothold in the  markets of Cardiac Surgery, Colorectal Surgery, General Surgery, Gynecologic Surgery, Head & Neck Surgery, Thoracic Surgery and Urologic Surgery. The system has facilitatedminimally invasive surgery to more than 3 million patients worldwide.Recently, the da Vinci Surgical System has been observed to cure patients diagnosed with inguinal hernia.The company launched an upgrade to its flagship Vinci Xi technology — da Vinci X — recently. Notably, the Xi suite is designed to seamlessly integrate future innovations, such as advanced instrumentation, surgical skills simulation, software upgrades and other advancements into one dynamic platform. The company can now ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler and Firefly to several countries.Minimally invasive surgery is becoming increasingly popular as it helps patients recover faster and reduces hospital costs. Notably, the minimally invasive surgical instruments market is projected to reach a worth of $18.14 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 10.2% (Markets & Markets). Although high price of the system may hinder widespread adoption, we believe that the benefits of minimally invasive surgery will propelsurgeons and patients to use the system. This will drive the company’s system sales and improve top-line growth in the long run.Favorable Share Price MovementIntuitive Surgical has outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The company’s shares have surged almost 50.8%, against the industry’s decline of 2.4%.

225,SYK,"The year 2018 may bring ample reasons for Americans to cheer from the standpoint of the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was finally signed by the President on Dec 22. Effective Jan 1, there are seven income tax brackets with five offering reduced tax rates. Corporate tax rates too have been slashed to 21% from 35% earlier. This apart, the new legislation has almost doubled the standard deduction.While the nation is delighted with these huge tax slashes, economists are quite apprehensive that its damage to the healthcare community will be realized before long. Going by a Vox article, “The bill also includes tax cuts so large that they would trigger across-the-board spending cuts — including billions for Medicare. The last time Medicare was a hit with cuts like this, patients lost access to critical services like chemotherapy treatment.”The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) apprehends that if it doesn’t find any alternative to meet the fiscal deficit from the huge tax cut, automatic cuts worth $136 billion from mandatory spending in 2018, including $25 billion in Medicare cuts, may be triggered.Not only that, the latest law also repeals the individual mandate, which is an essential part of Obamacare proving health coverage to majority of Americans. CBO expects 13 million people to drop their plans with this repeal. As per the Vox article, care for the elderly will be disrupted, bringing about erratic changes in the health care system.Device Tax Back in 2018 -- Serious Threat to MedTechWithin the MedTech space, the situation is all the more grave. The medical device community was earlier extremely hopeful about Trump’s regulatory agenda as it had promised the complete abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device tax that was first included in the 2010 health care reform law.The dreaded tax, imposed on the selling price instead of net profit and amounting to a stupendous sum, wiped out almost a quarter of the profits for medical technology companies.As per an article published on LA Times, “In Congress, it [Device Tax] was unpopular not only with Republicans, but with many Democrats from states such as Massachusetts and Minnesota, which have large numbers of medical device companies.” Realizing this, the U.S. House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015.Going by the available data, it is quite evident that this partial two-year repeal of the medical device tax has benefited the sector’s overall development. Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), within this period, there was a roughly 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players.The temporary suspension however had taken into account the expectation that the government will permanently put an end to this tax before 2018. Obviously, this is not going to happen.Undoubtedly, its comeback will be an additional burden on the MedTech fraternity, largely discouraging R&D activities. Per the LA Times article, AdvaMed and the Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance warn that the tax will take a $20-billion bite out of the medical device industry over the next decade.3 Medtech Stocks to be Affected Most by Tax BackPer an article by Matt Murphy in wbur, sectors that are likely to be hampered the most by the re-imposition of this levy are X-ray and MRI machines, surgical instruments and pacemakers. In such a tumultuous scenario, we have handpicked three MedTech bigwigs that are playing majorly in these controversial sectors with hefty investments each year, and are hence over-exposed to a significant level of risk associated with the tax reinstatement.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report)Medical device mammoth and a leading player in the field of heart stent, Boston Scientific’s unimpressive pacemaker performance within the core CRM has been a drag in the recent past.

The company’s solid international foothold is expected to boost growth by expanding existing product offerings in all business segments. However, the company announced the voluntary product recall of the Oral Care line-up in 2017.Stryker is focusing on international growth. A significant turnaround in the company’s European business backed by effective restructuring measures indicates a potential upside. In particular, the company’s Medsurg product line has witnessed strong demand in the European and Australian markets. Further, favorable response for the Medsurg product line in China has enhanced the company’s international prospects.Stryker’s international organic sales growth in the third quarter of 2017 was 5.2% on a year-over-year basis.

In the quarter, internationally, MedSurg delivered organic sales growth of 7.1%, which indicates strong growth in Medical businesses, primarily in Europe.Neurotechnology and Spine also witnessed robust organic growth. The performance was bolstered by high demand for Neurotech products in Europe and Asia. Countries like UK, Germany, Italy have been witnessing solid performances from Stryker since long.

235,SYK,"On Jun 25, 2018, we have initiated our coverage on PRA Health Sciences, Inc. (PRAH  -  Free Report). Notably, PRA Health's organic growth remains strong. Also, the company’s international business is capitalizing on great prospects. However, escalating direct cost remains a concern for PRA Health. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, shares of this renowned global Contract Research Organization (CRO) have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has rallied 28.1% compared with the broader industry 11.7% rise.The company continues to demonstrate solid organic revenue growth. In the first quarter of 2018, organic revenue growth was 15% at constant exchange rate or CER. Symphony integration process is also progressing well with PRA Health expecting to complete the procedure by 2018 end.PRA Health Sciences, Inc. Price PRA Health Sciences, Inc. Price | PRA Health Sciences, Inc. Quote PRA Health is highly optimistic about this $530-million acquisition, expected to enhance its ability to serve customers throughout the clinical research and commercial development process with technologies providing data and analytics.We are also encouraged by the company’s diversified client base with top five customers representing approximately 40% of revenues for the last-reported quarter.The company has been strategically expanding its Asia Pacific operations since 2000 and has supported 345 clinical trials in the region at 4300 plus sites across Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. In March 2018, the company was honoured with the best CRO label in Asia. PRA Health’s focus on the emerging markets looks extremely significant since a point of saturation and growth instability continue to grip the developed markets.On the flip side, the company persistently incurs direct costs, primarily on increased labor-related costs in its Clinical Research segment as it continues to hire billable staff for growth support. The increase in direct costs also included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $14 million as compared to the year-ago period tally. Within Data Solutions segment, direct cost shot up mainly due to raised salary and benefit. Moreover, the company  remains pressed underthe tough capital spending environment.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corp.

The company's strong organic growth across specialty services, life sciences and applied sterilization segments also buoys optimism.Synergy Health Consolidation on TrackSTERIS’ acquisition of U.K.-based outsourced sterilization services provider, Synergy Health plc, has continued to remain a significant move by the company as it combines STERIS' Infection Prevention and Services businesses with Synergy Health's Hospital Sterilization Services.

237,SYK,"The U.S. Medical Device industry trend in 2018 is reflective of extensive discovery and innovation in the life sciences industry over the past few years.Per a study published by CNBC, medical device companies have gained importance in the healthcare world on improved research and development (R&D) of technology. Far-reaching innovation like gene therapy, newer drug combinations, patient monitoring with the help of big data this year will shape up the medical fraternity of the United States.Tax Suspension to Fuel R&DThe Medical Device market has further gained momentum owing to the recent two-year suspension of the controversial 2.3% Medical Device tax. The 2.3% excise tax was implemented in 2013 as part of Obamacare on MedTech manufacturers, significantly restricting R&D activities.According to an article published in Xtalks, the Medical Device tax was responsible for a $34-million reduction in R&D spending along with a $188-million decline in overall sales.However, it is to be seen whether the tax will be fully eliminated or resumed after the two-year period. For now, the deferral will encourage R&D activity in this space, which bodes well for MedTech companies.Notably, in the past month, the medical instruments industry has rallied 3.8% against the S&P 500 index’s return of 1.5%.R&D Leads to Revolution in MedTechThe MedTech space currently offers unprecedented opportunities for growth and market share expansion. Solid investment in R&D has helped manufacturers use the benefits from big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and medical mechatronics.The industry is also catching up with the digital-data age. Enormous size of data can be captured through technology for arriving at business insights. This helps the healthcare sector provide better care and reduce wastage. The latest trend of adopting electronic health record (EHR) services in the U.S. MedTech space has also been gaining popularity.Some of the major HCIT (Healthcare I.T.) bigwigs, which have carved out a niche in the big-data domain, are Cerner Corporation and athenahealth, Inc. These companies are making significant investments in R&D to boost up their EHR platforms.Meanwhile, medical Mechatronics is a much-awaited digital evolution in the global healthcare industry, providing innovation to the healthcare industry through reduction in the size of the age-old medical devices and development of low-cost disposable devices.Engineering concern eInfochips believes that mechatronics is the future of medical devices. The benefits of Mechatronics have been seen in the form of 3D printing, cancer study and development of better medication for deadly diseases.Notably, Intuitive Surgical’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) minimally-invasive da Vinci surgical system and Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) robotic-arm assisted surgery platform, Mako, deserve a mention here.Choosing the Winning StocksGiven the favorable scenario, investment in Medical Device stocks with strong potential seems to be a wise choice.

238,SYK,"Shares of Opko Health, Inc. (OPK  -  Free Report) have gained 41.9% since the release of first-quarter 2018 results on May 8. The rally was backed by a narrower-than-expected loss per share and solid pharmaceutical business. In the past three months, the stock has rallied 37.6% against the industry’s decline of 12.4%.   In the quarter under review, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company incurred adjusted loss of 8 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. However, the loss widened 33.3% from the prior-year quarter tally. Quarter Highlights Revenues in the first quarter grossed $254.9 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%. Nevertheless, the top line decreased from $266.4 million registered in the year-ago quarter. Segment Details Revenues from Services came in at $211.3 million, down 7.6% from the year-ago quarter. Per management, the downside can be attributed to volume decline of approximately 3% at the clinical lab. Pharmaceutical Products revenues totaled $27.9 million, up 25.7% year over year. Per management, the company generated $3.7 million of revenues from sales of RAYALDEE in the reported quarter. At Transfer of Intellectual Property, revenues raked in $15.7 million, up slightly from $15.6 million in the prior-year quarter.Opko Health, Inc. Price and Consensus Opko Health, Inc. Price and Consensus | Opko Health, Inc. QuoteMargins In the reported quarter, gross profit totaled $100.8 million, down 9.7% on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin was 39.5%, which contracted 240 basis points (bps). Operating expenses amounted to $124.4 million, down 8.9% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, Opko Health incurred an operating loss of $42.6 million, down from $45.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Guidance In the second quarter of 2018, Opko Health expects revenues from services between $205-$225 million. Product revenues are anticipated to be within $25-$30 million, including RAYALDEE revenues in the $4-$5 million band. Revenues from the transfer of intellectual property are projected between $15 million and $20 million. Operating expenses are expected to be in line with the first quarter of 2018 at $295-$310 million range. For 2018, effective tax rate is projected to be in single digits. Our Take Opko Health wrapped the first quarter of 2018 on a tepid note. The company’s loss was narrower than expected, while revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company rides on its pharmaceutical business, which registered a year-over-year increase in revenues. Also, a significant gain from RAYALDEE is noteworthy. Furthermore, Opko Health is optimistic about its 4Kscore utilization, which witnessed solid growth in the first quarter. A year-over-year surge in the company’s R&D expenditures reflects increased focus on innovation. However, declining margins is worrisome. Sales decline at the company’s core Service segment is an added concern. Key Picks A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corp.

239,SYK,"On Jun 22, we issued an updated research report on IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report). The company’s robust worldwide commercial capabilities and best-in-class products including the next-generation chemistry analyzer, Catalyst One, are key growth drivers over the near term. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the past three months, this leading molecular diagnostic company has outperformed its industry. The stock has increased 12.9% against the industry’s 12.4% decrease. Notably, IDEXX continues to demonstrate strong organic growth, driven by robust sales at the Companion Animal Group (CAG) business, fueled by a firm global Catalyst uptake.International revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were up 11% organically, driven by 13% organic gains in international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. This reflected continued consumable revenue gains, supported by Catalyst instrument base, increased average testing utilization and sturdy growth in European lab revenues.The companion animal market fundamentals remain safe and sound with tremendous global runway for growth. Additionally, we are upbeat about the company’s expanding premium instrument base in the United States as well as the international markets including growth in competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and a consistent customer retention.IDEXX’s innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth in the reported quarter. Moreover, the company’s healthy top-line growth was driven by considerable contributions from its rest of the business segments. A raised EPS guidance for 2018 was also encouraging.Additionally, the company boasts a strong cash balance, allowing it to carry out share repurchases.Meanwhile, a majority of IDEXX’s consolidated revenues is being derived from the sale of products in the international markets. Thus, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate, relative to other currencies, had a negative impact on revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. money as well as on profits drawn from products manufactured in the United States and sold internationally. For 2018, adverse currency translations affected adjusted earnings per share to the tune of 4 cents. Also, the company’s heavy dependence on third-party distributors is a drag.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space include Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corp.

240,SYK,"Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), a leading player in the medical technology space, is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the closing bell.In August, Stryker announced a voluntary recall of the Oral Care line-up, which was offered by the company’s Sage-Products unit. Added to the voluntary recall, the company had placed a temporary hold on certain cloth-based products. While this might mar third-quarter results, an expected improvement in revenues at the major revenue segments might help the company generate solid results this season.It is important to note that Stryker delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, the average being 1.3%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues stands at $2.97 billion, up 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $1.50 per share, up 8.1% year over year.Stryker Corporation Price and Consensus  Stryker Corporation Price and Consensus | Stryker Corporation Quote Factors at PlayGuidance Takes a Hit: The recent product recall is likely to impact the company’s sales and operating income. In fact for the third quarter, Stryker estimates adjusted net earnings per diluted share at the low end of its previously issued $1.50-$1.55 band. The recall decision followed complaints of minor irritation and allergic reactions from consumers. However, management expects to reinitiate full supply capacity by the end of the year.Neurotechnology & Spine Segment: Stryker has been grappling with supply issues in the spine unit of Neurotechnology and spine segment for long. Of the major factors hurting the segment, challenging global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates deserve a mention. Precisely, foreign exchange volatility will affect adjusted earnings per share by approximately 2 cents in the third quarter.Owing to softness in the spine unit, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Neurotechnology & Spine segment decreased 2.3% sequentially to $1.31 billion.Lower Demand for Health Care Products: Stryker has been facing challenging global economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Western Europe of late. The ongoing political conundrum pertaining to the repealing of Obamacare has given rise to uncertainties in the Medical Products space.Added to this, lower reimbursements for medical products and services have been imposing a downward pressure on prices of the company’s products. Furthermore, longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies might mar revenues in the third quarter.MedSurg Unit: Declining sales in the Medsurg Equipment segment is likely to impede revenue growth in the third quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at the segment stands at $1.31 billion, down 2.4% sequentially.However, solid prospects in Canada, Australia and China are likely to boost the company’s MedSurg Instrument unit. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment increased 1.8% sequentially and 5% on a year-over-year basis. It is important to note that, in the last reported quarter, MedSurg as a whole posted organic growth of 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Stryker this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Stryker is -0.58%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Stryker currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.INC Research Holdings, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.02% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Medpace Holdings Inc. (MEDP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.47% and a Zacks Rank #3.Henry Schein, Inc.

241,SYK,"NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) received an expanded 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its TLX interbody system. The TLX interbody system is inserted through a conventional transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) approach. TLX implants can be placed easily into the disc space due to their low profile, bulleted design. TLX is designed for a minimally-invasive spine surgery approach.TLX interbodies were available in 15 degree lordotic options and were only indicated for use with allograft before the receipt of the approval. According to the company, new clearance includes an expandable 20 degree interbody and broader indications for use, including use with allogeneic bone graft and in additional levels of the spine. The TLX system's size offers many options for varying patient size and anatomic considerations.The TLX interbody system, combined with the Integrated Global Alignment (iGA) suite of the company’s software, has the ability to improve overall TLIF procedures.Notably, NuVasive is currently leaving no stone unturned to cash in on the rapidly-evolving spine market. During the last reported second quarter of 2017, the company’s core U.S. spinal hardware business maintained the bullish trend with 3% growth. The upside was driven by strong adoption of ReLine posterior fixation system within the company’s iGA platform. The company also witnessed a steady uptake of its recently-launched expandable interbody cages and base TI interfixated within the ALIF procedure.Meanwhile, the company recently closed the acquisition of Vertera Spine, a start-up company in the spine space. NuVasive also announced the commercial launch of LessRay software technology system. It particularly works to help address overexposure to radiation in hospital operating rooms (O.R.), mostly in the case of minimally invasive spine surgery (MIS).According to a report by GlobalData, the global market for spinal fusion is expected to rise around $9 billion by 2023, at a CAGR of 3.4%.

242,SYK,"Mazor Robotics Ltd. (MZOR  -  Free Report) recently received CE Mark approval for its Mazor X Surgical Assurance platform. The approval will allow Mazor Robotics and its partner Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) to commercialize, co-promote and market the Mazor X platform, in countries that recognize CE Mark.Mazor Robotics and Medtronic had signed a deal to distribute Mazor X (Mazor's robotic spine surgery system) in May 2016. Medtronic has made $40 million in third tranche investments in Mazor Robotics recently.In this regard we note that, Mazor Robotics recently reported second-quarter 2017 revenues of approximately $15.5 million, compared with $8.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The revenue upside was driven by strong Mazor X system sales and increased procedure volumes. During the last reported second quarter, Mazor Robotics received purchase orders for 16 Mazor X systems in the United States. We expect the CE Mark to drive orders for the system.According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for Spinal Surgery Devices has been estimated to reach a worth of $16.6 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 5% during the 2016 to 2021 period. Considering the opportunities in this niche, we see the company’s latest development as a strategic one.However, the company is facing tough competition within this industry from well-established players likeStryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

243,SYK,"In a bid to expand its advanced materials science range, NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) recently announced the Vertera Spine buyout. However, the terms of the acquisition agreement have been kept under wraps.NuVasive, a pioneer in applying procedurally-integrated solutions for minimally disruptive spine surgeries, aims to market and distribute Vetera Spine’s FDA-approved COHERE Cervical and COALESCETM Lumbar Interbody fusion devices in the United States. This deal will also lend the company a three-dimensional porous interbody technology across both polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and titanium materials. Notably, the company has introduced a few new features in its Modulus XLIF built on a fully-porous titanium implant created in a three-dimensional manufacturing process and designed to match the porosity and stiffness of bone.We encouragingly note that the company’s U.S. Spinal Hardware business, comprising implants and fixation products, MAGEC-EOS spinal bracing and lengthening system and the PRECICE limb lengthening system, registered 3% growth in the last reported quarter. NuVasive is leaving no stone unturned to gain traction in the fast growing spine market. In this regard, the company has been steadily focusing on product development.  Moreover, the company claims to have an active corporate development pipeline that includes a number of strategic investments, acquisitions and partnership opportunities. Notably, during the first quarter of 2017, the company launched the first two interbody devices, MLX and TLX, used in lumbar fusion procedures.Per a report from BECKER’s SPINE REVIEW, the global minimally-invasive spine surgery market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.6% between 2017 and 2021. Also, per a report by Technavio, the global spinal implants market is expected to witness a CAGR of roughly 6% in the 2016-2020 period.Thus, given the current market potential, we believe that the company is on the right track to gain traction.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the minimally-invasive spine surgery market. However, this market is dominated by many well-established players like Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report). Notably, Stryker provides a range of products with ES2 Spinal systems, MANTIS implants, LITe Decompression tubes and many more under its minimally invasive spine surgical solutions portfolio. Moreover, Zimmer Biomet’s range of thoracolumbar products forms a comprehensive portfolio for minimally-invasive spine surgery.Over the past three months, NuVasive has underperformed the broader industry. In this period, the company has lost 24.1%, as compared to the 0.8% gain of the broader industry. We expect the company to make a comeback with the latest developments.Zacks Rank & Key PickNuVasive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

244,SYK,"On Aug 29, we issued an updated research report on Sunnyvale, CA–based Accuray Inc. (ARAY  -  Free Report), a leading developer and designer of radiosurgery and radiation therapy systems for the treatment of tumors. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Accuray has had an unimpressive run in the bourse of late. A glimpse at the recent price performance reveals that its shares declined 8.0% over the past month, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 1.3%. The company has a dismal track record characterized by consecutive earnings miss in all the trailing four quarters.Accuray witnessed low product margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (ending Jul 31), down 80 basis points (bps) in to 36.4%. In fact, dismal performance by the product segment caused an adjusted loss of 6 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of a penny.Additionally, unsatisfactory performance by the CyberKnife and the Tomotherapy systems in Japan and Asia Pacific was a headwind. Unfavorable product mix and more replacement sales to the CyberKnife’s existing customer base caused the drag. Moreover, one-time employee severance related expenses and other one-time part costs dented the service margin in recent times.Accuray’s top line is highly dependent on CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems sales. However, both systems require high capital expenditures which act as a deterrent for healthcare providers.On a positive note, we are particularly upbeat about the company’s extensive product portfolio, growing customer base (especially in EIMEA region) and international expansion initiatives that are poised to drive growth. Moreover, the receipt of 510(k) FDA approval for the Radixact Treatment delivery platform is likely to boost product revenues over the long haul.Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).

245,SYK,"The latest Earnings Preview depicts a bullish run in the ongoing reporting cycle. Till Oct 20, 87 S&P 500 members (24.7% of the total market cap) reported their numbers. Total earnings for these members have gone up 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues.However, investors are concerned about the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) that saw a lot of struggle during the first nine months of the year, thanks to the political change and the ongoing policy-restructuring related battle.The ensuing lack of visibility has roiled the favorable trend that this sector maintained in the trailing few quarters. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate stands at a mere 2.2% on a 4.8% revenue-growth projection. In comparison, the second-quarter earnings growth was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.What’s in Store for the Medical Product Space?While twists and turns continue to unfold at Capitol Hill, the scenario within the Medical - Products space, an important part of the medical device subcategory within the broader Medical sector, is getting gloomier. The latest executive order released by the Republicans points to a shrinking customer base, indicating a cut in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices. This may lead to major supply/demand disequilibrium within this space.However, major medical device players have been pinning hopes on the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though its elimination is far from reality.Considering these tax issues, investors interested in the Medical Product space eagerly await earnings reports of MedTech bigwigs throughout this week.

While the downbeat IC business tangled under product recall issue will possibly gain some boost from the company’s recent $435 million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, a full recovery may take time.

246,SYK,"Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), one of the largest medical device companies in the global orthopedic market, has successfully expanded its product portfolio over time that aids the company to cater to evolving demands of customers.Markedly, the company boasts a diverse portfolio that has been aiding top-line growth, reflected through projected revenue growth of 8.53%. We expect the momentum to continue, banking on the strength of its portfolio and acquisitions.In fact, the company’s product portfolio cushions it against any significant sales shortfall during economic downturns. The Kalamazoo, MI-based company's pipeline include products for Hip, Knee and Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgeries. MAKO results in the last quarter were solid, with almost 26 global robot installations, of which, 24 were in the United States.Furthermore, the platforms of bone cement, sports-medicine, bones substitute, soft tissue repair, trauma and extremities, endoscopy and more fortify the company’s market position. Meanwhile, Stryker’s exclusive navigation platform provides streamlined software solutions that allow surgeons to accurately track, analyze and monitor instrumentation pertaining to a patient’s anatomy during surgical procedures to enhance patient outcomes. We expect Stryker to perform well by virtue of its strong and diverse portfolio, innovative pipeline, strategic acquisitions along with ongoing cost control measures and increasing operating efficiency.Stryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to boost growth profile. The acquisition of NOVADAQ Technologies Inc completed in September is a recent example.Also, Stryker has been focusing on international growth as well. In particular, the company’s Medsurg product line has witnessed strong demand in the European and Australian markets in 2017. However, China might prove to be a challenging market.On the flip side, Stryker along with its peers like Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report), Female Health Company (VERU  -  Free Report) and LeMaitre Vascular, Inc (LMAT  -  Free Report) continues to be challenged by lower demand for health care products. Additionally, the company’s spine business in the United States witnessed supply issues in 2017. It has been facing challenging global economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Western Europe as well. Going forward, lower reimbursements for medical products and services may impose a downward pressure on the prices for the company’s products, which are expected to have an impact on the top line.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

247,SYK,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) continues to hit headlines with its steady strategic developments. Recently, the company caught investors’ attention on the receipt of expanded 510(k) clearances for the company’s Kyphon HV-R Bone Cement for fixation of pathological fractures of the sacral vertebral body. This new breakthrough is expected to expand the company’s Interventional Pain Therapies business within the broader Restorative Therapies Group (RTG).Per Medtronic, the fixation will be done using sacral vertebroplasty or sacroplasty. With this expanded indication, the company will be able to broaden its commitment toward the treatment of pathological fractures of the vertebral body caused by osteoporosis, cancer or benign lesions. The company claims this advancement to offer clinicians more options in curing patients with sacral insufficiency fractures (SIF).Notably, SIFs are a common cause for debilitating back pain. Per American Journal of Neuroradiology (ANJR), SIFs are a frequent yet often unsuspected reason behind low back pain in the elderly patients. Very recently, sacroplasty emerged as an alternative therapy for the treatment of SIFs. According to ANJR, prospective studies and case reports suggest that it is a safe and effective remedy.Per Medtronic, SIFs show the symptoms of lumbar spine pathology. Going by studies, more than two-thirds of SIF patients fail to associate their pain with a traumatic event. Evidently, they are often being prescribed with conservative treatment options including physical therapy and prolonged bed rest. These are highly expensive choices inducing loss of productivity within the healthcare system. Also, patients put to bed rest are at a rising risk of pulmonary embolism and DVT as well as further muscle atrophy and bone loss.Meanwhile, SIF patients treated with sacroplasty experience immediate pain relief, allowing them to resume daily activity and/or physical therapy without suffering pain and physical limitations. More encouragingly, the procedure of sacroplasty with HV-R cement is pretty simple owing to its minimally-invasive procedure and the therapy can be performed in an outpatient setting.Demographic Change and SIFGoing by a report published in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), epidemiologic changes in first and second world countries will inevitably lead to a constant increase of the grey populace. Also, per the United Nations data, global aging population (aged 60 years or above) came in at 962 million in 2017, more than double the figure registered in 1980, when the strength of senior citizens was 382 million worldwide. The number is again expected to grow twice as dense by 2050 when it is projected to reach nearly 2.1 billion.Therefore, detection of SIF among elderly adults, is markedly gaining prominence with huge prospects for its treatment market. Hence, we believe Medtronic’s latest innovation in this space to be well-timed and strategic.Price Performance Medtronic has outperformed the industry in three months’ time. The stock has gained 9.9% compared with the industry's rise of 7.4%.Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corp.

The company saw a 21.3% rise at constant exchange rate in Diabetes business revenues during fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. The company benefited from a solid uptake of new sensor-augmented insulin pump systems in the United States and international markets along with increased production capacity for the same.Recently, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for the Guardian Connect continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system for diabetes patients between the ages of 14 to 75 years.Notably, the system was scheduled to be made available in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (May-July 2018).The company also announced that the FDA has approved a new arm indication for the Guardian Sensor 3 continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which is used with the MiniMed 670G insulin pump.Notably, Medtronic expects double-digit growth in the segment in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, courtesy of consistent performance by MiniMed 670G system in the United States along with enhanced sensor supply capacity.Additionally, Medtronic has been gearing up for the international introduction of the MiniMed 670G and the U.S. launch of new professional CGM iPro 3 in 2019.Market PotentialAn ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle, rising awareness and higher expenditure in healthcare are likely to drive the highly competitive diabetes market.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%. Considering the bullish market sentiments, we believe that the latest development has been strategic.Share Price MovementMedtronic has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

252,SYK,"There was a time when plastic and reconstructive surgeries were performed only on serious burn cases or accidental injuries. Now cosmetic surgery is de rigueur in many social circles. Over the last few years, the masses have been picking up this trend from eminent Hollywood celebrities.From millennials to baby boomers, plenty are interested in such procedures for aesthetic reasons. Data from the 2016 Cosmetic Surgery National Data Bank Statistics report published by The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) substantiates this fact, stating that for the first time since 2016, Americans have spent more than $15 billion on surgical and nonsurgical procedures marking a $1.5 billion rise in annual spending.This data might encourage venturesome investors to consider industries which have been gaining considerable ground of late.Factors Driving Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery MarketThe trend to look presentable on social media platforms is on the rise. Per an article by Jim Frame published by INDEPENDENT, “Cosmetic procedures are now the surgery of 'want, not need.'”Moreover, a rapidly aging population has been contributing to the fast-growing plastic and reconstructive surgery market. Per data provided by ASAPS in a Cosmetic Surgery National Data Bank Statistics report, the combined surgical and nonsurgical procedures for men and women above the age of 65 have risen by 89% between 2012 and 2016.The wide gamut of surgical and nonsurgical procedures makes the plastic and reconstructive surgery market a lucrative space. Ranging from skin grafting, modifying an existing feature for cosmetic reasons, to getting a congenital defect corrected, all these procedures fall under the umbrella of this niche space.Notably, surgical and nonsurgical solutions for men are also rapidly gaining momentum. Per data provided by ASAPS in Cosmetic Surgery National Data Bank Statistics report, male breast reduction procedures alone (for the treatment of Gynecomastia) had risen by 181%, as measured in 2016, since ASAPS initiated surveying for cosmetic surgical data 20 years back.The report also stated that breast augmentation and lifting surgeries dominated the chart of five most popular surgeries for women in 2016. Many analysts believe that increasing awareness and rising expenditure in healthcare with technological advancements are likely to drive demand for these surgeries. This is further substantiated by data provided by Global Market Insights, which projects that the global breast implants market is set to reach a worth of roughly $1,482.1 million, at a CAGR of 4.1% in the 2016-2024 period.If that is not enough, a report by Technavio published in Business Wire, says that the global plastic surgery products market is expected to value around $15 billion, seeing a CAGR of 9% between 2016 and 2020.3 Stocks to Bet OnHere we highlight three companies that are striving to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the plastic and reconstructive surgeries market.Hologic, Inc.

The systems aid plastic surgeons, dermatologists and other medical practitioners to perform non-invasive and minimally invasive procedures.Post the buyout, Cynosure has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Hologic and has resulted in the addition of a new segment to Hologic’s diversified business — Medical Aesthetics.Hologic announced the receipt of expanded FDA 510(k) clearance for Cynosure's clinically proven and non-invasive body contouring product, SculpSure, in September.

253,SYK,"On Sep 25, we issued an updated research report on Model N (MODN  -  Free Report), a provider of cloud-based revenue management software.Model N is benefiting from a growing customer base, transition to cloud-based applications and synergies from the Revitas acquisition.

Revenues of $34.2 million increased 22.7% year over year.Model N expects fourth-quarter GAAP revenues to come in the range of $34.6-$35.1 million.

254,SYK,"IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2018 results on May 4, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.48%. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 7.3%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Catalysts IDEXX is expected to continue with its gain momentum in the first quarter, courtesy of a strong global rise in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics’ revenues. Last time, this upside was driven by consistent strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumables plus owing to a high-single-digit increase registered in rapid assay sales. Management vouches for this trend to be retained further.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about IDEXX enhancing its commercial capabilities in the United States to maintain recurring revenue growth at CAG Diagnostics. We expect first-quarter results to reflect a rise in productivity as new sales representatives establish fresh customer relationships. Also, we anticipate the company to report exceptional customer retention rates for reference labs as well as instrument consumables in the United States and worldwide.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $460 million for CAG Diagnostics revenues represents a 5.9% improvement from the last-reported quarter.Notably, IDEXX’s 13-14.5% revenue growth projection for the quarter to be reported  highlights its organic gains of 9.5-10.5%. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total quarterly revenues is pegged at $525 million..Other factors predicted to influence IDEXX’s first-quarter results are:We pin considerable hopes on progress in the Water Business, lying on a growth trajectory of late, backed by encouraging test results in the United States as well as benefits drawn from the global go-direct initiatives. Moreover, the business witnessed 16% organic growth last quarter. Management also eyes gains from two favorable regulatory developments pertaining to wastewater in the United States and drinking water in Europe. The company earlier stated that it is perfectly on track for a continued high-single digit organic revenue boost in this business through 2018. The consensus mark for Water revenues stands at $28.3 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter.IDEXX carries on to expand its global footprint. It has been significantly drawing advantages from the bountiful opportunities in the emerging companion animal diagnostics markets. Further, management’s consistent share buybacks underscores its robust free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will bear reflection on first-quarter conference call.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern is the company’s heavy reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors leave a significant impact on the company’s sales of instrument consumables as well as its rapid assay products. Moreover, IDEXX has been witnessing a rise in operating expenses due to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development and expansion in the United States plus internationally.Additionally, a competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX’s performance. Thus, the struggle to gain market traction might be a drag on first-quarter results.Here’s what the quantitative model predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of -0.90% leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:Baxter International Inc.

256,SYK,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results on May 2 after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 12.24%. Notably, Hologic’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the past four quarters with an average beat of 6.26%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystWithin Diagnostics, Hologic once again expects a stellar performance banking on molecular diagnostics.In the United States, the company is likely to gain from an increasing market share as well as utilization of fully automated Panther system along with market expansion by conforming to the testing guidelines.Global growth within molecular diagnostics can be attributed to the Panther system, Hologic’s fully automated molecular diagnostics instrument and also owing to a frequent utilization of Aptima women’s health assays. Notably, Aptima assays have gained a huge customer base in testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV (human papillomavirus) and trichomonas. We are also hopeful about Hologic’s expanded market for sexually transmitted disease testing.Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hologic, Inc. Quote Further, we are upbeat about Diagnostics business earning a regulatory clearance for several new products in the United States over the last six quarters. These include the first three respiratory assays on new Fusion platform and three viral load tests for HIV (for human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis C and hepatitis B. This steady pace of domestic assay innovation strengthens the company’s position to consolidate molecular testing on the Panther system. In January, the company again announced the PMA approval for the Aptima HBV Quant Assay for quantitation of hepatitis B viral load on the fully automated Panther system.All the above developments are anticipated to contribute significantly to the company’s topline in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $155 million for Molecular Diagnostics revenues reflects an increase of 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.Other few factors likely to influence Hologic’s results in the fiscal second quarter are as follows:Hologic is optimistic about sustaining a solid earnings trend in 2018 courtesy of gains from the Breast Health segment. Sales from the same have improved on the basis of an established clinical superiority of the segmental products over the last three quarters. The company has witnessed a consistent rise in market share within Breast Health on the back of direct-to-consumer initiativesand insurance coverage.Additionally, the company’s adoption of new mammography systems, 3Dimensions and 3D Performance, encourages us. These new products have already started to leverage the company’s Genius brand and also lured customers to upgrade their existing 2D systems.

258,SYK,"With a market capitalization of approximately $20.26 billion, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) has been benefiting from consistent solid organic revenue growth, World Courier Business, H.D. Smith acquisition and deal with Walgreens. A temporary PharMEDium slowdown, declining dollar, generic inflation, cutthroat competition in the niche space and lower-than-expected contribution from generic launches are denting growth.For fiscal 2018, AmerisourceBergen expects revenue growth in the range of 8-11% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $167.94 billion, reflecting an increase of 9.7% year over year.The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.45-$6.65 for fiscal 2018.

Buoyed by the above mixed trends, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus | AmerisourceBergen Corporation QuoteSo, here we take a quick look at the major factors that have been plaguing AmerisourceBergen, and also the brighter prospects that indicates of a near-term recovery.Factors Plaguing AmerisourceBergenAmerisourceBergen has recently received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Tennessee for documents about the testing of a certain type of syringe made at its PharMEDium lab in Memphis. Memphis is the company’s largest highly automated production facility.Consequently, AmerisorceBergen suspended operations and recalled all products from there that had yet to expire. Recently, the FDA also visited this facility for the same reason. Sluggishness in this unit is likely to hamper the company’s specialty distribution segment over the long haul.In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the segment's results were negatively impacted by PharMEDium, with the company witnessing lower-than-expected revenues and profit contribution. Per management, contribution to adjusted EBIT and EPS in fiscal 2018 will be lower than anticipated due to the time and certain ongoing incremental expenses required to perform remedial measures,.Why Should You Hold?Despite adversities in PharMEDium, AmerisourceBergen’s World Courier unit is likely to be the key driver of revenues. The unit is a global leader in specialty logistics that designs and executes world-class logistics processes.Per management, World Courier’s position as the leader in global specialty logistics services propelled volume growth and overall performance for the company in the last couple of quarters as well.Recently, the company announced the designation of its flagship World Courier unit as the first logistics company to obtain global Good Distribution Practices (GDP) certification against three major standards.The business posted impressive results in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. At the end of the quarter, World Courier’s company-owned offices were spread across more than 50 countries, with 14 investigational drug depots located in emerging markets worldwide. Solid volume growth and expanding operating margins have favored World Courier unit in the quarter.Price PerformanceAmerisourceBergen outperformed its industry in a month's time. The company’s shares have gained 10.3% compared with the industry's rise of 5.1%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500 index’s return of 1.7% . Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corp.

QuoteSegmental AnalysisThe company currently distributes its products through two subsidiaries — Patterson Dental and Patterson Animal Health.Dental SegmentThis segment provides a virtually complete range of consumable dental products, equipment, software, turnkey digital solutions and value-added services to dentists and laboratories throughout North America.In the fourth quarter, dental sales (40% of total sales) declined 10.1% year over year to approximately $545.8 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.74 per share, which lies within guidance.Patterson Companies expects deal amortization expenses of $27.3 million or 30 cents per share.Our TakeLackluster sales and earnings performance dampened Patterson Companies’ fourth-quarter results. However, the company’s strong fiscal 2019 guidance buoys optimism. We are upbeat about the Animal Health segment that has been performing well lately.The company provides a wide range of consumable supplies, equipment, software and value-added services. A broad spectrum of products cushions the company against economic downturns in the MedTech space. We believe that a diversified product portfolio, strong veterinary business prospects, accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships are key growth catalysts.On the flip side, operating margins have been dull.  Declining revenues in the dental segment is another headwind. The recent fall in the segment is driven by lower sales of CEREC and digital technology products. Management expects headwinds in the technology-based equipment business to persist through fiscal 2019.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corp.

263,SYK,"With a market capitalization of approximately $10.17 billion, DENTSPLY SIRONA (XRAY  -  Free Report) reported in-line earnings in the trailing three quarters. However, the company faces margin threats and foreign exchange headwinds.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 4.6% against the industry’s rise of 4.3% in a month’s time.Let’s take a detailed look at the company’s performance and operations to analyze why investors should hold this stock for now.Probable HeadwindsDENSTPLY SIRONA expects adjusted earnings per share for 2018 in the range of $2.55-$2.65, down from the previous projection of $2.70-$2.80. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings is currently pegged at $2.57 per share, significantly lower than management’s expectations.DENTSPLY SIRONA expects gross margins and operating margins to be flat to slightly down as underlying margin rate improvement in businesses is expected to be offset by foreign exchange effects and the headwind from the target inventory equipment reductions. By the end of the first quarter of 2018, the company confirmed that it expects full-year 2018 operating margins to be down between 100 and 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis.DENTSPLY SIRONA has significant international foothold, particularly in Europe. Therefore, a strengthening U.S. dollar, especially against the euro, as well as emerging market currencies negatively impacts the company’s results. We believe that the currency volatility will remain a headwind for 2018. The company also faces significant pricing pressure due to intensifying competition.What’s Favoring the Stock?DENTSPLY SIRONA's innovations have been consistently driving its top line. Per management, the company spends more than $150 million in R&D and thus has a robust pipeline. Furthermore, efforts of DENTSPLY SIRONA’s laser team in accelerating major innovations deserve a mention.The company’s commitment to clinical education is also praiseworthy. DENSTPLY SIRONA plans to open a state-of-the-art training center in Charlotte, NC that will help it reach more than 10,000 dental professionals per year. Moreover, its European center in Bensheim, Germany will be able to directly communicate to above 25,000 practitioners a year, supplementing its continuing education efforts. Notably, DENTSPLY SIRONA is coming up with its new Dental Academy, in the second half of 2018.Management is bullish about the recently completed the acquisition of OraMetrix. OraMetrix software uniquely integrates digital scanning, 2D and 3D x-rays to create customized individual treatment plans for orthodontic patients. Lately, at the American Association of Orthodontists, the company launched a full clear liner and integration of OraMetrix and Omnicam, which witnessed positive reviews.Bottom lineUnhindered by the persistent issues, analysts are optimistic about DENTSPLY SIRONA.For current-quarter revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.03 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 3.8%.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

266,SYK,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has commenced on a positive note for most sectors, with a decent picture from the 133 S&P 500 participants that have reported till Jan 26. Total earnings for these companies are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating earnings estimates and 78.9% surpassing top-line expectations.Notably, about 121 S&P 500 companies are reporting their earnings this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to increase 11.6% on 7.5% growth in revenues. This indicates an improved growth projection from the previous quarter driven by a corporate-tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data. These factors have boosted corporate earnings and stoked investments.Based on this pattern, the fourth quarter is expected to register modest double-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.MedTech Earnings So FarMedical, one among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to stand out this quarter. The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.This is evident from the results of MedTech heavyweights Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report). The companies exited the fourth quarter on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. An upbeat FY18 guidance also instills confidence.For the fourth quarter, the earnings growth rate for the medical sector is pegged at 4.2% on 4.9% revenue growth.Upcoming ReleasesLet’s take a look at three major other MedTech stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Jan 30, 2018:Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) results are scheduled for release after the market closes.

For full-year 2017, net sales are estimated at $12.4 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter on a constant-currency basis. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.38 billion.Buoyed by these prospects, our quantitative model indicates an earnings beat for Stryker this quarter.

NuVasive further plans to add a world class surgeon education lab apart from expanding the work space. The company intends to introduce and educate surgeons from all over the globe on the company’s highly sophisticated spine technology and procedures at the innovation center of excellence.NuVasive, a pioneer in applying procedurally-integrated solutions for minimally disruptive spine surgeries, has been steadily strengthening its global position. In 2014, the company opened a center of excellence in Amsterdam. This was followed by the building of a new 180,000-sq ft medical device facility in West Carrollton, OH.  Moreover, the company owns a 100,000-sq ft facility which is used as its central distribution hub in Memphis, TN.NuVasive has been riding on strength in its international business. Interestingly, the company witnessed year-over-year improvement on the top-line front in the second quarter of 2017 on account of robust growth in the international business. We encouragingly note that the quarter marked the third consecutive quarter of more than 20% growth in the international business. Thus, the company’s effort to solidify its global footprint seems to be strategically aligned.Per a report from BECKER’s SPINE REVIEW, the global minimally invasive spine surgery market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.6% between 2017 and 2021. Given the current market potential, we believe that the company is on the right track to gain traction.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the minimally invasive spine surgery market. However, this market is dominated by many well-established players like Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report). Notably, Stryker provides a range of products with ES2 Spinal systems, MANTIS implants, LITe Decompression tubes and many more in its minimally invasive spine surgical solutions portfolio.

268,SYK,"Kalamazoo, MI-based Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), one of the largest medical device companies in the global orthopedic market, recently announced the voluntary product recall of the Oral Care lineup, which was offered by the company’s Sage-Products unit.Added to the voluntary recall, Stryker has placed a temporary hold on certain cloth-based products. The decision followed complaints of minor irritation and allergic reactions from consumers. However, management expects to reinitiate product shipment by September and expects to begin full supply capacity by the end of the year.The share price of Stryker slipped 1.9% to close at $138.36 following the news release.What Led to the Recall?The recall pertains to a cross-contamination issue in the Oral-care solutions which were manufactured for Sage by a third-party supplier. Notably, these solutions were distributed in markets between July 2015 and August 2017.However, Stryker affirmed that it has closed its business with the third-party supplier. In fact, Sage has resumed production of the oral care solutions.Coming to the temporary hold decision of the cloth-based products, the FDA expressed concerns regarding the ongoing microbiological testing methods for all products under the Sage platform. Now the FDA has instructed Stryker products to be verified using a new ‘compendial microbiological method’. Undoubtedly, the new method is more time consuming and complex than the one previously used at Sage.Notably, the FDA had warned Stryker about these issues in July.Product Recall Hurts GuidanceThe recall is likely to adversely impact the company’s sales and operating income. For the full year, Stryker now expects organic sales growth at the low end of its previously issued guidance band of 6.5% to 7.0%. Added to this, the company announced that net earnings per diluted share are expected at the low end of the $6.45-$6.55 range.For the third quarter, Stryker estimates adjusted net earnings per diluted share at the low end of its previously issued $1.50-$1.55 band.Stryker has been grappling with supply issues in the spine business for long which may prove to be a major drawback in the quarters ahead. In fact, international growth of the company’s Spine segment in the second quarter of 2017 was partially affected by these supply headwinds.Stock Performance at a GlanceStryker's share price movement over the past one year has been favorable. The company yielded a return of almost 22.1%, better than the broader industry's only 8%. Solid performances by the MedSurg and Neurotech segments in the last reported quarter hold promise. Strength in the international segments on strong momentum in Europe and China also buoys optimism.Zacks Rank & Key PicksStryker has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Cogentix Medical, Inc. .

272,SYK,"The Medical Instrument industry within the broader Medical universe has been gaining on R&D innovation, higher consolidation, focus on emerging market and tax abolition. The industry increased 3.6% in a month’s time, higher than the S&P 500 index’s rise of 2%.Fundamentally, the industry has benefited by a massive change in consumer behavior as well. This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests as well as use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.It will be interesting to analyze the best Medical Instrument stocks that are likely to yield solid returns in the days to come. But first, let us glance at the latest headlines from the space. Latest Medical Instrument Headlines at a Glance Stryker’s Takeover Plans of Boston ScientificThe Medical Instrument fraternity has been riding on the current merger and acquisition (M&A) trends.Per a recent report by the Reuters, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) is likely to take over Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), creating a market value of more than $110 billion. However, the possibility of the deal is uncertain. Thre are no confirmatory statements or press releases from the company representatives.In fact, investors should never forget about Stryker’s highly-rumored acquisition plans of Smith & Nephew in 2015, which never materialized. On the brighter side, this is not the first time Stryker has been tied up with Boston Scientific. The company acquired Boston Scientific's neurovascular unit in 2010 for $1.5 billion, which indicates probability of a second collaboration (read more: Stryker Likely to Acquire Boston Scientific).Stryker has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).If the deal materializes, the combined entity will have one of the MedTech’s broadest spectrums of product offerings that include cardiology, orthopaedics, surgical supplies and neuroscience. This will reduce pricing pressure and competition. Further, the companies with a strong acquisition policy will gain from rapidly-expanding customer base, moderate leverage and enhanced cash flow.Glancing at major acquisitions in the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s takeover of C. R. Bard for $24 billion and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Covidien for about $43 billion deserve a mention.Abiomed Reserves Slot in the S&P 500 Leading Medical Instrument player Abiomed Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report) replaced Wyndham Worldwide Corp and entered the S&P 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Health Care Supplies Sub-Industry index.Per a research report by The Globe and Mail, Abiomed is following the trend of medical device and technology companies reserving the top slot in the S&P 500 index. To remind investors, Align Technology Inc (ALGN  -  Free Report) topped the index in 2017.Abiomed currently has a market capitalization of $18.6 billion. Further, the company’s financial viability, adequate liquidity, reasonable price and sector representation has lent it a competitive edge in the U.S. Medical Instrument industry (read more: Abiomed to Replace Wyndham in the S&P 500 Benchmark).Tax Abolition Boosting R&DA bipartisan two-year suspension of a ‘Medical Device’ tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, has been a temporary relief. This tax took a toll on the entire medical device industry since its enactment. Per the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, this tax had a negative impact on medical innovation resulting in loss or deferred creation of jobs.For now, the deferral will encourage R&D activities in this space. The repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor’s optimism. The ratification of the Tax-repeal amendment has invoked massive investment in the sector.3 Top Medical Instrument StocksConsidering the existence of the number of players in the Medical Instruments industry, choosing the right stocks with the potential to yield returns might be a daunting task.Our proprietary Zacks methodology makes it fairly simple for you.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to select favorable stocks.

Notably, the Radixact system leverages on the company’s flagship TomoTherapy platform.Radixact system provides complex treatments such as craniospinal and total marrow irradiation. Added to these functionalities, Summit Cancer Center has the capability to perform stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) while sparing normal tissues and maintaining optimal treatment efficacy.The Radixact System has been designed to deliver image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy, an extremely precise form of radiation therapy. The platform gained Japanese regulatory approval (Shonin approval) in the last quarter and is expected to start formal treatments from the fourth quarter.In this regard, a glimpse at the preliminary fourth-quarter results reveals that Accuray expects approximately $86 million of gross product orders. Solid growth in gross orders is buoyed by the full commercial launch of the Radixact system and continued strong demand for the company’s flagship CyberKnife system.Stock Price & Estimate Revision TrendAccuray has had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one year. The company has lost 23.7%, way wider than the broader industry’s rally of almost 2.4%. Moreover, the current level compares unfavorably with the S&P 500’s 11% gain.Furthermore, the estimate revision for the stock has been unfavorable. The full-year estimates deteriorated 3 cents to a loss of 28 cents per share. Owing to the bearish analyst sentiments, Accuray carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which signifies underperformance in the near term.Our TakeAccuray’s top-line growth is highly dependent on CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems sales. However, both systems involve significant capital spending, which many healthcare providers are reluctant to spend, primarily due to the sluggish macro-economic conditions. This might mar revenues over the long haul.However, the company has been gaining ground on a series of positive tidings on the regulatory front recently. Of the notable ones, Accuray received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its iDMS Data Management System in July.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

276,SYK,"Medical device manufacturer Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSII  -  Free Report) recently released one-year data from its LIBERTY 360° clinical study in a late-breaking presentation at the 2017 Amputation Prevention Symposium (AMP) in Chicago. LIBERTY 360° is a prospective, observational, multi-center post-market study. The study was based on more than 1,200 patients at 51 sites across the U.S., including 501 patients with claudication, 603 patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and 100 patients with the most severe form of CLI.The study examined the acute and long-term clinical and economic outcomes of peripheral vascular interventions (PVI) in peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients. LIBERTY 360° included all FDA-approved endovascular devices to treat PAD.The 12-month data from this study demonstrated that peripheral endovascular intervention marked improvement across all Ruthetford Classes along with high freedom from major adverse events. To be precise, LIBERTY 360°showed that PVI can help prevent amputation for patients with PAD, specifically CLI.As per the company’s press release, around 18 million Americans suffer from PAD, which is caused by the accumulation of plaque in peripheral arteries reducing blood flow. We believe that the company is adopting appropriate strategic moves to capture the niche market.In this regard to note, the company recently received FDA approval for radial access Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy Device to treat PAD.

277,SYK,"Cardinal Health’s (CAH  -  Free Report) premarket approval (PMA) application for INCRAFT (INCRAFT Stent Graft System) recently received favorable recommendation from the FDA. The Circulatory System Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee voted 11 to 4 in favor of the system.Notably, the INCRAFT system comes under Cardinal Health’s Cordis unit, which was acquired earlier in 2015. However, by the end of third-quarter fiscal 2018, the Cordis unit’s performance lacked luster. It significantly affected Cardinal Health’s earnings and effective tax rate.Hence, the PMA for the INCRAFT system has been a timely one which will help Cardinal Health secure a broader customer base for the Cordis unit.The INCRAFT System at a GlanceThe INCRAFT system is a cardiovascular platform.It has an advanced endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) technology for the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), a severe and complex condition.Per an article by Experimental & Clinical Cardiology, AAA rupture causes 4500 deaths each year in the United States, with an additional 1400 deaths resulting from the 45,000 repair procedures performed to prevent rupture.Market ProspectsPer Research and Markets, the global market for cardiovascular devices reached nearly $42.4 billion in 2017 and should scale to $59.1 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 6.9% in the 2017-2022 period.The report further states that with medical needs of patients at an all-time high, any increase in incidences will lead to significant growth of the cardiovascular market.Price PerformanceWe believe that positive developments will boost the shares of Cardinal Health, which have declined 28.5% in a year’s time, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s gain of 8.8%.Other Major ProductsCardinal Health’s Medical and Pharmaceutical offerings lend the company a competitive edge in the niche space.

This is an advanced software application that provides systematic computer guidance to orthopedic surgeons during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures.Though Exactech might benefit from the solid prospects in the Total Knee Replacement market, it will face tough competition from the likes of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, INC. (ZBH  -  Free Report), which offers the iASSIST knee Personalized Guidance System for knee replacement procedures.Exactech plans a complete commercial launch of TKA PLUS software application in 2018. This product development is in line with the company’s objective to gain traction in the huge and untapped Total Knee Replacement market. As per data provided by GRAND VIEW RESEARCH, this market is expected to reach a worth of $12.4 billion by 2024.Apart from solid initiatives in the knee platform, Exactech announced FDA approval to market its proprietary ExactechGPS Shoulder Application in the United States earlier this year.Share Price TrendsOver the past six months, Exactech has been trading above the broader industry. The company’s stock has gained 20.2%, higher than the industry’s 6%. We believe that the company is currently riding high on regulatory approvals and product launches.However, the estimate revision trend for the current quarter lacked luster over the last two months. Notably, one estimate moved south compared to no movement in the opposite direction. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter fell 4.1% to 23 cents per share over the same timeframe.Exactech has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

281,SYK,"Amedisys, Inc.  (AMED  -  Free Report), renowned home health and hospice services provider, has rallied 3.6% over the last six months, ahead of the S&P 500’s 2.9% gain. The stock has a market cap of $1.7 billion. The company’s five-year historical growth rate is also favorable at 17.5% as compared to 12.4% of the broader industry.Also, the company represented a return of almost 3.6%, in comparison to the broader industry’s decline of 8.2% over the last six months.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick at present.The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has also been positive. In the past 60 days, five analysts moved their estimates north, with no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision increased around 6.2% to $2.22 per share over the same time frame.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Recently, Amedisys ended the second quarter of 2017 on a solid note, with earnings and revenues beating the year-ago figures. Also, at Hospice, the company registered strong growth across all segments.Amedisys is currently exploring opportunities in the Home Health and Hospice segments. The company’s favorable demographic trend and strategic acquisitions encourage us as well. Moreover, the company has been witnessing growth in the personal care segment on synergies from acquisitions.We are encouraged by the company’s long-term strategy to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to one focused on bringing home a continuum of care to better serve patients and diversify sources of payment so as to become less reliant on Medicare. In this regard, the company experienced an improvement in non-Medicare revenues in comparison with the declining Medicare revenues within the Home Health division as seen in the last reported second quarter.The home health industry is poised for substantial growth in the long term driven by the positive demographic trend in the United States. The company should continue to benefit from the aging demographics of the U.S. population and the need for higher acuity patients in a home nursing environment. Notably, the company is on track to fortify its footprint in the market place. Recently, it announced the completion of National Readmission Prevention Collaborative (NRPC) certification program by its clinical programs team that handles the progress and delivery of home healthcare programs.Additionally, the company’s strong cash balance position bolsters our confidence in the stock.On the flip side, we expect synergies from the Tenet Healthcare acquisition may escalate costs and operating expenses weighing on the company’s margins. Also, an intense competitive landscape and regulatory concerns continue to pose challenges in the home health and hospice industry.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

282,SYK,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on Align Technology (ALGN  -  Free Report), which manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics and dental records storage. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Align Technology has been trading above the industry since last month. The stock has gained 4.2% in this period as compared to 7.3% decline of the industry. The company’s strong InvisAlign Technology prospects and growth in North America and international regions look encouraging.In EMEA, second-quarter 2017 volumes surged 33.2% year over year, reflecting a continued adoption of InvisAlign Technology in core markets like the U.K. and Spain as well as rapid growth from expansion in new markets including Eastern Europe, Central Europe and Benelux. During the reported quarter, volumes soared 44.4% year over year in the Asia Pacific belt, led by China and followed by SouthEast Asia, Japan and ANZ (Australia and New Zealand).Great news is that the company has recently opened a new InvisAlign Technology Treatment Planning facility in China. Plus, a multimillion dollar marketing campaign for InvisAlign Technology brand promotion is also likely to keep investors upbeat. The company’s receipt of two U.S. patents for SmartTrack Aligner material no doubt buoys optimism.On the contrary, foreign exchange headwinds continue to pose a major dampener to the company’s international performance. Also escalating costs and expenses are weighing on its margins. Last month, a comparative study of Align Technology’s forward P/E (forward 12-month basis) multiple reflected that the stock has been quite overvalued.Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

283,SYK,"Leading healthcare diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp recently inked a distribution agreement with Roswell Park Cancer Institute’s molecular diagnostics subsidiary, OmniSeq, Inc.Per the deal terms, LabCorp will distribute OmniSeq’s Immune Report Card and OmniSeq Comprehensive clinical assays across the United States and outside.The company will get an exclusive right to distribute these OmniSeq tests to U.S.-based physicians through Integrated Oncology, a member of the LabCorp Specialty Testing Group, and globally to biopharmaceutical customers via its Covance Drug Development arm.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price  Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings price | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteAlso, the chief scientific officer of LabCorp Diagnostics, Marcia Eisenberg, will join OmniSeq’s board of directors. Plus, LabCorp has plans to participate in OmniSeq’s Series B financing round. This financing will be used to conduct OmniSeq’s ongoing retrospective and prospective clinical trials as well as to generate further evidence of the clinical utility of OmniSeq’s comprehensive genomic and immune profiling services.Notably, Immune Report Card is a comprehensive immune profiling test, designed to inform oncologists regarding checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) treatment decisions. This combines results for all common biomarker assays relevant to checkpoint inhibitors as well as other informative analyses. Per OmniSeq, this assessment will provide a comprehensive immune profile to help in identifying 20-40% patients, who are likely to respond to CPI monotherapy.On the other hand, OmniSeq Comprehensive assay is a 144-gene, pan-cancer, next-generation sequencing tumor profiling diagnostic panel. It helps oncologists to determine a particular line of treatment.Considering the fact that both Immune Report Card and OmniSeq Comprehensive trials have received the New York State’s Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program’s approval, we expect this alliance to help LabCorp broaden its customer base in cancer immunotherapy diagnostics space. Notably, this market is growing in leaps and bounds in recent times.Per the data provided by Radiant Insights, Inc. as published in Cision PR Newswrites, global cancer immunotherapies market is expected to witness a CAGR of 23.9% by 2022. Hence, we believe LabCorp’s latest decision to widen its position in this market is perfectly strategic.As part of its key tactical plans, LabCorp is consistently working hard on new innovations with academic institutions to capture the growing lab testing market with its advanced assays and tools.During the second quarter of 2017, the company has opened a state-of-the-art companion diagnostics laboratory in North Carolina and delivered a double-digit increase in year-over-year revenues aided by continued growth in immuno-oncology services.The company also won $100 million in companion diagnostic-related awards during the first half of the year. Its pipeline comprises a diverse range of oncology and non-oncology indications with new and established clients that might position it well for consistent growth in the future.LabCorp’s latest partnership with OmniSeq as well as its decision to invest for latter’s research and development should add further momentum to the company’s growth trajectory.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).

284,SYK,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Baxter International BAX)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7% over the past month. BAX hit a new 52-week high of $75.62 in the previous session. Baxter International has gained 16.6% since the start of the year compared to the 1.7% move for the Medical sector and the 10.8% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 26, 2018, Baxter International reported EPS of $0.7 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.62 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.13%.For the current fiscal year, Baxter International is expected to post earnings of $2.89 per share on $11.37 billion in revenues. This represents a 16.53% change in EPS on a 7.65% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.22 per share on $11.89 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.51% and 4.61%, respectively.Valuation MetricsBaxter International may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for BAX? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Baxter International has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 26.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.2X versus its peer group's average of 19.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.95. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus  Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus | Baxter International Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Baxter International currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Baxter International passes the test. Thus, it seems as though BAX shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does Baxter International Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Baxter International have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Surmodics (SRDX  -  Free Report), Haemonetics (HAE  -  Free Report), and Stryker (SYK  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Baxter International. Still, the fundamentals for BAX are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.

288,SYK,"Mechatronics, a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering, has been in vogue, of late. With growing prominence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotic companies, organizations with significant exposure to Mechatronics have been raking in huge profits. A research by the Business Wire deciphers that the global Mechatronics and Robotics market is projected to witness a CAGR of 15.02% during the 2017-2021 period.Considering the strong exposure of Mechatronics in almost all spheres like technology, automobile, telecom and more, the evolution of Medical Mechatronics has been the most fascinating.The growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of Information Technology (IT) for quick and improved patient care as well as a shift of the payment system to a value-based model indicate the predominance of Mechatronics in the MedTech space.So, let’s delve into details on how Medical Mechatronics has been creating new opportunities in MedTech and raising investors’ confidence to put money in the healthcare space for long-term gains.How is Mechatronics Shaping Up the Healthcare Paradigm?Medical Mechatronics is a much-awaited digital evolution in the global healthcare industry.Medical Mechatronics has provided innovation to the healthcare industry through reduction in the size of the age-old medical devices, development of low cost disposable devices, portability of devices and error free results.Per Hindawi, a renowned Healthcare Engineering journal, the Medical Mechatronics revolution has been one of the most important drivers of the global knowledge-based economies like the United States.Here we take a look at the two major aspects of Medical Mechatronics that have been doing rounds in the global headlines.3D printing & Medical MechatronicsThe best example of Mechatronics in the healthcare industry is 3D printing, which has changed the face of the medical devices industry.Also known as additive manufacturing, 3D printing is the process of turning a digital model into a solid three-dimensional physical object by adding material layer by layer (per an article on 3D Hubs). 3D printing has also received a warm response from the MedTech space within healthcare. Notably, research firm Future Market Insights expects the global 3D printed medical devices market to see a CAGR of 18.1% between 2017 and 2027.Of the major companies, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has been one of the early adopters of the 3D printing technology. The company’s FDA-approved Tritanium TL Curved Posterior Lumbar Cage is a 3D-printed interbody fusion cage intended for use as an aid in lumbar fixation.Robotics Boosting Medical Mechatronics The rise of Mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new robotic solutions to mitigate age-old problems for the MedTech companies. These solutions are pain less, error free and inexpensive. So MedTech companies that are using Mechatronic-based robots to cure diseases have a competitive edge with a strong customer base, solid revenues and handsome profits.Of the major companies, MedTech giant Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) is a notable mention.Intuitive Surgical designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This Mechatronic-based platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery.The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair in the days to come.Let us take a look at three other MedTech stocks that have been hogging the limelight based on the growing prevalence of Mechatronics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector.3 Best MedTech Stocks Riding High on MechatronicsIn this backdrop, three MedTech stocks are well positioned on strong fundamentals and solid exposure to Mechatronics.We have used the Zacks Stock Screener to pick them.

The technology also features an optical sensor. This development has provided the company with significant exposure to Medical Mechatronics.The company plans a controlled roll-out of the technologically advanced heart pump at hospital sites with developed heart recovery protocols over the next fiscal year. Varian Medical Systems Inc (VAR  -  Free Report)The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. Shares of Varian Medical have gained 17.1% in a year’s time.Varian Medical has received significant exposure to Medical Mechatronic trends on its Halcyon and HyperArc platforms.The Halcyon radiotherapy treatment system has been designed to offer cost-effective cancer care worldwide. The system streamlines every aspect of image-guided volumetric intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The HyperArc platform is Varian Medical’s high definition radiotherapy technology. In Apr 2018, Varian Medical launched Halcyon 2.0 with kilovoltage imaging (Kv). The first human kV cone-beam CT images on a Halcyon were acquired at Washington University with positive feedback on image quality, speed of image acquisition, and processing.Further, Varian Medical’s HyperArc platform is designed to treat multiple metastases brain cancer cases and continues to witness strong demand. STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report)The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B.

289,SYK,"Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), one of the largest medical device companies in the global orthopedic market, has successfully expanded its product portfolio over time, which aids the company to cater to evolving demands of customers.The Kalamazoo, MI-based company boasts a diverse portfolio that has been aiding top-line growth, reflected through projected revenue growth of 8.53%. We expect the momentum to continue, banking on the strength of its portfolio and acquisitions.The company’s product portfolio cushions it against any significant sales shortfall during economic downturns. Stryker’s pipeline includes products for Hip, Knee and Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgeries. MAKO results in the last quarter were solid, with almost 26 global robot installations, of which, 24 were in the United States.Furthermore, the platforms of bone cement, sports-medicine, bones substitute, soft tissue repair, trauma and extremities, endoscopy and more fortify the company’s market position. Meanwhile, Stryker’s exclusive navigation platform provides streamlined software solutions that allow surgeons to accurately track, analyze and monitor instrumentation pertaining to a patient’s anatomy during surgical procedures to enhance patient outcomes. We expect Stryker to perform well by virtue of its strong and diverse portfolio, innovative pipeline, strategic acquisitions along with ongoing cost control measures and increasing operating efficiency.Stryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to boost growth profile. The acquisition of NOVADAQ Technologies Inc completed in September is a recent example.Stryker has been focusing on international growth as well. In particular, the company’s Medsurg product line has witnessed strong demand in the European and Australian markets in 2017. However, China might prove to be a challenging market.On the flip side Stryker along with its peers like Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report), Female Health Company (VERU  -  Free Report) and LeMaitre Vascular, Inc (LMAT  -  Free Report), continues to be challenged by lower demand for health care products. Additionally, the company’s spine business in the United States witnessed supply issues in 2017. The company has been facing challenging global economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Western Europe. Additionally, lower reimbursements for medical products and services may impose a downward pressure on the prices for the company’s products which will ultimately impact the top line.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

290,SYK,"Per a Sep 18 article published on Duke University website, NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) has reportedly closed another acquisition. This time, it is a start-up company called Vertera Spine, created through research at both Duke University and the Georgia Institute of Technology. However, financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.NuVasive, which has just extended its global headquarter in San Diego, currently focuses on applying procedurally-integrated solutions for minimally disruptive spine surgeries. The latest development remains part of this strategy, having steadily strengthened NuVasive’s global position.The company aims to market and distribute Vetera Spine’s FDA-approved COHERE Cervical and COALESCETM Lumbar Interbody fusion devices in the United States.This acquisition has also lent the company a three-dimensional porous interbody technology across both polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and titanium materials. Notably, the company has introduced a few new features in its Modulus XLIF, built on a fully-porous titanium implant and created in three-dimensional manufacturing process as well as designed to match the porosity and stiffness of bone.It is encouraging to note that the company’s U.S. Spinal Hardware business, comprising implants and fixation products like MAGEC-EOS spinal bracing and lengthening system plus the PRECICE limb lengthening system, registered 3% growth in the recently reported quarter. NuVasive is therefore leaving no stone unturned to gain traction in this fast-growing spine market.In this regard, the company has been steadily focusing on product development.  It claims to possess an active corporate development pipeline that includes a number of strategic investments, acquisitions and partnership opportunities. Notably, during the first quarter of 2017, the company launched the first two interbody devices, MLX and TLX, used in lumbar fusion procedures.Per a report from Becker’s Spine Review, the global minimally-invasive spine surgery market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.6% between 2017 and 2021. Also, per a report by Technavio, the global spinal implants market is expected to witness a CAGR of roughly 6% in the 2016-2020 period.Thus, given the current market potential, we believe the company is on the right track to gain traction. We also believe that an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle, rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in this minimally-invasive spine surgery market.However, this market is also dominated by many well-established players like Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) and RTI Surgical (RTIX  -  Free Report) among others. Notably, Stryker provides a range of products with ES2 Spinal systems, MANTIS implants, LITe Decompression tubes and many more under minimally-invasive spine surgical solutions portfolio. Zimmer Biomet’s collection of thoracolumbar products forms a comprehensive portfolio for minimally-invasive spine surgery.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

291,SYK,"Anika Therapeutics, Inc. (ANIK  -  Free Report), a global medical technology company, specializing on integrated orthopedics medicines, has made a development with its proprietary hyaluronic acid (HA) technology. The company recently published favorable data on evaluating the usefulness of HYALOFAST, a non-woven biodegradable HA-based scaffold for treatment of cartilage lesions of the knee joint.The study was based on 40 patients with full thickness cartilage lesions of the knee joint. 20 among them were aged above 45 and the remaining, below the figure. Per the company, all patients were implanted with HYALOFAST, soaked in bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC), containing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and prospectively evaluated for four years.Data from the trial demonstrated that treatment outcomes were equally effective for both the age groups. This is more encouraging for the fact that it is difficult to treat patients above 45 years of age with traditional surgical approaches such as microfracture. Based on the findings, the company claimed that irrespective of a patient’s age, HYALOFAST in combination with autologous adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), can be successfully used as a treatment option for cartilage lesions.With this breakthrough, we expect the market adoption of HYALOFAST to increase significantly, boosting Anika Therapeutics’ sales performance. Notably, HYALOFAST is commercially available in more than 15 countries worldwide and has been used in more than 11,000 patients so far. Also, this trial result should advance the company’s procedure of regulatory submission of HYALOFAST in the US. Under ‘FastTRACK’ Phase III trial, it is currently enrolling patients across the U.S. and Europe.Demand for therapeutics-based treatment in the field of integrated orthopedics medicines and traumatic conditions, is growing in leaps and bounds these days. Per a recent report by Market Research Engine in this regard, global Orthopedic Devices Market will witness a CAGR of 5% from 2016 to 2022 and is projected to reach $47.50 billion by 2022.Some of the big names in the orthopedic device market with promising growth potential are Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), Smith & Nephew plc (SNN  -  Free Report) and Orthofix International N.V.

292,SYK,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on Ohio-based STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) – a manufacturer and marketer of infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction along with surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).STERIS posted better-than-expected results in first-quarter fiscal 2018 with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues is dampening.On a positive note, organic growth performance was strong across all segments. Further, growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company’s strong cash balance. Also, gross and operating margin expanded year over year. Recently, the company made a couple of organizational changes to serve customers in a better way. We expect this move to enhance the company’s cost structure as well. Over the last three months, the stock has gained 13.1%, which outperformed the 1.1% decline of the broader industry.However, we note that the government and insurance companies’ consistent efforts to curb healthcare costs have been putting pressure on the stock for quite some time. We are also concerned about the current customer consolidation scenario which will continue to affect the company, unless checked immediately. The competitive landscape and weak cost reduction initiatives are other overhangs.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

Haemonetics is also confident about maintaining progress in the commercial Plasma collection business.Further, the fiscal 2019 guidance looks promising.

295,SYK,"Brightree, the wholly owned subsidiary of ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report), recently entered into a strategic partnership with athenahealth (ATHN  -  Free Report), a leading provider of network-enabled services for hospital and ambulatory clients.Brightree has released a new solution for home medical equipment (HME) providers to digitally receive orders from more than 62,000 providers using athenaClinicals within the athenahealth network.From Brightree’s point of view, this deal is like adding another feather in its cap for delivering cloud-based software to post-acute care companies, which look set to improve business performance and patient outcomes.Notably, Brightree’s information exchange platform, eReferral, enables HME organization to seamlessly exchange information and receive referrals from external referral sources and Hospice customers, who are also part of the Brightree community.Before eReferral management happened, physicians and HME staff had to manually send, receive and process referrals as well as related documents via faxing and phone calls. Currently, Brightree is working hard to connect more physicians with eReferral Management, thus maximizing cost and time savings for them as well as HMEs.With respect to Brightree-athenaHealth partnership, offices using athenaHealth can refer patients to the HME providers the same way they refer them to other care settings, by forwarding equipment orders directly from their electronic health records system to the HME providers’ referral workflow within the Brightree system.Per Brightree, this digitized process will largely reduce the time of the entire procedure on one hand. While on the other, it will improve information accuracy, expediting patient care.Brightree Prospects at a GlanceSignificantly, ResMed’s Brightree software-as-a-service business is gradually growing strong. This business has been part of the ResMed Group for two full years, having registered a stable period of success. On the last reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 conference call, ResMed noted that Brightree systems handled more than 8.2 billion digital requests over the last 12 months. Revenues for the third quarter increased 14% year over year to $39.9 million.Moreover, analyzing the HME market prospects, we expect this growth momentum to sustain in the long run. According to an article by Freedonia Group, US demand for home medical equipment in 2018 is likely to gain 8.2% to $12.6 billion, driven by technological advances and cost containment efforts.Share Price Performance  In the past three months, shares of ResMed have outperformed its industry.

Notably, 71% of Tennessee-based naviHealth was acquired by Cardinal Health in 2015 for a deal value of $290 million. The company had a goal of acquiring the entire business after four years.naviHealth currently serves more than two million insured members and manages care transitions for approximately 800 acute hospitals and 11,000 post-acute care facilities across the United States.

298,SYK,"Penumbra Inc. (PEN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, after market close.The four-quarter average earnings beat is 35.7%. However, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 66.7% in the last quarter. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayPenumbra’s revenues rose 26.4% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter on the company’s stellar performance in both neuro and peripheral vascular. With the company remaining focused on product launches and geographic expansion, we expect the strong top-line uptrend to continue in the yet-to-be-reported quarter as well.We are also upbeat about the company’s promising guidance for 2017. Penumbra forecasts full-year total revenue in the range of $312 million to $317 million, which represents growth of almost 20% over full-year 2016.Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Penumbra, Inc. QuoteWe are also encouraged by the company’s focus on product development and innovation which should get reflected in the second quarter itself. Notably, research and development expenses increased 40.1% in the first quarter. In line with this, the company introduced a product under the Indigo family, CAT-D. Also, the company received FDA clearance for 3D revascularization device recently within its neuro franchise segment. Further, the company’s latest addition to its SMART COIL family is a wave extra soft finishing coil. Notably, Penumbra’s SMART COIL system is a platinum embolization device comprising complex Standard and Soft coils that change softness profile within a single coil.Coming to first-quarter 2017 results, Penumbra reported loss per share of 10 cents, comparing unfavorably with earnings of 7 cents in the year-ago quarter. Also, both gross and operating margin deteriorated in the first quarter. We expect escalating costs and expenses to continue to keep margins under pressure in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, in the first quarter, SG&A expenses had risen 29.2% year over year on increased headcount and personnel-related expenses. If this continues, the company’s operating income and earnings are likely to get affected in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Further, foreign exchange fluctuations and stiff competition from major commercial laboratories and hospitals continue to raise caution.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show a beat for Penumbra this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Penumbra has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 5 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Penumbra’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

299,SYK,"With the second-quarter earnings season gaining momentum, the broader picture no longer looks as bright as it was expected to be. Putting together all the 128 S&P 500 members’ released results as of Jul 25, constituting 36% of the index’s total membership, we note that earnings growth pace is less than the last quarter. However, it is more or less in line with the trailing four-quarter average earnings growth and exceeds the trailing 12-quarter average.Per the latest second-quarter scorecard, total earnings increased 7% year over year on 4.2% higher revenues. While earnings beat ratio remains at 77.3%, revenue beat ratio is at 70.3%. (For more information, please consult our Zacks Earnings Analysis).What’s in Store for the Medical Space?Investors are concerned about the healthcare space, a sector that has been seen through a lot of struggle during the past half year, thanks to the political power change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle.While yesterday, it was finally President Donald Trump’s win with the Republican healthcare bill passing one more barrier by a very narrow margin, investors are however not much optimistic about this development. Per a Vox article today, in its effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, “President Donald Trump continues to make bold promises about what that bill would do — promises that all available analysis suggests the bill will not keep”.While there are still chances that the Senate will amend the latest bill, its extent still remains unclear. Accordingly, uncertainty within the medical space is towering high. Investors are currently adopting a wait-and-see policy about this space.Let’s sneak a peek into the performance of five major Medical – Products companies within the broader Medical space expected on Jul 27.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report): We are upbeat about Align Technology’s execution of strategic initiatives like international expansion, which ensured Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. In this context, the company strengthened its foothold internationally by acquiring the Invisalign distributors in the highly lucrative Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region as well as Brazil in February. This is likely to drive the company’s results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Align is expected to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +2.74%. We note that, while a positive Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP.

Price and EPS Surprise Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. Quote Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): We believe, this medical device major’s second-quarter performance will be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. On the other hand, the company’s downbeat interventional cardiology business may get some sort of a boost with the company’s $435 million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA.Boston Scientific is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Hence, we are unable to conclude whether Boston Scientific is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Note that all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.  (Read More: Boston Scientific Q2 Earnings: What Awaits the Stock?)Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report): We believe, Cerner’s strong sales performance as well as its solid portfolio and strategic initiatives have positioned it well for stellar growth. Cerner announced that it has been chosen by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to develop an electronic health record (EHR) system. Department of Veterans Affairs will use the same system the company is developing for the U.S. Department of Defense, which began its operation at its first site in February. This system will facilitate the exchange of data between military care facilities and civilian health providers, where current and former service members receive care.This leading healthcare information technology (HCIT) company is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +1.75%. Hence it is expected to beat expectations this quarter.

Notably, this indicates a rise of 6.5%-9.4% on a year-over-year basis. We believe that the growing adoption of MAKO robots will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market. Additionally, Stryker is well poised on the acquisitions of both Sage and Physio-Control in the past.The company also expects to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell. This is because the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +0.66%. (Read More: Will Stryker Deliver a Beat this Earnings Season?)Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Stryker Corporation Quote McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report): This major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market expects to gain from a gradually stabilizing generic and branded market. The company’s distribution solutions segment performed favorably in fiscal 2017 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation.We are unable to conclude whether McKesson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. We need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.(Read More: McKesson Q1 Earnings: Stock Likely to Beat Estimates?)McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McKesson Corporation QuoteThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

300,SYK,"On Jun 11, we issued an updated research report on PetMedExpress, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company is striving to implement several strategies to revitalize its top line. These include increased focus on advertising efficiency to boost new order sales and shifting sales to higher margin items while also expanding the product line.After several quarters of drag in new order sales, we are impressed with PetMed’s improved performance through fiscal 2018. The entire year demonstrated a bullish momentum with new order sales growth of 8%, primarily on aggressive advertising. Although the company witnessed 5% softness in New Order sales during the fourth quarter, it is strategically increasing advertisements to handle the situation tactfully.Further, reorder sales grew 10.3% in the year. In the final quarter, driven by a change in product mix to higher priced items and augmented doses, average order size rose to $89 from $86 a year ago.PetMed is also working on improving its campaigns’ effectiveness. The company has been quite successful in pushing up its sales via the Internet. Approximately, 85% of the company’s orders was generated on the website during the fourth quarter compared with 83% in the year-ago period. Of late, the company has started focusing on advertising abilities to better new order sales and shifting sales to higher margin items including generics while expanding its product offerings. PetMed offers a wide range of products for dogs, cats and horses. We believe that with progress in economic conditions, PetMed's broad product portfolio will help drive growth in the coming quarters.However, with an aim to increase the recognition of its brand names, PetMed markets its products through national advertising campaigns. Under this procedure, the company has been incurring huge expenses related to advertising campaigns in the recent times. Hence, escalating advertising expenses exert pressure on the bottom line. Also, a tough competitive landscape is a major concern.Stock Performance Over the past three months, PetMed has underperformed its industry. The stock has declined 7.1% against the 6% growth of the industry.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include Abiomed, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report), Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).Abiomed has a long-term growth rate of 27%.

301,SYK,"Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, after market close. Based in North Kansas City, MO, the company provides healthcare information technology (HCIT) solutions worldwide. Cerner has a stellar four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.97%.Last quarter, Cerner reported adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents. Notably, earnings improved from 49 cents in the year-ago quarter. The company reported net revenues of $1.260 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.226 billion. Meanwhile, revenues rose from $1.138 billion in the year-ago period.Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Cerner is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Cerner is +1.75% as the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 58 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 57 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Cerner currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Cerner’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise this season.Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cerner Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderView Upbeat: We believe Cerner’s strong sales performance, solid portfolio and strategic initiatives have positioned it for stellar growth. For second-quarter 2017, the company forecasts revenues between $1.265 billion and $1.335 billion. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the band of 60 cents to 62 cents per share. For full-year 2017, management expects revenues between $5.100 billion and $5.300 billion. Cerner currently forecasts 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $2.44 and $2.56 per share.Development of Electronic Health Records System: Cerner announced that it has been chosen by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to develop an electronic health record (EHR) system. Department of Veterans Affairs will use the same system the company is developing for the U.S. Department of Defense, which began its operation at its first site in February.This system will facilitate the exchange of data between military care facilities and civilian health providers, where current and former service members receive care.Stable Estimate Revision Trend: For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is stable at 57 cents over the same time frame.Robust Portfolio: We believe that Cerner’s strong product portfolio will help boost its customer base. The frequent contract wins reflect growing traction. Furthermore, the company has strong growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory space.Solid Global Foothold: Cerner is one of the largest pure-play HCIT companies and its wide footprint, large reference-able client base and composite array of solutions make it an ideal candidate for investors seeking an exposure to the HCIT industry. Cerner offers an exposure to worldwide healthcare automation. Its international operations provide a more diversified revenue stream. In the past, the company has won contracts in the U.K. as well as in the Middle East. The company has also been working with client organizations globally, to a focus on its population health management profile.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

302,SYK,"We expect Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 27, after market close.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 26.87%. It is worth noting that Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 19.89%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Align Technology is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Align Technology has an Earnings ESP of +1.37% as the Most Accurate estimate is at 74 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 73 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Align Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Align Technology’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.37% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We are upbeat about Align Technology’s execution of strategic initiatives like international expansion, thereby ensuring Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. In this context, the company strengthened its foothold internationally by acquiring the Invisalign distributors in the highly lucrative Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region as well as Brazil in Feb 2017. This is likely to drive the company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter.In May, the company announced the receipt of two U.S. patents for Align’s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for Invisalign aligner treatment. Moreover, in a bid to gain traction in the Invisalign platform, Align collaborated with Digital Smile Design in March. Post-collaboration, Align’s Invisalign clear aligner treatment can be used by dentists during tooth alignment procedures along with Smile Design protocols.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteNotably, to expand its Invisalign brand offerings, Align Technology introduced a patient-friendly solution – Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement – for teens in March. According to the company, this advancement will help it offer more options for teen treatment which might boost its top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. Recently, the company expanded work flow options of its leading iTero scanners. In this context, Align collaborated with exocad GmbH in March, whereby the integrated portfolio will result in high-tech workflow solution for efficient scanning, design and manufacturing of in-house dental prosthesis. In February, the company had announced the addition of digital workflow for Nobel Biocare implants to its iTero intraoral scanner portfolio.Moreover, the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to likely continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Notably, for second-quarter 2017, the company projects earnings per share of 71−74 cents on revenues of $340–$345 million. The company also expects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 221,000 to 224,000, up 25–27% from a year ago.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansionOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

303,SYK,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Jul 25.Last quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16 cents, delivering a positive earnings surprise of 13.68%. It is worth noting that Quest Diagnostics outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters at an average of 5.15%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPosing a threat to Quest Diagnostics’ revenue per requisition performance, the last reported first-quarter 2017 saw a 20-basis points (bps) decrease in the same. Moreover, we remain apprehensive, as the company’s two Professional Lab Services (PLS) engagement, WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.This apart, unit price headwinds had  less than 100 bps in the first quarter. While unit price headwinds stayed in moderate ranges (at approximately 1%) over the last few years, the company continues to expect the same for 2017 too.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteAlso, over the last two years, Quest Diagnostics faced several reimbursement issues that affected its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). However, while reimbursement pressure has likely acted as an overhang on performance in the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects to beat the pressure through test and business mix.On a positive note, as observed in the reported first quarter of fiscal 2017, Quest Diagnostics seems to be determined to stimulate performance by adhering to its two-point growth strategy – Accelerate growth and Drive operational Excellence.We are also optimistic about the successful execution of the company’s strategy to grow its esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth.Also, in the recent past, Quest Diagnostics witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. We expect these growth drivers to remain active through the second quarter as well, driving the same metrics as in the preceding quarter.We believe all these recent developments will significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the second quarter.The company currently expects full-year 2017 revenues within the range of $7.64 billion to $7.72 billion (annualized growth of 2–3%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.69 billion, close to the low end of the company’s guided range. In addition, the company’s 2017 adjusted earnings per share have been forecasted between $5.45 and $5.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.56 is within this range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Quest Diagnostics has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.41 You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

304,SYK,"On Aug 22, we issued an updated research report on St. Paul, MN-based Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report). The company is a leading provider of water, hygiene and energy technologies and services. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Ecolab had an impressive run on the bourse over the last three months, trading above the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that Ecolab’s shares have gained 2.7%, comparing favorably with the industry’s 1.9% decline.Ecolab reported a stellar second quarter of fiscal 2017 result, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both counts. The upside came from new business gains, better pricing, product innovation and cost efficiencies. Overall adjusted quarterly net sales were $3.46 billion, up 4% from the year-ago period. This more than offset higher delivered product costs.For the third quarter of 2017, Ecolab projects adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.36–$1.44, compared with $1.28 a year ago.  Ecolab’s considerable earnings growth despite the challenging business environment instills confidence. Additionally, the company's large base of recurring revenues, industry-leading technologies and excellent field service are significant propellers for long-term growth.The company’s prospects in the Global Industrial and Global Institutional business segments are also bright. In the last reported quarter, sales at these segments both scaled 3%, on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, Ecolab boasts compelling fundamentals with revenues and adjusted earnings multiplying at a rate of 4.6% and 13.7%, over the last three years.However, on the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency and the impact of Venezuelan deconsolidation are expected to hurt earnings in the near term. Also escalating costs and expenses are weighing on its margins. Last month, a comparative study of Ecolab’s forward P/E (forward 12-month basis) multiple reflected that the stock has been quite overvalued.Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

Back in 2010, the orthopaedic devices giant bought Boston Scientific’s Neurovascular unit for $1.5 billion. That time, the rationale behind this divestment decision by Boston Scientific came as part of the company’s aggressive restructuring initiatives. More specifically, the neurovascular division, one of the company’s non-core businesses, was struggling with depressed sales.Rationale Behind Latest Rumored DealWhile Boston Scientific’s position on the prospects of the possible sell-off rumor is still unknown, some analysts believe that the reason behind the company’s contemplation over a probable sell-off might lie in its interest to gain a further competitive edge in the medical device space.It is important to note that post the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report)-St. Jude Medical over the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needed to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.If the merger gets to materialize finally, considering both Boston Scientific and Stryker’s present market cap, then the consolidated entity will have a combined market cap of more than $110 billion. According to Wells Fargo Securities, this is a position only behind Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson in terms of total device revenues.Reacting to this widely speculated buyout bid, retired Twin Cities med-tech stock analyst Thom Gunderson said that it  “makes perfect sense to me. Go big or go home is the rule of the day.""The analysts seem optimistic about the alleged deal and believe that if it finally works out, Boston Scientific will score a vantage point in the fast-growing competitive heart valve replacement market where it is currently trailing behind Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report) and Medtronic.Also, this merger is expected to reduce costs for the combined company at a time when the healthcare industry is already battling against severe pricing pressure.Share Price ComparisonOver the past year, shares of Boston Scientific have rallied 22.9%, ahead of Stryker’s 20.3% increase. While the broader sector remained much below with a 2.2% rise.Both Boston Scientific and Stryker currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

308,SYK,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3.Last quarter, this renowned healthcare products and service distributor delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.0%. Encouragingly, Henry Schein’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, at an average of 2.81%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayHenry Schein’s first-quarter 2017 results were quite impressive, recording growth across all four segments – Dental, Animal Health, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services. Geographically, the company gained traction in both North America and overseas markets. We expect a similar trend in the second quarter as well.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteNotably, during the to-be-reported second quarter, Henry Schein Animal Health opened a new National Distribution Service Center (NDSC) in Columbus’s Brookhollow neighbourhood. This has enabled the company to be a complete solutions provider for veterinary practices across the country. We expect this to boost the top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is also encouraging. In this regard, we note that management expects at least mid-single digit growth in North America’s dental equipment market in the second quarter. The company is currently banking on digital dentistry, which is part of its strategic plan. Henry Schein is thus busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s year-over-year deterioration in gross and operating margin over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.Meanwhile, per management, solid sales in the second quarter are likely to be partially offset by the timing of Good Friday this year. Notably, this international holiday has fallen in the second quarter this year as compared to last year’s timing which was in the first quarter.This apart, currency fluctuations and a tough competitive landscape add to our woes. Also, advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the U.S. adds to the competitiveness in the market.Overall, the company’s reaffirmed its 2017 EPS guidance, reflecting growth of 16–18% from the year-ago period.For the second quarter of 2017, there has been no change in estimate revision over the last 30 days. The same has been observed in the magnitude of estimate revision, with earnings estimates remaining at $1.73 over the same time frame.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Henry Schein this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.73. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Henry Schein’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

309,SYK,"Per a recent report by the Reuters, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) is likely to take over Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), creating a market value of more than $110 billion.If the deal materializes, the combined entity will have one of the MedTech’s broadest spectrums of product offerings that include cardiology, orthopaedics, surgical supplies and neuroscience. Yesterday, shares of Stryker have dropped 5.1% to close at $169.78. Boston Scientific’s shares have increased 7.4% to close at $34.32.How Likely is the Deal to Materialize?The chances of the deal are uncertain because there are no confirmatory statements or press releases from the company representatives.In fact, investors should never forget about Stryker’s highly-rumored acquisition plans of Smith & Nephew from 2015, which never materialized.On the brighter side, this is not the first time Stryker has been tied up with Boston Scientific. Stryker acquired Boston Scientific's neurovascular unit in 2010 for $1.5 billion, which indicates probability of a second collaboration now.However, reaching any particular conclusions at this moment might be a bit too early.Analysts’ OpinionThe Wall Street Journal claims this agreement to be “one of the largest in a year that is shaping up to be one of the busiest ever for mergers and acquisitions”.If the deal matures, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Lawrence expects it to outpace Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) in total device revenues.Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang focused on the need of increasing consolidation in healthcare to provide a comprehensive product portfolio to customers. Stryker’s supposed deal with Boston Scientific seems prudent in this regard.How Will Stryker Benefit?If the deal happens, Stryker will gain control of Boston Scientific's line of heart devices such as stents, defibrillators and Watchman device to prevent blood clots. Boston Scientific achieved clinical milestones for Ranger Drug Coated Balloon and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device.Further, the company will also leverage on Boston Scientific’s solid foothold in the underpenetrated emerging economies. The company also registered double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis in the emerging markets in the last reported quarter. If the deal materializes, Stryker might profit from Boston Scientific’s strength, especially in the BRIC nations.Stryker has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of the company have outperformed the industry over a year’s time. The stock has returned almost 20.2%, better than the industry's rise of 14.7%.  Stryker’s Acquisition Profile Shines BrightStryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to boost growth. Recently, the company acquired Entellus Medical, Inc in an all cash transaction for $24 per share or an equity value of approximately $662 million.Stryker also acquired VEXIM for €183 million. VEXIM specializes in the development and sale of vertebral compression fracture solutions for.In 2017, Stryker completed the acquisition of NOVADAQ for a net purchase price of $674 million. NOVADAQ is a leading developer of SPY fluorescence imaging technology that provides surgeons with visualization of blood flow and perfusion with more than250 clinical studies and array of specialties. The company's product portfolio is highly complementary to Stryker's visualization platform.‘Let’s Wait and Watch’If Stryker manages to acquire Boston Scientific, the Medical world will achieve a solid benchmark in terms of providing a comprehensive suite of MedTech solutions. This will reduce pricing pressure and competition. Further, the companies with a strong acquisition policy gain from rapidly-expanding large customer base, moderate leverage and enhanced cash flow.Meanwhile, the MedTech fraternity has been riding on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends, making it one of the most profitable investment arenas.Glancing at major acquisitions in the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s takeover of C. R. Bard for $24 billion and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Covidien for about $43 billion deserve a mention. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

311,SYK,"On Jun 4, we issued an updated research report on NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about the company’s flourishing international business, which holds immense opportunity. However, a highly competitive landscape is a concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.This leading global medical device company in the global spine market, focused on developing minimally-disruptive surgical products and procedurally-integrated solutions for the spine, has been outperforming its industry over the past month. The stock has gained 5.8% compared with the industry’s 4.5% rise.We are upbeat about NuVasive’s international business recording above 20% growth for the sixth consecutive quarter in the first quarter of 2018. The company saw strong sales growth across all geographies. Emerging markets also performed well, with strong growth in South Africa and Saudi Arabia. Asia Pacific grew in double-digits with strong results from Japan's reintroduction of XLIF. Further, NuVasive’s healthy cash balance should support its plans to pursue acquisitions and develop products.Meanwhile, the presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market intensely competitive. The orthopedic industry, in particular, is extremely competitive with the presence of bellwethers like Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), among others.Also, margin drag, pricing pressure and reimbursement issues continue to be other major headwinds.Key PickA better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

313,SYK,"Investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to selecting stocks. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company’s price performance is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. But betting on stocks depending totally on such a perception may not prove worthwhile.It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on revenues and not earnings, as top-line growth (or decline) usually reflects a company’s future earnings performance. Notably, in contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters.Also, a company can improve earnings by resorting to expense saving measures while maintaining stable revenues. However, superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth. Further, earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. But there are limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.A huge sales figure does not necessarily convert to profits. Hence, considering a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Kalamazoo, MI, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) is a medical technology company.

314,SYK,"McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), one of the largest healthcare service providers, is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 27.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $3.39 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04. Also, in the last four quarters, McKesson earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate at an average of 3.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that McKesson is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  McKesson has an Earnings ESP of +2.15% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.85 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $2.79. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: McKesson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of McKesson’s Zacks Rank #3 and +2.15% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. Management expects to gain from a gradually stabilizing generic and branded market. The company’s distribution solutions segment performed favorably in fiscal 2017 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. Also, McKesson expects earnings per share in the range of $11.75 to $12.45 for fiscal 2018. Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to increase mid-single digits year over year. Keeping in mind the last quarter performance and promising guidance, we expect a similar trend in the yet-to-be reported quarter.McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McKesson Corporation QuoteFurthermore, McKesson is likely to benefit from the acquisition of CoverMyMeds LLC in the quarter to be reported. In this regard, we note that the acquisition was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.In the international segment, management expects percentage revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in 2018.  Per management, international business is likely to be impacted by additional U.K. reimbursement cuts although the incremental cuts that will impact fiscal 2018 are significantly smaller than those in fiscal 2017.However, continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs, significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches might have an adverse impact on McKesson. Also, a competitive landscape adds to the woes.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

315,SYK,"Pharmacy benefit manager, Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, after market close. This St. Louis, MO-based company is the largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) in North America.Meanwhile, the company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by almost 0.8% in the last reported quarter. The stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters at an average of 0.3%.Express Scripts’ stock has underperformed the Zacks classified Medical Services industry in the last six months. Specifically, the stock lost 12.1% during this period compared to the industry's gain of 3.7%. Moreover, the current rate is way lower than the S&P 500's 8.8% over the same time frame. This indicates looming concerns ahead.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise  Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteLet’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the second-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlaySecond-Quarter Outlook: For the second quarter of 2017, Express Scripts expects total adjusted claims in the range of $343 million to $353 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter are estimated in the band of $1.70 to $1.74, representing growth of 8% to 11% on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, the company anticipates compounded annual EBITDA growth in the band of 2% to 4% from 2017 through 2020 for the core PBM business.Favorable Macroeconomic Scenario: We expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population in the U.S. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation. Thus, continued rise in the price of specialty drugs and increased regulatory burden has been driving demand for generics, a key catalyst for the company.Cutthroat Competition in Niche Space: On the flipside, Express Scripts faces intense competition in the PBM industry. The company faces competition from independent PBMs like MedImpact and Navitus Health Solutions. Moreover, the niche space is dominated by players like CVS, Aetna and Cigna, among others. We expect intensifying competition to mar second-quarter revenues.Estimate Revision Trend: Express Scripts’ estimate revision trend lacks luster at the moment. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. In fact, over the last three months, the current quarter estimates declined almost 1.2% to $1.71 per share.Probable Loss of Biggest Customer: Although it is too early to gauge the losses, Express Scripts is on the verge of losing its biggest customer – leading health insurer Anthem Inc. (ANTM). Following a series of legal conundrum, Anthem is no longer expected to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement withExpress Scripts, which is slated for expiration by 2019-end. Per management, Express Scripts might lose almost 50% of its revenues related to the Anthem contract by the second quarter itself.Earnings WhispersBuoyed by the above factors, our proven model does not conclusively show that Express Scripts is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Express Scripts is -0.59% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.70, while and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.71. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Express Scripts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

316,SYK,"Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Jul 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 89 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, adjusted earnings declined 18.3% on a year-over-year basis.Factors at PlayWe are particularly upbeat about Varian’s oncology business that accounted for around 95% of the company’s total revenue in second-quarter 2017. Notably, the company has been addressing both the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and has also been winning international contracts in the oncology space. For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Varian expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 92 cents–96 cents and revenues are expected to increase about 3% on a year-over-year basis.Further, strengthening its foothold in the oncology business, the company launched its FDA approved product Halcyon in May. Also, in June, the company signed an agreement with Vijametech and UPMC to establish radiation oncology centers in Vietnam.We are also upbeat about Varian’s prospects internationally where it primarily banks on proton therapy as an advanced treatment option for cancer patients. In this regard, we note that Varian Medical recently received Shonin approval in Japan to market the ProBeam system for proton therapy.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteThis apart, Varian Medical recently entered into two international agreements concerning its Proton therapy platform. Bangkok-based King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital has selected its ProBeam Compact single-room proton therapy system for cancer treatment in Thailand along with Delray Medical Center in Florida.We believe Western Europe, China and Africa present significant top-line growth opportunities in the near term. The company is opening new offices in Africa and the Middle East, which shows that it is aware of the opportunities in the region. Moreover, Varian’s strong product pipeline is a key catalyst.Nevertheless, increasing local competition is a primary headwind. Unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations and higher operating expenses pertaining to increased investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Varian Medical this quarter.

317,SYK,"Murray Hill, NJ-based CR Bard Inc.  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings, after market close on Jul 25.Last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $2.87, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22 cents. Also, the company’s earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.34%.Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of the company’s flagship Lutonix drug coated-balloon (DCB) will continue to be the key growth catalyst in the to-be-reported quarter. In this regard, Lutonix DCB is used to treat patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Within the Endovascular business, peripheral PTA line sales are solely driven by accelerating demand for the Lutonix DCB in the U.S. We expect to see this product to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in this quarter.Furthermore, the company's investments in emerging markets have strengthened its position internationally. We are also upbeat on the solid contribution from the company’s vascular product line. The urology and oncology segments are likely to drive second-quarter sales.On the flip side, a challenging Med-tech environment, especially in the hernia fixation and peripheral stent businesses raises concerns. The company continues to witness significant pricing pressure as well. Also, unfavorable foreign currency will continue to hurt top- and bottom-line growth.Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat either this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CR Bard is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $2.84.

318,SYK,"GNC Holdings, Inc. (GNC  -  Free Report), a specialty retailer of health and nutrition related products, is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 12.1%. However, GNC Holdings’ trailing four-quarter earnings average lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayGNC Holdings' last reported first-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) reflected a massive 46.4% year-over-year deterioration. Revenues in the quarter dropped 3.6% year over year. The dismal performance was primarily due to lower sales at the U.S. & Canada international and manufacturing/wholesale segments. Also, in the first quarter of 2017, gross margin and adjusted operating margin deteriorated. Hence, we expect a similar trend in the second quarter of 2017 as well.GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | GNC Holdings, Inc. QuoteMoreover, GNC Holdings has a number of tough competitors in the market that include large international pharmacy chains, major international supermarket firms and large U.S.-based companies with global operations. Thus, we expect the company to slash product prices in the face of stiff competition, which, in turn, may hurt margins.Also, currency headwinds continue to be a growing concern for GNC Holdings. Management also expects the failure to comply with FTC regulations and changing consumer preferences to hamper business.However, on the bright side, the performance of One New GNC was quite encouraging during the first quarter of 2017. Banking on it, we expect the company to continue to gain in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Meanwhile, the launch of the PRO Access program has added members to the company’s customer base, which is expected to drive growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for GNC Holdings this quarter.

319,SYK,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 14.63%. It is worth noting that Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.21%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayEdwards Lifesciences posted strong global sales in the last reported quarter, primarily buoyed by strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve(TAVR). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S., the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the second quarter of 2017 as well.In the TAVR space, Edwards Lifesciences reported highly encouraging European post-approval clinical trial results for its SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve in May 2017. The company also demonstrated successful results pertaining to its CENTERA valve for transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedures in the much awaited EuroPCR 2017 held in May.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteWe are also upbeat about the company’s initiative of strategic investment in research and development and receipt of regulatory approvals for those products. Moving on, the latest breakthrough achieved in its TAVR segment is the FDA approval for its SAPIEN 3 valve in early Jun 2017.Bullish on the company’s ongoing performance, management raised growth expectations to the high end of the projected full-year 2017 guidance for each segment.Moreover, we note that the company projected total sales between $810 million and $850 million and adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents to 92 cents for the second quarter.Apart from this, management completed the acquisition of Israel-based Valtech Cardio, a developer of Cardioband System for transcatheter repair of the mitral and tricuspid valves, toward the end of 2016. All these are expected to boost the top line in the quarter to be reported.On the flip side, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continues to challenge the company. We also believe that unfavorable foreign currency will affect the company’s gross margin in to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Edwards Lifesciences this quarter.

320,SYK,"On Jul 17, we issued an updated research report on Kalamazoo, MI-based Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), one of the largest medical device companies in the global orthopedic market. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company has a diversified product portfolio which cushions it against any significant sales shortfall during economic downturns. Stryker’s pipeline includes products for Hip, Knee and Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgeries. MAKO results in the last quarter were solid, with almost 18 global robot installations, of which 11 were in the U.S.Furthermore, the platforms of bone cement, sports-medicine, bones substitute, soft tissue repair, trauma and extremities, endoscopy and more fortify the company’s market position.Stryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to boost its growth profile. In June, the company announced a definitive agreement to acquire NOVADAQ Technologies Inc. for $11.75 per share, or $701 million with a net purchase price of $654 million. The transaction is structured as an arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by NOVADAQ’s shareholders. Additionally, the acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control added $245 million to the company’s net sales in the last quarter.Stryker has been focusing on international growth as well. In particular, the company’s Medsurg product line has witnessed strong demand in the European and Australian markets in the first quarter of 2017. On the flip side, China might prove to be a challenging market.Stryker’s strong guidance is also a catalyst. For the second quarter of 2017, the company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.48–$1.52 per share. For the full year, the company estimates adjusted earnings in the band of $6.35–$6.45. Stryker expects organic sales growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for full-year 2017.Over the last six months, the stock represented a strong return of 18.6%, higher than the Zacks classified Medical - Products sub-industry’s gain of 17.3%. The current level is also significantly higher than the S&P 500’s return of 8.9% over the same time frame.Other Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), CryoLife, Inc. (CRY  -  Free Report) and EDAP TMS SA (EDAP  -  Free Report). Notably, EDAP TMS sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences and CryoLife have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

321,SYK,"Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report), the MA-based medical instruments manufacturer, is expected to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of $2.08 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%. In fact, Thermo Fisher's earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?  Our proven model shows that Thermo Fisher is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.44%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Thermo Fisher currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.  The combination of Thermo Fisher’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident in looking for an earnings beat this time around. What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings? The company’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and strengthening of its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post solid results in the first quarter.The company has already spent $750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is expected through this year too. Some recently introduced noteworthy products include its new iCAP triple-quad mass spec system for clinical research in pharma Quality Assurance/ Quality Control (mass spectrometry and chromotography platforms); cloud-based application that connects electronic pipettes among individual users in the laboratories (within laboratory products); CarrierScan Assay, a microarray-based solution detecting over 6,000 genomic variations associated with 600 inherited diseases (within Genetic Sciences).It also introduced new targeted assays for cancer research that run on Ion Torrent Next-Generation Sequencing instruments; new tests for autoimmune disease and drugs of abuse; and new Clariom Pico assays for more effective biomarker discovery. Notably last month, the US FDA had granted a premarket approval for the company’s Oncomine Dx Target Test. We expect all innovations and product launches to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the second quarter itself.The company’s aim to expand capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific zone as well as emerging markets should also lead to impressive results. Standout contributors in recent times are China, India and South Korea. With strategic investments to support key customer applications, Thermo Fisher hopes to maintain this bullish momentum throughout the rest of 2017.Growth is likely to be seen in applied markets such as environmental and food safeties apart from life science. This apart, the company is currently betting on some key-focus areas with enormous opportunities. These are advancing precision medicine from mass spectrometry to targeted gene sequencing and structural biology. The acquisition of FEI has already started generating synergies and largely contributing to the company’s analytical instruments portfolio from last quarter. It is also the highlight of the quarter to be reported.Thermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal closure, with about $55 million of cost synergies and roughly $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies. This should get reflected in second-quarter 2017 performance.However, we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher citing a foreign exchange headwind to the tune of $250 million on 2017 revenues (an impact of 1.5%) and 17 cents on adjusted EPS (around 2%). Also, an unfavorable macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on Thermo Fisher’s stock. Plus, stiff competition continues to pose a threat to the stock’s value.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Dextera Surgical Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.

322,SYK,"A number of factors influence investment decisions, particularly when it comes to choosing stocks. While investors with a high-risk appetite looking for higher returns seek sophisticated and complex strategies, those with a low-risk appetite prefer conventional investment strategies based on solid fundamentals.Conventional strategies can be banked upon in bearish markets as well. We have picked one such strategy that is focused on the sales growth of a company.Sales Growth – A Key Financial IndicatorIn the current market scenario, characterized by changing customer preferences and habits, evolving needs, demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment, continued sales growth is crucial for the survival of any business. Companies are always looking out for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to boost sales.Sales are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business. It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases where companies incur a loss, albeit temporarily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. Hence, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be a suitable metric for stock valuation. It remains a key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to tamper with revenues as they can with earnings. Thus, the P/S ratio is subject to lesser manipulation than the Price-to-Earnings ratio. Sales growth alone, however, cannot ensure success. Consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more reliable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) operates as a play and entertainment company. This Pawtucket, RI-based company currently has long-term expected EPS growth rate of 11.7% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. American Airlines Group Inc.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SYK in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.52 per share for SYK, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SYK, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 0.66% heading into earnings season.

324,SYK,"St. Paul, MN-based Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report), a leading provider of water, hygiene and energy technologies and services, is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 80 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. Meanwhile, in the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average earnings miss of 0.70%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayEcolab’s earnings growth despite a challenging business environment raises investor’s confidence. Additionally, the company's large base of recurring revenues, industry-leading technologies and excellent field service are significant propellers. For the quarter under review, Ecolab projects adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.08 to $1.15, compared with $1.08 in the year-ago period.We are also upbeat about the acquisition of Abednego Environmental Services. Notably, the Abednego part of Ecolab’s Nalco Water business operations is expected to boost performance this quarter. Nalco is the worldwide leader in sustainability services and integrated water treatment solutions.For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is stable at $1.12 over the same time frame. Despite slightly unfavorable price trend, the stock has solid potential for appreciation with a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 13.25%.Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.Ecolab Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Ecolab Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ecolab Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point to an earnings beat this quarter for the stock.That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

325,SYK,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), a leading provider of tools and integrated systems for analysis of genetic variation and function, is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, Illumina’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters, at an average of 8.56%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the last reported first quarter of 2017, Illumina witnessed robust revenue growth on account of consistent improvement in sequencing consumables and strong demand of microarrays. While management is still emphasizing on its portfolio of sequencing platforms to fortify its market position, we expect the company to maintain top-line growth in the second quarter of 2017.Per management, top-line growth in the first quarter can also be attributed to strong uptake of the NovaSeq platform with more than 135 orders placed in this period.Moreover, with an active HiSeq customer base of roughly 800 customers, the company expects the replacement of older generation instruments by NovaSeq trend to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. QuoteFurther, the company recently launched VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe, a CE-IVD marked next-generation sequencing based approach to noninvasive prenatal testing. Notably, outside the U.S., the rate of NIPT adoption is increasing. The Netherlands and Denmark began covering the test in the first quarter and the same is expected shortly in France. The company continues to see positive reimbursement trends in Europe as well. Also, Illumina has been forging ahead with its NIPT expansion plans in China.We believe these developments will boost the company’s top line in the upcoming quarter.On the flip side, weak margins owing to the introduction of NovaSeq, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables will continue to act as deterrents for the company. Also, a tough competitive landscape may pose a challenge for the company. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding which Illumina has been facing for quite some time now.Overall, for the second quarter of 2017, Illumina projects revenue growth of approximately 7%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $642.5 million. The company expects adjusted EPS in the range of 65–70 cents. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is stable at 68 cents, within the guided range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Illumina is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Illumina has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 68 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Illumina’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.(TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

326,SYK,"Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), a leading player in the medical technology space, is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27 after the bell.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of $1.48 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Notably, on an average, Stryker beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by almost 2.08% over the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Stryker is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Stryker’s Earnings ESP is +0.66% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.52 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Stryker currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Stryker’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a beat.Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Stryker Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayFor the second quarter of 2017, Stryker expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.48–$1.52. Notably, this indicates a rise of 6.5% to 9.4% on a year-over-year basis. We believe that the growing adoption of MAKO robots will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market. Additionally, Stryker is well poised on the acquisitions of both Sage and Physio-Control in the past.For the full year, the company expects adjusted earnings in the band of $6.35 to $6.45. Stryker expects organic sales growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for full-year 2017. The tie-up with Indo UK Institute of Health’s Medicity Program is an important factor as well. Notably, this is a 20-year partnership that aims to offer primary joint replacements (orthopedic areas of hip, knee and trauma products) and healthcare services in India at low costs.The company’s estimate revision trend is encouraging. For the current quarter, Stryker saw two upward estimate movements with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month. Current quarter estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.51.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are three companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

327,SYK,"ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, after markets close on Aug 1.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.4%. The four-quarter average earnings beat is 1.0%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayManagement expects SG&A expenses margin in the band of 26%–27% in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, while it was 26.8% in third-quarter 2017. Also, R&D expenses margin is projected at 7% for fourth-quarter 2017 as compared to 6.8% of the preceding quarter.  Hence, we expect the bottom-line drag to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ResMed Inc. QuoteMeanwhile, the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from international markets. Notably, in the last reported quarter, currency impacted ResMed’s combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues by 3%. This is likely to dent results in the fourth quarter as well.Moreover, overall macroeconomic uncertainty is a major obstacle when it comes to the company’s international operations.Also, the market for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) products is highly competitive with respect to product price, features and reliability. Other challenges like competitive bidding and reimbursement pressure continue to hurt the stock.On the brighter side, an expanding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) market is a huge opportunity for ResMed. In line with this, the company released positive data pertaining to a clinical trial related to its Home Oxygen Therapy - Home Mechanical Ventilation (HOT-HMV). The results demonstrated that COPD patients who received non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at home with oxygen therapy had a 51% decreased risk of re-hospitalization or death, and stayed out of the hospital more than three times longer, compared to those who received oxygen alone. The company’s current endeavors to gain traction in the COPD market are expected to boost revenues.Further, as a major breakthrough in the treatment of sleep apnea, ResMed introduced AirTouch F20 full face mask with UltraSoft memory foam, which keeps patients on CPAP therapy comfortable throughout the night. AirTouch F20 is available in the U.S. and Canada now which is expected to drive the company’s top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.ResMed’s efforts to expand its business internationally are encouraging.The company’s revenue performance across all segments in the reported third quarter of 2017 was impressive. We expect the company to maintain a similar trend in this quarter.ResMed’s estimate revision trend is also encouraging. For the current year, the company saw one estimate move north with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month. This has taken the current year estimate from $2.79 to $2.80 over the same period.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for ResMed this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  ResMed has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

328,SYK,"We expect IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents, delivering a positive earnings surprise of 6.56%. It is worth noting that IDEXX has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters at an average of 13.60%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that IDEXX is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  IDEXX has an Earnings ESP of +1.19% as the Most Accurate estimate is 85 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at 84 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: IDEXX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of IDEXX’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.19% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?IDEXX achieved strong organic growth in the U.S. and international regions in the last reported first quarter of 2017, driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues, including double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base. The company expects this bullish trend to continue in the upcoming quarters as well.Overall, IDEXX raised its 2017 revenue outlook by $15 million to the range of $1,925--$1,950 million, reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 9.5% and 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is pegged at $1.92 billion, within the guided range.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteOn the bottom-line front, the company raised its EPS guidance to $2.95--$3.11 per share from the earlier range of $2.85–$3.01, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 21%--27% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at $3.05, which is within the guided range.We are upbeat about the company’s innovation-based global strategy that is leading to CAG Diagnostics growth. In June, IDEXX announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technology applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians.This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. The company has been significantly benefitting from the companion animal market of emerging nations demonstrating the bountiful opportunities. Further, management’s consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe, the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the second-quarter performance.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind for the company. Another concern is the company’s high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company’s sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, the company is exposed to higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion in the U.S. and internationally, and portfolio expansion.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX’s performance. This struggle to gain market share might also prove to be a drag on second-quarter 2017 results.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.(TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

For the current year, Baxter saw two upward estimate revisions with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month.However, lower cyclophosphamide sales pose a threat to the company’s Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise. For the second quarter, a decline in cyclophosphamide sales is expected to impact the top line by low single digits.
