3,APH,"Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25.In the trailing four quarters, the company delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 9.41%, beating estimates in each. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel.Notably, Amphenol’s top-line has also outpaced the consensus mark in the trailing four quarters. In the last quarter, revenues came in at $1.94 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79 billion and increased 17.6% from the year-ago quarter.Management anticipates first-quarter 2018 revenues between $1.78 billion and $1.82 billion, while adjusted earnings between 78 cents and 80 cents per share. Amphenol Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Amphenol Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Amphenol Corporation Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Military, Aerospace, Industrial Growth to ModerateAmphenol’s top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand, new product rollouts and market share gains. Demand continues to be strong in automotive, industrial and military markets.However, management expects sales in the military market to moderate from fourth-quarter level (up 11% year-over-year).Moreover, Amphenol remains encouraged by expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market. The company is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content in next-generation planes. These advanced electronic systems require new advanced technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for the company.Nevertheless, sales in the commercial aerospace market is expected moderate (low single digit growth against 11% in the fourth-quarter) as helicopter and business jet procurement volume stabilize and as commercial jetliner production continues to grow moderately.Further, the latest acquisition of Canada-based CTI Industries that manufactures high technology cable assemblies diversifies Ampehenol’s interconnect product portfolio, which will drive industrial market top-line growth. However, sales in the industrial market are also expected to moderate in the first quarter.Automotive Growth to ContinueAutomotive growth is anticipated to be sustained by a robust product portfolio. The company’s expanding range of interconnect sensor and antenna products are expected to drive sales.Further, the latest acquisition of China-based Sunpool, a provider of high technology antennas for the Chinese automotive market, solidifies the company’s market position.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Amphenol has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -0.06%, which indicates an unlikely positive surprise.

4,APH,"Reinforcing his protectionist agenda, President Donald Trump sought to levy new tariffs worth up to $60 billion on China, according to Reuters. Mainly Chinese apparel, technology and telecom goods are being subjected to this tariff. This month, Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% on aluminum imports. These tariffs are likely to push up costs and weigh on international sales of U.S. companies (read: 5 ETFs to Buy in March & Forget Trade War, Inflation Fears).The Trump administration is also reportedly mulling over “imposing investment restrictions on Chinese companies over and above the heightened national security restrictions.”Needless to say, trade war fears are rife at the moment. Already, the European Union (EU) has threatened the United States of a tit-for-tat tariff on a range of consumer, agricultural and steel products. Now China could be the next in line to levy a retaliatory tariff (read: Trade War Talks Heat Up: ETFs & Stocks in Focus).Naturally, companies that have extensive trade relations with China might face the brunt of a trade war. Technology chip suppliers selling products to manufacturers in China will also be dealt a heavy blow. In fact, Goldman Sachs compiled some companies with considerable revenue exposure to China.Let’s take a look at those companies and the related ETFs.  Likely Stock and ETF Losers Industrial Boeing China is a key market for Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report) where it serves as the largest exporter of America. Last September, the company said that it expects China to spend about $1.1 trillion over the next 20 years, purchasing more than 7,200 airplanes. The Chinese government has indicated that it might order Airbus in place of Boeing jets if the United States spoils its trade relation with China. Shares of Boeing fell 2.5% on Mar 14.Industrial ETFs like iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ITA, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) and Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) are highly invested in Boeing and could thus be hit hard.Technology Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS  -  Free Report)The company, which makes highly innovative analog semiconductors, has 85% revenue exposure to China, per Goldman, quoted on CNBC. The stock has moderate focus on ETFs like Global X Internet of Things Thematic ETF SNSR (around 6% weight) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) (around 3.8% weight).Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report)The leader in 3G, 4G and next-generation wireless technologies has 69$ revenue exposure to China and has exposure in ETFs like SOXX (about 6%).NVIDIA Corp NVDAThis semiconductor company is 56% related to China and is heavy on ETFs like Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic ETF BOTZ (about 9% focus) and SOXX (about 8% focus).Other tech and semiconductor companies include Intel Corporation INTC, Micron Technology Inc. (MU), Applied Materials Inc. AMAT, Lam Research LRCX, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report), which have sales exposure of 22% to 55%to China.Consumer Discretionary Wynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN  -  Free Report)This owner and operator of casino resorts has 64% exposure to China. The stock has around 5% focus on each of PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment PEJ and VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF BJK.Likely Stock & ETF Winners Small-Cap Retail & Technology Since Trump’s tariff plan will take consumer goods into consideration, small-cap apparel, footwear and toys companies are likely to benefit, which do not have much foreign exposure. PowerShares S&P SmallCap Consumer Discretionary Portfolio PSCD might gain in the days ahead.As far as small-cap apparel and shoe companies are concerned, the likes of Stage Stores Inc. SSI, Boot Barn Holdings Inc. BOOT and Xcel Brands Inc (XELB) may benefit from the import tariff.There is a small-cap technology ETF for investors, namely, PowerShares S&P SmallCap Information Technology Portfolio (PSCT  -  Free Report). As far as stocks are concerned, Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report) and Stoneridge Inc. (SRI  -  Free Report) are some of the companies one may consider.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?    Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

5,APH,"The world’s largest and the ultra-popular large cap ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, has been enjoying its strong asset accumulation on the completion of its 25th anniversary. This is because it has become the first ETF with $300 billion in AUM. Though SPY’s inception date is Jan 22, 1993, it officially debuted on the American Stock Exchange on Jan 29, 1993 (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).Inside The ETFSPY tracks the S&P 500 index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.62%. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration.About one-fourth of the portfolio is tilted toward the information technology sector, which has fully emerged from the burst of the dot-com bubble and is flying higher in the current bullish market. Moreover, financials, health care, consumer discretionary and industrials, each of which accounts for a double-digit exposure, are also performing remarkably well.The ETF charges 9 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of 71.6 million shares a day on average. This ensures higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Factors Driving SPYThe U.S. stock market is in the midst of the second-longest bull run in history. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals as well as better-than-expected corporate earnings are the major catalysts. This, coupled with Trump’s pro-growth agenda aimed at accelerating economic growth, reducing regulation, increasing spending, slashing taxes, and boosting jobs and corporate profits, are bolstering optimism in the economy.Since Trump’s win, the stock market rally has been the fourth largest since 1936, according to Goldman Sachs. Per Sam Stovall of CFRA Research, the S&P 500 rally during Trump’s first year is the third best since World War II, behind only President George H. W. Bush and President John F. Kennedy (read: Trump's First Year in Office: 5 Must-See ETF Charts).Further, a combination of other factors like rise in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat global economic data have bolstered the appetite for riskier assets in recent months. Good news flowing despite the global trade fears, political instability in Washington and geopolitical tension.As a result, SPY generated more than 545% returns over the past 25 years and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.

8,APH,"The earnings season has already started and the picture, so far, appears to be encouraging. Per the Earnings Preview dated Jan 19, nearly 53 of the S&P 500 members have reported their results. Out of these companies, approximately 81.1% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 75.5% surpassed top-line expectations.Notably, earnings for the 53 S&P 500 companies have advanced 11.7% from the same period last year, with revenues up 7.5%. Further, the report suggests that earnings for the total S&P 500 companies for the fourth quarter are projected to improve 10.3% year over year, with total revenues increasing 7.1%.Tech Stocks Continue to OutperformTechnology is one of the six sectors anticipated to report double-digit earnings growth. The other five are Oil/Energy, Basic Materials, Industrial Products, Construction and Autos. Various technology giants, including Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), are scheduled to report their numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 14.3% on 8.7% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year.

It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s See How LRCX, TEL, APH, XLNX and FFIV are PlacedSupplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.

9,APH,"Diversified electronics manufacturer Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 24. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, it delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 8.9%, beating estimates in each.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Factors in the QuarterAmphenol’s top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand, new product rollouts and market share gains. Demand continues to be strong in automotive, industrial and military markets. The diversification in end markets, with consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle has enabled the company to post solid results over the past few quarters. A sustained drive for geographic and market diversification has further helped Amphenol to expand its customer base and develop new applications.In addition, Amphenol remains encouraged by its expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market and is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content in next-generation planes. These advanced electronic systems require new advanced technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for the company.Moreover, Amphenol generates solid cash flow, which allows management the opportunity to invest in product innovations, acquisitions and business development. Also, it has historically returned significant cash through a combination of share repurchases and dividend to reward shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. A balanced organic and inorganic growth model, a lean and flexible cost structure, and an agile and entrepreneurial management team is likely to translate into relatively higher revenues in the quarter.Amphenol also has bullish revenue and earnings expectations. The ongoing revolution in electronics has enabled the company to capitalize on the opportunities and strengthen its position in the market. It further expects to leverage on the solid growth potential of the acquired companies to drive robust performance in the future.For 2017, Amphenol expects sales in the range of $6,828 million to $6,868 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 9%. The company estimates adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.19 to $3.21, an increase of 17-18% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1,788 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model conclusively shows that Amphenol is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.44% with the former pegged at 82 cents and the latter at 81 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Amphenol Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Amphenol Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Amphenol Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Amphenol has a Zacks Rank #2. This increases the predictive power of ESP and makes us confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.82% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

10,APH,"With earnings season in full swing, this is a good screen to use both before and after a company reports.Like any earnings season, we're going to see both positive surprises and negative surprises.This screen however focuses on more than just earnings surprises, but instead goes over the importance of both earnings surprises and sales surprises, and why as an investor you should care so much about them.As you know, if a company reports earnings above expectations, that's a positive surprise, and the price in general should go up.If the company reports earnings below expectations, that's a negative surprise, and the price in general should go down.But a surprise is more than just a snapshot of an extra few dollars and cents a company made or lost in that one period. Instead, it's a glimpse into what a company's earnings could be, or should be, in the future.And when these surprises occur, the market tries to quickly re-price that stock to reflect these changes.Not All Surprises Are Created EqualSome earnings surprises are due to revenue increases, and other earnings surprises are due to cost cutting measures.Top line growth (or sales growth) usually produces the biggest price reaction over cost-cutting, because an increase in sales is generally thought of as more sustainable. Once you've cut costs, where’s the future growth going to come from? You can only cut costs so much. You need sales to drive long term growth.There's also guidance. What the company sees down the road is important.If you've got a positive surprise on one hand, but then downward guidance on the other, that'll usually produce a negative reaction. Why? Because they've taken away the hope generated from the surprise by saying the future outlook will likely be weaker than expected.There's also the idea that some surprises aren't really surprises -- either because a company has a history of continuously beating their estimates or the stock has already priced in a 'surprise' by running up or going down prior to the announcement; therefore, the 'surprise' in that direction really wasn't a surprise at all. That's where you'll sometimes see an opposite reaction to an earnings surprise - a ""buy the rumor sell the fact"" type event.But while predicting which companies will surprise or not can be difficult, the benefit of an earnings surprise will typically last for one to three months after a surprise is reported.So you can get in after a company reports a surprise, or you can try and find companies that are more likely to report a surprise, and get in ahead of time.Screening ParametersThe screen I'm running today starts off with:• Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 5%(Stocks posting positive surprises have a tendency of surprising again.)• Last Sales Surprise greater than or equal to 5%(A positive sales surprise shows top line strength. And once again, a company that has surprised in the past is more likely to surprise again in the future.)• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2(Only Zacks Rank 1 and 2 Strong Buys and Buys can get thru.)• Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000Just these few criteria narrows down the universe from over 8,800 stocks to just over 20.Here are 5 stocks that meet this criteria:(APH  -  Free Report) Amphenol(reports on 1/24)(CATY  -  Free Report) Cathay General Bancorp(reports on 1/30)(WRB  -  Free Report) W.R. Berkley Corp.(reports on 1/30)(MOD  -  Free Report) Modine Manufacturing(reports on 2/5)(ALL  -  Free Report) Allstate(reports on 2/7)All of these companies reported both earnings surprises and sales surprises their last time out.

13,APH,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has partnered with HomeLab to create a healthy home environment. The partnership will leverage Philips Air Purifier tool along with professional grade AeraSense technology to automatically monitor, react, as well as purify indoor air, capturing 99.97% of particles. In fact, incorporating Philips Air Purifier into HomeLab’s Healthy Home Program will make it easier to track and control air quality in home, facilitating healthier homes.Combining HEPA and VOC purifier with a professional grade PM2.5 monitor, the Philips 2000i Smart Air Purifier tracks pollution trends as well as decrease allergens simultaneously. The active carbon filter aids in trapping toxic gases (VOCs), while the HEPA filter traps minute particles as small as 0.3 microns, including dust mites, pet dander, pollen and mold.Philips Air Purifier’s unique numerical index, connected app and corresponding color ring, alerts users even if there is a minor change in indoor air conditions, supporting HomeLab’s analysis. The collaboration will enable users to visualize allergen levels with the color coded ring and watch air improvement simultaneously as the purifier is set to work. It will also allow users to control the device from smart phones as well as view both indoor as well as outdoor pollution.Our TakeIn the past couple of years, Philips has successfully morphed from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider. However, the company’s near-term profitability is likely to be hurt by sluggish growth prospects of the healthcare market on a global scale. In light of uncertainties like slowing government spending and events surrounding the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) legislation, the company expects the United States to witness low-single digit growth in the healthcare industry.Moreover, country-specific risks for China like anti-corruption initiatives, slow GDP growth and centralized tendering are likely to dampen the prospects of the healthcare industry, thwarting growth. Also, in the HealthTech Other vertical, the company anticipates incurring approximately EUR 80 million of net cost, higher than previous guidance. These costs are likely to negatively impact margins in the quarters ahead. Not surprisingly, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has returned 6.1% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 9%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Analog Devices, Inc.

14,APH,"Investors seem to be optimistic about TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) recent earnings beat streak, as the company’s earnings have trumped estimates in each of the four trailing quarters.This has been an impressive year for the company. We expect this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to retain this bullish momentum going forward, driven by rise in global auto production, continued progress on strategic priorities and solid execution. As investors continue to seek both growth and value in the market, infrastructure stocks which are priced fairly relative to earnings, might witness soaring share prices in 2018 as well.Investors also seem to think the same, as they have favored this stock in recent times. The company has outperformed the industry quarter to date, having appreciated 14.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 9.7%. TE Connectivity recently reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein it reported its eighth consecutive earnings beat, buoyed by encouraging industry trends and solid operational execution. Its adjusted operating margins expanded 110 basis points to 16.8%, with contribution from all three segments, highlighting robust operational execution. The company is enjoying sturdy momentum in emerging markets in Asia, which were up 16% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, outstripping the solid growth of the more mature American and European markets, which rose 9%.The company actually recorded 9% revenue growth and 8% organic growth in fiscal 2017, which, according to CEO Terrence Curtin, is best-in-class, compared with its industrial technology peers. The transportation segment registered 11% growth in the year, much ahead of the global oil production growth of 3%, reflecting consistent outperformance due to content growth trends as well as robust global position.In terms of guidance, the company is optimistic about 2018 being another strong year. It expects 6% top-line growth, of which 4% would likely be organic. The company also expects double-digit growth in adjusted earnings.SubCom, the deep sea cable component of TE Connectivity’s business, which has been weak this year, is anticipated to rebound to a strong fiscal 2018. Further, several new projects are in the pipeline for the coming fiscal, including a trans-Pacific Asian-U.S. cable. In addition, the company expects to address a project backlog worth a whopping $1 billion in the next fiscal.Of late, TE Connectivity’s transportation business has been displaying remarkable signs of progress. Growth in electronic content and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for the company’s transportation business in fiscal 2018.The consensus analyst community’s optimism toward the stock is reflected in its upward earnings estimate revisions. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings being revised upward to $5.02 from $5.27 over the past 60 days, and reflects bullish analyst sentiment.TE Connectivity Ltd.

15,APH,"3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) continues to struggle with the headwinds that have marred its performance over the past few quarters. We anticipate that a continuous rise in operating expenses, among other factors, will continue to hinder growth for the company. Moreover, in light of its miserable third-quarter 2017 results and uncertain operating environment, the company’s management withdrew full-year 2017 guidance.It’s not surprising that the stock has also put up a dismal show in recent times. In the past three months, 3D Systems has lost 30.5% against the industry’s growth of 9%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has moved south over a couple of months from 44 cents to a loss of 4 cents. This indicates exceedingly bearish analyst sentiment, reflected by five downward estimate revisions versus none upward.Read on to find the major factors curbing the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s growth and why it may be prudent to avoid the stock at the moment.Factors at Play3D Systems had commenced significant transformational work in solving legacy issues in the third quarter, which partly led to the company withdrawing guidance for 2017. The company cited that it is unable to predict earnings and sales numbers accurately. This action has unnerved investors badly, as it indicates a highly uncertain environment.During the third quarter, revenues from 3D printing products and services were significantly undermined due to continued challenging market conditions that adversely impacted customers' capital investment cycles and reduced demand across most geography. Further, its performance in Americas and Asia Pacific was very weak. If these problems persist, 3D Systems’ earnings will likely continue to be under pressure, going forward as well.Also, the company continues to incur high research & development (R&D) and acquisition costs. Going forward, the company believes investment in IT and go-to-market initiatives will result in higher expenses, consequently restricting near-term operating income growth. During third quarter, the company had legal expenses from a Department of Commerce investigation, which inflated costs. We expect margin contraction and higher operating expenses in the upcoming quarters as 3D Systems attempts to implement organizational changes.Moreover, over the past few quarters, the company has been experiencing unfavourablebroader market conditions that have badly hit its financial performance. Macroeconomic factors such as economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations, commodity prices and credit availability have negatively impacted performance. This apart, the company’s business faces the adverse effects of rapid technological changes, alterations in user and customer requirements and preferences, consequently adding to challenges.Thus, considering the risks that the company faces, we believe it would be prudent for investors to avoid the stock for now.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Axcelis Technologies, Inc.

21,APH,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) reported modest third-quarter 2017 results, driven by robust sales growth particularly in China and in its Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses. The company also reiterated its full-year 2017 guidance.The company posted third-quarter net income of €423 million ($497 million), an increase of 10.4% compared with the prior-year quarter’s figure of €383 million. Increase of income from continuing operations drove the year-over-year improvement in operating income.Inside the HeadlinesTotal sales in the quarter came in at €4,148 million ($4,875 million), relatively flat (inching down 0.2%) from the year-ago tally. The year-over-year decline can primarily be attributed to fall in sales of Personal Health businesses and HealthTech Other segment, partially mitigated by impressive performances from Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses and Diagnosis & Treatment businesses.Philips’ adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) – the company’s preferred measure of operational performance – rose 12.2% year over year to €532 million ($625.1 million), benefiting from higher volumes, procurement savings as well as cost productivity.Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Koninklijke Philips N.V. QuoteMeanwhile, net cash provided by operating activities came in at €295 million ($346.6 million) compared with year-ago quarter figure €259 million. The company’s comparable order intake rose 5% year over year, driven by strong growth in Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses.Segmental RevenuesDuring the reported quarter, Personal Health sales fell 0.8% year over year to €1,650 million ($1,938.8 million). This segment reported a 1% decline in nominal sales and a 5% hike in comparable sales. The upside in comparable sales came on the back of high-single digit growth in Health & Wellness as well as Sleep & Respiratory Care, while Domestic Appliances recorded growth in mid-single-digit. On a geographic basis, double-digit growth in Middle East & Turkey and India, high-single digit growth in China, bolstered revenues in the quarter.Diagnosis & Treatment revenues rose 0.2% in the quarter to €1,638 million ($1,924.7 million). While nominal sales were flat, comparable sales grew 2% for the quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in Image-Guided Therapy and low-single-digit growth in Ultrasound and Diagnostic Imaging drove this segment’s sales. On a geographic basis, double-digit growth in China, Latin America and India acted as catalysts.Connected Care & Health Informatics revenues inched up 1.2% in the quarter to €751 million ($882.5 million). On a nominal basis, segmental revenues climbed 1% year over year and comparable sales grew 8% for the quarter. Sales improvement was primarily driven by double-digit growth in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions as well as mid-single digit growth in Healthcare Informatics.On a geographic basis, while growth geographies witnessed mid-single-digit growth, mature geographies posted a low-single-digit decline. Double-digit growth in China, Middle East & Turkey and Latin acted as catalysts.Revenues in the HealthTech & Other segment continued to show weakness, shrinking 7.7% to €108 million ($127 million). The decline in this segment can mainly be attributed to higher restructuring charges incurred during the quarter.With effect from this quarter, Philips is reporting results of Philips Lighting under discontinued operations.Liquidity & Share RepurchaseExiting the quarter on Sep 30, 2017, Philips’ cash and cash equivalents rose to €999 million ($1,180.2 million) from €1,859 million a year back. The company’s long-term debt fell to €4,441 million ($5,246.2 million) compared with €4,860 million a year ago.Diligent Cost-Savings ProgramsPhilips has been gaining significantly from its DfX program, along with other productivity and savings programs. These programs have been designed to maximize the value potential of the company, while accelerating growth by leveraging on innovation and operational execution.Thanks to these initiatives, in the reported quarter, the company achieved procurement savings of €77 million, powered by the DfX program, while other productivity programs also resulted in a savings of €69 million. The company now is well on track to generate an impressive annual savings of €400 million.Notable Developments During the QuarterThe quarter was marked by a string of acquisitions which the company had identified over the past two years. Philips announced the acquisition of Health & Parenting to strengthen its offerings in pregnancy and parenting. Health & Parenting is a London-based developer of healthcare and family-related mobile applications for expectant and new parents.The company also inked an agreement to buy image-analysis software provider, TomTec Imaging Systems GmbH. This acquisition is likely to enhance the former’s image-guided therapy portfolio.Further, earlier this month, the company obtained the 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing its new eL18-4 transducer for ‘small parts’ assessment. The company is anticipated to launch the newest solution at the 16th World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (“WFUMB”) Congress in Taipei.Update on Lighting DealAt the end of the third-quarter 2017, Philips holds 41.27% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Philips Lighting shares. Philips aims to sale the business completely over the next few years.GuidanceBased on the present market scenario and accounting for the macroeconomic headwinds, Philips continues to project full-year sales growth of 4-6%. The company also anticipates its Adjusted EBITA margin to improve around 100 basis points this year.Our TakeIn the past couple of years, Philips has successfully evolved from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider. Moreover, the company's transformation from a hardware-oriented to a software-driven business, with a higher-margin and recurring-revenue model, bodes well for investors. The company also believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will drive future growth.Further, the company is highly optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis & Treatment vertical on account of positive industry trends, with the Image-Guided Therapy and Ultrasound equipment segments acting as major profit churners. This apart, the company’s Connected Care & Health Informatics vertical is progressing well, and is experiencing strength in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions.Though, healthcare markets hold solid prospects in the long run, lackluster performance in key end markets, including the Western Europe and North America are thwarting the growth momentum of the Dutch multinational. Also, higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges are proving to be a drag on the company’s financials.Philips currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering in the same space include Applied Materials, Inc.

Notably, strategic sensor-business buyouts from Meggitt PLC (June 2017), Intelligente Sensorsysteme acquisition (June 2017) and Telect Incorporated buyout (July 2017) are anticipated to bolster the company’s revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, solid mobile devices, commercial air market and automotive market sales are projected to aid the company’s revenue growth trajectory, going forward.Amphenol Corporation anticipates to report revenues in the range of $1.70-$1.74 billion in third-quarter 2017 (estimating an year-over-year increment of 4-6%).Furthermore, elevated revenues, a lean and highly flexible cost structure, and greater operational efficacy are estimated to drive the company’s bottom-line performance in the quarters. Notably, Amphenol Corporation projects to report earnings in the range of 77-79 cents per share in the third quarter.However, Amphenol Corporation believes lower military market sales, and slightly lower IT and data communications sales might hurt the company’s top-line results.We believe rising average debt levels, if not checked, might further escalate the company’s interest expense going forward. In addition, sudden input price inflation, unfavorable foreign currency translation impact or any supply chain challenge might dent the company’s near-term results.Amphenol Corporation currently carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) is predicted to be up 10.2% in the next three to five years. Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock is currently pegged at 79 cents per share for third-quarter 2017.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks within the industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Applied Materials, Inc.

23,APH,"Technology and manufacturing giant, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 20. In the quarter to be reported, the company anticipates weak revenues in Aerospace Business, which constitutes the major portion of total revenues.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.80, reflecting a beat of 1.7%. Overall, Honeywell pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 2.1% over the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to Consider In a bid to better positioned itself to leverage the shared business models and maximize share-owner value through focused strategic decision making, Honeywell has reorganized operating segments. However, the company’s proactive restructuring initiatives are yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets.Particularly, Honeywell’s revenues for its Aerospace’s defense and space-related products and services remain vulnerable to changes in the U.S. government’s defense and aerospace funding. Further, the high research and development costs could also be a drag on this segment margin and affect its profitability in the upcoming quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Aerospace segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains low at $3,535 million compared with second-quarter revenues of $3,674 million. Revenues from Materials and Technologies segment are also anticipated to be low with estimate of $2,194 million compared with reported revenues of $2,239 million in the prior quarter.Moreover, Honeywell remains susceptible to material price inflation, which in turn is expected to affect its operating profit and bottom-line growth for the third quarter. Further, high dependency on supply chain to scale production and adjusting delivery of long lead-time products during times of volatile demand remains matters of concern. High operating risks in one of the key ingredients of its business might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.However, Honeywell’s balanced mix of long and short-cycle businesses, along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augur well for the company. Additionally, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products. It has regularly fine-tuned portfolio, having sold about 60 of its units (accounting for $7 billion in sales) since 2002 and acquiring another 90 companies contributing $14 billion in revenues over the same period. These factors bode well for the company’s quarterly numbers and are anticipated to offset some of the risks it faces.Furthermore, infrastructure investments and increasing gas consumption in high growth regions like India and China are expected to drive demand for the company’s acquired business Elster’s gas heating assets, strengthening its existing gas combustion portfolio. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Honeywell this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

24,APH,"Germany-based enterprise application software, SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.03, reflecting a beat of 1%. Overall, SAP has a modest earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 2.2% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlaySAP is poised to grow on the back of resilient Cloud and Software business, a strong business network spread over critical client demand areas, superior customer management along with growth of S/4HANA and other Cloud initiatives.Over the past few quarters, the company has recorded spectacular growth in S/4HANA and other Cloud initiatives, which in turn, has provided a boost to financials. During second-quarter 2017, the company gained 500 customers, of which 30% is entirely new. The company anticipates demand for S/4 HANA to surge, which will prove conducive to operating profit and bottom-line growth in the to-be reported quarter.SAP’s renewed focus on strengthening IoT foothold is also expected to boost the top line in the quarter under review, as it has resulted in significant client wins. With business enterprises leveraging state-of-the-art technology to outshine peers, we believe that SAP’s market leading portfolio will continue to witness increased demand, thus supplementing its financials.Moreover, SAP has been focusing on expanding cloud business to become one of the leading players in the category. The company has a competitive edge over its cloud competitors as its processes are designed to be industry-specific and can be customized to meet corresponding business requirements. Further, solid adoption of the company’s human capital management (‘HCM’) applications, led by SuccessFactors Employee Central, is expected to drive the results in the upcoming quarter.However, the fact remains that dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters, along with flat customer spending projections are adversely affecting SAP’s performances. This apart, over the past few quarters, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances and general economic slowdowns, which adversely impacted purchasing power. Moreover, sluggishness in China might dent the IT spending in the country, which might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.Furthermore, the IT services industry is characterized by stiff competition from technology behemoths, which in turn may also dampen the third-quarter financials. This apart, currency fluctuations in many of its key markets are also likely to thwart sales for the upcoming results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for SAP this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.14.

26,APH,"Shares of diversified electronics manufacturer Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $86.59 during Friday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $86.58 for a healthy year-to-date return of 28.7%. Barring minor hiccups, Amphenol’s share price has steadily been on an uptrend since early July. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.2%.Growth DriversAmphenol’s top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand, new product rollouts and market share gains. Demand continues to be strong in automotive, industrial and military markets. The diversification in end markets, with consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle has enabled the company to post solid performance over the past few quarters. A sustained drive for geographic and market diversification has further helped Amphenol to expand its customer base and develop new applications.In addition, Amphenol remains encouraged by its expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market and is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content in next-generation planes. These advanced electronic systems also require new higher technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for the company.Despite the uncertainties prevailing in the global economy, Amphenol has bullish revenue and earnings expectations. The ongoing revolution in electronics enables the company to capitalize on the opportunities and strengthen its position in the market.

This represents a healthy improvement from the prior guidance of $6.41 billion to $6.53 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $2.91 to $2.97 per share.Such a bullish outlook with continued growth impetus and core focus perhaps boosted investors’ confidence and catapulted its share price to a new 52-week high.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the same space are AMETEK, Inc.

28,APH,"Traditionally, October is the most volatile month for the broader market. The daily percentage change in the month is 1.44% compared with 1.08% for the other months. Historically, the period between the end of April and the end of October, had been the worst “six months” for the Dow and the S&P 500, while the period between June-end and October-end is considered the worst for the Nasdaq.This bearish trend, however, hasn’t played out so far this year. All the major indices continued to scale record highs on improved corporate earnings, the chugging along of the U.S. economy and the rise in oil prices after the decline in the first half of the year. Oil prices moved north after major producers said that the global market was on its way toward tallying international demand-and-supply levels.Hopes that President Trump is making strides with his new tax plans also overshadowed a slew of negative developments including catastrophic hurricanes, threats of war from North Korea and cyber breach at credit bureau Equifax.Given such positives, the month of October is not likely to put an end to the bull market. Equities, moreover, have a reputation of maintaining gains as the fourth quarter is usually the strongest. This calls for investing in some rock-solid stocks this month for better gains.Corporate Earnings EncourageTotal Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are up 11.1% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues. This marked the second straight quarter of double-digit growth. Earnings growth is also expected to turn positive in Q3. Total Q3 earnings are poised to be up 3.2% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues.For the full year, total earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be up 7.4% on 4.6% higher revenues, which would follow 0.7% earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in 2016 (read more: Start of the Q3 Earnings Season).Economic Recovery SolidMeanwhile, the U.S. GDP expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment drove the upside.Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter. Consumer spending – the biggest driver of the economy – picked up on higher income for consumers and low inflation.Trump’s Tax Policy ProposalsTrump has urged Congress to move fast with the lowering of corporate taxes and had recently held a bipartisan group of House members at the White House to discuss a tax deal. He has been working on a major tax overhaul in more than three decades. Ever since 1986, the tax code hasn’t been restructured, when President Ronald Reagan along with a divided Congress broadened the tax base and slashed marginal tax rates.Trump proposed a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that would boost the U.S. economy and drive corporate profits. Such a tax cut included trimming of the business tax rate to 20% from 35%. Low corporate tax will benefit businesses of all sizes, as most of them will see the improvement in their bottom lines.5 Top-Performing Stocks for OctoberOctober may be a rocky month for the stock market. But, as mentioned above, there are positives that may propel the broader markets. We have, thus, selected five stocks that have not only gained, traditionally during the rough trading month of October but also flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

29,APH,"Premium global e-commerce solutions provider, Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report)) has been disappointing investors of late. The company continues to grapple with rise in total costs, along with a drab revenue performance. Let us delve deeper and try to find out why it would be wise to dump the stock from your portfolio at the moment.Disappointing Fiscal Second Quarter 2017Pitney Bowes reported adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share in second-quarter fiscal 2017, down 15.4% year over year. Performance in two of the company’s three segments, namely, Small and Medium Business (“SMB”) and Enterprise Business Solutions (“EBS”), declined year over year, proving a drag on top-line performance.During second-quarter 2017, SMB Solutions revenues dipped 3% year over year to $436.4 million. The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business (down 1%) and International Mailing Business (down 11%).This segment continues to suffer from lower recurring revenue streams and rental revenues. Additionally, a waning recurring revenues trajectory and poor equipment sales are making matters worse.EBS revenues declined 4% year over year to $204.0 million. While Presort Services (up 2%) drove top-line growth of this segment, it was more than offset by the drab performance of the production mail business (down 11%). Uncertain global economic environment is anticipated to impact production mail and software businesses in the near term, consequently limiting the company’s growth momentum.Decline in Software SalesThough the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company adopted multiple measures to broaden the base of its business and boost profits at the software segment, fluctuations in license revenues remains as a major headwind. In general, licensed software businesses are always susceptible to swings based on large transactions. Given the scale of Pitney Bowes’ business, it remains vulnerable to those swings.Over the last three months, PBI’s shares dropped 11.6%, wider than the industry’s average loss of 3.9%.Moreover, the company’s current focus to drive growth by penetrating into new areas has put the margin performance under pressure in the short run.Escalating CostsPitney Bowes has been experiencing a surge in operating expenses on account of ERP implementation in the United States and higher marketing expenses in relation to aggressive advertising as well as marketing strategies for strengthening brand value. The company expects marketing expense to be up on a year-over-year basis.In addition, it expects incremental marketing expense in the ERP program, related to digital capabilities enhancement, for entire 2017. Also, capital expenses associated with the ERP project remains a drag. Till the benefits of ERP materialize, the company is anticipated to incur higher capital expenses that might exert pressure on margins.The array of problems are limiting the company’s growth momentum, consequently putting Pitney Bowes’ investors in bumpier ride.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Apptio Inc. (APTI  -  Free Report), AMTEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) and Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

31,APH,"Last month, TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) came up with its third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein it came up with its seventh consecutive earnings beat. Buoyed by positive industry trends and solid operational execution, the company raised its 2017 bottom-line guidance third time in a row.Let’s take a better look at the long-term growth drivers of the company.Overarching Business ModelThe company’s long-term growth strategy rests on three pillars — drive above market expansion through focus on harsh environment applications, leverage on “TEOA continuous improvement” system to expand margin and execute a balanced capital allocation strategy. Overall, strong demand in end markets, along with its overarching business model, helped TE Connectivity improve organic sales by 8% and adjusted EPS by 15%.Solid Harsh Application BusinessTE Connectivity is the market leader in the connectivity and sensor business, armed with a comprehensive portfolio. About 80% of TE Connectivity’s revenues are driven by harsh environment applications. Over the past five years, the company’s harsh business applications have experienced mid-single digit growth, driving top-line growth.Going forward, the company believes that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion. Also, it might help fend competition from key players including Hubbell Incorporated (HUBB  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report).Positive Industry TrendsOf late, TE Connectivity’s transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress, adding to its strength. Growth in electronic content and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for the company’s transportation business. For fiscal 2017, the company expects high-single-digit organic rise in auto on approximately 3% production growth.Commercial Transportation business has been faring well, driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market, especially in China, content growth due to the adoption of new emission standards and regulations. Also, healthy demand from Europe and North America are expected to supplement growth. TE Connectivity continues to expect mid-single-digit increase for the full year in sensors business.The other businesses of the company, namely Industrial and Communications Solutions are also faring well and TE Connectivity believes that they have ample room for growth, going forward. The company has affirmed that much of its operating margin expansion in the past few years have been driven by the transportation segment.
