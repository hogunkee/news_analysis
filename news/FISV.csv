4,FISV,"ServiceNow (NOW) has become one of the fastest-growing companies in technology by automating key activities, tasks and processes that make up day-to-day work life.
"

6,FISV,"""In our personal lives, we have all of these apps that can help get and manage information and customize what we need and want. Think of this as an app for your work,"" said a ServiceNow spokeswoman.
"
7,FISV,"A growing number of customers want in on ServiceNow's workflow cloud solutions. Since the company went public in 2012, revenue has grown at a compounded annual rate of 75%.
"
8,FISV,"A Billion-Dollar Year?
"
9,FISV,"In 2014, revenue jumped 61% to $682.6 million. Management expects revenue of $960 million to $1 billion this year, an increase of 41% to 47% over 2014.
"
10,FISV,"""Very few companies are growing 40%-plus on a $1 billion revenue base,"" said Kirk Materne, an analyst with Evercore ISI.
"
11,FISV,"Most of its revenue is subscription-based. ServiceNow doesn't record all revenue upfront but over the billing cycle of a contract, which is typically one or three years. But it recognizes expenses upfront. That and the revenue lag creates a ""mismatch,"" says Rob Owens, analyst with Pacific Crest Securities.
"
12,FISV,"Earnings, he said, are a ""lagging indicator,"" while cash flow and billings are more ""leading indicators.""
"
13,FISV,"Backlog and deferred revenue combined at year end totaled $1.4 billion, up 57% from the prior year.
"
14,FISV,"The company has seen 50%-plus growth in billings for some time, says Owens. ""But cash flow is just starting to move from negative to positive, as is earnings,"" he said.
"
15,FISV,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipate that ServiceNow will log its first annual profit in four years this year: 21 cents per share, up from a 7-cent loss in 2014. They expect earnings to more than double next year, to 50 cents.

"
21,FISV,"For example, one state's department of wildlife created a custom app on ServiceNow to keep track of endangered animals. A fashion retailer set up an app on ServiceNow to enable store managers to report security incidents such as shoplifting, broken windows and threats.

23,FISV,"ServiceNow plans to open an online app store for customers, though no date as yet been set. Materne likens it to Salesforce.com 's (CRM) AppExchange.

25,FISV,"Salesforce.com was first set up as a customer relationship management database for salespeople but has moved ""more broadly across the organization,"" Owens said. He says that ServiceNow is deploying a similar ""land and expand"" strategy.
"
26,FISV,"ServiceNow also has ""modest overlap"" with cloud player Workday (WDAY), which is focused on human resources, or the so-called ""human-capital market,"" Materne says. He adds that Workday competes more directly with Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) .

27,FISV,"""There are more opportunities to partner with Workday than to compete,"" he said. ""They can help each other sell and grow their customer bases. They're both the disrupters in the broader enterprise software world.""

He raised his price target to 76 from 71, though maintained his neutral rating.FIS's stock hit an all-time high of 74.19 in early trading on the stock market today, though by early afternoon it was down a fraction, near 73.50.

51,FISV,"As banks farm out more tech services and try to keep up with customers managing more of their money via their phones, Fiserv (FISV), a company that provides back-end technology to the finance industry, seems to be expanding at a solid, measured pace.Companies spilling over with triple-digit growth every quarter are drawing more adventurous investors, which is why many on Wall Street seem to like Fiserv’s steadiness. The company routinely generates single-digit sales gains and low-double-digit earnings growth, aided by share buybacks.Following the Fed’s rate hike last year and forecasts for fatter industry tech budgets, more of the same could be in store despite worries over a downturn and consolidation, the company and analysts say. That's due primarily to a steady income base.“When you have 85% of revenue recurring, it gives them a very good visibility into their numbers,” helping enable more accurate guidance and minimizing surprises when earnings season rolls around, Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Alexander Veytsman told Investor's Business Daily.“They do increase pricing, but given the longevity of those contracts and given the fact that these clients have been with them for a number of years, I would say they’re growing it slowly and steadily,” Veytsman said.The nature of the company’s contracts with clients helps Fiserv maintain its firm footing. Many deals are longer-term and retention is high, Morningstar notes in its research on the company. In addition, it’s costly and potentially hugely disruptive for financial companies to switch from one core-processing service to another, helping Fiserv keep customers in the fold.And even amid Wall Street’s hand-wringing over a possible recession, Chief Executive Jeffery Yabuki told IBD that he sees the trends in tech spending among Fiserv’s own clients continuing.""Most of our revenue is based on non-discretionary, mission-critical technologies under longer term contracts and is not subject to dramatic fluctuation,” he said via email. “We are seeing stable and growing demand for newer technologies that enhance experiences in the increasingly digital world.”Brookfield, Wis.-based Fiserv serves 13,000 banks, credit unions, retailers and other clients around the world. If you’ve withdrawn money from an automated teller or transferred a balance from one account to another, there’s a good chance it went smoothly in part because of Fiserv.Created in 1984 through a merger, Fiserv handles everything from transaction processing to data analysis to person-to-person payment systems. With this year’s technology spending seen growing 4%-5% among banks and credit-union customers -- Fiserv’s bread and butter -- the company is set to follow, Argus Research says.“We believe that Fiserv remains well positioned to benefit from technology infrastructure spending among its primary customers (banks and credit unions), many of whom are working to improve processing efficiency for online bill payment and debit card transactions,” Argus analyst Stephen Biggar said in a research note last month.“This should help revenue to keep rising at a modest mid-single-digit pace,” Biggar said, adding that Argus sees 5.5% in sales growth this year.Shares are up 25% over the past 12 months. The company has a Composite Rating of 93 out of a best-possible 99, boosted most recently by its strong fourth-quarter results that were marked by better-than-expected operating margins.The company also has tried to stay relevant through acquisitions. In 2011, Fiserv snapped up mobile banking company M-Com and digital payments outfit CashEdge, which gave it Popmoney, a bank-based person-to-person payments system for participating institutions that has helped drive sales growth. The company in 2013 announced that it acquired Open Solutions, giving it real-time account-processing technology.“You don’t need a new product every day,” Biggar said, “but you need something fairly significant every 2-3 years that would have its own sort of life cycle.”Last month, Fiserv said the United Nations Federal Credit Union for U.N. employees, among the largest in the U.S. by assets, will begin using Fiserv’s core account-processing technology. Analysts say the Federal Reserve’s rate hike in December could help strengthen banks’ finances, potentially freeing up cash for their technology budgets.“We view the Fed rate increase for the first time in a decade as good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend, as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across the technology landscape,” CEO Yabuki said on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call last month.Some concern persists that Fiserv could make less money if consolidation continues within the banking industry, either due to tightening regulations or an event like the 2008 financial crisis. Mergers and acquisitions could reduce client count and give those bigger, combined companies more muscle in negotiating cheaper contract prices with companies like Fiserv.However, the reduction in clients hasn't materialized, Veytsman said, and the prospect of more banks bringing tech operations in-house seems unlikely. Fiserv counts Wells Fargo (WFC) among its big clients, potentially signaling a stronger shift to outsourcing among larger banks.Monness Crespi's Veytsman said consolidation could actually accelerate the trend of tech outsourcing.“When they consolidate they also look to see what’s happening with the bottom line and what they’re doing around the costs,” he said. “And if someone was not considering using Fiserv as a client, maybe together, they will.”Yabuki sees consolidation continuing, but stressed that the number of accounts and transactions has kept rising for the company.Foreign exchange amid a stronger dollar could also hurt the company, although its international exposure is limited, Veytsman said. Jack Henry & Associates and FIS are among the company’s primary competitors. Concern also lingers about Fiserv’s debt, although Yabuki cites the company’s $1-billion-plus free cash flow last year.Still, both Biggar and Veytsman say the company’s acquisitions have been relatively focused and restrained.And one might be forgiven for wondering whether a person-to-person service like Popmoney can compete with PayPal’s (PYPL) Venmo, or payment-tech offerings from Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and, potentially, Apple (AAPL).However, Yabuki said P2P was in the early innings. And Veytsman said Popmoney is intended more as a side dish in its offerings to midcap banks than a main course.""It’s very hard to challenge PayPal,” he said.

52,FISV,"In the world of big-cap stocks, defensive issues still rule the roost.However, the IBD Big Cap 20 is showing a few faint streaks of growth-style companies banging on the door of market leadership.Today's weekly edition of top-performing stocks with a minimum market value of $15 billion features companies that are leaders in video graphics processors and financial account processing -- namely Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia (NVDA) and Fiserv (FISV) of Brookfield, Wis.One can expect more high-growth companies to join the Big Cap 20 if the latest confirmed uptrend, delivered by a Day 4 follow-through on Feb. 17, holds firm. It's valuable to monitor the Big Cap 20 for changes in the overall makeup.Nvidia ranks No. 19 in Monday's IBD 50. The stock rallied 43% from a 23.70 buy point that required a pair of breakouts to get really moving to new highs. Last week, the stock made a key stride in developing a potential new base pattern with an 18% gain in volume 61% above its weekly average. The stock also reclaimed its key 10-week moving average, a positive sign of institutional demand returning to the stock.Wall Street recognizes Nvidia as the leader in semiconductors that allow online video gamers to enjoy robust graphics on their computers and other Internet-enabled devices. But they are also making headway into the automotive and product-development markets. As noted in Monday's Inside The IBD 50 section, Nvidia is enjoying accelerating top- and bottom-line growth thanks to improving profit margins and product innovation.Fiserv, which ranked No. 8 in the Big Cap 20's Feb. 9 edition, staged a sixth straight gain Monday, three of which took place in above-average turnover. Last week it cleared a 96.66 handle entry within a shallow 10-week cup pattern. Volume was below average Monday; expect volume to rise as the stock aims for a new high. Persistently low turnover suggests lukewarm demand among institutional investors.The company says that it leads the U.S. in account processing services for financial institutions and holds more than one-third of that market. It keeps gaining ground in the credit unions space. On Monday, Fiserv announced that 25 credit unions with a total $2.5 billion in assets and 250,000 members have committed to the company's CUnify account processing platform; five of the credit unions are ""new core processing clients.""Priceline Group (PCLN) is another company that is neither a utility nor supplying food or cell phone service. The leader in online travel booking has leapt 35% from its Feb. 9 low of 954.02 and is now 12% below its all-time peak of 1476.

55,FISV,"A Day 5 follow-through in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Tuesday gives IBD readers the proverbial ""green light"" to deploy capital in fresh new leaders.Question is, how bright is that ""green light?""Indeed, every IBD-style growth investor should know these two things: 1) not all follow-throughs are the same; and 2) the success and breadth of the breakouts by high-quality stocks ultimately determine the quality of a follow-through.Right off the bat, this new uptrend is hampered by a much smaller pool of stocks that are towering in both EPS and sales growth as well as price strength. The small list of stocks making Inside Your Weekly Review reflects this clearly.Nevertheless, the market's rally can heat up. Spring always follows winter. In 2016, watch to see if a comeback in crude oil prices, better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, or other positive external events help provide a spark.Keep a close eye on how this Weekly Review list changes.

The Jan. 15 list showed 37 stocks.A quick scan of today's YWR shows that quite a few different industry sectors get represented, but only by a handful of stocks or less. These companies are true leaders in their specific industry niches.You won't find many stocks hailing from the medical sector in today's list, but Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) (90 EPS, 89 RS) made the grade. It's fallen in recent days, but still trades not so far from a 580 high that it hit in a recent breakout. No one has yet come up with a better system of robotic surgery.Ross Stores (ROST) truly excels in buying excess inventory from department store chains and selling the merchandise at deep discount in a clean, well-lit atmosphere. The stock is not far from a 55.74 handle buy point. Fiserv (FISV), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Public Storage (PSA) also are tops in their fields.

86,FISV,"Shares of Fiserv, Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) have gained 22.1% in the past year, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 14%. The company’s key growth drivers include its strong market position, a healthy product portfolio, significant acquisition synergies and steady flow of new customers. Fiserv reported mixed results in first-quarter 2018, wherein bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. Adjusted earnings of 76 cents outpaced the consensus mark by 3 cents and improved 22.6% year over year. Total revenues came in at $1.440 million, which missed the consensus mark of $1,442.1 million but increased 3.3% year over year.The company’s earnings surprise history has been decent. Fiservsurpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 0.4%. For the second quarter, the consensus estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days.Market Position & Operational Efficiency to Drive GrowthFiserv’s dominant position in the financial and payments solutions business is expected to continue driving growth. Furthermore, the company’s broad and diverse customer base, efforts to enhance operational efficiency, high recurring revenues and continued technology upgrades are encouraging.In first-quarter 2018, which is the third year of Fiserv’s ongoing five-year operational effectiveness program, the company achieved $18 million of savings. The savings came on the back of solid labor optimization and procurement benefits. Fiserv is optimistic about achieving its target of $50 million savings by 2018.Fiserv, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Fiserv, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Fiserv, Inc. QuoteAcquisitions a Key CatalystFiserv continues to expand its product portfolio and enhance its offerings with the help of strategic acquisitions.  The company completed four acquisitions — Online Banking Solutions, Inc., PCLender, LLC, Dovetail Group Limited and Monitise plc — in 2017. These buyouts helped the company to improve cash management and digital business banking solutions, and transform payments infrastructure.We believe Fiserv will continue to pursue accretive deals, which will boost its market share and customer base moving ahead. It is focused into becoming a global leader in transaction-based technology solutions.Competition RifeFiserv’s core banking products and services are part of a highly competitive market. Several non-banking bodies such as internal data processing departments, data processing affiliates of large companies, large computer hardware manufacturers, independent computer service firms, and processing centers — that are offering both customer facing and back office financial technology products and services — are teeming in the space.Going ahead, competition is anticipated to increase as market entrants multiply in number and the existing ones expand their product lines and services with updated technologies to attract new customers and retain the existing ones. Maintaining strong and long-term client relationships is a difficult task, amid stiff competition.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Fiservhas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include The Dun & Bradstreet Corp. (DNB  -  Free Report), TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.

87,FISV,"Investors looking for stocks in the Financial Transaction Services sector might want to consider either Cardtronics (CATM  -  Free Report) or Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Cardtronics and Fiserv are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CATM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FISV has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.CATM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.63, while FISV has a forward P/E of 23.94. We also note that CATM has a PEG ratio of 1.42. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. FISV currently has a PEG ratio of 2.08.Another notable valuation metric for CATM is its P/B ratio of 2.72. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FISV has a P/B of 10.30.Based on these metrics and many more, CATM holds a Value grade of B, while FISV has a Value grade of D.CATM sticks out from FISV in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that CATM is the better option right now.

88,FISV,"Fiserv, Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) yesterday announced a partnership with Iowa-based Sioux Valley Community Credit Union (CCU) and Washington-based Coulee Dam Federal Credit Union (FCU) for improving their technological suite and delivering updated and enhanced services to members. Both the credit unions will be using Fiserv’s Portico core account processing platform. With these new partners, Portico has added 15 credit unions over the past year. The Portico product is integrated with Fiserv’s digital and mobile banking solutions.Apart from Portico, Sioux Valley CCU will also use debit and credit processing, digital and mobile banking and bill payment solutions from Fiserv. Coulee Dam FCU will also be using a large portion of Fiserv’s technology solutions.A glimpse of Fiserv’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse on a year-to-date basis. Shares of Fiserv have gained 16.3%, outperforming the Zacks S&P 500 Composite’s increase of 4% year to date. Active on the Partnership FrontPartnerships like these makes sense considering the rapidly changing financial services industry and increasing demand for digital services. In fact, Fiserv has been quite active on the partnership front to expand into digitalization.On Jun 18, 2018, Fiserv tied-up with Dollar Bank to help the latter modernize its digital banking and payment suite with the help of its Architect solution. On Jun 6, the company collaborated with leading credit union, VyStar for enhancement of Vystar’s mobile banking platform.In May, Fiserv allied with Broadway Bank to help the latter grow in the commercial banking market and collaborated with Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLC (MBSL) for improvement in financial services offerings.In April, the company partnered with SISCOOP to enable 26 Mexican credit unions to offer a full range of secured digital banking and payment services using its Digital Access technology. In the same month, Fiserv allied with Carter Bank & Trust of Martinsville wherein the latter will use the Digital Edge suite from Fiserv to digitalize banking services and automate multiple manual processes as part of a strategic transformation.The company entered similar partnerships with Mastercard in March, Kawartha Credit Union in February and with Motor City Community Credit Union, First Foundation Bank and The Home Savings and Loan Company of Kenton in January.Such strategic partnerships will help Fiserv expand its product and service offerings in the market, thereby strengthening its position, opening up more opportunities for long-term growth and improving competitiveness. Fiserv is focused on becoming a global leader in transaction-based technology solutions.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Fiserv is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Cardtronics has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Fiserv has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CATM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FISV has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CATM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.70, while FISV has a forward P/E of 24.51. We also note that CATM has a PEG ratio of 1.43. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. FISV currently has a PEG ratio of 2.13.Another notable valuation metric for CATM is its P/B ratio of 2.73. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FISV has a P/B of 10.53.These metrics, and several others, help CATM earn a Value grade of A, while FISV has been given a Value grade of D.CATM is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that CATM is likely the superior value option right now.

91,FISV,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we focus on Fiserv, Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report), a stock with expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11.5%. Its earnings are expected to register 21.9% and 12.6% growth, respectively, in 2018 and 2019.The company’s price performance over the past year looks impressive. Share of Fiserv have gained 19.3%, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 12.5%. We believe the stock has the potential to continue the momentum. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s strategic acquisitions and alliances to boost its digital banking and payment services suite and shareholder-friendly moves.Let’s discuss them in detail.Strategic AcquisitionsFiserv continues to expand its product portfolio and enhance its offerings with the help of strategic acquisitions.  In 2017, Fiserv completed four acquisitions - Online Banking Solutions, Inc. (on Jan 17, 2017), PCLender, LLC (on Jul 31, 2017), Dovetail Group Limited (on Aug 18, 2017) and Monitise plc (on Sep 1, 2017). Thesebuyouts helped the company to improve cash management and digital business banking solutions and transform payments infrastructure.In 2016, Fiserv acquired two businesses - Convenience Pay Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Companyand Community Financial Services businessof ACI Worldwide, Inc. Both these buyouts expanded Fiserv’s biller solution offerings and enhanced its digital banking and payments solutions suite.Considering the rapidly changing financial services industry and increasing demand for digital banking services, investment in digital-oriented technologies through strategic acquisitions should boost Fiserv’s long-term growth and improve competitiveness.We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive deals, which will boost its market share and customer base going forward. The company is focused into becoming a global leader in transaction-based technology solutions.PartnershipsFiserv continues to make prudent business moves. It is entering into partnershipsto expand into digitalization. On Apr 19,2018, Fiservannounced its partnership with SISCOOP to enable 26 Mexican credit unions to offer a full range of secured digital banking and payment services using Fiserv’s DigitalAccess technology. This came on the heels of Fiserv’s foray into digital transformation with Carter Bank & Trust of Martinsville, announced on Apr 9, 2018. The bank will use the Digital Edge suite from Fiserv to digitalize banking services and automate multiple manual processes as part of a strategic transformation.Business Sale Fiserv continues to profit from offloading assets. In first-quarter 2018, Fiserv sold its 55% stake in Lending Solutions business to funds affiliated with Warburg Pincus LLC. Fiserv received total sale proceeds of $419 million from the deal. The company will retain the remaining 45% stake in the Lending Solutions business.  On Jan 10, it completed the sale of the retail voucher business, MyVoucherCodes (acquired as part of its purchase of Monitise in September 2017) for $50 million. On May 11, 2017, Fiserv sold its Australian item processing business for approximately $17 million.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed with Fiserv’s consistent efforts to return value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In first-quarter 2018, Fiserv repurchased 5.7 million shares for an aggregate cost of $398 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, it had 15.8 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization. Fiserv repurchased shares worth $1.17 billion, $1.20 billion and $1.47 billion, respectively, in 2017, 2016 and 2015.Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only boost investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Bottom LineThe aforementioned factors positively impacted Fiserv’s performance in the last reported quarter. In fact, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 0.4%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, thus giving investors enough reasons to remain optimistic on the stock.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Fiserv has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

96,FISV,"Paycom Software, Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 18.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderPaycom Software provides cloud-based human capital management (HCM) software solution delivered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with functionality and data analytics to manage the complete employment lifecycle, from recruitment to retirement.The company’s sustained focus on investing in SaaS technology and mobile applications has been driving revenue. We believe that Paycom Software’s cloud-based solution has greater demand across a wide section of verticals. Larger companies have greater and more complex HCM needs and Paycom Software’s solution is evolving to serve them.Growth of cloud computing has supported the company’s SaaS delivery model. According to IDC, the global SaaS market is expected to increase at a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) (2014–2019) of 16%. With its SaaS-based applications, we believe that Paycom Software is well-positioned to lead the market for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions.Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by higher recurring revenues and higher traction in cloud-based offerings. Better-than-expected demand for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions were the other catalysts.We believe that the higher adoption of Paycom Software’s Affordable Care Act (ACA) dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind in the long run. Also, Paycom Software might witness long-term growth by successfully cross-selling newer products to the existing client base, which is likely to boost revenues.Nevertheless, competition from companies like Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report), Intuit Inc. and Paychex, Inc. remains a headwind.Paycom Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Paycom Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Paycom Software, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Paycom Softwareis likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 13 cents per share. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Paycom Softwarecarries a Zacks Rank #3.

97,FISV,"FireEye Inc. (FEYE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 40.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFireEye’s management has been striving to turn the business around through a string of initiatives, which includes product launches, acquisition and cost optimization. We are of the opinion that the company’s turnaround strategies are paying off as reflected from its sterling first-quarter results, and solid outlook for the second quarter and full year.Going ahead, despite persistent macro uncertainty, the company appears optimistic due to a healthy security market, strong product line-up, deal wins and investment plans, which are likely to boost results in the long run.Furthermore, FireEye’s strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging, the latest being the buyout of iSIGHT Partners during the first quarter. The deal has reinforced FireEye’s cyber security suite and enhanced its competitive dynamics.However, the company has been losing business to its rivals in the past several quarters. FireEye faces stiff competition from other well-established players such as Check Point Software (CHKP  -  Free Report) and Fortinet in the cyber security space.FireEye, Inc.

98,FISV,"DST Systems Inc.  posted second-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings (excluding amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and one-time items) of 76 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. However, the company’s non-GAAP earnings registered a year-over-year increase of 7%, primarily driven by higher revenues, effective cost management and lower share count.Shares of the company declined more than 9%,yesterday, following the dismal bottom-line performance.Notably, the stock price underperformed the industry in the past one year. While the industry gained 27.7%, the stock yielded a negative return of 11.6%.Quarter DetailsTotal revenue in the second quarter came in at $656.2 million, up 68% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 68.3% year over year to $629.4 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $541 million.According to Steve Hooley, Chairman, CEO and President of DST, """"Our second quarter results demonstrate execution on our organic growth initiatives and reflect the value potential of our acquisitions of Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (""BFDS"") and International Financial Data Services Limited (""IFDS U.K."").”In first-quarter 2017, DST changed its reportable segment structure, which splits the previously reported Financial Services segment, into two new segments, Domestic Financial Services and International Financial Services. The Healthcare Services segment remains unchanged.Domestic Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) rose 22.9% year over year and came in at $312 million. Benefits from businesses acquired from BFDS in 2017 and increased revenues from organic growth along with positive market movement at ALPS positively impacted the segment.International Financial Services Segment increased from $31.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter to $231.1 million, primarily due to synergies from IFDS U.K acquisition.Healthcare Services operating revenues were down 2.6% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $101.3 million, primarily due client migrations, reductions in membership and decline in healthcare technology spending resulting from changes in government policy.Total cost and expenses soared 63.9% from the year-ago quarter to $525.2 million. Also, as a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses were up 230 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 83.4%.Non-GAAP operating income increased 11% year over year and came in at $76.5 million, primarily due to the acquisition of BFDS in 2017. Operating margin was however down 620 bps on a year-over-year basis to 12.2%, primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.DST Systems reported non-GAAP net income of $47.3 million compared with $47.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter.The company exited the quarter with $139.1 million in cash and equivalents compared with $260.4 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $645.4 million compared with $730.7 million in the previous quarter.During the second quarter, DST Systems repurchased roughly 1.2 million shares worth $75 million which exhausted the previous $300 million share-repurchase plan. Furthermore, in May 2017, the company authorised a new $300 million share repurchase program.Additionally, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per share (an increase of 3% quarter-over-quarter).Important Developments of 2017DST Systems announced the completion of the acquisition of State Street's ownership interest in both Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. and International Financial Data Services Limited. According to Steve Hooley, Chairman and CEO of DST, “We are confident that the single-operator model for these businesses will allow us to significantly enhance our clients' experience and improve the execution of our long-term growth strategy.""Our TakeDST Systems reported mixed second-quarter results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues surpassed the same. However, both revenues and earnings grew year over year.We are still of the opinion that DST Systems’ business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.However, persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market and stiff competition from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) and Fiserv Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) might put its fundamentals under pressure. Moreover, a high debt burden remains a major concern.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another top-ranked stock worth considering in the broader technology industry is Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

99,FISV,"The financial services industry has transformed significantly in recent years, considering the notable changes in transaction techniques. Technology plays a major role, with digitalization taking center stage.In today’s fast-paced life, people rely heavily on digital technologies and gadgets – especially mobile, laptops and others – for day to day needs. Digitalization of banking and payment services has made it easier for them to conduct transactions.Companies in this industry are expanding their business and enhancing their product portfolio with the introduction of advanced products and services, and strategic acquisitions and partnerships.However, the industry is getting competitive with the entry of several non-banking bodies such as global and local IT product and services companies, payment service providers and processors – who are offering both customer facing and back office financial technology products and services. Going forward, competition is anticipated to increase as market entrants multiply in number and the existing ones expand their product lines and services.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Financial Transaction Services stock — Fiserv, Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) and Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report). Both the stocks are part of the broader Business Services sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Fiserv has a market capitalization of $29.79 billion, Equifax’s market cap is $13.77 billion.Currently, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceFiserv clearly scores over Equifax in terms of price performance. Fiserv has gained 15.5% in a year’s time, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 11.5%. Equifax has declined 17.2%, underperforming the S&P 500. Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Fiserv’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 23.3% while that of Equifax are expected to decline 3.7%.  Looking at the full-year 2018 picture, Fiserv’s earnings are projected to grow 21.9% while that of Equifax are expected to decrease 0.5%. For 2019, Fiserv’s earnings are expected to register 12.6% growth compared with 8.6% for Equifax. Moreover, the long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.5% for Fiserv is higher than Equifax’s growth rate of 7.9%.Thus, Fiserv has an edge over Equifax in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock gives investors an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Equifax has performed better than Fiserv, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the previous four quarters, delivering an average beat of 2.9%. Fiserv has delivered positive surprise in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 0.4%.Valuation Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Fiserv and Equifax is 26.9 and 19.2, respectively, while that of the industry is 29.1. Although both the companies are undervalued relative to the industry, Equifax has an edge with a lower P/E ratio.The EV/EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation because it includes debt. The ratio is often used in addition to the P/E ratio.We observe that while Fiserv and Equifax have EV/EBITDA ratios of 16.9 and 12.4, respectively, the industry’s figure stands at 16.3. Equifax has an edge with a lower EV/EBITDA ratio and is undervalued relative to the industry. Fiserv is overvalued relative to the industry.ROE and ROCReturn on Equity (ROE) is the measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. Fiserv’s ROE for the trailing 12 months looks impressive in comparison to Equifax. The current ROE for Fiserv is 44.1% compared with 38.4% for the industry. Equifax’s ROE stands at 22.6%. Return on Capital (ROC) for Fiserv and Equifax is 15.6% and 14.2%, respectively. While both the stocks have scored below the industry level of 20.6%, Fiserv scores over Equifax in this respect.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Fiserv scores over Equifax in terms of price performance, expected earnings growth, return on capital and equity. However, Equifax enjoys an advantage in terms of valuation.So, even though Fiserv seems expensive compared to Equifax, it is likely to generate higher capital appreciation.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Verifone Systems, Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report) and WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).   The long-term expected earnings per share growth rates for Verifone and WEX are 14.9% and 14.3%, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

101,FISV,"We expect Fiserv, Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1.Last quarter, its earnings of $1.25 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents. The company has a decent earnings track record. In the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice while matching the same on the other two occasions, delivering an average positive surprise of 1.7%.Revenues of $1.394 billion were up 4.7% on a year-over-year basis and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.393 billion.Fiserv’s shares have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 11%, the stock returned 19.6%. We believe that the company’s strong market position, healthy product portfolio, significant acquisition synergies and steady flow of new customers are key drivers.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Fiserv is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key components.Zacks ESP: Fiserv currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.63%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.25 per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.23 per share. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Fiserv currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Fiserv’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Fiserv, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Fiserv, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fiserv, Inc. QuoteWhat's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Fiserv holds a dominant position in the financial and payment solutions business backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins.  Additionally, strong user base of Mobiliti ASP is a key driver. Moreover, Fiserv remains focused on expanding its product portfolio and thus product-oriented acquisitions are leading to a steady flow of customers.In May 2017, First National Bank of Pandora and Apple Creek Bank chose Fiserv as their new technology partner.  The company is also rapidly expanding in the overseas markets. In recent times, Fiserv’s offerings like Signature core account processing platform and DigitalAccess have been selected by BDO Unibank – the largest bank in Philippines – and Australia-based Bank of Sydney, respectively.We note that across Asia-Pacific, Fiserv supports approximately 68 clients in 13 countries, including some of the largest banks in Australia, Thailand and Indonesia.In Jun 2017, Affinity Plus Federal Credit Union chose to implement the company’s Architect Digital Banking and Payments Platform Solution. This reflects growing clout of Fiserv’s digital banking solutions among banks and credit unions.Fiserv expects revenues from base solutions like DNA, Agiliti and Now to drive growth as well as to benefit from its five-year cost cutting program.Other Stocks to Consider    Here are a few companies that you may also want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release:Kemet Corporation (KEM  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

The year-over-year rise in revenues was driven by the accretive Progressive Waste acquisition.

103,FISV,"Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial results on Jul 27, after the closing bell.Last quarter, Aflac surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.09%. The company exceeded earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 0.85%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 Flashback    Aflac has huge exposure to the life insurance business in Japan and has thus been suffering from a persistent low interest rate in the region. The same is expected to have impacted earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, sales from this segment will benefit from an increase in third-sector sales given the company’s emphasis on promoting these products which are less interest rate sensitive and carry strong and stable margins.  Also, the introduction of third-sector products such as a cancer insurance product early last year, revised EVER and get products in the first quarter have been well received in the market place and will contribute to top-line growth.  On the other hand, the company’s efforts in pulling out first-sector products and repricing other products in this category to fight the prolonged low interest rate environment may continue to restrict their sales..  In its U.S. business segment, we expect to see improved persistency, which in turn should support premium growth. The segment’s expense ratio is expected to remain high due to investments in a certain platform, including group administrative platform, enrollment platform and related technology.However, the company’s continuous efforts to return capital to its shareholders via share buyback will cushion its bottom line.The company will, however, incur high cost on account of its Japan branch conversion.Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aflac is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

In 2014, the company acquired TDX Group and Forseva, while it closed the Veda Group Limited buyout in first-quarter 2016.We believe that management’s efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should act as tailwinds. Moreover, the company’s strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets, as well as exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, moving ahead.However, we foresee the company’s investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar remain concerns.Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report), Automatic Data Processing Inc (ADP  -  Free Report) and Total System Services (TSS  -  Free Report) are other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fiserv, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fiserv, Inc. QuoteOur TakeFiserv commands a leading position in the financial and payment solutions business backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins. Additionally, the strong user base of Mobiliti ASP remains a major growth driver. The company remains focused on expanding its product portfolio. Product-oriented acquisitions are leading to a steady flow of customers.Investment in digital-oriented technologies is likely to improve its competitiveness. Fiserv’s digital banking solutions are gaining momentum among the banks and credit unions. The company is also rapidly expanding in the overseas markets.Fiserv expects revenues from base solutions like DNA and Agiliti to drive growth. Its new five-year cost cutting program is also likely to prove beneficial. In the second quarter, Fiserv added six DNA clients, four among which have over $1 billion in assets, and expects to add at least 10 more in 2017. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 30% to more than 6 million. The company’s $40 million savings in the first half of the year was driven by workforce optimization, progress in procurement and data center consolidation.However, lower termination fees, EMV deferral and adverse foreign currency translations are negatively impacting the company’s sales. Moreover, increasing regulations in the banking and financial services industry and intensifying competition from the likes of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report), and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) remain concerns.Zacks Rank & Stock to Consider Fiserv carries Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

106,FISV,"American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after market close.Helped by a reduction in operating costs, AIG surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate last quarter by 22.5%. Results reflected strong operating performance at both its Consumer and Commercial Insurance segments, favorable alternative investment return and lower-than-expected catastrophe losses.The company, however, does not have an impressive surprise history. Although it beat estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed in two, it witnessed an average negative surprise of 4.85%. This is depicted in the graph below:American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackWe expect performance at its Commercial Lines segment to remain stressed. Net premium written in the segment decreased 25% in 2016 and the decline continued in the first quarter. Given that the company has exited some of its casualty lines business, we expect the top line to remain under pressure over the coming quarters. The effect of the same will be seen in the to-be reported quarter.The company’s Individual Retirement business is weighed down by uncertainty stemming from the Department Of Labor’s fiduciary rule and lower fixed annuity sales due to the prevailing low interest rate environment. This resulted in lower sales in the past several quarters. Though the company has undertaken remedial measures such as making changes to product pricing, product features and asset quality, we don’t expect much improvement in sales in the upcoming release.In its Life Insurance business, recently, the company introduced a new administrative platform and digital capabilities, revamped its product suite, and substantially exited its U.S. life career distribution channel, service agent channel, and subscale group benefits business. These steps were undertaken to enhance ROE from this line of business. The efforts paid off as evident by an increase in life insurance sales in the first quarter as we expect to see further sales growth in the second quarter.Management’s efforts toward saving costs will accrue to its bottom line. In 2016, the company was ahead of its expense reduction target of $1.4 billion and decreased the same by over $1 billion or 10%. In the first quarter, its general operating and other expenses declined 18.6%. We expect to see a moderation in expenses in the to-be reported quarter.The company is also aggressively buying back shares in sync with its capital return target of $25 billion. In the first quarter, the company committed $7 billion of capital for share buyback and dividend for rest of the year. We believe substantial repurchase of shares will aid the company’s bottom line.We also expect to see an improvement in return on equity driven by the company’s continued active capital management and operating improvement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AIG is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

107,FISV,"MetLife Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after market close.Last quarter, MetLife surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15%. Earnings benefited from volume growth, continued expense discipline and higher fees from improved equity markets.The company, however, does not have an impressive surprise history. Although it beat estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed in one, it witnessed an average negative surprise of 1.55%. This is depicted in the graph below:MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | MetLife, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackMetLife has a leading position in group benefits with a market share of 25% among the large employers. It is experiencing strong growth in the mid-market segment in this business. The company witnessed continued strong persistency and solid sales across all market segments, as well as in both core and voluntary products in the first quarter. We expect strong performance from this segment in the second quarter too as the company continues to invest in this space to create differentiated customer experiences, supported by strong enabling technology and leading data protection capabilities.The company incurred derivate related losses of $602 million in the first quarter on account of low interest rates and strong equity markets. These macroeconomic factors remained largely unchanged in the second quarter, thus leading to expectations of derivate losses once again.We expect the company’s Property and Casualty (P&C) segment to suffer from the underperforming auto insurance business. The company has been making targeted rate increases in auto insurance over the last past one year and will continue doing so in 2017. These price increases, along with other management actions, will push the combined ratio higher. Overall, P&C sales may also suffer due to price increases and management actions to drive value. Weather-related destruction in the months of April and May might also dent earnings from this segment, in the form of catastrophe loss.  We also expect to see an increase in variable investment income driven by favorable hedge fund performance and strong private equity. The company’s bottom line will be aided by its expense management initiatives.MetLife has been generating enough free cash flow which it uses for investment purposes and buying back shares. Repurchases made by the company in the second quarter will aid its bottom line.Currency fluctuation will likely impart volatility to earnings.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that MetLife is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

We don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP.Despite having a bullish Zacks Rank #2, we are not confident of an earnings beat for Verisk in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Further, our proven model does not conclusively show that Fiserv and ServiceMaster are likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter, despite carrying a Zacks Rank #3. This is because both the companies have negative Earnings ESP.Overall, it is difficult to predict an earnings beat for the abovementioned business services stocks.Irrespective of an earnings beat or miss, investors are likely to focus on the companies’ fundamentals to make investment decisions.

Furthermore, it acquired a small business – Billers Solutions — which has expanded its presence on the SaaS platform. In early 2013, it acquired Open Solutions — a leading technology provider — for approximately $850 million.Also, most of the Open Solutions contracts are long term in nature, thus adding recurring revenues to the company’s top line. We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions, which are likely boost its market share and customer base going forward.Additionally, Fiserv is focused on returning value to shareholders through buybacks. The company bought back 1.5 million shares for $189 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

119,FISV,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to zero in on stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main aspects that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc. (VMW  -  Free Report) provides virtualization solutions from the desktop to the data center. The company delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 3.8%.

120,FISV,"Shares of DST Systems Inc.  surged more than 7%, yesterday, following the company’s better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results.The company’s non-GAAP earnings (excluding amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and one-time items) of 76 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. However, the company’s non-GAAP earnings registered a year-over-year decrease of 1.3%.Notably, the stock price underperformed the industry in the past one year. While the industry gained 21.9%, the stock yielded a return of just 20%.Quarter DetailsTotal revenues in the third quarter came in at $562.6 million, up 45.5% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 43.6% year over year to $524.8 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $511 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to synergies from Boston Financial Data Services (""BFDS"") and International Financial Data Services U.K. (""IFDS U.K."") acquisitions.In first-quarter 2017, DST changed reportable segment structure, which splits the previously reported Financial Services segment, into two new segments, Domestic Financial Services and International Financial Services. The Healthcare Services segment remains unchanged.Domestic Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) rose 23.4% year over year and came in at $305.3 million. Benefits from businesses acquired from BFDS in 2017 and increased revenues from organic growth along with positive market movement at ALPS positively impacted the segment.International Financial Services Segment increased from $26.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter to $129.4 million, primarily owing to synergies from IFDS U.K acquisition.Healthcare Services operating revenues were down 1.8% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $104.2 million, primarily due client migrations.Total cost and expenses soared 63% from the year-ago quarter to $472.1 million. Also, as a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses increased from 79.2% to 89.9%.Non-GAAP operating income decreased 1.5% year over year and came in at $72.5 million, primarily due to higher stock compensation expenses. Moreover, operating margin was down from 20.1% reported in the year-ago quarter to 13.8%, primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.DST Systems reported non-GAAP net income of $46.5 million compared with $50.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter.The company exited the quarter with $140.7 million in cash and equivalents compared with $139.1 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $644.8 million compared with $645.4 million in the previous quarter.During the third quarter, DST Systems repurchased roughly 1.2 million shares worth $75 million. The company has $225 million shares remaining under the current share repurchase program.Additionally, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per share.Our TakeDST Systems reported stellar third-quarter results. Further, revenues grew year over year, primarily due to BFDS and IFDS acquisitions.We believe that DST Systems’ business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.However, persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market and stiff competition from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) and Fiserv Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) might put its fundamentals under pressure. Moreover, a high debt burden remains a major concern.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock worth considering in the broader technology industry is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

121,FISV,"Fiserv Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the previously announced acquisition of British financial services technology firm, Monitise Plc. The deal will boost Fiserv’s capabilities in providing mobile payments solutions globally. However, financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.Initially, Fiserv had offered to pay 2.9 pence per share in cash, valuing Monitise at almost £70 million ($89.35 million). However, Cavendish Asset Management, which owned almost 4.84% of stake, considered the offer too low.Last month, Fiserv sweetened the offer to £75 million ($98 million) or 3.1 pence in cash, representing a premium of 34.8% more than Monitise's closing price on Jun 12, per Reuters. The final offer received support from Monitise's shareholders like Banco Santander and Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report).Fiserv’s shares closed at $123.00 on Sep 1, down 0.6%. The stock has gained 15.8% year to date, substantially underperforming the 25.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Acquisitions Expanding PortfolioAcquisitions have been a key driver for Fiserv’s expanding product portfolio over the last few years. Notably, the company has added more than 100 DNA clients since its acquisition of Open Solutions way back in 2013. In the second quarter, the company added six DNA clients, four among which have over $1 billion in assets. Fiserv, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Fiserv, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Fiserv, Inc. QuoteAnother acquisition – Architect digital banking solution – has gained significant traction within a short span of time. Moreover, addition of companies like Commercial Center, BillMatrix Next, Mobiliti have been key drivers in recent times. Notably, Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 30% to more than 6 million in the last quarter.Fiserv’s recent acquisition of Dovetail Group Limited strengthens its offerings in the payments infrastructure market.We note that Monitise’s cloud-based FINKit platform (focused on the United States and the United Kingdom) has gained significant interest within a short span of time since its launch in fiscal 2016. Moreover, Monitise has significant geographic penetration into European and Middle-East markets, which was a major attraction for Fiserv.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Fiserv has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

122,FISV,"Fiserv Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of Instant Issue Advantage, a tablet solution that enhances in-branch issuance and activation of payment cards within a short span of time. As customers can immediately start using these cards, engagement and satisfaction levels are anticipated to improve.This is significant for banks as delay in card issuance as well as activation can result in customer loss. Customer retention has become a major concern for banks amid intense competition from fintechs and traditional retailers offering disruptive financial services.We believe that instant issuance and activations of cards can act as a differentiator in this regard. The instant service will help in establishing banks as the primary financial institutions as compared with the aforesaid organizations, whose offerings are primarily online based. They are also not well-equipped to issue instantly activated cards due to the regulatory and certification process and PCI compliance procedures.Moreover, per Fiserv, the Consumer Preferences research highlights the gap between people receiving their cards and activating them. Only 63% of consumers activated their debit card the day it arrived in the mail. This habit significantly hurts interchange revenues, which can be improved through in-branch issuance and activation.Additionally, Fiserv’s expertise in effectively addressing challenges – primarily fraud – which banks and financial institutions face in case of instantly issued cards is a game changer. The adoption of company’s solution will mitigate risks related to issuance and activation of instant cards.Expanding Product Portfolio: Key CatalystFiserv remains focused on expanding its product portfolio. The company recently launched Integrator Advance that offers multiple tools, including research-based segmentation, cross-sell intelligence, campaign management and reporting in a single platform. Broadcom Limited Price and Consensus  Broadcom Limited Price and Consensus | Broadcom Limited QuoteMoreover, the company commands a leading position in the financial and payment solutions business backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins. In the second quarter of 2017, the company added six DNA clients, four among which have over $1 billion in assets and expects to add at least 10 more in 2017.Fiserv’s digital banking solutions are gaining momentum among the banks and credit unions. Recently, DNA solution was selected by SEFCU, which is among the top 50 credit unions in the United States, with approximately $3.5 billion in assets and more than 350K members in communities across New York.Further, investment in digital-oriented technologies is likely to improve the company’s competitive position in the long haul.Zacks Rank & Key PicksFiserv carries a Zacks Rank #3 (hold).

123,FISV,"On Aug 18, Zacks Investment Research downgraded DST Systems Inc.  to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Of late, the stock has been witnessing downward estimate revisions. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 dropped 6.5% to $3.04 over the last 30 days. All four estimates for fiscal 2018 declined in the same time frame, resulting in a drop of 4.5% in the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $3.57.    The negative estimate revision was primarily due to disappointing second-quarter 2017 bottom-line results. The company posted non-GAAP earnings (excluding amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and one-time items) of 76 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.DST has lost 4.8% of its value year to date against 24.2% growth of its industry.Factors Affecting the CompanyWe believe persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market is putting the company’s fundamentals under pressure. Additionally, a high debt burden remains a major concern.The impact of client migrations, reduction in membership and decline in healthcare technology spending resulting from changes in government policy also negatively impacted the company.Moreover, there was an increase in total cost and operating expenses in the second quarter, which soared 63.9% from the year-ago quarter to $525.2 million. This in turn put pressure on margin. Operating margin was down 620 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 12.2% in the last quarter.DST Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) DST Systems, Inc.

Also, the overall revenues of $2.04 billion are projected to decline 9.6% from the prior-year quarter.The Florida-based financial service provider’s bottom line might benefit slightly from the lower tax rates and rising interest rate environment.The company’s focus on introducing new and innovative products in order to meet the growing demand of customers will likely increase expenses, as witnessed in the past.Earnings WhisperAccording to our proven model, Fidelity does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Fidelity is -0.56%.Zacks Rank: Fidelity carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

The historic overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax liabilities from 35% to 21% has boosted corporate earnings, increased investments and in some instances also reflected in employee rewards.

126,FISV,"Shares of ABM Industries Incorporated (ABM  -  Free Report) have lost 11.2% against the industry’s gain of 3% on a year-to-date basis. Reasons Behind the Price PlungeThe company’s significant presence in the United Kingdom seems to be a major headwind for its operations. Post the Brexit referendum, the European economy has become highly unpredictable with disruptions and restrictions in acquisitions and trade with other European Union members. Such activities affect the company’s revenues and margins.Moreover, ABM Industries' dependence on inorganic growth is a concern. It appears that the company’s failure to make new acquisitions on a regular basis is hampering its growth rate with reduced revenues and margins. Strong competitive pressure also limits its success rate in bidding for profitable businesses and its ability to increase prices in accordance with rising costs.The company is also engaged in several energy efficiency projects. However, such projects remain exposed to federal and state legislature policies and natural disasters.Notably, the company's earnings missed estimates in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings (from continuing operations) of 26 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents and declined 31.6% from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease was largely due to interest expenses, amortization and higher share count. The company’s operating profit of $19.5 million was down 18.2% year over year.Downward Estimate Revisions & Zacks RankThe direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings decreased 13.5% to 45 cents per share. Estimates for 2018 decreased 8.1% to $1.93 per share in the same time frame.The downward estimate revisions along with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reflect pessimism over prospects of ABM Industries.Negative Earnings Surprise HistoryABM Industries has a disappointing earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 4.1%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report), Global Payments (GPN  -  Free Report) and Fidelity National Information Services (FIS  -  Free Report).

Moreover, the company beat earnings estimates in two out of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.76%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcementFactors Influencing Q2 ResultsWe expect the company’s second-quarter’s results to showcase strong performance at both its segments — Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting — driven by an improving global economy which is perking up economic activity. However, the company commented that given the better-than-expected first-quarter top line, growth might get tempered in the second quarter, resulting in modest margin improvement in Risk and Insurance Services.The company is quite aggressive in making acquisitions, which constitutes an important part of its capital allocation strategy. The synergistic effect of a number of purchases made by the company over the past many quarters will lead to revenue accretion.Growth initiatives undertaken by the company will contribute to overall results. Some of these include –  expansion in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and South Africa, Marsh’s buildout of MMA and its UK SME strategy, the emergence of cyber, flood and mortgage practices at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, investments at Mercer in Workday implementation capabilities, global health and benefits technology and the Mercer Marketplace Health Exchange, investments in Oliver Wyman and their digital technology and analytics platform, and the pursuit of high-growth areas, including healthcare and public sector.The company has undertaken restructuring initiatives which will cause it to incur related charges.Also, foreign exchange movement might have a slight negative impact on earnings.Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

129,FISV,"We expect Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 1.Earnings Whispers         Our proven model shows that Apple is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Apple currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.27%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.59, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3. This combined with the company’s Earnings ESP of +1.27%, makes us confident in looking for an earnings beat this quarter.Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Apple Inc. QuoteWe caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderThis is a relatively calmer quarter for Apple. Apple’s revenues will continue to be driven by the fast growing “Services” segment as well the sales (albeit slowing down) of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Services include revenues from App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay.Investors are more interested in the second half of fiscal 2017. This is because Apple will be launching its mega edition, iPhone 8, around September.iPhone 8 is set to be launched to mark the tenth anniversary of the revolutionary iPhone. It is reported to have amazing features like a glass body, a dual-curved edge-to-edge OLED display with a built-in Touch ID sensor and wireless charging. iPhone 8 is already dubbed a “super cycle”. However, there are rumors that the launch might be delayed, which could mar its September-ending quarter results.Meanwhile, the company remains focused on finding newer growth avenues. It is also working on developing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality/ virtual reality (AR/VR), which are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities. The company’s interest in the autonomous car project is understandable as it is now being labeled as a big business opportunity. Apple also remains focused on increasing its market share in India.Over the past one year, the stock has registered growth of 44.3% compared with the industry’s gain of 43.7%.Despite these, Apple continues to face a plethora of challenges. Competition from local players has been hindering iPhone growth in China. In the last reported quarter, owing to persistent macroeconomic weakness, Apple revenues declined around 14% year over year in the Greater China region to $10.7 billion.For third-quarter fiscal 2017, Apple forecasts revenues in a range of $43.5–$45.5 billion. Gross margin is expected within 37.5–38.5%, while operating expenses are projected within $6.6–$6.7 billion. Operating expenses will be in the range of $6.6–$6.7 billion. Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of other stocks worth considering that, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.CGI Group Inc.

It surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 27.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackAllstate’s earnings have always been exposed to catastrophe losses. The first quarter bore the brunt of cat losses and the same is expected in the second quarter. The company has provided preliminary estimates of cat loss of $638 million on a pre-tax basis, owing to weather-related destruction in April and May.In the first quarter, the company closed the acquisition of SquareTrade, a protection plan provider for consumer electronics and connected devices. Allstate previously said that the deal would dilute earnings for three years. Therefore, the effect of the same will be felt in second-quarter results.The company’s customer-focused strategy, and a wide variety of products and services sold through an extensive distribution network, will likely result in higher policies issued thus aiding top-line growth.Allstate took profit improvement initiatives, over the last two years, in its Auto insurance business. These efforts have started bearing fruit and will aid earnings in this line of business.Shares bought back by the company in the quarter under review will also add to the bottom line.Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allstate is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

131,FISV,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for second-quarter 2017. The company’s adjusted earnings (excluding amortization expenses, Veda Group acquisition-related charges and other one-time items) per share from continuing operations of $1.60 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 and also jumped 11.9% year over year.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $1.36 per share, up from the year-ago quarter tally of $1.08 per share. The strong year-over-year bottom-line growth can primarily be attributed to solid top-line performance and stringent cost management, which was partially offset by a marginal increase in the number of total outstanding shares.Notably, the stock’s share movement has compared unfavorably with the industry in the past one-year period. Equifax returned 9.5% while the industry gained 22.6%.RevenuesEquifax’s revenues of $856.7 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $861 million as well as management’s guided range of $857–$862 million. However, the figure was up 6% on a year-over-year basis.According to Richard F. Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Equifax, ""Second quarter performance reflects outstanding execution by the team and the strength of our unique portfolio of businesses.""The company made slight changes in its reportable segments from first-quarter 2016. The U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) and Workforce Solutions remained unchanged, while Personal Solutions was renamed to Global Consumer Solutions.Segment wise, total USIS revenues were up 8% year over year to $331.9 million. Among its sub-segments, growth was recorded in Online Information Solutions (6%), Mortgage Solutions Services (10%) and Financial Marketing Services (15%).International revenues (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) advanced 6% year over year to $231.4 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 10%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific region’s contribution to revenues to $76.5 million, up 6% year over year. Moreover, revenues registered an increase of 13%, 4% and 2% in Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment climbed 10% year over year to $194.5 million, primarily on the back of 19% revenue growth in Verification Services, which more-than offset 5% decline in Employer Services.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $98.9 million to total revenue, reflecting an 8% year-over-year decline. On a constant-currency basis, revenues dropped 7%.Operating ResultsEquifax’s adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 13% to $334.7 million. Consequently, adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded 250 basis points (bps) to 39.1%. Adjusted net income came in at $194.8 million or $1.60 per share compared with $172.7 million or $1.43 per share reported a year ago.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowEquifax exited the quarter with $403.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from the previous quarter’s balance of $123.2 million. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was $2.04 billion, flat quarter over quarter. During six months ended Jun 30, 2017, Equifax generated cash flow of $329.1 million from operational activities. The company paid 39 cents per share as dividends in the second quarter.GuidanceFor the quarter, Equifax projects revenues in a range of $853–$861 million (mid-point: $857 million), while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $855 million. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $1.50 and $1.54 (midpoint: $1.52). The earnings guidance range at its mid-point is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53.Furthermore, Equifax updated full-year 2017 outlook. The company now expects revenues in the range of $3.395–$3.425 billion (previous guidance $3.375–$3.425 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.41 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are now anticipated to be between $6.02 and $6.10 (previous guidance $5.96 and $6.10). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.06.Our TakeEquifax posted mixed results for the second quarter. However, earnings and revenues both recorded year-over-year growth. The company also updated outlook for full-year 2017.We believe that management’s efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in America, should act as tailwinds. Further, the company’s strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets, along with exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, moving ahead.However, we expect the company’s investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar are concerns. Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report) and Total System Services (TSS  -  Free Report) are the other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better ranked-stock in the broader technology sector worth considering is Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.

135,FISV,"Shares of VeriFone Systems, Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report) tumbled to a 52-week low of $14.93 during the trading session on Apr 2. However, the figure recovered marginally to close at $15.14, down 1.5%.In fact, the stock has not performed well in the past three months. Shares of Verifone have lost 14.1% against the industry’s gain of 3.0% in the said timeframe. Reasons for the UnderperformanceMacro Headwinds and CompetitionVeriFone’s business continues to be affected by macroeconomic headwinds in emerging markets such as China and India. Further, VeriFone faces significant competition from a number of local providers in the domestic as well as international markets. Notably, non-GAAP revenues from North America and Asia Pacific declined drastically by 21.7% and 30.7%, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2018, on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, Verifone reported mixed financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Earnings per share met the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved fr om the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP revenues, despite beating estimates, declined 4.3% year over year. The company’s System Solutions revenues declined 7% year over year to $243.1 million, owing to the headwinds arising from the U.S. petro business and Indian markets.Verifone Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Verifone Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Verifone Systems, Inc. QuoteApart from this, the Electronic payment system and services market is highly competitive and fragmented. New market entrants such as non-card payment methods (using Internet and cloud instead of using physical cards) are expected to gain significant traction in the long run. Increased pricing pressure is another headwind. We believe the market is getting more competitive with the introduction of new market entrants and latest technologies.Divestures and Buyout-related WoesThe divestitures of China business, Petroleum Media business and Taxi Solutions business during 2017 are anticipated to hurt top-line growth in the near term. Multiple acquisitions, despite improving revenue opportunities, increase the company’s exposure to integration risks. Further, the company’s leveraged balance sheet may limit future expansion and worsen its risk profile. Higher interest rate on debt is expected to negatively impact profitability.Recent launches like Carbon Mobile 5 device and Verifone e280 mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) solutionwill take some time to contribute to growth.Downward Estimate RevisionsThe direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings declined 12.1% to 29 cents per share. Full-year 2018 earnings estimates however remained unchanged at $1.48 per share in the last 60 days.Further, current quarter and full-year 2018 sales are estimated to decline 8.1% and 4.2%, respectively.The downward estimate revisions reflect pessimism over the prospects of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other Bearish ReadingsROC and ROEReturn on Capital (ROC) of Verifone is 7.1% compared with 19.9% for the industry. This implies that the company generates a lower return on investment than its industry.Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. Verifone’s trailing 12-month ROE undercuts its growth potential. The stock’s current ROE stands at 18.9% compared with the industry’s ROE of 37.2%.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company. To this end, Verifone seems to be a highly leveraged stock with a reading of 93.5% compared with 61.7% for the industry.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report), Global Payments (GPN  -  Free Report) and Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report). All the stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #2.The projected earnings growth rate (3-5 years) for Fiserv, Global Payments and Mastercard is 11.5%, 15.8% and 18.3%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

Reportedly, Alipay has more than 600 million registered users in China and 200 million of financial institution partners. Therefore, the deal will help First Data to expanding its client base, increasing its top-line numbers.Also, the deal will allow Alipay to expand its reach across North America.

139,FISV,"DST Systems Inc.  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 20.We expect DST Systems to perform well driven by strength in its Financial Services segment and synergies from acquisitions. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.The company’s shares are moving in the upward direction of late. Notably, its shares have returned 7.4% in the past one month, outperforming the industry’s gain of just 2.5%.Financial Service Segment to Drive GrowthIn second-quarter 2017, DST Systems’ Domestic Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) rose 22.9% year over year and came in at $312 million. Benefits from businesses acquired from Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (""BFDS"") in 2017 and increased revenues from organic growth along with positive market movement at ALPS positively impacted the segment.International Financial Services Segment increased from $31.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter to $231.1 million, primarily owing to synergies from International Financial Data Services Limited (""IFDS U.K."") acquisition.We believe that Financial Services’ revenues will grow in the upcoming quarters primarily backed by significant contributions from the acquisitions of, Kaufman, Red Rocks Capital, ALPS, IntelliSource, Subserveo and Finix.Important Developments of 2017DST Systems announced the completion of the acquisition of State Street's ownership interest in both BFDS and IFDS U.K. We believe that these acquisitions will be accretive to DST Systems’ earnings and will have a positive impact on the to-be-reported quarter.The company also has a strong business model. It generates recurring revenues and a good percentage of its business comes from long-term contracts with its customers. The company has developed the fee structure on a per-account and per-transaction basis, which indicates the fixed and flexible portion of revenues with respect to each client. Financial services companies that use DST System’s software to service multiple such clients generate incremental revenues with each additional client and/or transaction. The model ensures a minimum revenue level even when there are limited transactions.Meanwhile, persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market and stiff competition from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) and Fiserv Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) might put its fundamentals under pressure. Moreover, a high-debt burden remains a major concern.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

140,FISV,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio — to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc.

142,FISV,"Fiserv Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 7. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the trailing quarters and matched it once, delivering an average positive surprise of 0.09%.Last quarter, adjusted earnings of $1.27 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30. However, it improved 11.4% from the year-ago quarter.Total revenue increased 1.4% year over year to $1.40 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 billion. Adjusted revenues grew 2% year over year to $1.34 billion.Notably, shares of Fiserv have gained 28.7% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s 39.9% rally.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key FactorsFiserv holds a dominant position in the financial and payment solutions business. We believe an expanding product portfolio coupled with steady flow of customers will drive top-line growth.Fiserv is witnessing an increase in the adoption of DNA as well as other digital banking solutions among banks and credit unions. Notably, the number of signed DNA clients totaled 20 after the addition of nine clients to the platform in third-quarter 2017.

The acquisitions of Monitise, PCLender and Dovetail Group in the third quarter are expected to further enhance its clientele in the United States as well as in the international markets.Management expects EMV revenues to  increase in the fourth quarter. The company is also optimistic about earning the delayed periodic revenues of third quarter, which is expected to expand margins.However, increasing regulations in the banking and financial services industry and intensifying competition from the likes of Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) remain concerns.
