Waymo — often seen as being furthest along on autonomous technology — said it will soon put passengers in driverless cars — without even a ""safety driver"" to take over the controls if things go wrong. But GM says its ability to both develop self-driving solutions and manufacture cars gives it an edge vs. tech rivals in the race to put self-driving cars on public roads on a commercial scale.

His remarks suggest that the Fed's hawkish-but-patient tilt probably won't change much after Yellen's exit. Powell also hinted that he favors a lighter touch on bank regulation.Meanwhile, the economy continues to show broad strength.

74,SNPS,"Synopsys (SNPS) stock bolted to a record high Thursday for the seventh time in August, dragging rival Mentor Graphics (MENT) to a 10-month high and pulling Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) stock out of a sell zone, following the company's fiscal Q3 blowout late Wednesday.In early afternoon trading on the stock market today, Synopsys stock rose 4.7% to 58.50, hitting an all-time high. Last week, shares hit record highs for five consecutive days. Shares are up 20% for the year as of Wednesday's close.As of Thursday's close, Synopsys stock was about 18% extended from a buy point at 49.47 out of a cup-with-handle formation, achieved May 20. Shareholders are typically advised to take some profits at 20% extension.Mentor stock lifted 1.65% to 22.16, while Cadence stock was up 1.4%, near 24.76.IBD'S TAKE: On Monday, investment bank RBC listed Synopsys, Cisco Systems and Intel among those best positioned to take advantage of the burgeoning Internet of Things market.DA Davidson analyst Thomas Diffely expects Synopsys to continue gaining share from the other two makers of software used to design chips, Cadence and Mentor. He reiterated a buy rating and boosted his price target to 64 from 60 on Synopsys stock.""Synopsys is our favorite EDA (electronic design automation) name and the only one of the Big Three that is not projected to derive a significant portion of its earnings growth this year from an aggressive share repurchase program,"" he wrote in a research report.For fiscal Q3 ended July 31, Synopsys reported $615.2 million in sales and 76 cents earnings per share ex items, up a respective 11% and 21% vs. the year-earlier period. Both metrics topped analysts' view for $602.9 million and 74 cents.Current-quarter guidance for $621 million to $629 million in sales and 75-78 cents EPS ex items easily topped Wall Street's model for $608 million and 75 cents. At the midpoints of guidance, sales and EPS would be up 6% and 14%, respectively, vs. last year.Synopsys also upped its fiscal 2016 guidance to $2.41 billion to $2.43 billion in sales and $3 to $3.03 EPS ex items, up 9% and 8%, respectively. Earlier, Synopsys had guided to $2.36 billion to $2.4 billion in sales and $2.95 to $3 EPS minus items.Needham analyst Richard Valera credited Synopsys' consensus-topping fiscal Q3 to record bookings for the company's emulator and field-programmable gate array products.

75,SNPS,"Cisco Systems (CSCO), Intel (INTC) and Synopsys (SNPS) are among the best positioned hardware and software companies for growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) -- industrial, medical, automotive and consumer devices connected wirelessly to the Web -- says RBC Capital in a research report.Companies targeting IoT growth have stepped up acquisitions, wrote RBC analyst Mitch Steves.Cisco in March acquired Jasper, an IoT software provider, for $1.4 billion. Intel in April bought Arynga, which provides wireless software to update automotive IoT systems. Japan-based telecom conglomerate SoftBank (SFTBY) in July said it would buy chip designer ARM Holdings (ARMH) for $32 billion.IBD'S TAKE: EPS is the biggest red flag for Cisco Systems, as investors can learn from IBD Stock Checkup.""While ARM (acquired by SoftBank) was the leading player in semiconductor intellectual property, Synopsys is second with 15% of revenue tied to IP -- benefiting from complex chip design and miniaturization,"" said Steves.Web-connected devices are expected to transform factory automation, agriculture, utilities, health care, retail and insurance industries. Amazon.com's (AMZN) cloud computing service, General Electric (GE) and phone companies AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) are among those targeting IoT markets.""We think the software platform is the most attractive segment within the broad topic of IoT, as cloud-based software platforms allow companies to obtain real-time visibility and monitoring,"" said Steves. ""For the design side, we think companies that provide software to create increasingly complex chips (miniaturization) will also benefit from IoT growth.""He says Big Data firms Splunk (SPLK) and Tableau Software (DATA) should have upside from IoT deployments.On Intel, he said: ""INTC is on track to generate $2.5 billion of revenues from its IoT segment, implying year-over-year growth of 10%."" Intel could update its IoT efforts at its Intel Developer Conference, which starts Tuesday, in San Francisco.With Jasper, Cisco gained software to manage wireless connections to a broad range of devices, Steves said.""Cisco now offers comprehensive end-to-end IoT solutions across a number of industry verticals, making it a preferred choice for businesses that function across multiple industry sectors,"" he wrote.Intel stock finished trading up 1% to 34.91 on the stock market today.

77,SNPS,"Mentor Graphics (MENT) stock crashed after hours Thursday from near a 14-year high as the maker of software used to design chips guided to Q4 sales and earnings vastly below analysts' expectations, and shares tumbled to a 13-month low.In early trading Friday, Mentor Graphics stock was down more than 32% and trading just below 19 for the first time since October 2014. Before the firm's Q3 earnings release, shares were up 27% for the year. As of Friday morning, they're down 13%.Key rivals Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) and Synopsys (SNPS) felt the weight of Mentor's burden Friday. Early in the stock market today, Cadence was down nearly 6%. Synopsys stock closely trailed, falling more than 5%. Synopsys is scheduled to report its Q4 earnings after the close Dec. 2.For Q3, Mentor Graphics reported $290.5 million in sales and 28 cents earnings per share ex items, down 1% and 18%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both measures missed the consensus for $291.8 million and 29 cents.Mentor also guided to current-quarter sales of $336 million and non-GAAP EPS of 47 cents, down 23% and 57%, respectively, vs. the year-ago quarter. Analysts were expecting $439.3 million and 97 cents.Chip M&A Could 'Pose Challenges'On Friday, Mentor stock suffered at least two price target cuts and two downgrades. Pacific Crest analyst Monika Garg blamed rival Cadence's release of a new emulation tool ""that led customers to delay decisions around emulation"" for Mentor's $105 million cut to Q4 sales guidance.Garg downgraded Mentor stock to sector weight, noting, ""We expect semiconductor industry consolidation to continue, which could pose challenges to Mentor's growth.""Mentor had been on a strong growth streak previous to Q3. Since March 2011, sales have declined only twice and EPS just three times.For the year, Mentor cut its sales guidance to $1.18 billion from earlier guidance for $1.88 billion. The company now expects $1.40 non-GAAP EPS vs. its three-months-ago view for $1.90.Preliminarily, the company guided to low single-digit percentage growth for 2017 sales.This reflects continued consolidation within the chip sector, Garg wrote in a research report. Mentor CEO Walden Rhines estimated $100 billion thus far in 2015 deals, during Thursday's conference call with analysts.""We are concerned that consolidation in the semiconductor industry could continue for some time, which means more impact on Mentor in the coming years,"" Garg wrote. ""This also raises concerns about Synopsys and Cadence.""D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Diffely downgraded Mentor Graphics stock to neutral from buy. He also cut his price target on the stock to 24 from 32.Emulation is typically ""lumpy"" and therefore subject to quarter-over-quarter volatility, Diffely wrote in a report.""We are more concerned about the shortfall in the core EDA market and the prospect of this weakness extending through next year,"" he wrote.Key customers such as Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (BRCM) — soon to be acquired by Avago (AVGO) — could seek better EDA pricing elsewhere with combined merger heft, he wrote. Or a renewed contract could be for a shorter term amid M&A hype.""Bottom line, the outlook for low single-digit growth next year is well below our expectations projected from these scenarios,"" he wrote. Mentor guided 2016 sales at 2014 levels, and the company is ""underperforming its peer group.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

78,SNPS,"Investors clearly disagreed Thursday with Synopsys (SNPS) CFO Trac Pham, who late Wednesday likened the company's three-penny trim of 2015 earnings guidance to ""a deferred haircut.""Synopsys closed down 7% in the stock market today at 48.60, though shares regained a little after hours.During the company's Q3 earnings conference call, Pham attributed the EPS haircut to four hefty acquisitions in Q3 expected to remain dilutive in 2016.Synopsys works in electronic design automation and semiconductor intellectual property. In Q2, the company guided to $2.76-$2.81 non-GAAP earnings per share for 2015. On Wednesday, Pham pulled back from that, guiding to between $2.76 and $2.78 EPS ex items for the year.""We did tweak the earnings guidance at the midpoint by about penny or 2 cents to reflect a dilution,"" he said.But, CEO Aart de Geus later added, one of those dilutive acquisitions is expected to be accretive in 2016. Synopsys acquired Coverity, a software quality- and security-checking firm, in February 2014.""From a philosophy point of view, the way to think about it is that as we add acquisitions, we aim to within I would say 12 to 18 months make them accretive,"" he said.Overall, however, the acquisitions balance — which includes chip verification company Atrenta in June — will be dilutive in 2016, de Geus said.'A Good Beat'Analysts were less critical of Synopsys as it emerged from Q3 with 63 cents EPS ex items on $555.8 million in revenue. EPS fell 2 cents vs. Q3 2014, whereas revenue jumped 6.5%.Synopsys beat the consensus forecast of seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters who expected 59 cents per share for earnings on $555.4 million in revenue.For Q4, Synopsys guided to between $570 million and $585 million in revenue and between 65 cents and 67 cents non-GAAP EPS, which would be up 3% at the midpoint vs. Q4 2014.Pham also hoisted Synopsys' 2015 revenue guidance to between $2.23 billion and $2.24 billion, an increase from the $2.21 billion to $2.24 billion forecast in Q2.Historically, Synopsys has lagged Mentor Graphics (MENT) and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) in the emulator business, Pacific Crest analyst Monika Garg wrote in a research report.""But, it seems Synopsys' strategy of focusing on integrating its simulation, verification and emulation tool in the 'verification continuum' is paying off,"" she said.The verification continuum is Synopsys' name for its software-verification platform, on which customers use the company's products in conjunction with one another.Garg called the company's Q3 ""a good beat"" and estimated Synopsys' IP revenue could grow into the double digits with the burgeoning use of IP in chip design.Garg suggested Synopsys may have also scooped an emulation contract — ""Intel, in our view"" — from Mentor.She maintained her 60 price target on Synopsys stock and reiterated an overweight rating.Thomas Diffely, of DA Davidson, hiked his price target on Synopsys stock to 60 from 56 and rated it a buy.Despite the temporary dilution, Diffely sees Synopsys ultimately garnering profit stemming from the $125 million it spent in Q3 acquisitions.""SNPS is building a meaningful presence in these growth markets that should ultimately drive earnings,"" he wrote in a research report.Connect with Allison Gatlin: Twitter | Facebook.

113,SNPS,"The technology sector continues to attract investors due to its dynamic nature. It is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices (AR/VR), autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.The technology sector has been a prolific performer on a year-to-date basis with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) registering a return of 22.8% year to date. The positive data suggests that the sector will grow further in 2017. According to a recent forecast provided by Gartner Inc. (IT), global IT spending for 2017 will rise 2.4%, up from 0.3% in 2016.Per the research firm, the worldwide public cloud services market is anticipated to increase 18% in 2017 to $246.8 billion, up from $209.2 billion in 2016. It also forecasted that the number of connected things will increase 31% to 8.4 billion in 2017 from 6.4 billion in 2016.So, we believe that this is the right time to invest in this space. However, picking the right stocks is always a tough task. To zero in on stocks that are winning currently and have the potential to gain further, we have opted for one tried and tested technique – picking stocks near their 52-week highs.Making the Right ChoiceThe 52-week investment strategy loosely borrows from the basics of Momentum investing and is one of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook. The basic idea is “buy high and sell higher” since once a trend is established, it is likely to continue. In other words, stocks that are growing will continue to grow.The surge is driven by a broad set of factors including impressive sales, robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects.  Major developments may also send stocks soaring. On the flipside, stocks that are trading near their 52-week highs carry the risk of falling fast as the market might consider them overvalued. But the positives seem to outweigh the drawbacks.Still, to be on the safer side, why not bet on stocks that besides trading near their 52-week highs and have a positive earnings history. The stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a Momentum Score of A or B. Notably, back-tested results show that this favorable combination handily outperforms other stocks.5 Stocks to Scoop Up Entegris, Inc.

118,SNPS,"Synopsys Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) recently announced that its board of directors has replenished its ongoing share repurchase program to its limit of $500 million.Notably, the stock repurchase program has been in effect since 2002 and the allotted capital has been refilled depending on the availability of funds. However, Synopsys is not obligated to buy back any specific number of shares and the program may be terminated depending on the company’s decision.In fiscal 2017, Synopsys repurchased stock worth $380 million. At the end of fiscal 2017, the company had $400 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization of $500 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company bought back $180 million worth of its common stock, following which the fund was refilled.According to the company, accelerated share repurchase (ASR) arrangements are an integral part of its overall efforts to enhance investors’ worth. In fiscal 2017, the company either initiated or completed $325 million worth of ASR. Prior to that, in December 2015, it initiated a $200 million ASR program while in December 2014, it started a $180 million ASR program that was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.We believe that apart from strategic investments, the company’s continuous focus on such shareholder-friendly initiatives will help the company’s shares rebound going forward. Notably, Synopsys has rallied 16.1% over the past year, underperforming the 30.4% surge of the industry it belongs to.Additionally, the company’s raised fiscal 2018 guidance is encouraging. The company’s recent acquisitions of Black Duck Software and Kilopass Technology are expected to boost the top line in the long run. Moreover, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to consumers.However, escalating costs and expenses, which have been dampening margins, remain headwinds. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies and heightening competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Mentor Graphics are other concerns.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA and Western Digital have long-term expected EPS growth rates of 10.3% and 19%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

124,SNPS,"Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) recently announced that a host of its solutions has been selected by Arbe Robotics for its patented imaging radar meant for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.Arbe Robotics’ imaging radar has a high resolution and offers a “wide 100-degree field of view” even in difficult conditions such as heavy rains, fog or extreme darkness. The chipset is enabled to support safe autonomous driving level 4 and 5 via capturing a detailed image of the size, location and speed of any object within a range of 300 meters of the vehicle.The company has adopted Synopsys’ “DesignWare ARC EM Safety Island, EV6x Embedded Vision Processor with Safety Enhancement Package (SEP), Ethernet Quality-of-Service (QoS) Controller IP, STAR Memory System, STAR Hierarchical System and STAR ECC Compiler for its new 4D high-resolution imaging radar system-on-chip (SoC).”The ASIL D Ready features of Synopsys’ IP are suitable for the strict safety requirements of ADAS. Additionally, “safety documentation, including failure modes, effects, and diagnostic analysis (FMEDA) reports” are anticipated to quicken the pace of the chip’s ISO 26262 Certification.Notably, in May, Synopsys unveiled the industry’s first ASIL D Ready embedded vision processor IP for applications in ADAS and autonomous vehicles. It provides critical hardware features for safety along with maintenance of high performance. We believe this will provide the company with first mover’s advantage in the market, eventually driving revenues.Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteSafety First for ADASDiscussions regarding ADAS and autonomous vehicles often veer toward the reliability and safety-oriented issues of the vehicles. In March, one of Uber Technologies’ autonomous vehicles killed a pedestrian in Arizona, while undergoing test driving.Following this incident, the governor of Arizona suspended Uber from test driving autonomous cars in the state for an indefinite period. Reportedly, this mishap led NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), the manufacturer of hardware for Uber’s technology, to stop testing of its own self-driving vehicles on roads.Notably, NVIDIA is currently using NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, a virtual reality (VR) based autonomous vehicle simulator that enables the virtual testing of autonomous vehicles in diverse conditions. Hence, safety remains a major concern for the companies dealing with autonomous driving and ADAS.Synopsys’ IP solutions are equipped with self-checking safety monitor, error correcting code (ECC) and programmable watchdog timer. Also, the lockstep feature enables rapid detection of runtime faults and system failures and addresses the need for real-time networking between the connected devices.We believe that such initiatives on Synopsys’ part will eventually increase its client bases, thereby boosting its top line in the long run.

125,SNPS,"Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) has been gaining from recent product launches, client acquisitions and buyouts. The company has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.8%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10% and a current market cap of $13.3 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio right now.Let’s take a look at the factors aiding the company’s performance.Increased adoption of Synopsys’ products, as well as strength in hardware segment and IP are aiding the company’s growth, as evident from its second-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues that jumped 14.2% year over year to $776.8 million.Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Synopsys, Inc. Quote Notably, the company is gaining traction from acquisitions. In January 2018, Synopsys acquired Kilopass Technology, a provider of one-time programmable (OTP) non-volatile memory (NVM) IP with applications in automotive, mobile, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) areas. The buyout is expected to help Synopsys in offering a wide portfolio of efficient IP solutions.Synopsys is also reaping the benefits of acquiring Black Duck Software, a provider of solutions related to security and management of open source software. Black Duck’s brand recognition as well as cross-selling options are proving to be accretive to the company’s top line.Nevertheless, the company’s escalating costs and expenses, which are thwarting margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the timeline for realization of acquisition synergies remain headwinds.Moreover, the company faces stiff competition from peers like Cadence Design Systems (CDNS  -  Free Report), which might result in lower prices and profits for Synopsys.Furthermore, the company has customer-concentration risk, as a small number of customers account for significant portion of its revenues. This could be risky, as loss of a single customer could affect its operating performance significantly and thereby jeopardize results.However, Synopsys' improving top line along with shareholder-friendly initiatives like the recent announcement of buying back $165 million worth of common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program make this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock worth retaining in the portfolio.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked technology stocks include The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.

QuoteAcquisitions: A Key Growth DriverAcquisitions are central to Synopsys’ growth strategy and are helping it to gain access to newer markets and technologies. Intense competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Mentor Graphics Corporation has made the EDA market tougher to penetrate. Synopsys’ acquisitions have helped it to boost revenues.Most recently, Synopsys acquired Forcheck, which offers static code analysis tools in Fortran applications. These tools meet the industry coding standards and compliances. Prior to that, the company had added Cigital, Codiscope and Simpleware to its kitty.The acquisitions have expanded the company’s product suite thereby driving the company’s top line.

This initiative reflects the California-based company’s sound financial position and favorable prospects.Last Thursday, the company announced an agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association and MUFG Securities EMEA plc in this connection. Per the agreement, Synopsys will initially receive approximately 1.8 million shares, while the remaining shares will be received on or before May 16, 2018, depending on the completion of purchase. The number of shares to be repurchased will be calculated on the basis of Synopsys’ volume weighted average share price during the stated period, after adjusting for a discount.ASR arrangements are an integral element of the company’s overall framework for enhancing investors’ worth. Since fiscal 2015, the company has completed $705 million worth of ASR program.Apart from the ASR agreements, the company has also repurchased its common stock from the open market. In June 2017, Synopsys approved an extension of the company’s existing share-repurchase authorization to make it worth $500 million again. In fiscal 2017, it has repurchased $400 million worth of common stock.Synopsys’ financial strength enables it to continue with the buyback program.

Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip.Nonetheless, the company’s escalating costs and expenses, which are thwarting margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

137,SNPS,"Synopsys Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 29. The company has a decent earnings surprise history having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice while matching the same on two occasions in the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe company’s sustained focus on introducing new products is expected to continue boosting revenues. Moreover, its unique intellectual properties and global support are likely to drive forthcoming results.Also, Synopsys’ time-based license revenue model under which customers effectively rent the software rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee is impressive.  Notably, this is a much more predictable revenue model, providing better visibility through a steady and recurring revenue stream.Additionally, acquisitions are central to the company’s growth strategy and are helping it to gain access to newer markets and technologies as well as diversify and broaden product portfolio. In fact, the company’s continued acquisitions are expected to make a good contribution to its revenue stream.In September, Synopsys had completed the acquisition of QuantumWise. This buyout has not only enhanced the company’s capabilities but has also gained it QuantumWise’s customers. Therefore, we expect the acquisition to boost the company’s fourth-quarter revenues.However, a challenging technology spending environment, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies, and competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Mentor Graphics Corp., remain near-term headwinds.Synopsys, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Synopsys, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Synopsys’ has an Earnings ESP of -1.22%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pure Storage, Inc.

138,SNPS,"ANSYS Inc (ANSS  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 earnings on Nov 1.Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.02%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.79%.For third-quarter 2017, ANSYS expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of 94-98 cents per share. Net revenues are anticipated in the range of $258-$267 million. The company expects gross margin of 90% and operating margin between 47% and 48%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at 97 cents on revenues of $264 million. ANSYS, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  ANSYS, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ANSYS, Inc. Quote Notably, the stock has returned 46.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 36.3% rally of the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Strong Demand for Simulation Tools to Drive GrowthANSYS is a dominant player in the high-end design simulation software market. The company’s solutions are in demand due to the rising complexity in product design. Additionally, increasing demand for energy efficient products is a key catalyst.ANSYS’ strong simulation portfolio is helping it to rapidly grow total addressable market (TAM). This will drive top-line growth in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Moreover, growing recurring revenues base (almost 75%) is significantly positive.During the quarter, the company unveiled ANSYS Discovery Live that supports fluids, structural and thermal simulation applications. The software enables engineers to experiment with design ideas and see instant feedback.Notably, the combination of NVIDIA Corporation’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) graphic processing units (GPUs) and ANSYS Discovery Live simulation software makes result calculations a thousand times faster compared with traditional methods.We note that ANSYS simulation tools received certification from Intel Customer Foundry during the quarter. The company also collaborated with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for an Automotive Reliability Solution Guide, which will help in accelerated development of new-age automotive features.Moreover, collaborations with leading vendors like PTC and Synopsys (SNPS  -  Free Report) are strong growth drivers for the company’s products.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total lease revenues is currently pegged at $95 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of more than 10%.Declining Perpetual License to HurtANSYS expects the transition from perpetual license contracts to longer term, time-based licenses at some of the company’s largest customers (in mature markets like the United States and Japan) to affect software license and maintenance revenues growth in the near term.Moreover, weakness in Europe and adverse foreign currency exchange rates are other major concerns.Further, ANSYS expects to incur additional charges of $2 million ($1.3 million, net of tax), primarily in the quarter, related to additional realignment charges. This will drag profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total perpetual revenues is currently pegged at $54 million, which remains almost flat on a year-over-year basis.Unfavorable ESPWe believe that ANSYS is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the third quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere is a stock you may consider as our proven model shows it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.HubSpot Inc (HUBS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +26.53% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
