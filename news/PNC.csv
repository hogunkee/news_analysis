8,PNC,"Can the future really be female if an unspoken gender gap keeps quietly eating away at women's futures? While women have been shown to outperform men at investing, they tend to shun the stock market for the deceptive safety of cash savings, leaving men to reap the gains — and keep a grip on the world's private wealth.This disconnect between women and Wall Street runs deep. Hollywood portrayals only underscore the divide, from the chest-thumping boys' club in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" to ""Sex and the City"" heroine Carrie Bradshaw. As she once said about investing, in a phrase that launched a thousand Etsy posters: ""I like my money right where I can see it — hanging in my closet.""In the real world, millennial women in particular are financially vulnerable. The investing gender gap can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of a lifetime. That means the difference between being in control of the future and being swept away by the undercurrent of daily expenses.""One thing we realize more than ever these days is that money is power. And that if you don't have as much money as the guys do, it can put you in a tough position,"" says Sallie Krawcheck, CEO of investing platform Ellevest. ""It can keep you in a job you don't want to do. It can keep you in a relationship you don't want to be in. It can keep you from taking that trip around the world, or starting the business you've been dreaming about.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCompared with the average single man, the average single woman's net worth is three times smaller, according to a joint study from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave.Pay equity is part of the equation, compounded by the fact that women are more likely to pause their careers to raise children and take care of aging parents and spouses. Compared with a man with no workforce interruptions, the average woman cumulatively has earned $1.06 million less by the time she hits retirement age.""Women, generally, we're leaning in to our careers and we're becoming much more comfortable around being ambitious professionally. But we're not having that same dynamic (with our money),"" says Jennifer Barrett, a former CNBC personal finance editor and the current editor-in-chief of Grow, a web publication from micro-investing app Acorns. ""It's to our detriment if we don't invest.""No matter where you look, the numbers are pretty straightforward: Compared with men, women are tepid about the stock market. Some 57% of women didn't invest a dime in 2017, vs. 44% of men, according to a recent Acorns study. If handed a thousand bucks, 2.5 times more men than women said they would put that money in stocks. Women also lag men in 401(k) participation and contribution, says the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.Some women are already feeling the fear of missing out.The Merrill Lynch/Age Wave study found that 41% of women said their greatest financial regret was not investing more of their money. That even trumps career, credit-card and lifestyle woes.Thirty-year-old Caroline Rhoads, an account director at a marketing firm in Philadelphia, said Wall Street ""seems very intimidating.""She has consulted a financial planner once, invested around $1,000 through a Robinhood account, and feels good about her 401(k) and financial future. But she invests conservatively, ""because I feel like if I'm going to invest I need to know what I'm doing, and I don't.""Bridging the investing gender gap may seem abstract and distant, particularly for 20-something women mired in student debt, decades away from retirement. But there are serious consequences for not at least trying to get the ball rolling.""In not being comfortable investing, what you're saying is you're not comfortable building wealth,"" says Barrett. And the gender gap there is ""growing, not shrinking, even as women are earning more and closing the wage gap. We still have a gaping wealth gap.""If it's so important, why is there a dearth of female investors? What accounts for this gender gap in the market? More than a couple of things, it turns out.Think back to ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's testosterone-fueled, Martin Scorsese-directed yacht parties, filled with models and bottles. And earlier this year, an E-Trade Financial (ETFC) ad showed men cavorting with bikini-clad women on a yacht. Who wouldn't want to be associated with that lifestyle?Uh, women.""I can't help but equate Wall Street with the a**hole bros filling lower Manhattan bars most nights, who drink too much, act rudely toward women, and generally behave badly,"" wrote Refinery29's Work & Money Director Lindsey Stanberry in a 2016 story on how to invest. ""Do I really want to put my hard-earned money in their hands? (No.)""Ellevest's Krawcheck says the fact that the investing gender gap even exists ""tells me that women are not being well served by the existing investing industry and by Wall Street.""She should know. Her Wall Street cred includes stints as the head of Merrill Lynch and Citigroup's (C) wealth management divisions. Now she is a vocal proponent of something she calls ""financial feminism,"" or wealth equality between men and women.And no, the solution isn't slapping a bunch of pink labels on existing financial products. Of her days at the heavyweights, Krawcheck said efforts to appeal to female investors didn't consider their financial desires.Ellevest's ""gender-aware"" investing algorithms, she says, consider key differences about women. Their salaries peak sooner than men's. They earn less over their lifetimes. They are more likely than men to outlive their resources.So she aims to help investors reach their goals, not beat the market. Wall Street's obsession with outperforming the stock market indexes ""leaves women completely cold,"" she says.Female investors are more interested in reaching certain milestones, such as retiring at a certain income, buying a home or starting a business, she adds.And she's quick to dismiss the notion that women's risk aversion toward stocks drives the investing gender gap.""It's not that she's risk averse, she's risk aware. And the industry has done a poor job explaining risk to her,"" said Krawcheck of female investors. ""When she understands it, she's happy to take it.""But it's true that women are doing less with their money. Financial services startup SoFi found that men contribute 32% more to their investment accounts than women do, and tend to invest more aggressively.Meanwhile, women are equally or more confident than men in paying bills and setting budgets. But they're far less confident about managing their investments, say Merrill Lynch/Age Wave researchers.Maybe that's why female investors keep more of their money in cash. According to an oft-cited BlackRock study from 2015, female investors keep 68% of their portfolios in cash vs. men's 59%.The apparent safety of a savings account, however, is deceptive. Over the long run, hoarding cash is a terrible way to increase net worth. Consider the math: Interest rates on savings are near zero while inflation is now 2%, which means that $1,000 in the bank today is objectively worth less in the future.Additionally, it pays to take advantage of compounding interest.Say you invest $500 tomorrow in a low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500. Then add 50 bucks to that account every month thereafter. Say it grows by an average 8% every year. (Over the last 90 years, the average yearly return for the S&P 500 has been 9.8%, even accounting for crashes.) In 30 years, a no-interest savings account would have grown to $18,500. Your investment in the stock market would have amassed $73,001.26.Still, that's easier said than done for those who don't trust Wall Street. There's a whole generation of women and men who remain deeply distrustful of the stock market. Both the dot-com crash and the Great Recession blindsided them in their formative years.""In a short period of time, they saw two recessions and two market meltdowns,"" says Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride. ""Those memories are fresh. So a lot of (millennials) just never warmed up to equities and have taken a naturally risk-averse stance, detrimental though that may be to their long-term financial health.""Younger people prefer real estate and cash over the stock market, according to Bankrate surveys. And millennial women in particular are in a financially precarious position.""Here's my concern, and it's heightened for millennial women,"" says McBride. ""Millennials are going to have the biggest retirement savings burden in history,"" thanks to longer life spans, fewer pensions, more uncertainty around Social Security, and higher health costs than any generation before them. And holding on to safe-haven assets like gold, he says, is not going to cut it.""To accumulate retirement savings, you need the power of compounding to do the heavy lifting.""Michelle Trejo, a 29-year-old quality assurance engineer in Los Angeles, says that her main vehicle for retirement is her 401(k), though she isn't sure how much she's contributing. Once she saves more money, she is looking to invest in real estate, and then potentially in the stock market.""I wish I knew how to play (the stock market),"" says Trejo, who has dabbled in cryptocurrencies, a far higher-risk investment than stocks. ""I know there's a lot of money there. I just don't know how to get started.""Some experts venture that women get a one-sided directive about what to do with their money: Spend it.""Generally speaking, if you look at who's spending money on clothes and keeping up with the trends,"" says Barrett, ""it's not men. It's women.""Think about how many magazines or style blogs talk about buying ""investment pieces"": a classic necklace, a blazer that will never go out of style. An analysis from purse reseller Baghunter will have you believe that a Birkin bag from Hermes is a better purchase than gold. Of course, that assumes you hold on to the bag for 35 years and keep it in mint condition.""When we talk about buying a handbag as an investment, it makes me cringe,"" said Barrett.That mindset extends beyond the investing gender gap to the venture-capital world.Men with wealth are encouraged to amass more wealth, said The Helm CEO and co-founder Lindsey Taylor Wood at the recent United State of Women conference. Her venture fund invests in female entrepreneurs.""Their buddies are like, 'Get in on this deal, invest in this company, buy this stock,' "" she said. By contrast, ""women with wealth are invited to give their money away. 'Chair this gala, join this nonprofit, be on this board.' ""A notable 61% of women would rather chat about their own death (!) than talk about money, according to Merrill Lynch/Age Wave data.""In our society, talking about money is pretty taboo for women; we learn this from childhood,"" says Ellevest's Krawcheck. ""If you're not talking about money, how do you know what raise to ask for, or how to invest? The answer is: You don't. And women are the poorer for it.""That deep-rooted behavior is encoded early on. In fact, 63% of millennial women vs. 53% of their male peers learned from their parents about saving money at an early age, according to a recent PNC Investments survey. But only 29% of those same women said their parents showed them how to grow wealth, vs. 37% of men.""(There are the) stories that we tell ourselves and the stories that we've heard and internalize,"" says Acorns' Barrett, who is writing a book about the wealth gender gap. ""That investing is hard, that you need to be wealthy to invest. Women in particular get that message a lot. And if you look at the research — even the way parents talk to their sons and daughters about money is different.""Kathy Mirescu, a 40-year-old director of product design, is far from the norm when it comes to enthusiasm for personal finance. It is a quality the Los Angeles resident learned from her mother, a self-taught commercial real estate investor with an accounting background who ""was always looking for investment opportunities and would talk about them"" openly with her three children.""I just grew up not really thinking about it, until I became a lot older, and I started realizing that a lot of my friends, a lot of my peers, who are college educated — a lot of them have advanced degrees — didn't know a lot of the things that I just knew"" about finance, said Mirescu.She bought her own condo at just 29. The down payment came from cash and proceeds from the sale of blue chip stocks that her mother bought for her early on in life.Now Mirescu wants to start an investing club that will help her friends and other women become more financially literate. ""To just simply have a place where we all get in a room,"" she said, and ""help each other set up Roth IRAs.""Acorns' survey found that 42% of women chose Oprah as the person they'd be most likely to take investing advice from. More than half of men chose Warren Buffett.That likely speaks more to women's trust in Oprah than the gender gap, says Barrett. But it also serves to highlight how few female investors are well known on Wall Street.""If you think about really famous investors — can you think of a woman?"" she said. ""We don't have a lot of female role models."" (According to the Merrill study, 45% of women don't have a financial role model, to be exact.)Krawcheck, who took the stage at the United State of Women conference to hearty applause, is an emerging rock star in the realm of financial feminism. At the mention of the Ellevest founder, Mirescu starts ""fan-girling."" (Her words.)She, too, sees money as a ""feminist issue.""""It's about having choices, and money gives you the freedom to have choices,"" says Mirescu.

9,PNC,"SunTrust Banks (STI) and other superregional bank stocks drifted closer to buy zones on Tuesday, leaders on a down day for the broader stock market. After the close, the House voted to ease some post-crisis restrictions on the financial industry.XThe bill, which waters down some Dodd-Frank curbs put in place after the financial crisis a decade ago, will largely help smaller banks. Still, giant bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) were forming bases, while Morgan Stanley (MS) was near a buy point.The Republican-controlled House approved the measures. It is largely expected to pass, and would then arrive at President Trump's desk to be signed into law. The bill cleared the Senate in March.Under the bill, banks would need to have at least $250 billion in assets to be considered systemically important to the financial system, well up from the current requirement for $50 billion. Banks with such a designation are subject to more regulations, including the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe measure also exempts banks with assets of less than $10 billion from the so-called Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from short-term proprietary trading with their own accounts and other investments deemed too risky.The bill is part of a broader deregulation agenda for Trump and the GOP, who argue that passing it will promote economic growth. Democrats warn that lifting the restrictions could lead to a repeat of the risky behavior that got banks into trouble a decade ago.Separately, regulators are reportedly considering changes to the Volcker Rule that would remove some curbs on short-term trading.SunTrust rose 1.2% to 69.59 on the stock market today.

11,PNC,"Looking for ways to cut retirement costs without sacrificing your quality of life? Spending does generally decline in retirement. The real challenge for many retirees is how to cut retirement costs — and by enough to keep spending below income — without resorting to radical, depressing solutions like eating bologna sandwiches five days a week.You work too hard building a retirement nest egg to waste any of the income it provides. So here are experts' tips for cutting retirement costs, often by a lot, in four key areas:How can you put a dent into such a staggering demand on your retirement finances? Exercise and education can make a big difference.Corporate wellness programs are proliferating. Companies offer workers more and more incentives to exercise and change habits having to do with eating, sleeping, smoking and so on. Corporations are not pushing their wellness programs out of altruism. They see financial paybacks in the programs. It stands to reason that you can reap similar dividends by participating in what is in effect your own personal wellness program.Here are the numbers: 57% of workers who were at high risk of cardiac problems because they had such red flags as too much body fat and high blood pressure had switched to low-risk status after six months in a wellness program, according to a 2010 Harvard Business Review study.Those workers' medical claim costs fell by $1,421 on average compared to the previous year. For every $1 their employer had invested in the wellness program, it yielded $6 in health care savings.In a separate, more recent study reported by the Society for Human Resource Management, an employer got a return on investment of $3.80 for the disease management part of its wellness program and an ROI of 50 cents for the long-term lifestyle improvement part.The lesson: at the very least, exercise. If you can, join a wellness program that includes exercise at some place like a local health club or your condo's activities center. The participation cost is likely to more than pay for itself in lower medical costs. ""Retire as healthy as you can,"" said Rich Ramassini, a senior vice president for strategy and sales performance at PNC Investments. ""Then take steps to stay healthy and active. It pays off.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

It cost $6,354 to own and operate a small sedan for the year 2017, according to AAA, the motorist advocacy group. Ramassini says that use of riding-sharing services like Lyft and Uber tends to cost just a fraction of that.Once you do retire, you should have more time to perform maintenance and repair on your own. Stuart Ritter, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, said, ""Maybe you hired other people to do things like care for your lawn and stain your deck. Now you can do it yourself at lower cost because you have more time and flexibility in your schedule.""Are your handyman skills in some areas rusty? You can brush up at many hardware stores, especially big-box retailers that conduct instructional sessions, Ritter says.In addition, retirement gives people the flexibility to book things like flights and cruises at the last minute. ""If you don't mind the uncertainty, that's another good way to save a lot of money,"" he said.Heather Lord, a senior vice president of strategy and innovation at American Funds parent company Capital Group, added, ""As a retiree, you have more time to enjoy free entertainment such as art in the park and free local concerts in parks and libraries and schools."" Those can add up to big savings, avoiding regular full-price admission fees like $25, $50 or $100 or more per person, per event, Lord adds.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeHow To Apply For Social Security Benefits: What You Need To Know

Analysts have said the legislation would likely be a bigger theme this earnings season than the results themselves, as Wall Street tries to assess the full benefits of the bill.Financials also have been rallying in 2018 on higher bond yields, with the 10-year Treasury rate moving past 2.5% this week. Higher yields, including a wider spread between short- and long-term maturities, should bolster banks' profitability in traditional lending.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Blackrock Earnings Rise 21% As Assets Under Management SwellBanks And Financial Stock NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

25,PNC,"New Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that he sees ""at most modest risk"" from high asset prices, despite the generally buoyant stock market. But investors sold shares on concerns that Powell and fellow policymakers will raise interest rates more than three times in 2018 due to stepped-up economic growth forecasts.Asked whether low interest rates have fueled ""dangerous risk-taking,"" Powell noted no real build-up of leverage among households or the emergence of other significant risks to financial stability.Wall Street reacted somewhat negatively to Powell's first monetary policy testimony to Congress since taking the helm of the U.S. central bank, focusing on his outlook for stronger economic growth and what that might mean for the number of Fed rate hikes in 2018.Yet the overall tenor of his testimony probably should be taken as positive, because it suggests a lack of urgency to raise interest rates. The Fed, in other words, remains data-dependent and won't move to tighten policy more quickly due to tax cuts and fiscal stimulus unless inflation gathers momentum. On the stock market today, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at session lows, down more than 1%.Bank stocks fell somewhat amid the broad sell-off. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost a fraction, though JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) were down 1% or more. Banks can reap higher net interest margins as interest rates rise, especially when the long-term yields rise more than short-term yields.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!The 10-year Treasury yield rose 3 basis points to 2.90%, off session peaks but not far off last week's four-year high of 2.95%.""At the December meeting, the median participant called for three rate increases in 2018,"" Powell said in response to a question over what it would take for the Fed to hike rates more than three times this year. ""Now since then — we will submit another projection, all of us, in three weeks  — but since then, what we've seen is incoming data that suggests that strengthening in the economy. We've seen continuing strength in the labor market. We've seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target. We've also seen continued strength around the globe, and we've seen fiscal policy become more stimulative. So I think each of us is going to be taking the developments since the December meeting into account and writing down our new rate paths as we go into the March meeting.""Powell added that it was his ""personal outlook"" as well as the overall committee that ""the economy has strengthened since December,"" when Fed policymakers last offered their economic and policy projections for 2018.Powell's upgrading of the outlook is hardly a surprise, coming after Congress backed a $300-billion-plus increase in federal spending earlier in February. Even before that, some Fed policymakers had been marking up their economic projections, as noted in the minutes from their Jan. 30-31 meeting.Asked about whether ""profligate fiscal policy"" might require higher interest rates than otherwise by a Democratic committee member, Powell said that the Fed will keep its on eye on the economy, not on the actions of Congress, but he allowed that ""all things equal,"" the appropriate interest rate would be higher when fiscal policy becomes more stimulative.The Q&A seemed to cancel out the seemingly positive reaction to his published testimony. In prepared remarks released before the market open, Powell said that the Fed policymaking committee sees the risks to the economy as balanced between upside and downside risks, even as ""some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,"" especially fiscal policy.The takeaway from the Q&A is that the assessment of balanced risks might date back to the January meeting, before the latest fiscal stimulus.Yet in discussing a possibility that the Fed might discuss adopting an inflation range, instead of its specific 2% target, as a guide for policy, Powell underscored that there's not much reason to worry about an upsurge in inflation.""Generally speaking inflation has been low or stable for 15 years now,"" Powell said.IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Indeed, core inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored personal consumption expenditures price index, hasn't touched 2.5% since 1995. The past two economic expansions weren't tripped up by the Fed having to tamp down an inflation outbreak, but by the bursting of the dot-com and housing bubbles.So when Powell expresses confidence that few troubling signs of excess have emerged, as well as confidence about a stable inflation outlook, investors should see the potential for this economic expansion running for several more years.In prepared testimony, Powell said, ""In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis.""Powell's testimony comes as firms including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are predicting one more rate hike this year than the Fed's own policymakers projected in December. Passage of a $310 billion budget deal in early February, after the Fed's last meeting, also has led economists to mark up their GDP growth estimates and added to concerns that inflation could make a comeback.Inflation and the risk of a hawkish Fed has come back on the radar of investors after the January jobs report showed average hourly wages growing 2.9% from a year ago, up from the Goldilocks readings near 2.5% that persisted in 2017.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes to their tax cuts, saying they would spend part of their tax windfall on higher compensation, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.While details of the January employment report suggested that the reported acceleration in wage gains was misleading, it does appear that faster wage growth is on the way.Although a faster pace of rate hikes can't be ruled out if wage gains and inflation exhibit momentum, Powell's remarks suggest that the Fed isn't predisposed to a faster pace of rate hikes and will continue to give the economy some running room.Arguably, financial markets are leading the Fed and not the other way around. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a four-year high last week after the Fed minutes from the January meeting noted that ""a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?LGI Homes, Toll Bros.

26,PNC,"""Messy and lackluster,"" Jefferies says. ""Isn't great,"" according to Nomura-Instinet. ""Noise,"" says Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Those are words being used to describe big banks' fourth-quarter earnings season, which starts Friday, with results due from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).The good news, perhaps, is that Wall Street might not care that much.X After a year dogged by lackluster trading activity, flattening yield curves and occasional concerns about loan growth, business confidence and long-term rates, the financial community seems likelier to be more interested in the longer-term benefits from the tax reform signed into law last month and trends for the year ahead.""While results may underwhelm some investors, we believe the bigger story for 4Q will be tax guidance,"" Nomura-Instinet analyst Steven Chubak wrote in a research note last week, adding that management should offer more detail on future tax rates and more obscure parts of the tax bill.The more U.S.-exposed banks — such as Bank of America (BAC), which reports on Jan. 17, and JPMorgan — are likely to get the biggest bounce to earnings, he said.As for the fourth quarter: Trading? That'll be bad, again, compared to last year, when the markets' gears were still grinding away to process President Trump's election. Loan growth, particularly in commercial and industrial lending? Could be better, due to seasonal factors, KBW says. But one-time charges related to Trump's new tax legislation will soak the banks' profits during the quarter.JPMorgan is seen reporting earnings per share of $1.69, down 1%. Revenue is seen up 7% to $24.99 billion.Jamie Dimon, the bank's CEO, has been a longtime evangelist for tax reform and deregulation. Over the summer, Dimon said it was ""almost an embarrassment, being an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s**t we have to deal with in this country.""Wells Fargo, which is also likely to be a big gainer from tax reform as it tries to repair its reputation after a fake-account scandal, is expected to report EPS up 1% to $1.04. Revenue is expected to come in at $22.43 billion, a 4% increase.PNC Financial (PNC), which also reports Friday, is seen growing EPS by 12% to $2.20, as revenue grows 8% to $4.17 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.As the industry looks out to the year ahead, analysts generally think 2018 will be a better year for the banks. But they remain mixed over where, and when, the benefits will land.Among the benefits to expect, Chubak cites rate hikes from the Fed — which would bump up rates on things like credit cards and auto loans, and healthier deal making amid more clarity over tax policy. But weak fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading could extend into this year.While business-loan growth might be stronger in Q4, it could be muted in the first half of the year, as ""companies are expected to slow borrowing until all the ramifications of the tax bill are sorted out,"" KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote.Goldman Sachs (GS) reports Q4 results next Wednesday, and Morgan Stanley (MS) reports next Thursday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Fierce Bitcoin Critic Now Has 'Regret'; Kodak Joins Blockchain WaveBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetMorgan Stanley To Take $1.25 Billion Hit For U.S. Tax RevampGoldman Sachs Takes One-Time $5 Billion Hit From U.S. Tax Bill

29,PNC,"The Federal Reserve late Thursday released annual stress-test guidelines that will test more big banks and pit the likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) against a tougher economic obstacle course than last year.X But the new rules shouldn't affect the thing that Wall Street tends to care most about when the exam results come out in June; the buyback and dividend payouts that the banks typically announce after they pass the tests, an analyst said.The GOP's new tax legislation should be ""a beneficial offset"" in the Fed's annual evaluation of banks' abilities to lend to households and businesses if the economy implodes, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.The banks' pre-provision net revenue — or revenue before factoring for the money set aside to cover losses — should also ""start at a higher point,"" he added.""In the end, our current expectations for capital return are not changing despite more severe stress scenarios,"" Kleinhanzl wrote.Each year, the Fed's stress tests lays out three economic scenarios, each with different degrees of severity, that the banks have to prove they have the capital cushion to navigate.The harshest scenario this year, what the Fed calls the ""severely adverse"" scenario, envisions a severe global recession, with U.S. unemployment rate rising by nearly 6 percentage points to 10% by the third quarter of next year. That rise is a bit more than the roughly 5.25 percentage-point increase, still to 10%, in last year's scenario.And by that time, under this year's scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak, compared to 6.5% last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's tests outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Housing and commercial real estate prices would also slide. ""Severe recessions"" would trample the eurozone, the U.K. and Japan.Also, the severe test would include ""a global aversion to long-term fixed-income assets."" As a result, the Fed said, long-term rates would not fall and yield curves would steepen.The Fed said it's dialed up the bleakness in this year's tests because it wanted a ""test of the resilience of large firms when current economic conditions are especially strong.""JPMorgan shares were down 2.2% in the stock market today. Bank of America was off 1.7%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 4.5% and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost 3.4%. Citigroup (C) eased 2.75% and Wells Fargo (WFC) lost 2.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The annual grading of the banks' resilience in a crisis features two parts. First, the Dodd-Frank Act stress test shows how banks' capital would hold up under the different economic scenarios. The second, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), evaluates the banks' capital planning procedures and capital adequacy, and looks at their plans for rewarding investors with dividends and buybacks.The banks have until April 5 to submit their capital plans to the Fed. Results will be announced by June 30.Last year, all 34 banks subject to the tests passed. And the banks have gotten used to the grading process. A flood of press releases from the banks, announcing dividends and buybacks, tends to follow once they pass the second and final round of the tests.This year, 38 banks total will be tested. The Fed for the first time will also test five foreign companies with U.S. operations.The Trump administration's tax reform has mangled the buyback plans of some of the companies subject to the tests this year. American Express (AXP) said it would suspend its buyback plans for the first half of the year due to a one-time hit to profits caused by the legislation.Capital One Financial (COF) also said it would cut its buyback offering nearly in half due to a similar charge.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:JPMorgan Chase, PNC Financial Beat; Wells Fargo MixedGoldman Sachs Weighs In On Cryptocurrencies As Trading Lags Peers

34,PNC,"Bank of America (BAC),  JPMorgan Chase (JPM), PNC Financial Services (PNC), Suntrust Banks (STI) and Zions Bancorp (ZION) all topped buy points Wednesday, at least intraday, as the Trump-backed GOP tax plan boosted Treasury yields and the stock market generally. Several other big banks are close to entries, while Citigroup (C) continued to rise after breaking out earlier this month.XThe tax reform would slash the corporate rate to 20% from 35%, while reducing personal income tax rates. Banks would benefit from the lower tax rates directly, as well as from stronger economic growth and the resulting impact on Federal Reserve and market interest rates.The continued courting of buy points by bank stocks comes a week after they neared buy zones following the Fed's still-bullish for raising interest rates and its decision to slim down its massive portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.

35,PNC,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average pared overnight losses Friday morning with Hurricane Irma bearing down on Florida. The U.S. dollar fell for a seventh straight session as Treasury yields neared the key 2% level.XS&P 500 and Dow futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were flat against fair value. The major market averages are trading modestly below all-time highs and slightly above their 50-day moving averages. The euro rose to its highest levels vs. the greenback in nearly three years while the Japanese yen set a 10-year highs. Gold futures continued to advance. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to a 10-month low of2.03% after a sharp drop on Thursday.Not coincidentally, bank stocks were big losers on Thursday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) undercut a buy point, the SPDR Financial (XLF) bank ETF, fell below its 200-day line and industry leader Citigroup (C) dropped below its 50-day line. Morgan Stanley (MS) knifed below its 200-day moving avergage while Wells Fargo (WFC) and several superregional bank stocks hit 2017 lows.The current retreat is just one reason to steer clear of bank stocks. Hopes for tax cuts and other Trump agenda items continue to fade. Interest rates and yield spreads have steadily declined. And over the long term, bank stocks have not outperformed. The case for avoiding bank stocks was clear at the end of May; the evidence is even stronger today.Bank stocks briefly outperformed in late 2016, especially following President Trump's election win. But since early 2017 most banks began to follow the market, with clear underperformance in recent weeks, with several signals along the way.Bank stocks rallied after Election Day in part on hopes for sweeping tax cuts, which would lower their own IRS checks as well as bolster economic growth and interest rates, and accelerate Federal Reserve rate hikes. But the odds and timing of a tax hike have steadily declined, with Goldman Sachs now predicting that the odds of tax reform are down to 40%. On the positive front, the Trump administration is still making moves to ease crisis-era financial regulations, potentially freeing up capital for lending and buybacks.With the Trump agenda stalling, Treasury yields have been sliding for weeks. The 10-year Treasury yield fell sharply on Thursday to fresh 2017 lows, in part due to euro gains on European Central Bank hints of tapering asset purchases. The yield is at its lowest levels since Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election. Meanwhile, the spread between short-term and long-term yields has been falling sharply. That's bad news for banks, whose traditional profit model is borrowing short and lending long. It's also not a great sign for the economy when the yield curve flattens out.Bank stocks can be solid investments over certain periods, including right after the election. But they haven't tended to outperform the S&P 500 index significantly over time. Citigroup has been the best-performing U.S. bank stock in 2017, but its Relative Strength line is back about where it was at the start of the year. That means that Citi is trading even with the S&P 500 index. Looking further back, JPMorgan has been one of the better financials, but its shares haven't been long-term outperformers.Investors might be better off buying a broad index fund or ETF, which often will have financials as big holdings, to provide similar performance without the sector or single-stock risk.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Hold Serve, But Banks Face Break PointFour Reasons You Should Withdraw From Bank StocksThese 5 Dow Titans Are Near Buys In Bullish BasesTrump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman SachsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksBanks And Financial Stock News

39,PNC,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose strongly Tuesday morning while Dow futures jumped about 240 points while Bitcoin and other digital currencies plunged on renewed talk from South Korea about banning trading.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings early Tuesday. Citigroup (C), , CSX Corp. (CSX), Comerica (CMA) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) all report today.X Citigroup and Dow component UnitedHealth Group closed Friday near buy points, with caveats. CSX is the first rail operator to report this week, while Interactive Brokers precedes Charles Schwab (SCHW) on Wednesday. Citigroup and super-regional Comerica kick off a new wave of big bank earnings.S&P 500 futures were 0.5% above fair value. The dollar's recent weakness continued vs. major rivals, hitting a 2-year low vs. the Chinese yuan. Dow futures popped 1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.7% against fair value.Bitcoin fell 9% to $12,335.19, according to CoinDesk after falling as low as $11,182.71. South Korea's finance minister stressed that banning cryptocurrency trading is on the table. Ethereum lost 14% and Ripple 20% vs. 24 hours earlier, according to CoinMarketCap. That follows further signals from China to crack down on Bitcoin mining in that country.The No. 1 U.S. insurer reported before the opening bell Tuesday. UnitedHealth earnings rose 23% to $2.59 a share, beating views for $2.50, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue climbed 9.5% to $52.06 billion. UnitedHealth also raised its 2018 EPS forecast.UnitedHealth rose 2.7% to 234.78 before the opening bell on the stock market today. That suggests a move above a 231.87 buy point from a flat base.But the relative strength line, with tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the end of November, actually hitting a consolidation low on Thursday.Ideally, a stock's RS line (the blue line in the charts below) should lead or confirm a breakout.A strong breakout could push the RS line to at least a short-term high over its pseudo-handle.  Flat bases do not have handles, and this brief pause was not long enough to qualify as a handle in any other pattern, but it's still something for the RS line to try to top.UnitedHealth also is the first managed-care company to report for the latest quarter, with several in or near buy zones. Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) moved into a buy zone Friday, joining Humana (HUM), though none of the breakouts came on impressive volume and their RS lines continue to lag. Aetna (AET) and WellCare Helath Plans (WCG) are near buy points but with lagging RS lines.Citigroup reports early Tuesday as well. EPS should edge up 4.4% to $1.19, with revenue edging up 0.5% to $17.09 billion.Citigroup has a flat base that's a half-step above a prior flat base, which was just above yet another flat base. The buy point is 78.02. Shares rose to 76.84 on Friday.But Citigroup, which outperformed the RS line from early June to early October and generally outperformed rival banks over that span, has had a declining RS line since then.Citigroup follows bank earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) on Friday. Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report later this week.Comerica also reports Q4 earnings early Tuesday, with analysts forecasting a 31.5% EPS jump to $1.21 billion with revenue climbing 13% to $819 million.Comerica shares have risen 7.2% in January and are well extended from any buy point. The stock's RS line has been rising for the past four months.Rail giant CSX delivers Q4 results after Tuesday's close. Analysts expect a 14% advance to 56 cents even as revenue slides 5% to $2.88 billion. This is the first report after CSX named James Foote CEO in December following the death of veteran railroad exec Hunter Harrison.CSX's stock is modestly extended from a 55.09 buy point. Shares briefly tumbled on news that Harrison was taking a leave of absence followed quickly by his death, but shares didn't fall quite enough to invalidate the buy point. Also, shares found support at their 200-day line and never closed below their 50-day.CSX's RS line initially confirmed the Nov. 30 breakout. But the RS line hasn't made headway since then, and has generally been lagging for more than six months.Later this week, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) will report quarterly results. Canadian Pacific is in a buy zone while Kansas City is near a flat base buy point, but both have lagging RS lines.Interactive Brokers reports will issue results late Tuesday. Revenue should more than double to $399 billion with earnings sprinting to 39 cents  a share vs. 7 cents a year ago.Shares cleared a short consolidation last week, hitting new all-time highs.

40,PNC,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.""Companies with businesses that are primarily domestic-focused tend to have higher tax rates on average. Similarly, small-cap stocks, which are generally more U.S.-centric, could see strong earnings revisions,"" wrote William O'Neil chief investment strategist Randy Watts and senior equity analyst Romeo Alvarez. Among S&P 500 sectors, ""Energy currently has the highest corporate tax rate and would see major relief.""The data show Marathon Oil (MRO) with a 49.9% effective tax rate and ConocoPhillips (COP) paying a 46.9% rate.Energy stocks were big winners Thursday. Conoco Philips jumped 3%, nearly breaking out to a buy zone on the stock market today. Marathon Oil was among the many energy stocks moving toward entry points. Diamondback Energy (FANG) did blast out into buy range in strong volume.CVS Health (CVS) has a 38.9% effective tax rate, tops among consumer staples companies, according to William O'Neil data. Aetna (AET), another high-tax company, is being acquired by CVS as it braces for the entry of Amazon.com into the retail prescription business. CEO Larry Merlo said recently that CVS would take some of its tax windfall and reinvest it in reconfiguring its stores to provide more health services.RELATED:6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechHere's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Will Boost Profits At These Banking GiantsFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market Leadership

44,PNC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most from corporate tax cuts among major U.S. banks, followed by PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC), finds a new analysis by Goldman Sachs.X Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden sees an average 13% boost to bank earnings in 2018 from a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, factoring in some other tax changes that would act as a drag on earnings. Those other changes include a new limit on the deduction of FDIC premiums paid by banks, which would cut most big banks' earnings by 1%, as well as changes in international taxation and the loss of various tax credits. Banks with a bigger international presence generally would get a more modest boost to profits.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Wells Fargo earnings are seen getting a 17% boost from the GOP Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, followed by 15% for PNC, 14% for BofA, 12% for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and 8% for Citigroup (C).Goldman also notes that most banks it follows will write down deferred tax assets because the tax legislation limits their ability to deduct past losses, denting after-tax profits. Citigroup said earlier this month that it expected to take a $20 billion charge related to the tax bill, including roughly $16 billion from deferred tax assets. The Financial Times reported that Bank of America may lose $3 billion due to loss deduction limits.Bank stocks outperformed the broad market on Monday, even as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite recorded moderate gains and scored all-time highs.Wells Fargo rose 1.76%, BofA 1.5%, Citigroup 1.2%, PNC 0.9% and JPMorgan 0.8% on the stock market today.RELATED:Federal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksCongress To Vote On Tax Bill; Micron, FedEx Report: Investing Action Plan

46,PNC,"Are there any mutual funds that hold Dow Jones Industrial stocks like Boeing (BA), McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) and also beat the broad stock market in both total return and yield?For many investors — especially people interested in retirement income — finding a mutual fund whose total return and yield top the stock market is the holy grail of investing.You can find such stock mutual funds. One place to look is among top-performing dividend-oriented stock funds. Several hold leading stocks that are approaching buy points or are within buy ranges.But be wary of dividend stock mutual funds that have only outperformed over relatively short recent periods.For example, the broad market measured by the S&P 500 scored a total return — share-price gain plus income — of 11.56% this year through July 24. The $93.1 billion American Capital World Growth & Income Fund (CWGIX), just to name one, did much better, galloping ahead 16.26%, according to Morningstar Inc. It holds Boeing along with many other stocks with attractive yield.But how risky would it be to bet on that fund going forward? World Growth & Income's longer-term performance is not as impressive as its year-to-date performance. Its five-year and 10-year average annual gains of 12.35% and 4.62% both lag the S&P 500's 15.47% and 7.33%.So, rather than looking for a fund that outperformed over a short recent period, look for long-term, consistent outperformers.Check out dividend-oriented stock mutual funds that have existed for at least 10 years. And consider confining your search to funds that have at least $100 million in shareholder assets. Those funds have survived long enough and satisfied enough shareholders to show that they are not unproven flash-in-the-pan portfolios.There are 544 such funds. And 61 of them average an annual total return higher than the S&P 500's in the past 10 years.That group's average 12-month yield is 1.59%. That lags the bogey's 1.91%, measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).Still, some individual stock mutual funds among those 61 outperformers do have 12-month yield that tops the S&P 500's.The three with the best 10-year average annual returns, whose yields also top the S&P 500's, are $1.1 billion Pimco StocksPlus Small (PSCSX), up an average of 12.07% a year; $1.4 billion Hennessy Gas Utility (GASFX), up 9.09% on average; and $13.9 billion AIG Focused Dividend Strategy (FDSAX), with a 9.07% average yearly gain. Their yields range from 2.36% by Hennessy to 4.33% for Pimco.The AIG fund, whose yield is 2.93%, holds stocks such as Boeing (BA), which is up 53% this year through Aug. 2. The aerospace manufacturer and defense contractor sports a 93 Composite Rating from IBD. Composite Ratings range from 1-99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.And Boeing is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.In addition, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.4%. It has boosted dividends five years in a row, according to dividend.com.AIG Focused Dividend also owns McDonald's, which is up 30% this year and yielding 2.4% and Caterpillar, up 24% and yielding 2.8%.Caterpiller is looking for a rebound in earnings, with analysts expecting growth of 51% and 24% this year and next following an average decline of 21% the past three years.The $522 million Nicholas Equity Income (NSEIX) is yet another one of the 61 funds whose 10-year average annual return and its current 12-month yield are better than the S&P 500's. The fund's yearly return over the decade is 8.54%. Its 12-month yield is 3.32%.One of the stocks helping Equity Income is PNC Financial Services (PNC). The bank holding company stock has a 2.3% dividend yield. Up 11% this year, shares are trading around 130 and are approaching a 131.93 entry point.Microchip Technology (MCHP) is another holding. Brian Demain, manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise Fund (JANEX) — which also holds Microchip Technology but is not a dividend-focused fund — recently told IBD that the company gets most of its revenue from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that are used in a wide variety of products.

47,PNC,"The Federal Reserve's hawks and doves agree on one thing: The time has come to begin scaling back the $4.5 trillion balance sheet bloated by market interventions in the wake of the financial crisis.XWhile divisions appear deeper over how the Fed should adjust its key overnight lending rate, its usual monetary policy tool, policymakers could announce a change in reinvestment policy — letting its portfolio gradually run off as mortgage and Treasury bonds mature — at any time, including on Wednesday.An announcement at the end of the Fed's two-day meeting this week wouldn't rank as a huge surprise. Although a Bloomberg survey of Fed watchers gave just 13% odds of a reinvestment change on July 26, most observers expect it to happen at the next meeting on Sept. 19-20. Still, an earlier launch could have a few repercussions, albeit ones that are likely modest in scope.Shifting reinvestment policy this month would send a few not especially welcome signals to investors. One signal would be that Fed committee members are getting a bit nervous about equity and other asset values. Another would be that the hawks aren't convinced by the recent muted inflation data and want to maintain flexibility to hike rates earlier than December, when market pricing suggests the next hike will come.On the margins, a reinvestment shift on Wednesday would likely be positive for bank stocks like Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup (C) and Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which have mostly been sidelined in the latest phase of the stock market rally that was abetted by dovish signals from the Fed.On Tuesday, as the Fed began meeting and The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index registered its highest level for present conditions since 2001, the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 6 basis points to 2.31%. Meanwhile, Citigroup gave upbeat earnings projections at an analyst meeting. Citigroup rose 3.1% to 68.16 in afternoon trade on the stock market today, near its recent 7 1/2-year high.Morgan Stanley popped 1.9% to close at 47.61 and remains within a buy zone after breaking out of a cup-with-handle base on July 19, clearing a 46.76 entry. Bank of America climbed 2.4% to 24.48 and is closing in on a buy zone above 25.11. JPMorgan rallied 1.7% to 92.80 and remains within a buy zone above 89.23.Meanwhile, superregional bank PNC Financial Services (PNC) advanced 1.7% to 129.33. PNC broke above a cup-with-handle buy point at 128.35.IBD'S TAKE: Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the top-rated companies in the Banks-Money Center and Banks-Super Regional industry groups based on earnings, revenue, margins and stock performance.Economists see a gradual move away from the Fed's current stance of reinvesting all principal from maturing bonds as likely to put upward pressure on long-term interest rates. Goldman Sachs figures the shift could raise the 10-year Treasury yield by 20 basis points over time. That would contribute to an upward sloping yield curve, a positive for banks' net interest margins.Another potential impact of a Fed reinvestment policy shift on Wednesday might be a halt to, and partial reversal of, the dollar's recent dive to its lowest level in more than a year. The falling dollar, at least partially a response to expectations of a more patient Fed, is a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals such as Dow components Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA) and Microsoft (MSFT) and has helped support the current rally.Fed chief Janet Yellen's July 12 testimony to Congress, along with a speech by leading Fed dove Lael Brainard the prior day, helped spark the current stock rally. Yellen made clear that the softening in inflation since March had ""made it difficult to form a consensus view"" on near-term interest-rate policy, wrote Ward McCarthy, Jefferies chief financial economist.For now, Yellen will be content to watch the data for clearer evidence that inflation is on the rise because the Fed can begin scaling back its balance sheet in the interim. While the initial reductions will be quite modest, up to $10 billion per month, the Fed members have signaled that they want to have a window to implement the change while holding rates steady to avoid any market turbulence.Brainard offered an even more dovish outlook for policy than Yellen, insisting that rate hikes must pause, but allowing that a reinvestment shift was warranted. Yellen is sure to take the deal, the only question is whether it will become official on Wednesday or in two months.RELATED:Morgan Stanley Earnings, Trading Revenue Push Stock Into Buy ZoneFed Chief Yellen Won't Fight The Doves Yet; Stocks FlyDraghi Drama Undercuts Key Stock-Market Support

48,PNC,"The latest list of new buys by top performing mutual funds shows strong demand for stocks in sectors like health care — UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), building — NVR (NVR) and Thor Industries (THO), and chips — Applied Materials (AMAT) and Microsemi (MSCC).X Defense and financial stocks are also well represented, with Boeing (BA), Heico (HEI), Bank of America (BAC) and T. Rowe Price (TROW) making the cut.While Donald Trump and Republicans battled over how and whether to repeal and replace ObamaCare, mutual funds invested over $1 billion in just two managed care companies. Sixty-six funds scooped up approximately $805 million of shares in UnitedHealth, and 46 funds invested just over $600 million in Aetna.Additionally, 50 funds picked up $367 million of shares in Cigna (CI).That high level of institutional demand is reflected in the share prices of both stocks, which have climbed steadily higher in recent months. The consistent support along the 10-week line seen in the charts for Aetna and UnitedHealth is another indicator of how fund managers have been stepping in to protect and add to their positions.Outside of health care, big bets were also placed on BofA ($490 million), Boeing ($253 million), superregional bank PNC Financial Services (PNC) ($376 million) and Applied Materials ($214 million).On the flip side, credit card giants Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped the list of the latest sells by leading funds. The net number of funds selling Visa (99 selling minus 56 buying) was 43, while the number for MasterCard was 39.Despite that selling, both stocks have continued in an upward trend.E-commerce and cloud computing services behemoth Amazon (AMZN) was also on the sell list, with 26 more funds selling than buying.Since reporting a 78% decline in earnings growth for Q2 on July 27, Amazon has been pulling back and is trying to find support at its 10-week line.RELATED:Top Fund Managers Are Buying These 4 Highly Rated StocksTop Fund's Picks Include Stocks Within Buy Ranges Like Global Payments

57,PNC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial (PNC) are expected to confirm on Friday that financials had a lackluster second quarter, yet bank stocks are near long-time highs.XBanks have largely telegraphed declines in their trading results, which have been hurt by calmer markets and muted client activity. JPMorgan Chase CFO Marianne Lake, at a conference in May, said that there had been fewer ""idiosyncratic events"" to jolt trade in Q2 — think recent populist agitation like Brexit or President Trump's election — and that more such incidents were were needed.Other difficulties could hang over the results. The Federal Reserve's recent rate hikes have helped push up short-term interest rates. But long-term interest rates also fell during the quarter as doubts grew over Trump's ability to carry out an agenda intended to spur long-term growth, a story from Dow Jones noted this month.The banks' earnings, which are expected to be roughly flat except for PNC Financial, will also come after lending activity cooled in the first quarter. Gains in the 10-year Treasury yield — which influences the value of mortgages and other types of credit — slowed for much of the quarter.But bank stocks have been faring well in recent weeks. JPMorgan and Citigroup have hit longtime highs, while Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo and PNC Financial, among others, are near buy points.""July earnings will feel like the middle of the swimming test with 60 seconds of treading water,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in a research note. ""You're looking forward to the freestyle sprint up next.""""Deregulation is the next catalyst for the money centers,"" she added, referring to the global money center banks.Analysts' hopes have been raised by a recent Treasury Department report that called for broad financial deregulation  — much of which could be pushed through without congressional approval, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said.

And he said he expected the bank to emphasize the progress of its credit card investments, including a co-branded deal with Costco (COST). Still, questions remain about the write-down Citigroup might take on its deferred tax assets if tax cuts make it through Congress.Citi's results will also come days before the company's first investor day since before the financial crisis.""Its earnings call could serve as a preview to its Investor Day on July 25 (first in over 9 years), where we expect management to lay out a more detailed blueprint to higher investor returns,"" Goldberg said.Shares climbed 10 cents to 67.02. Citi rose to 68.91 on July 3, the highest since January 2009.EPS is seen up 1% to $1.02; revenue is expected to edge up 0.6% to $22.287 billion.Barclays analysts said that the brunt of the fallout from Wells' sham-account scandal — in which reams of fake accounts were created in an attempt to hit sales goals in a high-pressure environment — may be in the past. However, the firm said that bad press could still ""persist for some time.""Others suggest that if the bank turns out strong loan growth, those troubles could shrink further into the past.""For WFC, we expect a rebound in loan growth will help buoy investor concerns about lost business momentum at the company, and this should drive shares higher if there is no collapse in the net interest margin,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.Wells Fargo rose 0.8% to 55.60.

59,PNC,"The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow industrials all rose slightly Thursday, with more stocks setting up new possible entries within sound bases. Here are six big-cap stocks that are within 1% of buy points: Amgen (AMGN), General Motors (GM), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), ASML (ASML) and PNC Financial Services (PNC).XGeneral Motors has a $54 billion market cap, and that's the smallest of the six, with Visa No. 1 at $200 billion. Amgen, GM, Mastercard and ASML all edged past entry points intraday, but closed beneath them.The market uptrend is under pressure, with earnings season kicking into high gear. So investors should be especially cautious about taking on new positions now.Amgen rose 1% to 175.04 in Thursday stock market trading. The biotech's stock rose as high as 176.20, briefly passing a 175.55 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, but couldn't hold that level. Volume was below normal, though the highest in three weeks.Amgen hasn't been a market leader lately. Its relative strength line is well off recent highs, as Amgen lags the S&P 500 index. And several other biotechs, including Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN), have already broken out.General Motors rose as high as 36.12 Thursday afternoon, briefly passing a 36.10 cup-with-handle entry. GM settled with a 1% gain at 35.86 in slightly above-average volume. Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) cleared buy points Thursday, following a move by Ferrari (RACE) on Wednesday.General Motors' RS line has been lagging. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales have peaked, though a shift to SUV and truck purchases is supporting profits.Visa climbed to 96.65 intraday, a new all-time high, but not quite triggering the 96.70 buy point from a flat base. Visa reversed to closed down 0.25% at 95.94.Mastercard edged up 19 cents to 125.47, rising intraday to 126.40, briefly topping the 126.29 flat-base entry.Volume was below average for both Visa and Mastercard, but their RS lines are near highs, reflecting their strong performance and short consolidations.However, several other payment stocks have broken out this week, including PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ).Visa has earnings next week, along with a few other card firms such as American Express (AXP), which is still in range from a June breakout.Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial could provide insight into credit card trends Friday with their second-quarter earnings reports and conference calls.The chip-equipment giant fell 0.1% to 136.85. But for the second straight day ASML inched past a 137.37 buy point in a flat base going back nearly two months. ASML's RS line is near highs, a good sign.ASML will report quarterly earnings next week.PNC Financial is a superregional bank. It may be overshadowed by the money center banks JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, but PNC is expected to deliver a 10% EPS gain, while its larger rivals deliver essentially flat profit. PNC rose 0.1% to 127.38, as it builds toward a 128.35 entry in a shallow cup-with-handle base.JPMorgan is still in range from a double-bottom base, while Citigroup is extended. Wells Fargo is close to a buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern.RELATED:The Big Picture: Analyzing Apple's Stock; 3 Big Bank Earnings DuePeak Auto?

62,PNC,"Bank of America (BAC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) were breaking past aggressive buy points on Thursday, a day after those and other banks passed the annual Fed stress tests and announced higher shareholder payouts. But they were struggling to hold onto those entry areas with S&P 500 and other major averages retreating.XThey join JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which cleared a double-bottom base on Wednesday, and Citigroup (C), which was moved out of a consolidation earlier in June. JPMorgan shares rose 1.5%. Citigroup advanced 2.8%, now extended from buying range.The Fed late Wednesday cleared the nation's largest banks to hike shareholder payouts, and most banks within minutes announced they would raise dividends and share buybacks.However, Capital One Financial (COF) will have to resubmit its capital plan by the end of December to ""address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices,"" the Fed said.Bank of America rose 1.8% to 24.33 in the stock market today, closing below an aggressive buy point of 24.45 after hitting 24.67 intraday. The stock has a conventional flat-base buy point of 25.90.Bank of America late Wednesday announced a $12 billion stock buyback and a 60% dividend hike to 12 cents a share.Meanwhile, the superregional bank PNC Financial Services popped 1.5% to 125.28, past an aggressive entry of 124.54 and rising to 128.25 soon after the open. The stock has a conventional flat-base buy point of 131.93. PNC raised its dividend by 36% to 75 cents and authorized $2.7 billion in buybacks.Comerica (CMA), another superregional bank, was trying to clear the handle of a cup base with a 73.51 buy point. Comerica initially broke out on June 13, but fell back below that level and found support at their 50-day line. The stock was up 1.2% to 72.78 after rising as high as 74.97. The bank said it would repurchase up to $605 million in stock and raise its dividend 15% to 30 cents per share.KeyCorp (KEY), which bumped up its dividend to 11 cents and approved an $800 million buyback, rose 1.85% to 18.72, off intraday highs of 19.10. The stock is in the handle of a cup base with a 19.19 entry.RELATED:JPMorgan, BofA, Goldman, Citi Pass Stress Tests — Now Pay Me!Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading Revenue

63,PNC,"The Trump tax cuts were met with bleak poll numbers and high skepticism among Americans about their tilt in favor of corporations and the highest-income groups. Yet barely two weeks after passage, roughly 1 million workers have been awarded bonuses that companies attribute to the GOP tax legislation, according to a running list by Americans for Tax Reform, and a few million more are in line to get small cuts in their utility bills.X Still others will benefit from bigger corporate matches for 401(k) accounts, as well as a new $15 minimum wage adopted by at least 20 banks, including Wells Fargo (WFC), U.S. Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial Services (PNC), in the wake of tax cuts.Among the biggest announcements have been $1,000 bonus awards by American Airlines (AAL) (127,000 employees); AT&T (T) (200,000); Bank of America (BAC) (145,000); Comcast (CMCSA) (100,000); Southwest Airlines (LUV) (55,000); and U.S. Bancorp (60,000). The generosity of those announcements was undercut somewhat by reports that AT&T and Comcast were in the midst of layoffs.Meanwhile, a number of electric utilities have announced plans to cut power bills, sharing their tax-cut windfall. Customers of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) subsidiary Pacificorp and Exelon (EXC) subsidiaries Pepco, Baltimore Gas & Electric, and Commonwealth Edison stand to benefit.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Even before the tax cuts begin to show up in paychecks in February, take-home pay has been surging at a rate that's almost unmatched since recession hit in 2007, the exception being a spurt that coincided with 2017's bonus season that runs through the end of March.Over the past 10 weeks, federal withheld employment and income taxes have surged 7.4% from the same period a year ago, an IBD analysis of Daily Treasury Statements finds. That's far faster than the roughly 5% growth in tax receipts implied by 2.5% average wage gains and the roughly 2% growth trend in aggregate hours worked in the economy, so bonuses and other incentive pay likely explain the surge to a large extent.The big political question is whether such displays of corporate generosity begin to shift sentiment about the Republicans' legislative achievement and improve GOP prospects in the midterm elections. From an economic standpoint, the question is how fast will the economy grow in 2018 and how much growth will result from this instant gratification from tax cuts.Most economists have fairly moderate expectations for growth this year, with JPMorgan Chase's economics team seeing 2.5% GDP growth in 2018, thanks to a 0.3-percentage-point lift from tax cuts. But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that he thinks ""4% economic growth this year is possible.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

65,PNC,"If there is one thing about which most economists understand and agree it's the law of supply and demand. A derivative of that law is that demand and velocity of transactions tend to diminish as costs increase.  While few individuals disagree about this, many in the collective body of economists have become so politicized that when it comes to the cost of variables such as taxes and regulations, that consensus all but vanishes.XIndeed, to listen to many of the pundits and experts there seems to be confusion, denial and disagreement about how the cost of regulations and taxes actually affect economic activity.Last year a University of Chicago Booth School of Business survey of so-called top economists — including Nobel Prize winners and former presidents of the American Economic Association — found that only one in 42 economists polled thought that the Republican tax reduction bill would boost the economy.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveRecently, Princeton economics professor and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Blinder stated in the Wall Street Journal that there was little economic evidence ""that tax benefits showered on corporations will translate mostly into higher wages and vastly faster economic growth.""It's not at all difficult to grasp the reasons for the markedly different economic performance of the Obama years as compared to what we have experienced in just one year of the Trump administration. Obama's best year of his two terms delivered a 2.6% growth rate, and he was the only president in some 88 years (since Herbert Hoover) to have failed to deliver economic growth of 3% in any one year he was in office.In contrast, in the first two full quarters of the Trump administration, the economy experienced 3.2% growth.During his eight years, Obama oversaw an output of some 3,069 regulatory rules and nine new taxes that were part of the ObamaCare health law, adding nearly $900 billion in costs to the U.S. economy, and a record 572,000 pages to the Federal Register. In contrast, in his first 11 months, Trump has eliminated some 66 significant rules while adding only three,  which equates to a ratio of 22 to 1  — far exceeding the standards of his Executive Order 13771 requiring 2 old rules to be eliminated for every new one added.The stock market closed out 2017 with a record increase for the eighth year of economic expansion, largely due to deregulation and anticipation of tax cuts.No sooner had the ink dried on President Trump's signature on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, than more than a dozen companies, such as AT&T, Comcast NBC, Boeing, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Kansas City Southern, announced special $1,000 bonuses to more than 300,000 employees, and tens of billions of dollars of spending increase on plant, capacity, facilities and workforce development.2018 has come in like a lion with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivering more headline news.  Now it's reported that more than one million American workers at some 60 companies will be receiving pay raises and/or bonuses — undeniably attributable to the reduction of corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%.  Wells Fargo, PNC, Bank of America, Fifth Third Bank,  and BB&T,  to name just a few — all cranked up minimum wages paid to $15/hour and spread the new found wealth anticipated from tax savings in generous bonuses to more than a hundred thousand employees.President Trump said from the beginning that lowering tax rates, simplifying the tax code, and making American companies more competitive would be the fuel that propels our economy to new heights.It's baffling that political bias can obviate empirical evidence and common sense.  One surely doesn't need a Ph.D. in economics to grasp how tax and regulatory costs affect behavior.By helping companies become more competitive through lower tax rates, a simplified tax code, incentivized capital investment, and removal of regulatory barriers, President Trump and the Republican Congress have actually delivered, in the first year of working together,  the essential foundation to make America great again. Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

67,PNC,"The U.S. economy added 148,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, the Labor Department said on Friday.Wall Street economists expected a gain of 190,000 jobs and steady 4.1% jobless rate.X Average hourly wages rose 9 cents to $26.63 an hour, up 2.5% from a year earlier. That was in line with the expected 2.5%, still the Goldilocks reading markets enjoyed throughout 2017.Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures moved higher after the jobs report, with the major indexes hitting record highs early Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped after the jobs and wage data that bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to go slow in hiking its key interest rate.The continuation of tepid average wage gains comes amid a recent surge in federal withheld employment and income taxes. Over the last couple of months, Americans' paychecks have been growing at nearly the best rate in a decade.The stronger tax receipts may reflect a sugar high padded by early Christmas bonuses — AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) were among the companies pledging $1,000 bonuses for hundreds of thousands of employees as tax legislation crossed the finish line.Meanwhile, a host of big banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB) have announced a $15 minimum wage since tax cuts passed.

69,PNC,"As President Trump and the GOP celebrate their $1.5-trillion-tax-cut victory, Americans' paychecks are growing like they haven't for a decade.X The big question is whether this is a sugar high padded by early Christmas bonuses — AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) were among the companies pledging $1,000 bonuses for hundreds of thousands of employees as tax legislation crossed the finish line — or the start of a sustainable pickup for wage growth and the economy, and Friday's jobs data may start to provide some early hints.Wall Street expects another solid payroll reading — thought not as robust as Thursday's ADP report showing a 250,000 rise in private-sector payrolls — with 190,000 nonfarm jobs added in December and the unemployment rate holding at a 17-year-low of 4.1%. Still, forecasters expect Labor Department data to show that the tepid 2.5% annual gain in average hourly wages continued last month.Yet federal employment and income taxes withheld from worker paychecks are telling a merrier story. Over the past 10 weeks, federal withheld taxes have surged 6.8% from the same period a year ago, an IBD analysis of Daily Treasury Statements finds. That's far faster than the 5% growth in tax receipts implied by 2.5% average wage gains and the roughly 2% growth trend in aggregate hours worked in the economy.A multitude of factors is likely contributing to the faster rise in aggregate pay. Faster wage growth, spurred by the tightening labor market, could be among them. Target (TGT) hiked its minimum wage to $11 an hour from $10 in October. A host of big banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB) announced a $15 minimum wage after tax cuts passed, but those didn't take effect in time for December's jump in tax receipts. Wells Fargo hiked its base wage from $13.50 an hour.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, which helps produce the ADP employment report, attributed its strength to a strong Christmas selling season. ""Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls.""Target's wage hike came as it was seeking to recruit 100,000 workers for the holidays. Meanwhile, for the second straight year, Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would give employees more hours rather than hire seasonal workers, so longer workweeks on top of solid payroll gains could be padding paychecks. Wal-Mart last raised its base wage to $10 an hour in February 2016.A bigger Christmas bonus season is likely part of the story. After a year of huge stock gains and in anticipation of tax cuts in 2018, it wouldn't be surprising if bonuses were running ahead of the prior year's pace. The year-end bonus season runs through March 31, the deadline for deducting them from the prior year's pretax profits. And tax receipts spiked at the end of bonus season last March, briefly sending the growth in tax receipts to levels not seen since 2007.Now tax receipts are again breaking above the trend that has prevailed for a decade. Yet, given the individual and corporate tax cuts, the logical time for companies to pay bonuses will be early in 2018. That will allow corporations to deduct them against 2017 profits, when they'll face a higher tax rate, yet allow individuals to recognize the income in 2018, when they'll face a lower tax rate.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Wal-Mart Near Possible Buy PointCongress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

70,PNC,"With President Trump's signing of the big tax-cut bill, the GOP snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. Suddenly, the political and economic landscapes have changed. The Republican party has turned the tables on the Democrats.Trump and the GOP are on the side of the growth angels with the passage of powerful tax-cut legislation to boost business investment, wages, and take-home family pay. The Democrats, meanwhile, are left with stale class-warfare slogans about tax cuts for the rich.XIronically, government unions, with their pension plans heavily invested in equity shares, will benefit hugely from the tax-cut-led stock market boom. They boo the GOP bill while they should be cheering.But there's a lot of irony to go around. Unlike the pro-growth, tax-cut party of JFK, today's left-lurching Democrats root against economic growth, the stock market, and a powerful prosperity at home that lends strength abroad.This is not a good place for Democrats to be.If the supply-side business tax cuts perform as well as I believe they will, Trump and the GOP, with the stroke of a pen, will have greatly enhanced their outlook for the midterm elections.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveOne of the more incredible things about this story is the almost immediate support of large companies. Bank of America (BofA) announced $1,000 bonuses tied to the tax-cut bill, affecting 145,000 employees. And AT&T and Comcast announced $1,000 bonuses for more than 300,000 people combined, along with substantial new investments in the United States. Ditto for Boeing.And more banks have joined the parade. Wells Fargo, PNC, BB&T, and Fifth Third are raising their minimum wages to $15 an hour.And all this is tied to a massive corporate-tax-rate deduction from 35% to 21%. This is the most powerful growth measure in the plan. Trump called it ""tax love"" in a tweet.At the old 35% rate, our companies took home 65 cents on the extra dollar. At the new 21% rate, they'll take home 79 cents. This enormous 21% incentive rewards new risk-taking, investment, a recycling of overseas profits to the U.S., and additional after-tax profitability.Combined with 100% immediate cash write-offs for new investment, and the one-time repatriation of foreign-held earnings, this is the largest supply-side stimulus since 1986.The result will be a business boom, where new capital formation and productivity increases the economy's potential to grow. This is counter-inflationary. And we can say goodbye to 1% to 2% secular stagnation and hello to 3% to 4% long-run prosperity.And when you toss in lower marginal tax rates for individuals and the doubling of the standard deduction, you have even more potential for growth.A recent Tax Foundation analysis from Scott Hodge notes that even the low-ball Joint Committee on Taxation agrees that the tax cuts pay for themselves. How? More GDP will be generated than revenues lost to the Treasury. For every $1 lost, the tax cuts produce roughly $1.90 in additional GDP.Also from the Tax Foundation, the biggest tax-liability reductions come to the middle class. A single, $52,000 earner claims a 36% reduction in tax liabilities. A married, filing-jointly family making $85,000 gets a 20% tax-revenue reduction.And a married, filing-jointly family earning $2 million only gets a 3% reduction in tax liabilities. So much for the tax-cuts-for-the-rich argument.And let's not forget, inside the plan, there's drilling access to ANWR and repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate. And let's also not forget the Trump administration's massive reductions of burdensome business regulations.At the end of the day, the success of the Trump tax cuts will not be decided by Democrat-leaning polls or highly flawed econometric models. The proof in this pudding will be in the eating.With the supply-side model of lower marginal tax-rate incentives to work, save, and invest, plus significantly less tax avoidance and sheltering, the economy will move back to its normal, steady-state pattern of 3% to 4% growth.Already, in the past two quarters, we're seeing a bump in business-equipment investment, producing better than 3% growth.

73,PNC,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 rose early Thursday, fueled by JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and other big financials rallying on buyback and dividend hikes after they passed the second round of stress tests.X S&P 500 futures rose 0.3% above fair value, Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3% while Dow futures gained 0.2%.On Wednesday, the Dow's JPMorgan Chase and a few other financials broke out into buy range as the major averages rebounded from Tuesday's sell-off. JPMorgan rose 2% to 89.82, topping an 89.23 double-bottom entry. JPMorgan popped above 91 late Wednesday after announcing a $19.4 billion buyback and hiking its dividend 12% to 56 cents. Citigroup, which broke out June 8, rose more than 2% on its capital return plans — a $15.6 billion buyback and doubling its dividend to 32 cents — signaling a move out of buy range.Many other banks also gained ground overnight, with several poised to flirt or clear buy points on Thursday. They include Bank of America and superregionals PNC Financial (PNC), Comerica (CMA) and Keycorp (KEY).IBD'S TAKE: JPMorgan Chase is often viewed as the best-run Wall Street bank. But its stock is rated fifth in the Bank-Money Center group. See which are the top-rated banking giants, and how they stack up vs. objective criteria, at IBD's Stock Checkup.Bank of America will repurchase $12 billion in stock and increase its payout by 60% to 12 cents a share. BofA stock rose 1.5% to 24.23 in late trading after rising 2.6% to 23.88 in regular stock market trading Wednesday.Bank of America has a conventional flat base buy point of 25.90. But an aggressive investor could see 24.45 as an early entry.PNC Financial lifted its dividend to 75 cents, up 36%, and OK'd a $2.7 billion buyback. PNC stock rose 2.5% to 126.50 in late trade after closing up 1.9% to 123.40.PNC has a flat base buy point of 131.93. But it has an aggressive entry of 124.54.Comerica will buy up to $605 million in shares as its payout climbs 15% to 30 cents. Shares rose 1% to 72.69 after hours. Comerica edged up just 0.2% at 71.94 in the regular session.Comerica cleared a 73.51 cup-with-handle buy point earlier this month, but fell back below that level on June 20. The stock found support at its 50-day line and has rebounded modestly, leaving the old entry area still valid.Keycorp raised its dividend by 11% to 11 cents and announced an $800 million buyback. Keycorp advanced 1.2% to 18.60 after hours following a 1% gain during the regular session.Keycorp has a 19.19 cup-with-handle entry.Japan's Nikkei rose 0.4% intraday Thursday, while China's Shanghai composite climbed 0.2%.RELATED:JPMorgan, BofA, Citi, Wells Fargo Hike Payouts, OK Massive BuybacksThe Big Picture: Nasdaq Shows It's Still The Leader, But One Thing Was MissingWalgreens, Nike, Micron To Report As Dry Spell Nears: Investing Action Plan

74,PNC,"U.S. stock indexes rushed upward at the opening bell Wednesday and built on the gains in midday action. New highs included Caterpillar (CAT), a Dow Jones industrial average component; Jagged Peak Energy (JAG) from IBD's IPO Leaders screen and smart home software provider and IBD 50 name Control4 (CTRL).XThe mix of new highs from both enduring and innovative spaces is a sign of strength.The small cap Russell 2000 zoomed 0.9% higher, and the Nasdaq matched the gain. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.7% and 0.5% respectively.Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges, reversing a recent trend. Up days have been coming in falling volume and down days in rising volume — the opposite of what bulls prefer to see. But Wednesday's strong price moves in higher volume served as red meat for the optimists.Finding losers was a challenge. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, winners led losers by a 47-to-1 ratio. Food and dairy products led the losers, and even that was a good sign. Generally, food is considered a defensive niche.Computer-related groups and oil stocks were notching big gains.Two items appeared to be reviving the bulls. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in her prepared remarks told Congress that the U.S. economy was strong enough to handle gradual rate hikes.But banks, which are expected to benefit from higher interest rates, were mixed. Citigroup (C), which is extended about 7% from a 62.63 buy point, edged up 0.1%.  JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  slipped 0.3%. JPMorgan is about 2% below a 94.08 buy point, but is about 4% above an alternate entry at 89.23.Why the muted reaction among bank stocks? Part of the reason might be earnings season. On Friday, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial (PNC) will report Q2 results.The second item was oil. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose 1.22 to 46.26. The Energy Information Administration reported a drop of 7.6 million barrels in the week ended July 7. Analysts at S&P Global Platts had expected a decline of 2.6 million barrels. Oil appears to have pegged a short-term bottom June 21, when the price of sweet light crude fell to $42.05 a barrel.RELATED:What A Friend PayPal Has In AppleCleveland-Based Firm Offers Turnaround Play

76,PNC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among the nation's biggest banks that got the OK from the Federal Reserve to hike shareholder returns, the second round of the central bank's annual stress tests showed Wednesday.X All 34 banks tested were cleared to do so, but the Fed had reservations about Capital One (COF), which got a conditional pass. The credit card company and American Express (AXP) had to adjust their plans to pass muster.After the test results, banks started announcing richer payouts:The Fed said that it is requiring Capital One to ""to address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices."" Capital One has until Dec. 28 to resubmit its capital plan.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying the Fed did not object to its capital plan, but the bank did not provide specific figures for shareholder returns.""We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in the statement.Other lenders delivering more capital to shareholders:Shares of JPMorgan rallied 2% late after closing up 2% at 89.82 on the stock market today, breaking out past an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base. Bank of America rose 1.4% late after finishing up 2.6% at 23.88, resurfacing above its 50-day average and approaching a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley rose 1.3% late adding to its 0.2% gain to 44.32, still below a 46.08 entry. Citigroup surged 2.3% late, after rising 1.5% earlier. Wells Fargo added 1.4% to its 2.2% gain at the close, while Goldman Sachs edged up 1.2% late, on top of its 1.3% regular-session uptick.IBD'S TAKE: The stress-test results could give bank stocks a jolt after they've been idling in recent months in anticipation of tax reform and regulatory cuts from President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures and determines how much lenders can pay out to shareholders. Banks will likely begin announcing their dividend and buyback plans shortly after the Fed releases the CCAR results.The results come after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a bold vote of confidence for banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the kind seen in 2008 is unlikely ""in our lifetime.""""I think the public can see the capital positions of the major banks are very much stronger this year,"" Yellen said at a conference in London, noting that regulators are more proactive in detecting threats to financial stability than they were a decade ago.The Fed's confidence in the financial system could mean banks may see some relief in the future from the crisis-era measures designed to ensure stability — or at the very least, they may not face tougher rules. But this year's test results are based on economic scenarios the Fed outlined in February.The CCAR test also contains a quantitative portion as well as a qualitative portion, which looks at a bank's internal quality controls. Twenty-one smaller banks this year, however, were exempted from the qualitative part of the CCAR test.The Fed said Wednesday that most of the 13 banks subject to the qualitative portion this year ""have continued to strengthen their capital planning practices since last year."" But it also said that some banks, despite improvements, ""continue to have areas of weaknesses that fall short of meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.""Citigroup in 2014 failed the qualitative portion, and in recent years Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs received ""conditional passes"" and had to resubmit their capital plans. But banks have largely gotten used to the stress tests since they were first instituted in the wake of the financial crisis.They could become easier as the Trump administration looks to shred big parts of Dodd-Frank financial regulations and fill open positions at the Fed and regulatory agencies.The Fed over the years has tried to balance banks' demands for more testing transparency and its efforts to make the tests matter. The Fed worries that giving banks too much information would make the tests too easy to pass.Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, also floated the idea of requiring fewer banks to take the tests.""We believe that future stress tests will also become easier, and the possibility of banks being exempted from the process or not having qualitative reviews for all banks remains open and possible,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note dated Friday.RELATED:Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

Wells Fargo tumbled 3% lower on earnings and revenue results that missed analyst expectations by wide margins.Apple (AAPL) rose 0.4% and the four FANG stocks shifted firmly higher. Netflix (NFLX) led the group with a 2.2% advance, boosted by a price target hike to 225, from 210, from JPMorgan in a report that maintained the brokerage's outperform rating on the stock.

78,PNC,"The freight train that is the stock market kept on chugging ahead in October, with the S&P 500 tacking on a 2.33% gain to make it 12 straight months of growth, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds jumped on board, advancing 1.70% on average, the 14th monthly gain in the past 15 months.XThe broad market got a lift from such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), 3M (MMM) and Intel (INTC).The October gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, increased odds of corporate tax reform with a possible lowering of the corporate tax rate, and increased likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising its short-term interest rate in the near term, said Jonathan Edwards, a manager of Invesco Value Opportunities Fund (VVOAX). The $839 million fund's 1.64% gain in October topped 69% of its large-cap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.In addition, for the most part corporate earnings have been OK, said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He added that a few individual companies logged disappointments, which helped mute investor sentiment. Sentiment was further dampened by infighting among Republican leadership. That reminded investors that corporate tax reform is not a sure thing, Samana said.With a 3.41% October gain, large-cap growth funds outpaced other U.S. diversified stock fund categories last month. Multi-cap growth funds averaged a 3.08% gain.Douglas Roman, manager of $92 million PNC Multi-Factor Large Cap Growth Fund (PEWAX), attributed outperformance by large-cap stock funds to strong economies in the U.S. and abroad. Large-cap companies are more likely to sell goods and services abroad as well as in the U.S. The PNC fund's 3.98% October gain outpaced 78% of its large-cap growth competitors.U.S. multinationals in particular got a tailwind from the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar vs. the euro, especially later in October, which helped U.S. exports, Roman said.Reflecting widespread global economic growth, world equity mutual funds rose 1.83% last month, topping the showing by U.S. diversified stock funds.India region funds led the way for foreign stock funds, jumping 5.89% last month.Global science and technology funds led the major sectors, rising 5.49% last month.General domestic taxable bond funds gained 0.29% on average in October. Loan participation funds' 0.56% return led all taxables in the month. Muni bond funds were about flat in October.The stock market got an additional lift from the hunt for a new chairperson of the Federal Reserve — who in November turned out to be current Fed Governor Jerome Powell. In October, investors appeared to welcome the prospect that the apparent leading contenders would keep the central bank on its current path of raising rates, said Charles Shriver, manager of T. Rowe Price's $2.3 billion Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $295 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. Balanced beat 87% of its allocation peer group in October. Global Allocation topped 62% of its direct rivals.Going forward, T. Rowe Price's Shriver likes foreign stocks in general more than U.S. equities. ""Fundamentals are positive, but valuations give us a little pause. We are underweight in areas whose valuations are a little more rich,"" he said.Among foreign stocks, ""Japan is an area where we see the cheapest valuations among developed markets.""IBD'S TAKE: Tokyo-based bank holding company Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group was a top holding as of June 30 of $6.7 billion Matthews Asia Dividend Investor Fund (MAPIX), which is a diversified Pacific/Asia fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. The stock edged up 4.4% last month. Earnings per share rose 20%, 44% and 55% the past three months after having declined for five stanzas in a row.On the other hand, lower U.S. corporate tax rates would benefit U.S. stocks, said Invesco's Edwards. ""That favors economically sensitive stocks as well as financials,"" he said.Holdings he likes for those reasons include LPL Financial (LPLA). ""They are one of the largest independent financial advisory firms,"" Edwards said. ""One hundred percent of their profits are from the U.S., so they would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate. And a significant part of their earnings are from interest on customers' cash balances. As interest rates go up, they would earn more on those balances.""He also cites SVB Financial Group (SIVB). ""They're a regional bank (mostly) in California, focused on the technology sector,"" he said. ""A lot of their loans are floating rate. As (the Fed raises) short-term rates, it would increase their net interest margin."" And the large portion of their profit that is based on U.S. revenue would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate.PNC's Roman is overweight in industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. He likes industrials because of the prospects for aerospace and defense firms. Financials should benefit from rate hikes. And he likes the diversity of consumer discretionary. ""From homebuilders to dollar stores, there's always some opportunities,"" he said.As of Sept. 30, among his top holdings were aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and defense contractors Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).He likes auto parts, travel and home furnishings. Auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive (DLPH) was another holding. Smaller holdings included Wyndham Worldwide (WYN).RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Income At Your Age And Income

84,PNC,"BlackRock started out in 1988 as BlackStone Group, a fixed-income shop with eight people.It adopted the name BlackRock in 1992, and in 1995, became a unit of PNC Financial. BlackRock went public in 1999 and had $165 billion in assets under management by year's end.Key acquisitions following its debut included Merrill Lynch Investment Managers in 2006 and Barclays Global Investors in 2009. The latter purchase gave it access to the iShares exchange traded fund platform.Today, BlackRock is the world's biggest asset manager with some 13,000 employees. At the end of Q1, it boasted $5.4 trillion in AUM. It's also the biggest exchange traded fund provider, thanks to a series of strategic mergers and moves.BlackRock continues to stay on top of ETF trends, from its iShares Core series to smart beta to the ubertrendy environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds. We checked in with Jennifer Grancio, global head of iShares distribution, to get the company's take on current trends in the ETF universe as well as its market outlook.""BlackRock's macro view is fairly bullish,"" she told IBD. ""We expect growth to continue to rise, not just in the U.S. but globally.""The full interview with Grancio follows:IBD: Which are BlackRock's most popular equity ETF strategies — and why do you think that's the case?Jennifer Grancio: Cost and quality are top of mind for investors, which is why so many of them are turning to ETFs to build diversified portfolios at the core of their portfolios. These are the broad market exposures — domestic, international, emerging markets, growth, value, small-cap and so on — that can be accessed with an ETF at a fraction of the cost of their traditional counterparts.For example, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), the world's second-largest ETF, offers exposure to large U.S. stocks for just 4 basis points (in fees). The growth of our iShares Core ETF suite reflects this overall trend. We saw $50 billion in U.S. flows year to date, with more than $300 billion in assets in the U.S.I would note that our Core ETFs are as popular with institutional investors as they are with individuals and financial advisors. A recent survey by Greenwich Associates found that 60% of institutional investors use ETFs for their core portfolio allocations.IBD: How does BlackRock differentiate its ETFs from its competitors?Grancio: In addition to iShares being the largest global ETF provider, we offer the most diverse lineup of products to meet the demands of our clients, among them broad exposures, single countries, smart beta, fixed income, sectors and currency-hedged. At a portfolio level, we aim to manage our funds tax efficiently and deliver as close to a benchmark return as possible.Our scale provides distinct benefits that we can pass on to investors. We can access information and realize efficiencies that small shops simply can't provide, whether it's our global trading platform, our deep portfolio management bench or the powerful integrated technology of BlackRock's Aladdin. We also use these resources to make sure we're constantly innovating. For example, iShares launched the first bond ETF 15 years ago; today, we offer 80 fixed income ETFs in the U.S., and we're leading the way in smart-beta bond ETFs.IBD: What's your opinion on the active vs. passive debate?Grancio: The active/passive debate is completely outmoded. Every investment decision is active, whether you're considering an index fund, or, like the vast majority of financial advisors, want to blend active and index investments. What matters for investors today is not, 'Which product should I choose?' It's 'How can I build the best portfolio — at the right price and with appropriate risk — toward the goals that matter most to me?' And pursuing those goals is an active, ongoing endeavor.We found that most investors don't make the active/passive distinction, either. According to BlackRock's ETF Pulse Survey, 9 out of 10 investors said that owning ETFs and mutual funds together in a portfolio is a good thing. That said, more and more people are putting their new money to work in ETFs, which is why we're seeing this broad shift in assets from mutual funds to ETFs.IBD: What's your outlook for the U.S. and global stock markets?Grancio: One of our major themes has been reflation, and in fact, we're seeing inflation tick up for most economies, which should have a positive impact on earnings.From an investment perspective, our preference is to go global — to Europe, Japan, and in particular emerging markets, where we think valuations are better than in the U.S. In particular, we believe that small caps, cyclicals and banks could benefit from the reflationary trend. The nice thing about ETFs is that they let you go as broad or niche as you want.IBD: What types of ETFs should investors focus on in a rising rate environment?Grancio: While rates have gradually come up in the U.S., we don't see a big jump in yields anytime soon. So the challenge for investors is to try to minimize the adverse effects of rising rates while still seeking yield that doesn't expose them to too much credit risk.We think a diversified approach is the best way to manage these multiple challenges. For example, ETF investors could look to higher-quality corporate bonds or dividend stocks to enhance their yield potential and also reduce some of the interest rate risk in their portfolios. And shortening the duration of your overall bond sleeve can make you less vulnerable to rising rates while also helping to diversify equity or credit risks.There are also ETFs that are designed to explicitly counter rate rises, such as floating rate bond ETFs that adjust interest payments to reflect interest rate changes. That's a lot to consider and how you invest depends on your personal situation, so we think it's a good idea to ask a professional for help.One option I don't recommend is staying in cash until it all ""blows over."" Trying to time the market is short-term thinking, and a good way to miss gains when the market rebounds.IBD: As fees keep getting lower, how will the providers make money?Grancio: Although the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule only recently went into effect, the attention to cost has been intensifying for some time, alongside the movement to fee-based advice. We think this focus is a very good thing for investors, particularly for their long-term holdings, where low costs keeps more money working for them over time. Our iShares Core ETFs have among the lowest expenses in the industry, which has helped attract meaningful flows to our funds, as I mentioned earlier.It's true that from a provider perspective, lower fees will have an impact on your bottom line. That said, BlackRock's product line spans a broad range of offerings across price points, and reflects what our clients are asking for. For example, there's appetite for investing in frontier markets, which is necessarily more expensive than investing in the S&P 500. Or a large institution looking to move into or out of a position may be seeking liquidity above all else, with less consideration for cost.  No matter who you are, though, smart investing should ultimately be about value — am I getting what I paid for?IBD: How are BlackRock's ESG funds doing in terms of assets?Grancio: Sustainability is important to many investors, from big sovereign wealth funds to millennials. More and more of them want to be able to align their views on environmental, social and governance issues with how they invest for the future. Today, responsible investing is no longer just about staying away from guns, cigarettes and alcohol, but about specifically pinpointing companies that have a positive impact on things like clean water and carbon emissions.BlackRock has a large sustainable investing footprint. In the U.S. there are eight iShares ETFs that focus on one or more aspects of ESG. Two of them — iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI) and iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (KLD) — have track records of more than a decade. And globally, we manage about $4 billion in sustainable ETFs.IBD: Are there any ETFs that don't exist yet but you think should?Grancio: Technology and access to data allow us to index investment styles, markets and strategies that were once the sole province of traditional managers. And ETFs have made it possible for all types of investors to track the performance of these indexes at very low cost. Smart beta ETFs, which isolate factors like value, momentum and low volatility, are a good example.This type of innovation is only going to accelerate as technology evolves. Big data is leading to the creation of more refined, targeted indexes — for example, purer exposures to factors or access to narrow subsectors like robotics.  The result will be an expanded set of choices for investors to build and manage portfolios that really work for them.Note: About the surveysThe BlackRock U.S. ETF Pulse Survey was conducted from September 12—26, 2016, by TNS, an independent research company. The survey interviewed over 1,000 individual investors and 400 financial advisors, from nationally representative online samples of household financial savings/investment decision makers age 21—75, with $100K+ in investable assets and aware of ETFs; and financial advisors age 21—75 with $25MM+ in assets under management.The Greenwich Associates U.S. Exchange Trade Funds Study is based on interviews between October 2016 and January 2017 of 187 institutional investors. That research sample encompassed institution funds, asset managers, insurance companies, investment consultants and RIAs. Participants manage a total $6.668 trillion in assets.RELATED:What Matters Most To Top ETF Pro As He Shakes Up His PortfoliosStrategy Taps 8 Large-Cap ETFs To Dial Up Equity Risk As Economy Improves

85,PNC,"President Trump's hint this month of a breakup of big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hit their stocks hard — for maybe 30 minutes. Then the stocks recovered and finished higher for the day.Little wonder. Financial deregulation looks like it's one of the few Trumponomics planks that investors can count on. Despite all the headlines, chaining off commercial banks from investment banking is probably a nonstarter now in Congress. But Trump has the will — and the political wherewithal — to bust up heavy regulations clamped on banks after the financial crisis.Capital requirements, stress-test thresholds, fee limits and trading curbs are some of the weights that Trump likely will lighten. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also likely will lose much of its budget and authority. These changes could boost bank profits, shareholder returns and M&A activity, as well as boost lending to businesses and consumers that accelerates economic growth.Hope for such deregulation is the reason shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Wells Fargo and other banks large and small shot higher after Donald Trump's election.The stakes are huge: The excess capital that banks hold to comply with stress tests is estimated at well over $100 billion. They could return much of that money to shareholders via buybacks and dividends with the right reforms, such as reducing how many banks face Federal Reserve stress tests. If capital requirements are cut, excess capital could rise as high as $218 billion, Goldman Sachs analysts say.Regional banks also seek regulatory relief. Current rules imposed in the last eight years may discourage them from expanding beyond $10 billion in assets, where they'd face an additional regulator in the CFPB, more compliance and training requirements, and stress tests. Even small community banks face significant burdens, and they appear to have Trump's ear. Complaints include new mortgage-disclosure rules, caps on fees and heightened loan standards.Many local banks say they face unnecessary limits on whom they lend to and the products they offer. Their concerns are reflected in the declining number of banks. Only a few banks have been created since the financial crisis, suggesting that compliance costs and other red tape are too high and stifling new competition.""If I were the CEO of a small or community bank, an asset manager or an insurance company, I would be ecstatic"" over prospects for deregulation, said Douglas Elliott, a partner in Oliver Wyman's financial services consulting practice. ""There's virtually no downside.""For the largest banks, the regulatory outlook is ""more mixed,"" amid some high-level GOP support for Glass-Steagall and raising capital standards, but ""still overall a positive,"" Elliott said.Aligning oneself with big banks is still politically risky. The Republican Party platform molded by the populist Trump campaign endorsed reviving Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that split commercial and investment banking until its repeal in the late 1990s.But Trump's support for the idea was never strong or clear.In a Bloomberg News interview on May 1, Trump was asked if he wanted to break up the big banks. He made no commitment. Some people ""want to go back to the old system, right?"" he said. ""So we're going to look at that.""Those are hardly fighting words. And the reality is that even a tough fight would have a slim chance of winning in Congress, says KBW Washington analyst Brian Gardner. He figures Republicans opposed to Glass-Steagall would demand big concessions, such as killing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Democrats would reject that.By contrast, Trump clearly is serious about rolling back some Dodd-Frank provisions. The law is ""going to be very, very seriously changed so the banks can go back to loaning money,"" he told Bloomberg. Speaking to community bankers that same day, he blasted the law as being ""out of control,"" and ""not only for community banks — for banks, period.""Trump's diagnosis sounds a lot like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's. In an April letter to shareholders, Dimon argued that big U.S. banks should be freed from post-crisis capital requirements that exceed Basel international rules. That would unlock $15 billion of equity capital at JPMorgan and support nearly $190 billion of loans, he wrote.Eliminating the capital surcharge for the eight biggest U.S. banks could boost earnings by 4.6%, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods have estimated.Part of the bank rally after Trump's surprise election was relief that more onerous regulations wouldn't come into being. Not only has the Federal Reserve's regulatory regime been fairly strict for the eight globally systemically important banks, constraining their dividends and buybacks, but it was set to get even tougher if Hillary Clinton had become president, notes Elliott.On tap was ""a significant increase in capital requirements"" for megabanks under a policy outlined in September by Daniel Tarullo, who headed the Fed's committee on bank supervision and regulation. Tarullo turned in his resignation in February in the wake of Trump's victory.""People are policy,"" said RBC Capital banking analyst Gerard Cassidy, and Trump's election is bringing ""an incredible amount of turnover.""Trump's people, Cassidy told IBD, are likely to be ""pro-bank people, pro-business people, which would inevitably lead to more sound, common-sensical"" regulations. ""We do expect to see more returns of excess capital this year and next year, even if the legislation is not changed,"" he said.A House panel on Thursday voted on party lines for legislation that would roll back much of Dodd-Frank. The legislation could clear the full House, but the Senate would be a much higher hurdle.Policy analysts see two legislative ideas with enough support to get to Trump's desk. Elliott expects Republicans to ax the CFPB's budget. Supporters say the CFPB is a long-needed watchdog, citing September's $100 million fine on Wells Fargo for employees illegally opening 2 million deposit and credit-card accounts for unknowing customers. But its crackdown on payday lending has reduced access to small, short-term loans, while its 1,659-page rules on prepaid debit cards could choke off a popular product.As the CFPB shrinks and loses authority in the Trump era, ""restrictions on banking fees will slacken for all banks, which should help boost earnings,"" Oppenheimer Funds portfolio manager Benjamin Ram and research analyst Christopher Mashia wrote in a March analysis.Meanwhile, solid bipartisan support exists for raising the asset threshold by which banks become subject to the Fed's annual stress test, Elliott says. The level could rise from $50 billion to ""between $150 billion and $500 billion,"" he says.In his outgoing speech April 4, Tarullo agreed that the $50 billion threshold was ""set too low,"" adding that Dodd-Frank's risk-based capital requirements are ""unduly complicated"" for small banks.While Tarullo is gone, his endorsement could help pave the way for freeing community banks from Dodd-Frank's additional safety and soundness provisions for ensuring that their risk controls and financial conditions are adequate. There also is broad support for raising the $10 billion asset floor that triggers additional compliance and oversight, including a requirement for banks to conduct their own stress tests.Many superregional banks would be happy to do their own stress tests. In the Fed's stress tests, the agency provides little transparency about how it determines whether capital is sufficient, spurring banks to be ultraconservative in setting dividends to avoid surprises. No bank wants to be in the position of Zions Bancorp (ZION), when it was the only one to fail the Fed's stress test in 2014.Raising the Fed stress-test asset threshold likely would spark consolidation, creating cost-saving opportunities without triggering a special regulatory headache.If Congress raised the Fed stress-test threshold to $250 billion, 21 more financial institutions would be exempt. They include KeyCorp (KEY), American Express (AXP), BB&T (BBT) and SunTrust Banks (STI). Some 13 banks would still face strict scrutiny, with a few superregionals such PNC Financial (PNC) and US Bancorp (USB) still grouped with the globally systemically important banking giants.Prospects for regulatory relief and higher net-interest margins helped vault superregional and regional banks to the top of IBD's 197 industry-group rankings after the election. They held five of the top 10 positions in mid-February. The money-center bank group, including seven of the eight ""systemically important"" U.S. banks, got as high as No. 15. Since then, most bank stocks have fallen below their 50-day moving averages as interest rates have fallen and doubts have grown about Trumponomics, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The big question facing Trump's financial regulators will be whether the pendulum has swung too far toward safety and soundness at the expense of access to credit and economic growth.Under the Fed's stress test, which assumes a severe recession comparable to the crisis that began in 2007, systemically important banks are seen losing a combined $195 billion. But that's less than 10% of their capital of $2.2 trillion.""It's clear that banks can use more of their capital to finance the economy without sacrificing safety and soundness,"" Dimon wrote. ""Had they been less afraid of potential CCAR stress losses (the Fed's capital review process), banks probably would have been more aggressive in making some small business loans, lower rated middle market loans and near-prime mortgages.""Dimon says JPMorgan has turned away $200 billion in deposits from large clients because of new rules requiring that ""capital in many cases must be held on these short-term, virtually riskless activities.""While the biggest banks may not get regulatory relief as quickly as smaller banks, KBW estimates that the giants' earnings could rise 13.5% if ultrasafe assets such as Treasuries and deposits at the Fed are excluded from the leverage ratio, or capital as a percentage of assets.Tarullo's final speech also targeted Dodd-Frank's much-criticized Volcker Rule aimed at barring banks from trading for their own accounts, while still allowing them to act as market makers. He called the rule ""too complicated."" He said it was affecting market making, ""particularly for some less liquid issues.""An outright legislative Volcker Rule repeal could lift big-bank earnings by 4.2%, Goldman has estimated. The chances of that appear negligible, though Trump regulators likely will try to ease compliance.RELATED:Markets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: GoldmanBreakout Watch: Top Financial Stock Jumps Back Into Buy ZoneMorgan Stanley Beats Estimates As Fixed-Income Revenue DoublesGoldman Sacked: Wall Street Giant Blames Politics For Trading Woes

The stock gapped down almost 2% in volume 467% above average.Stocks that start the day with volume spikes in huge percentages often see those percentages slip a bit as the session wears on.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, steel, heavy construction and telecom infrastructure were among the early top gainers. The top losers included wholesale food and diversified operations.RELATED:What The Statistics Say About The Stock Market's Next MoveExperts See Crude Oil Prices As Close To Balanced

92,PNC,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 fell slightly in Sunday evening trading. Dow futures edged down 0.1% while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.2%.The major averages all rose slightly in the past week, with the Nasdaq composite briefly setting an all-time high on Friday.But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), both Dow industrials components, retreated last week, along with Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and a slew of other banks. Several bank stocks, notably Goldman and Morgan Stanley, are testing their 50-day moving averages.The Federal Reserve's decision not to signal faster interest rate hikes after Wednesday's expected quarter-point increase buoyed most stocks. But banks sold off as Treasury yields fell, especially at the high end. Lower yields and a flatter curve between short- and long-term maturities hurts banks' borrow short, lend long profit model.IBD'S TAKE: Financial stocks often are sensitive to interest rates swings, but not all: Here's a big-cap financial stock that in buy range now.JPMorgan, which gapped up at the beginning of March as investors priced in the March 15 Fed hike, fell about 1% in Friday stock market trading, essentially at its lowest levels of the month, but still not too close to its rising 50-day line.Fellow Dow stock Goldman Sachs sank 1.7% to 243.92 on Friday, closing just above its 50-day line. So did the other big pure-play investment bank Morgan Stanley, which retreated 2.8% Friday.Bank of America sank 1.4% on Friday, but is comfortably above its 50-day line. BofA tested its 50-day in early February, then had a solid advance through March 1.Citigroup, which was one of the few big banks to trade below its 50-day line earlier this year, fell 1.3% to 60.37 on Friday. Citigroup crossed a 61.73 buy point several times this month, but never closed above that level.PNC Financial (PNC) is approaching its 50-day line, Regions Financial (RF) briefly undercut that level on Friday, while BB&T Corp. (BBT), Keycorp (KEY) and Suntrust Financial (STI) all closed the week below that support area.Keep in mind that in most of these cases, the stock are not far multi-year highs.In Asian Monday intraday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose to its best levels since 2015.

93,PNC,"The rally in regional banks has moderated, but two ETFs that track the industry are using that pause to refresh their charts.The charts of SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT) look like twins, the way they've behaved so similarly. Both have pulled back from highs reached at the start of March and are testing the 50-day moving average.With a bit more of a bounce, both exchange traded funds will be in buy areas. At the moment, the support at the 50-day line is not convincing enough. Watch for shares of both to climb at least one more point, and preferably in above-average volume.No chart reader would dispute that both ETFs were in need of a break. They shot up starting in mid-November on a combination of rising interest rates and President Trump's election. Trump and Republicans are trying to ease banking regulations, and higher rates are widening interest margins for banks.While SPDR Regional Banking has 100 stocks, iShares Regional Banks has about half as many.Still, the two portfolios are similar in terms of the largest holdings. PNC Financial Services (PNC), SunTrust Bank (STI), M&T Bank (MTB), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), Regions Financial (RF), Citizens Financial (CFG) and BB&T (BBT) are top-10 holdings in both funds.The two differ in that iShares Regional Banks has a big stake in U.S. Bancorp (USB) (more than 16% of the portfolio) while the superregional bank doesn't even make the SPDR Regional Banking portfolio.The holdings of SPDR Regional Banking are more spread out, with no single stock accounting for more than 4% of the total weighting.With the Federal Reserve expected to increase interest rates by a quarter-point two more times this year, the fundamental backdrop for regional banks is generally favorable. Higher rates tend to widen the margin between interest earned on loans vs. interest paid on deposits.LPL Financial, for example, had this to say: ""Steepening yield curve, deregulation, expanded credit access, strong fourth quarter 2016 earnings, and positive revisions are all supportive.""But Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, saw an economic warning sign in the banking sector.

The Dow industrials and S&P 500 are down 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively, after a tough week of Senate confirmation hearings, the first press conference by President-elect Donald Trump and commentary from Federal Reserve officials, as well as the first weakening in oil prices in a month.Reports from big banks set the fourth-quarter earnings season in serious motion early Friday.Bank of America (BAC) traded 1% higher at the open after delivering mixed fourth-quarter results. Earnings narrowly beat views and revenue stopped short of the consensus target.

95,PNC,"Your personal finance plan in 2017 will be like baking a cake. All you'll need is the right recipe. Whether you're investing in stocks, bonds, ETFs or mutual funds in a 401(k) retirement account, now's the time to check to make sure you have the right ingredients at hand.For Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, the recipe involves six ingredients: overweight U.S. stocks in general; underweight 10-year Treasury bonds; and overweight financial services stocks, U.S. small-cap stocks, energy stocks and industrial companies' stocks.Orlando's colleague, Steve Chiavarone, associate manager of $414 million Federated Global Allocation Fund (FSTBX), cites holdings which illustrate that recipe. Among them, Apple (AAPL) could see higher profits if corporate taxes are lowered as President-elect Trump wants. It could also boost stock dividends or buybacks and spend more to develop new products with repatriated cash under Trump's tax proposal. ""Still, Trump has issues with parts of the tech industry, so Apple's may be a more mixed picture,"" Chiavarone said.In addition, a more lenient regulatory environment for banks would convert JPMorgan (JPM) from a something akin to a regulated utility back into a growth stock, Chiavarone says. Oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) should get more mileage out of its run, fueled by rising energy prices, he adds. And construction aggregates producer Martin Marietta (MLM) is poised to benefit from a boom in infrastructure projects.IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta is No. 2 in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete-Aggregates industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 83 IBD Composite Rating and very strong 96 EPS (earnings per share) Rating stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.To Orlando and Chiavarone, the 2017 recipe aims to take advantage of several macroeconomic forces now in play.In financials, $1.2 billion Third Avenue Value (TAVFX) lead manager Chip Rewey says U.S. regional banks are likely to benefit from rate hikes and scaled-back regulation. Their valuations are also relatively low ""since people have shunned them since the financial crisis.""Banks he likes include top holdings Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Comerica (CMA), PNC Financial (PNC) and Keycorp (KEY). All have strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the 80s or 90s.Among other stocks, he said home-builder ""Lennar (LEN) is a new position for Value Fund because housing should do well."" Its balance sheet is improving, it is reducing debt and it is trimming its land bank.He also recently bought shares in Johnson Controls (JCI). Some investors still think of it as a maker of automotive seating, a field it has exited. ""Its hidden gem is its car batteries,"" Rewey said. ""They are a leader in lead acid batteries and in start-stop batteries. And they, not Tesla (TSLA), are the leader in lithium ion car batteries.""In addition, Rewey likes biotech Amgen (AMGN), a relative newcomer to the portfolio, largely ""because the market is ignoring its strong pipeline.""And true to his value orientation, Rewey likes apparel company Ralph Lauren (RL). Earnings per share growth has declined eight straight quarters. The stock's Comp Rating is a dismal 7. ""But Rewey likes CEO Stefan Larsson's turnaround credentials. ""We think it's a great opportunity,"" Rewey said.Lee DeLorenzo, president of United Asset Strategies in Garden City, N.Y., says workers should try to take advantage of the same apparent forces in their 401(k) accounts. At the same time, they should cut their interest-rate risk by shifting 5% to 10% of their weighting in traditional bond funds to stable value funds or flexible, go-anywhere bond funds.She advises increasing exposure to small- and midcap stocks and stock funds. Plan members who can stomach risk, she says, should boost their weightings in financials and energy.Rich Weiss, a senior portfolio manager on a team that oversees 20 American Century target-date, target-risk and asset-allocation funds, says 401(k) plan members should also look at whether the year-end spurt in stock prices threw their target asset allocations out of whack. Does your mix of stocks, large and small, U.S. and foreign, specific geographies and selected sectors, still jibe with your overall financial plan? Your risk tolerance? Your financial goals?If something has grown too big, take profits to rebalance. Keep the proceeds inside your account to avoid an early withdrawal.Plan members who'd rather not make their own investment decisions should leave the heavy lifting to target-date and target-risk funds within their accounts, he says. If you do want to forge your own investment decisions, you can look for ideas at the asset allocations of target date and target risk portfolios that match your situation. ""But doing that may be more expensive and complex than simply purchasing an appropriate target-date fund,"" Weiss added.If your 401(k) does not offer target-date or target-risk funds? Consider investing that same money instead in such a fund inside an IRA, where your investment choices are almost unlimited.In addition, Weiss says, if your 401(k) offers a Roth option, use it if you are young and if your tax bracket will stay the same or rise after you retire. Meanwhile, contributions are not tax deductible. But earnings grow tax-deferred. And withdrawals normally will be tax-free, unlike withdrawals from a regular 401(k) or IRA.Suppose you share the Orlando-Chiavarone vision of what 2017 is to bring. How do you act on it?One approach would be to boost the assets, sectors and geographies that they expect to thrive by 10% in your portfolio. Trim from assets like long Treasuries and emerging-markets stocks. You can tweak those numbers up or down, depending on factors such as your time horizon, risk tolerance, long-term goals and any near-term need for cash.If you're an aggressive investor in your 30s, for instance, you might want to boost your U.S. small caps by 11% or 12%.In any case, first form your 2017 financial action plan, either with your financial advisor or on your own. Then look for securities that can bring that plan to life. It's not all that hard. In fact, reflecting holiday cheer, DeLorenzo said, ""The execution of these changes is as easy as baking a cake.""RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewHot Stocks That Made Craig Hodges A Top 2016 Mutual Fund ManagerWhere Mutual Fund Pros See Big Stock Gains In 2017Here's How To Decide Which Retirement Accounts To Fund First

96,PNC,"In their seemingly never-ending quest for yield, income investors may finally get their fix as interest rates are broadly expected to keep rising into 2017. If this trend, which started in July, is to continue, we may even see the reversal of a three-decade-long history of declining interest rates.But there's one challenge: Some areas of the bond market that generated equity-like returns this year have become overvalued, while many bond mutual funds and ETFs suffered price declines as rates ticked higher since July.In addition, the recent election results have only exacerbated this upward move in yields. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield surged 19 basis points the day following the election and another 26 basis points since, touching 2.45% on Dec. 1. The main reason: Bond markets reacted negatively at the prospect of higher inflation as the Trump administration takes over the reins of the U.S. economy on Jan. 20.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingSo, is there any juice left in the bond market and if so, where? And how can income investors protect themselves in this rising rate environment?""It's been a while since we've had the traditional or inverse relationship 'bonds up, stocks down', and I think we may be headed toward that kind of market,"" said Hugh McGuirk, portfolio manager in the fixed income division and head of the municipal bond team at T. Rowe Price (TROW). Therefore, a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds may be the best way to shield investors against potential price volatility.Nevertheless, certain pockets in the fixed income market may still provide investors with some yield and even potential price appreciation.The fixed income vehicles that first come to mind are Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS. If you're afraid that inflation will chip away at your total return, TIPS are the go-to place.As their name indicates, these securities are backed by the U.S. Government and indexed to inflation, as measured by the consumer price index. They pay a fixed coupon, but their par is adjusted semiannually with inflation movements. Investors can purchase TIPS in $100 increments with five-, 10- and 30-year maturities. Another option is to invest in them through a mutual fund or an ETF that holds them.The $3.6 billion DFA Inflation-Protected Securities I (DIPSX) has 89% of its assets invested in TIPS. It yields 1.04% and only charges a 0.12% management fee. It's up nearly 5% year to date. The $25 billion Vanguard Inflation-Protected Secs Inv (VIPSX) has 66% of its assets in TIPS, yields 0.73% and charges a 0.2% fee. It's up 4.8% this year.In the ETF land, it's important to choose a liquid TIPS fund as many trade less than 100,000 shares a day. The $1.5 billion Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (SCHP) has a daily average volume of 170,000, yields 0.93%, costs just 0.07% and is up 4.8% this year.""Even though we've seen those break-evens widen, we do think TIPS, on a longer-term basis, are well below what we would consider to be the fair value on a 10-year TIP,"" said Sean Rhoderick, chief investment officer, taxable fixed income at PNC Capital Advisors. ""Inflation is going to be moving toward 2% or north of that as we get into the early part of next year, just because of what's happened to oil prices, so long as they don't collapse again."" He believes TIPS are a good way to hedge longer-term risks in a portfolio.The market is now assigning a 100% probability that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in just a few days. But the yield curve shape ""may be less flattening than we tend to expect in Fed rate rising times,"" said Jason Brady, president and CEO of Thornburg Investment Management, and head of the firm's global fixed income investment team.

116,PNC,"A few days ago and for a few hours last night, it looked as if a Donald Trump victory was perhaps the only thing standing in the way of a Federal Reserve rate hike in December.Some economists had even suggested Janet Yellen would have to resign if Trump won, after he attacked her for running a Fed that acted ""more political than Secretary Clinton.""Now, in the light of day, as markets process the likely direction of a Trump presidency, the Fed's green light is back.After tumbling overnight, the 10-year Treasury yield surged above 2%, hitting their highest levels since January. Stocks are rallying solidly in late-afternoon trading, easing concerns that markets won't be able to handle higher rates. The odds of a Fed hike next month, which briefly dipped below 50% overnight, are back to 71.5%.Plus, Trump will be able to nominate two members to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He's warned that ultralow rates are fomenting bubbles, suggesting that he might pick more hawkish policymakers.Shares of U.S. Bancorp (USB), which saw its shares rise to a 52-week high on Tuesday when Hillary Clinton looked like a winner, surged 3.8% to an all-time high on Wednesday despite the altered political reality. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) advanced 5.7% to the top of a 12-month base.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) hit an all-time high, closing up 4.6%. PNC Financial Services (PNC) rose 4.8% to its own record high.IBD'S TAKE: Markets may stay volatile as investors figure out what a Donald Trump presidency means, but don't lose sight of the big picture. For a primer on how to know if the market is ripe for gains and it's a favorable time to establish new positions, visit IBD University. Then read The Big Picture each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend.Now, investors seems to believe, banks can enjoy not only the higher interest-rate environment that will help net-interest margins, but they'll also benefit from a lighter regulatory touch under Trump.What happened to change the mood so suddenly? Credit Trump's gracious speech early Wednesday morning, says Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research.""Trump's speech helped to calm down markets"" because it lacked the aggressiveness that defined his campaign, Bandholz said.Still, Bandholz notes, everything Trump says is now under the microscope. New talk of tariffs, the market's biggest fear, could upset the new equilibrium.During the campaign, Trump threatened to walk away from Nafta unless Mexico renegotiates the agreement under favorable terms for the U.S., and he pledged that his administration would slap the currency manipulator label on China, paving the way for punitive tariffs.Uncertainty about he'll make good on his campaign pledges will likely increase the volatility of the market, Bandholz says. But for now, wage growth has picked up, inflation is rising, albeit from a low base, and there's little chance the data will shift before the Fed makes its next interest-rate decision on December 14.As for Yellen, she has dismissed any charge that the Fed held off on raising rates this year to help Hillary Clinton.""We do not discuss politics at our meetings, and we do not take politics into account in our decisions,"" Yellen said at a post-meeting press conference in September.If she believes in the importance of the Fed's independence, she's unlikely to take the fall because of some rough campaign words.The surge in Treasury yields on Wednesday comes after Trump signaled that his top priority is to get the economy humming — ""we will double our growth"" — via infrastructure spending and tax cuts.Fitch Ratings warned on Wednesday that Trump's agenda could be negative for U.S. creditworthiness since it could potentially put upward pressure on already-rising deficits and debt levels.Yet Bandholz sees little risk that Trump's big infrastructure splurge will lead the U.S. economy to overheat, forcing the Fed to move quickly. He notes that any package will either require Democratic support in the Senate or, if done through reconciliation to get around a filibuster, would have to be revenue neutral.RELATED:The Fed Isn't Ruled By Politics — But Here's Why It Soon Might BeAfter Initial Fall, Stocks May Rally On Trump Victory, Agenda

Here's a broader look at what stocks could drive a potential bull market in the Trump era.The rising yields come as investors anticipate stronger growth and higher inflation due to Trump's plans for tax cuts a wave of new public infrastructure spending. Markets are also betting that the Federal Reserve will raise rates next month, with perhaps more tightening in 2017.Short-end Treasury yields also have risen sharply since the election and in recent weeks, but not nearly as much as the long end. That means banks, which borrow short and lend long, should see higher profitability.Banks could also benefit from fewer regulations under a Trump administration.RELATED:Profit Recession Over, Here Comes The Best Earnings Growth Since 2014Banks ETFs Rise To Build On Trump Windfall, At Best Level Since 2008JPMorgan Hits Record As Banks Extend Gains; CEO Dimon At Treasury?U.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

126,PNC,"Big banks JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got through the second and final round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests unscathed, resulting in a shareholder-returns bonanza shortly after the test results were announced late Wednesday.But Morgan Stanley's (MS) capital plan only got conditional approval, and U.S. segments of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Santander (SAN) failed once againStill, Morgan Stanley said it will move forward with a 33% quarterly dividend hike to 20 cents and a $3.5 billion buyback. JPMorgan OK'd a $10.6 billion buyback but kept its dividend the same. Bank of America announced a $5 billion repurchase program and a 50% payout increase to 7.5 cents. Citigroup will buy back $8.6 billion in stock and raised its payout to 16 cents from 5 cents.Goldman Sachs (GS) didn't give specifics but said its plan included buybacks and a dividend hike. Wells Fargo (WFC)  kept its capital plans unchanged.Morgan Stanley stock were little changed in pre-market trading on the stock market today after rising late Wednesday JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup climbed 2.4%, Wells Fargo rose and Goldman Sachs all rose fractionally. Deutsche Bank, which the IMF said ""poses the greatest risk to the global financial system,"" sank nearly 4% while Santander fell 2%.Other banks also announced bigger returns to shareholders.The Fed only gave conditional approval to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, in which it projected how it would perform under difficult economic conditions for this year's stress tests. As a result, Morgan must resubmit its capital plan and address broader concerns from the Fed by Dec. 29. If Morgan can't deliver on those promises, the Fed said, its governors ""would expect to object"" to the resubmitted plan, potentially hindering Morgan's shareholder returns.While the Fed did not technically object to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, the central bank said the company ""exhibited material weaknesses in its capital planning process,"" including in governance, modeling and other safeguards.""These weaknesses warrant further near-term attention but do not undermine the quantitative results of the stress tests for the firm,"" the Fed said, referring to the portion of the tests that quantifies what banks' capital levels would look like under financial turmoil.The Fed said Deutsche Bank and Santander, both of which also had their plans rejected last year, had tightened up some aspects of their capital planning methodology but still struggled with ""material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine (the) capital planning process.""The results follow a pattern of stress-test one-upmanship between the banks, which have been shoring up capital since the financial crisis, and the Fed, which has tried harder each year to catch the banks off-guard in the scenarios posed in the tests.While the banks that passed can move forward with their dividend and buyback hikes, tougher standards on the horizon could keep payouts restrained this year. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo warned this month that banks in future tests might have to make a ""significant increase"" in the assets they set aside to cushion against a potential economic crisis.The final round of results from the stress tests -- known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR -- came after all 33 tested banks last week passed the first round of the evaluation, which quantifies how banks' finances would be affected against a barrage of market shocks.The Fed outlined the economic scenarios for both tests at the beginning of the year. In the weeks that followed, the banks submitted their capital plans, which this year forecast how they would do amid 10% unemployment, negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries -- among the conditions in the Fed's worst-case scenario.The first round of test results can serve as a preview of sorts to the second, in which the Fed actually indicates whether it accepted, rejected or had any reservations with the banks' capital plans. If it does have an issue, banks could have to temper plans to issue buybacks and boost dividends in order to pass.The second round of tests contains both a quantitative element and qualitative element. The quantitative element measures banks post-stress-test capital levels and whether they could sustain any new dividend and buyback plans. The qualitative element evaluates the soundness of the banks' capital plans and how they were developed.Analysts largely had not anticipated major problems with the banks' stress-test results.

127,PNC,"Except for when the Federal Reserve’s more hawkish tone surprised the markets, fixed income funds posted a rather dull performance in May. The yield curve flattened with increased expectations of the Fed hiking interest rates sooner rather than later.Among domestic taxable bond funds, it was loan participation, flexible income and high-yield funds which gained the most, returning 0.81%, 0.75% and 0.53%, respectively, according to preliminary Lipper Inc. data. Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) and intermediate U.S. government bond funds underperformed the most, falling a respective 0.69% and 0.16%. They are still up 3.4% and 2.14% for the year.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders

128,PNC,"“April was eventful from a return standpoint; May was not,” said Timothy Compan Jr., senior portfolio manager fixed income at the PNC Financial Services Group. “If you look at returns for the month, from an excess return standpoint, the numbers are all pretty small.Longer-term general U.S. Treasury funds rose 0.19%, while investment-grade bonds showed mixed but nearly flat performance, with higher-quality ones outperforming the riskier assets.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance“Credit was a little worse on the month, and most of the structured products, mortgages, asset-backed's, commercial mortgages all had positive excess returns, but we’re talking a few basis points of spread tightening,” said Compan. “High-yield performed well again. That’s the one story that’s interesting. That market continues to do well, especially the riskier credit.”High-yield funds are up 5.8% year to date.Internationally, emerging market local-currency debt funds were the worst performers in May, declining 4.79% as the dollar strengthened. However, they’re still ahead of the pack with a 6.76% jump so far this year. Hard-currency ones fared slightly better, retreating 0.68% in May but still providing investors with a 6.13% return in 2016. Global income funds had a similar performance.In May, “investors (were) reading the tea leaves of the economy to try to ascertain when and at what pace the Fed will raise interest rates,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for private wealth management at Brown Brothers Harriman. “We got some stronger economic data in the middle of the month that drove rates up.”Clemons believes the economy is in decent shape and does not have any major inflationary pressures. His expectation is one more rate hike this year, probably in the fall and not in June.“That’s what’s going to continue to drive volatility,” he added. “I don’t see any real direction in interest rates unfolding until it’s clear the pace at which the Fed will raise interest rates. That’s the clarity the market doesn’t have.”Fed funds futures prices indicate the chances for an interest rate hike in June fell to 4% Friday after a disappointing jobs report. The figure had climbed to a 30% chance following the release of the latest FOMC minutes.Compan notes that an increase in rates won't have the same impact for investment-grade spreads, though high-yield could be vulnerable.Investment-grade corporates have seen strong demand from the eurozone as investors look for more yield. Compan is constructive on the financial sector due to increased regulation and scrutiny, as well as BBB-rated industrial with the view that the U.S. economy continues to be in a cyclical recovery.That said, PNC has been reducing its exposure to investment-grade corporates when spreads tighten.Further, Compan likes AAA-rated asset-backed securities such as credit cards and auto loans, as they provide more yield but are higher quality. He’s also neutral on mortgages but is starting to like them, while TIPS could be vulnerable to a rate hike.One sector that has shown consistently good returns this year are municipal bonds. General and insured muni debt funds advanced 0.41% last month, amounting to a total gain of 2.68% this year. High-yield muni funds were up 0.79% and 3.88%, respectively. Shorter munis were slightly negative.“The big factor has been limited supply,” Jim Grabovac, managing director and investment strategist at McDonnell Investment Management, told IBD. “Somewhat surprisingly, supply has been on the short side of last year’s pace. Throughout the first five months of the year, we’re down in the vicinity of 8% vs. 2015's pace.”All of the declines have been driven by slower refunding issuance, he said. “One of the factors that could change that dynamic would be the prospect of higher rates.”McDonnell’s Grabovac continues to favor quality, as spreads have been compressing for a while, especially in the high-yield debt. As a result, he prefers adopting a more conservative approach.McDonnell’s managing director Dawn Mangerson says yields are still more attractive in the 10- to 15-year part of the yield curve, and sectors she prefers are utilities, higher education, hospitals and transportation.

129,PNC,"Charles Schwab (SCHW) investors are happier than investors with other firms. But investors rank the entire financial industry lower than fields such as technology, food and drink, and pharmaceuticals. Investors’ trust in finance is particularly weak in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, but strong in India and China.Those are the results of new surveys by the CFA Institute and J.D. Power.Schwab tops the list of 21 financial services companies in a poll of investors for the “2016 U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study.” The report, by marketing and information services firm J.D. Power, said, “Schwab has developed an overall client experience that is closely aligned with the evolving priorities of today’s full-service investor.” The next most popular firms, in order, were Edward Jones, Fidelity Investments and UBS (UBS) Financial Services.At the bottom of the list are LPL Financial (LPLA), PNC (PNC) Wealth Management, Lincoln (LNC) Financial Network and, lowest of all, Voya Financial (VOYA).The financial services industry as a whole ranks below most other industries in “From Trust to Loyalty: A Global Survey of What Investors Want in 2016.” The survey comes from the CFA Institute, which calls itself “a global association of investment professionals.”The technology world ranks at the top; 77% of the survey’s respondents (3,312 retail investors from 10 countries and 502 institutional investors from six countries) say that they trust the tech industry “to do what is right.” In second place (68%) comes the food and beverage industry, followed by brewing and spirits (65%), pharmaceuticals (64%), banks (63%) and telecommunications, energy and consumer packaged goods (62% each).Financial services ranked under all of those industries: 61% of retail investors and 57% of institutional investors said that they trusted the industry.The survey’s other industries were automotive (60%), entertainment (55%) and, coming in dead last, media (47%).The level of trust varied from country to country, the CFA Institute reported. In India, 90% of the survey respondents said that they trust the financial services industry. Just below India was China (89%). From there, the level of trust fell hard: only 64% in Canada and Hong Kong, 63% in Singapore, 55% in France, 54% in the United States, 50% in Australia, 44% in the U.K. and 40% in Germany.

Small caps had an even better day than the general market on Wednesday, with both the S&P 600 and the Russell 2000 surging 2.2% (vs. 1.5% for the Nasdaq and 1% for the S&P 500).Thursday's economic calendar opened with consumer prices, which the Labor Department reported eked up 0.1% in March. That was an improvement over February's 0.2% decline, but short of expectations for a 0.2% rise. Core prices, minus energy and food, also rose 0.1%. Consensus estimates projected a 0.2% increase.Unemployment claims dropped sharply to 253,000 in the week ended April 9. That was nearly 5% below the prior week's downwardly revised number, and well below expectations for 267,000 claims.Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said he changed his mind about an April rate hike and will no longer support it.

131,PNC,"China's latest headline economic figures show that growth is stabilizing and even accelerating, giving a boost to U.S. multinationals and global activity overall. But China's reliance on debt-fueled stimulus may not be sustainable, analysts warn.China grew 6.7% during the first quarter vs. a year earlier, the smallest gain in seven years, Beijing reported Friday local time. But that matched estimates and was only a slight deceleration from Q4's 6.8% expansion.  Also, other economic reports, including retail sales and industrial production, found growth accelerating in March.But even setting aside the usual doubts about whether Chinese economic statistics can be trusted, some analysts worry that China's economy is being propped up by increasing financial leverage and escalating real estate prices.""It could take a few years before that is exposed -- as we know from our own economy in the last slowdown,"" according to Gil Luria, managing director and analyst at Wedbush Securities.The U.S. exposure to China is somewhat limited, comprising barely 1% of U.S. GDP. But stronger Chinese growth could be a boon to U.S. corporate giants, from Apple (AAPL) to United Technologies (UTX) to Starbucks (SBUX).Meanwhile, U.S. and other global stock markets have rallied strongly from early February lows.Crude prices have moved back above $40 a barrel, along with big gains in iron ore and steel prices. That's bolstered commodities-sensitive industries.""The indirect price effect is the most important channel through which Chinese growth affects the U.S.,"" according to William Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services.But questions remain about China, Adams said. In Q1, the three major sectors of the economy -- agriculture, industrial and services -- decelerated from Q4 more than the aggregate growth rate.Retail sales grew 10.5% in March, picking up from 10.2% in February, but China includes government purchases in that number, making it somewhat unclear if actual consumer spending is accelerating.Meanwhile, government measures bolstered China's flagging real estate sector, which had been hampered by a glut of development.Investment in fixed assets such as factories and buildings grew 10.7% in Q1, better than expected. Cement production climbed 24% last month compared to a year earlier. Crude steel production gained 2.9% in March compared to the 5.7% decline during January and February.But private firms' investment rose just 5.7% vs. 23.3% for state-owned businesses. China's state-owned enterprises tend to be less efficient than the country's dynamic private sector.Social financing, which includes bank and nonbank lending, soared to a record high in the first quarter, raising concerns that China has been throwing money at the problem.Still, after a bumpy start to the year, China's policymakers have engineered a soft landing, steadied the yuan and slowed capital outflows.""Chinese fiscal stimulus has cushioned the first quarter slowdown and has reduced the downside risks to near-term global growth,"" Adams said.The world's No. 2 economy is in a well-publicized and long-term transition from an industrial, export-based economy to one led by services and domestic demand. The Chinese consumer's share of GDP rose two points year over year to 56.9%, but that remains far below U.S. numbers.Reform plans to rationalize laggard SOEs have been mooted; Beijing is wary of reforms that would cut millions of jobs. Next year, a lot of provincial officials are up for potential promotions or demotions, according to Sung Wohn Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. They don't want to risk weak economic figures or widespread labor unrest.Accelerating growth in China and improved global financial markets, even in the short term, should give the Federal Reserve hawks a little more impetus to tighten U.S. monetary policy.""They're more likely to raise interest rates now,"" Sohn said.

132,PNC,"The stock market rallied nicely at the open Wednesday as overseas factors, earnings reports and economic data all influenced early trade.The Nasdaq led the way, rising 0.9%. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 picked up 0.7% each.The stock market today benefited from a positive mood started in Asia. China's March exports surged 12% from a a year ago, the first rise in eight months, according to the General Administration of Customs. Imports declined less than 8%, vs. a 14% drop in February. The export improvement was partially due to a sharp drop in exports in March 2015. Strong exports were also helped by a weaker yuan.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index responded with a 3.2% gain. The Shanghai Composite climbed 1.4%. In Japan, the yen continued lower against the dollar, helping send the Nikkei 225 ahead 2.8%.The positive tone carried over into Europe, where markets pushed strong gains in afternoon trade. The CAC 40 in Paris and Frankfurt's DAX traded up more than 2% each. London's FTSE 100 showed a 1.4% gain.The overseas momentum helped compensate for the drag caused by oil and gold, both of which traded briskly lower. West Texas Intermediate traded down 1%, but held firmly above $41 a barrel. Gold futures were off nearly 1% to $1,250 an ounce.In U.S. economic news, inflation received a tame report card, as producer prices eased 0.1% in March, the Labor Department estimated, well below the 0.3% increase expected by consensus forecasts. Declines in cost of services apparently offset rebounding energy prices. Core prices, minus energy and food, also dipped 0.1%, vs. forecasts for a 0.2% increase.Retail sales also dropped in March, down 0.3%, Commerce Department data showed. Consensus expectations called for a 0.1% increase. Minus automobiles, sales rose 0.2% -- below the consensus estimate for a 0.4% gain.The Census Bureau offers up February business inventories data at 10 a.m. ET, followed by the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventories report at 10:30. The Federal Reserve's beige book report is due out at 2 p.m.JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) paced the Dow in the early going, rising 3% each.JPMorgan outperformed after its Q1 report showed earnings and revenue falling less than anticipated. JPMorgan's Q1 results showed consumer and community banking growing net income 12% on a 4% rise in revenue. Investment banking revenue dropped 24%.Other banks tapped into the momentum. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) -- all scheduled to report results on Thursday -- rose 2% apiece. Overseas banks were also in serious motion: Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) leapt 6%, London-based HSBC Holdings (HSBC) swung up 5%. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Lloyd's Banking Group (LYG) and UBS Group (UBS) all climbed 3%.Among other companies reporting quarterly results, Adtran (ADTN) jumped 4% after a positive report late Tuesday. Railroad CSX (CSX) rose 1%, as revenue missed and earnings just met analyst consensus estimates, but management reported firmer pricing and rising volumes in automotive and other segments.Beyond earnings, biotech drug maker Medivation (MDVN) sparked up 8% after Bloomberg reported the company had snubbed a buyout offer from French drug giant Sanofi (SNY). Shares of Sanofi added 0.6%.China's Baidu (BIDU) and JD.Com (JD) led the Nasdaq 100, up 3% and 4% respecitively. S&P 500 name Harley Davidson (HOG) rebounded 3.5%. The stock tanked 14% last week on a string of critical analyst notes.Early IBD 50 leaders included Facebook (FB). Shares added more than 1%. The social networking heavy found quiet support at its 50-day line on Tuesday, ending 6% below a 117.09 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX) added 2% after Tuesday's gap down in heavy trade. The stock managed to find support at the converged 50- and 200-day moving averages. That is a positive, but shares have been unable to rise clear of those lines of support as they've climbed the right side of a shallow six-month consolidation.

133,PNC,"President Obama is scheduled to visit the United Kingdom this month -- too late to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's 90th birthday, but just in time to urge Britons to stay in the European Union, even as it grapples with economic stagnation and a refugee crisis.The possibility that Britain may vote on June 23 to exit the EU has increased anxiety over what could be Europe's biggest political change in decades, raising fears about the EU's survival, global finance and U.S. ties to European allies.Nervousness over a potential ""Brexit"" is already being felt. The pound has fallen, U.K. construction activity has slowed, and new hiring saw its weakest advance since mid-2013. Consumer confidence in the year ahead, though positive, is at its lowest point since December 2014. And the worst may be yet to come.""As we go closer to the actual referendum date, this uncertainty will have a negative impact on U.K. financial markets,"" said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.It has been enough to worry JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. In his annual letter to shareholders earlier this week, he warned on a Brexit's negative consequences, including a possible trade war between the U.K. and the remaining EU states that might even threaten the EU's existence.""The best case is that Britain can quickly renegotiate hundreds of trade and other contracts with countries around the world, including the European Union,"" Dimon wrote. “Even this scenario will result in years of uncertainty, and this uncertainty will hurt the economies of both Britain and the European Union.""Europe's largest bank, HSBC (HSBC), decided in February to keep its headquarters in London but said it could move 1,000 jobs to Paris if Britain leaves the EU.To Brexit supporters, exiting the EU would save Britain money and restore some of the sovereignty they feel has been lost to Brussels bureaucrats. But others are concerned that a British departure would embolden populist anti-EU political parties such as the National Front in France, Law and Justice in Poland and Podemos in Spain, among others.And after losing a Scottish independence vote in 2014, Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has said there ""almost certainly"" would be another independence referendum if the Brexit happens.""If the U.K. leaves, what you’ve done for the first time, you’ve now begun to remove one of the main factors that has held Europe together,"" said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at Economic Outlook Group.For the U.S., a Brexit would make global financial regulation more difficult as EU rules mostly likely would differ from their British counterparts. A split in Europe could make steering NATO policy harder. The EU also would become less friendly to the U.S., as Britain often acts as a political bridge between the U.S. and Continental powers such as France and Germany.Analysts are skeptical that the U.K. will vote to leave the EU. Opinion polls currently are close, with the pro-EU camp holding a narrow lead. But British election polls have been wrong before.During last year's general election, pollsters predicted a hung parliament with no majority party. Instead, the Conservative Party won a surprise victory with a slim, though outright, majority in the House of Commons.That political party is now split over Europe. Prime Minister David Cameron is campaigning to remain in the EU, while more than 100 Conservative members of Parliament, including London Mayor Boris Johnson and members of Cameron's cabinet, want to leave.Though the EU is frequently referred to in some quarters as a sluggish mass of red tape, it was once considered a phoenix that rose from the ashes after centuries of war.But its post-World War II successes have been overshadowed by the eurozone's recent economic malaise, the debt crisis and repeated battles over Greece, over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and over millions of refugees from the Mideast and Africa flooding into Europe.The U.K. in general -- and the Conservative Party in particular -- has been reluctant to involve itself too deeply in Continental Europe. In the late 19th century, Britain pursued a policy of ""splendid isolation."" A Conservative Party split over Europe led directly to Margaret Thatcher's downfall as prime minister in 1990. When the euro was adopted as a currency, Britain kept the pound.As Europe's problems mounted after the financial crisis of 2008, the voices of those skeptical of the EU became louder across the union. In Britain, the populist United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) challenged the Conservatives on their right flank.UKIP won 12.6% of the vote in last year's election, though it only won one seat in Parliament due to the U.K.'s first-past-the-post electoral system. But in response to the emerging electoral threat, Cameron promised a referendum on Britain's EU membership.""Dissatisfaction with the EU is pretty widespread across the entire union,"" said William Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services Group.

134,PNC,"The U.S. economy grew in the fourth quarter at a faster pace than previously estimated, supported by stronger household spending that’s helping cushion the expansion from weakness overseas.The revised 1.4% increase in gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced, compares with the Commerce Department’s previous estimate of 1%, according to figures issued Friday. The economy grew 2% in the third quarter. The report also showed that corporate profits dropped in 2015 by the most in seven years.The earnings slump illustrates the limits of an economy struggling to gather steam at the start of this year. Some companies, encumbered by low commodities prices and sluggish foreign markets, are cutting back on investment while a firm labor market and low inflation encourage households to keep shopping.“It’s really U.S. consumers who are powering the global economy forward at this point,” said Gus Faucher, an economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. At the same time, “there are pressures on businesses in terms of the stronger dollar, rising labor costs and slowing productivity growth” even as a rise in energy prices will help ease that drag for oil producers.The median forecast of 73 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for fourth-quarter growth of 1%, with projections ranging from no change to a 1.4% gain. This is the last of three estimates for the quarter before annual revisions in July.The figure marks a slowdown from the 2.2% average pace in the first three quarters of 2015. For all of last year, the U.S. economy grew 2.4%, matching the advance in 2014.Today’s fourth-quarter growth figure reflected more spending on services, particularly on recreation and transportation. Exports also declined less than previously estimated.Household purchases, which account for almost 70% of the economy, rose at a 2.4% annual pace, compared with a previously estimated 2% rate. Personal consumption added 1.66 percentage points to growth.Weak overseas demand has weighed on net exports, with trade subtracting 0.14 percentage point from overall growth after a previously reported 0.25 percentage point. The gap in goods and services trade may stay wide as the U.S. economy plods ahead and foreign markets, including China, struggle to improve.Inventories subtracted 0.22 percentage point from growth compared with a previous estimate of a 0.14 percentage-point drag. American companies are still trying to get stockpiles more in line with demand.Final Sales
"
135,PNC,"Stripping out inventories and trade, the two most volatile components of GDP, so-called final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a 1.7% rate, compared with a previously estimated 1.4% pace.Friday’s report also offered a first look at corporate profits for the period. Pre-tax earnings declined 7.8%, the most since the first quarter of 2011, after a 1.6% decrease in the previous three months. The estimate of nonfinancial corporate profits was reduced by a $20.8 billion settlement, considered a transfer to the government, between BP (BP) and the U.S. after the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.Profits in the U.S. dropped 3.1% in 2015, the most since 2008. Earnings are being weighed down by weak productivity, rising labor costs and the plunge in energy prices.“If profits remain depressed, the prospects for capex and hiring will come under greater pressure,” Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina, wrote in a research note.Corporate outlays for equipment declined at a 2.1% annualized pace, subtracting 0.12 percentage point, the Commerce Department said.A strengthening labor market is supporting steady U.S. household demand even as factories continue to struggle amid the global slowdown. Employers added 242,000 workers to payrolls in February and the unemployment rate held at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent. Firings linger near four-decade lows.Consumers have also been buoyed by gasoline prices. The cost of an average gallon of regular gasoline was $2.01 as of March 23, compared with $2.40 on average for all of 2015, according to motoring group AAA.

141,PNC,"Stocks got off to a positive start, then fell into mild losses early Friday, despite a surprise jump in January consumer sentiment.The Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.4%. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% and the Nasdaq eased 0.1%.Volume rose 13% on the Nasdaq and 54% on the NYSE compared with trade at the same time Thursday.The stock market today appeared to shed its weak premarket posture, opening higher on strong trade. The Dow was the first to drop into negative territory, weighed by Intel (INTC), Caterpillar (CAT) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Early consumer price data were, if not positive, at least in line with expectations, showing the bulk of the month's decline's owing to gasoline prices.The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production eased 0.1% in December, down from November's 1.3% jump but in line with economists' projections. Utilization of factory capacity was 79.7%, just below expectations.The University of Michigan delivered good news, with its initial estimate on January consumer sentiment jumping to 98.2. That was up from 93.6 in December and well above forecasts for a reading of 94.In stocks, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) spiked 6% to lead the Nasdaq 100. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) topped the Dow, up more than 1% each, although oil prices pulled back from an early, 3% gain.A raft of earnings reports from big banks stirred a share of Friday's early action. SunTrust Banks (STI) surged 5% to top the S&P 500. PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) popped 2% higher. Brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW) gained a fraction, while Goldman Sachs (GS) dipped 0.4%.Oilfield service shaker Schlumberger (SLB) rode up nearly 4%. It reported late Thursday that its Q4 earnings topped expectations.

The stock was 50% below its early July high.Leading stocks posted a healthy start, with some 80% of the IBD 50 list stocks moving higher at the open.Ambarella (AMBA) led the group with a 3% advance. The maker of chips used in GoPro (GPRO) and other digital video cameras is rebounding after three straight losses left the stock down 13% at the end of Thursday's session and just short of a test of its 10-week moving average. GoPro shares were down nearly 3% Friday, trading 52% below an early October high.Losses on the IBD 50 list were mild, with the deepest cut being a 1% drop by Align Technology (ALGN).

152,PNC,"SUV Sales Hot
"
153,PNC,"U.S. factories have enjoyed many advantages in 2014. Consumers have rushed to replace older automobiles as dealers offer incentives. Q3 auto sales ran at the best rate in eight years, though there are signs that may be slowing down. General Motors (GM) on Wednesday reported strong September U.S. sales of SUVs and large pickups, helped by falling gasoline prices. But Ford (F) said its overall domestic sales declined slightly.
"
154,PNC,"There are also signs that a long-awaited rebound in business capital spending is finally at hand. Capacity utilization, a measure of how much slack firms have in their equipment, stands just below 80%, the point at which firms can no longer put off new investment.

"
164,PNC,"So on Friday – stocks ended slightly lower...consolidating really after the rally that has seen the Dow , S&P and Nasdaq all move higher by about 6% in the last week halting just at initial resistance levels. Have investors decided that all of the chatter about a weakening economy is just that? Chatter? Have they decided that the selloff in January and February was a bit overdone? Well before we tackle those questions – remember that bear mkt rallies can be dramatic events and we have yet to break out of the bear trend – so now is the time for some analysis.Remember on Sesame Street – when Bert and Ernie wanted to introduce a new letter? They would say something like: ""Today we are gonna learn about the letter (insert letter here). Well - folks - today we are going to learn about a letter that plays an important role for technicians and one that can be seen clearly when you look at the charts....It is the letter ""W"".Notice that the letter ""W"" has a descending left arm , a bottom, then a spike up, only to make another bottom before bouncing and creating the ascending right arm.... and this is called a ""double bottom"". You see that right - The Double Bottom?For well over 2 ½ months now the mkt has been struggling – the bulls and the bears have been at each other""s throat""s – and while this has been going on – something else has been happening. A quick look at the Dow, the S&P, will reveal a ""W"" trading pattern. The descending left side beginning in early January took us to the first bottom on Jan 20th….then the mkt began to rise – making its top on Feb 1st – only to turn south again and make the second bottom on Feb 11th – at about the time that Janet Yellen was testifying in front of congress – suggesting that 4 rate hikes were most likely ""not going to happen in 2016"" and this is when the ascending right side began to form.Now the logical follow thru of this pattern is for the mkt to create the right hand side of the W that we can expect to test (at least) its 50 dma (1955) where it should find plenty of resistance, but In fact – if it were true to the pattern then it should really pierce the 50 dma and attempt to test its 200 dma at 2030 (now in this environment - I think that is a bit of stretch) - it is a tall order, but one that is not out of the question at all in terms of technical patterns.So what would help propel us to that level? Well, a bunch of things really, but clearly one of them is oil! Last week, on the 16th, we saw oil pierce the $30 level and trade as high as $31.53......and coincidentally - this was the same day that the mkt rocketed higher, as the word then was that oil had put in a bottom, so the trader types hit the BUY button as "" FOMO"" (Fear of Missing Out) took hold of their senses.... ......and when oil failed to rally further - the mkt stalled a bit - digesting the move higher and waiting for direction.Well - it is getting that direction today....Oil has once again begun to move and the move is higher... WTI is trading up $1 or 3.3% and so US futures are up 22 pts in early pre-mkt trading...Now if it holds here into the opening - then the S&P would immediately trade to 1935.....determined to at least test and pierce its Feb 1st high of 1943 before it can make a run at its 50 dma at 1955. And if that is true - then the ""W"" pattern will be on its way to completion. Once we get there though, I would expect there to be some resistance....On Friday we learned that consumer prices - as measured by the CPI (Consumer Price Index) are in fact accelerating - despite the collapse in so many commodities....The gov't told us that year over year - CORE CPI - that is ex food and energy - was up 2.2% .....Gus Faucher - PNC Economist was quick to point out that this""Broad based price growth is signalling that the wage and price pressures are building, an indication that the economy is expanding at a solid pace and that recessionary concerns are overdone""To that I say - Come on Gussy.....really? The FED uses the ""Personal Consumption Expenditures Index"" to measure inflation and that my friend only shows a 0.6% increase year over year (well below the 2% target).......and besides we have a dozen other macro data points, strong dollar and a weak employment picture that all signal a slowdown and now you are telling us that this one report - that is EX food and energy - changes the whole picture? If that is the case- then you are calling for the FED to move on rates - and if that is true - then the mkt would be backing off considering the broader global economy continues to struggle. And it isn't!Now this morning global mkts are screaming higher...... - we can thank this move on higher oil - The head of OPEC & the Saudi oil minister are set to speak today at an energy conference in Houston - so we can credit the move to this anticipated discussion....- Recall that last week - 4 major producers did say that they would freeze production at January levels and that is what started the rally in oil....so any new news today will be seen as a positive - because the sense is that they are NOT going to announce a cancellation of that prior announcement.In addition the news in Europe was not bullish at all....European Flash PMI's for February were disappointing.... German Manufacturing PMI was 50.2 vs.52.0 expectation and the European Monetary Union (EMU) Manufacturing PMI was 51.0 vs. 52.0 expectation. But those mkts are solidly higher because of the possibility of further ECB easing. (there is that whole NEGATIVE rate discussion rearing its ugly head) FTSE+1.26%, CAC 40 +1.77%, DAX +1.95%, EUROSTOXX +2.07%, SPAIN +2.18% and ITALY +2.88%.As noted S&P futures are +22 pts.... with little eco data today - I suspect that traders will be listening intently to the comments coming from the energy conference in Houston.Today we will get Markit US Manf PMI - exp of 52.5.......and considering manufacturing has been a sore spot for this recovery - this will be an interesting stat to watch.....an upside surprise (which would be interesting) is unlikely but if so - then watch for the mkt to back off a bit as the speculation will return to FED policy

167,PNC,"Exposure to energy in Wells Fargo (WFC) and an underwhelming global banking performance for Citigroup (C) factored in as they, along with U.S. Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings Friday.
"
168,PNC,"Wells Fargo said it earned $1.03 a share for the quarter, up 1% from a year earlier and beating by a penny the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 0.7% to $21.6 billion, missing estimates of $21.8 billion. Full-year EPS was $4.15 a share, up 1.2% from 2014's total and matched views. Full-year revenue rose 2% to $86.1 billion, missing views of $86.5 billion.
"
169,PNC,"As of Dec. 31, total assets rose 6% to $1.8 trillion compared with a year earlier. Total loans rose 6.3% to $916.6 billion. Total consumer loans grew 2.7% to $460 billion. Commercial loans grew 10% to $456.6 billion.
"
170,PNC,"Wells' net interest margin, the difference between what banks earn in loans vs. what they pay out to depositors, slipped to 2.92% from the third quarter's 2.96% and 3.04% a year earlier. The Federal Reserve's decision to boost interest rates by 0.25% last month — the first interest rate hike since 2006 — is seen as helping boost banks' profitability. But the brutal start to the year for stocks, weak global growth and underwhelming inflation numbers could mean that further hikes could be delayed.
"
171,PNC,"The sagging energy sector also weighed on Wells Fargo to some degree. The San Francisco-based bank reported $831 million in credit losses in the fourth quarter, up 18.2% from the quarter before, primarily due to $90 million in higher oil and gas portfolio losses as well as seasonal increases in non-real estate consumer portfolios. Costs decreased 2% to $12.4 billion from $12.65 billion, reflecting savings on employee benefits and commissions.
"
172,PNC,"Shares tumbled 4.2% to 48.51 on the stock market today. Wells Fargo's IBD Composite Rating is 64 out of 99, meaning it is outperforming 64% of other publicly traded companies. It is trading well below its 50-day moving average, and that fell below its 200-day line back in September.
"
173,PNC,"Meanwhile, Citigroup reported quarterly earnings of $1.06 a share, also beating views by a penny. The New York-based bank earned 6 cents a share in the year-ago quarter because of legal expenses. Revenue rose 4% to $18.6 billion, beating estimates of $17.9 billion. Full-year EPS was $5.35 a share, missing views by 9 cents, but during the year the bank earned $17.2 billion, its biggest profit in nearly a decade. For all of 2014, Citigroup earned $2.20 a share. Full-year revenue fell 1.5% to $76.1 billion, but beat estimates of $75.6 billion.
"
174,PNC,"Allowance for loan losses was $12.6 billion at the end of the quarter, or 2.1% of total loans. A year earlier, that total was $16 billion, or $2.5% of total loans. Citi set aside $250 million to cover losses to its energy portfolio.
"
175,PNC,"Operating expenses fell 23% to $11.1 billion, driven by lower legal costs. Loans fell 4% to $618 billion while deposits rose 1% to $908 billion. Net interest margins slipped to 2.92% compared with 2.94% in the third quarter.
"
176,PNC,"Profit at Citi Holdings, Citigroup's ""bad bank"" that has housed the company's sour assets since the 2008-09 financial crisis, soared to $704 million from $87 million a year earlier, thanks in part to the sale of OneMain Financial Group, Citi's subprime lending unit. Net income at Citi's global banking unit fell 20% to $1.3 billion and income from its institutional clients group dropped 18% to $1.4 billion.
"
177,PNC,"Citi has sought to become leaner and meaner since the financial crisis. It has sold off a number of its overseas assets in order to slim down. Total assets as of Dec. 31 were $1.7 trillion, putting it behind Wells Fargo in that department.
"
178,PNC,"Citi's shares sank 6.5% to 42.43, well below its 50-day line, which fell below its 200-day moving average in October. Its IBD Composite Rating is 48.
"
179,PNC,"Elsewhere, U.S. Bancorp earned 80 cents a share for the quarter, up 1.3% and beating views by a penny. Revenue fell 0.2% to $5.2 billion, beating estimates of $5.1 billion. Full-year EPS was $3.16, up 2.6% from the previous year, matching views. Full-year revenue rose 2.5% to $20.1 billion, missing views of $20.2 billion.
"
180,PNC,"The Minneapolis-based bank earned $294 million in fees from credit and debit cards, up 8.1% and helping to offset declines in mortgage banking and investment product revenue.
"
181,PNC,"Net interest margin rose to 3.06% compared with the third quarter's 3.04%, but fell from Q4 2014's 3.14%. Average total loans grew 4.2% from a year earlier to $256.7 billion while total deposits grew 6.9% to $294.5 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2015, total assets were $421.9 billion, up 4.8%.
"
182,PNC,"U.S. Bancorp.'s provision for credit losses rose 5.9% to $305 million. The allowance for credit losses was $4.3 billion, down 1.6% from a year earlier.
"
183,PNC,"Shares fell 3% to 38.72, well below its 50-day average. U.S. Bancorp's IBD Composite Rating is 64.
"

189,PNC,"Follow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter @IBD_CMcEvoy and on Facebook.Exposure to energy in Wells Fargo (WFC) and an underwhelming global banking performance for Citigroup (C) factored in as they, along with U.S. Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings Friday.Wells Fargo said it earned $1.03 a share for the quarter, up 1% from a year earlier and beating by a penny the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 0.7% to $21.6 billion, missing estimates of $21.8 billion. Full-year EPS was $4.15 a share, up 1.2% from 2014's total and matched views. Full-year revenue rose 2% to $86.1 billion, missing views of $86.5 billion.As of Dec. 31, total assets rose 6% to $1.8 trillion compared with a year earlier. Total loans rose 6.3% to $916.6 billion. Total consumer loans grew 2.7% to $460 billion. Commercial loans grew 10% to $456.6 billion.Wells' net interest margin, the difference between what banks earn in loans vs. what they pay out to depositors, slipped to 2.92% from the third quarter's 2.96% and 3.04% a year earlier. The Federal Reserve's decision to boost interest rates by 0.25% last month — the first interest rate hike since 2006 — is seen as helping boost banks' profitability. But the brutal start to the year for stocks, weak global growth and underwhelming inflation numbers could mean that further hikes could be delayed.The sagging energy sector also weighed on Wells Fargo to some degree. The San Francisco-based bank reported $831 million in credit losses in the fourth quarter, up 18.2% from the quarter before, primarily due to $90 million in higher oil and gas portfolio losses as well as seasonal increases in non-real estate consumer portfolios. Costs decreased 2% to $12.4 billion from $12.65 billion, reflecting savings on employee benefits and commissions.Shares tumbled 4.2% to 48.51 on the stock market today. Wells Fargo's IBD Composite Rating is 64 out of 99, meaning it is outperforming 64% of other publicly traded companies. It is trading well below its 50-day moving average, and that fell below its 200-day line back in September.Meanwhile, Citigroup reported quarterly earnings of $1.06 a share, also beating views by a penny. The New York-based bank earned 6 cents a share in the year-ago quarter because of legal expenses. Revenue rose 4% to $18.6 billion, beating estimates of $17.9 billion. Full-year EPS was $5.35 a share, missing views by 9 cents, but during the year the bank earned $17.2 billion, its biggest profit in nearly a decade. For all of 2014, Citigroup earned $2.20 a share. Full-year revenue fell 1.5% to $76.1 billion, but beat estimates of $75.6 billion.Allowance for loan losses was $12.6 billion at the end of the quarter, or 2.1% of total loans. A year earlier, that total was $16 billion, or $2.5% of total loans. Citi set aside $250 million to cover losses to its energy portfolio.Operating expenses fell 23% to $11.1 billion, driven by lower legal costs. Loans fell 4% to $618 billion while deposits rose 1% to $908 billion. Net interest margins slipped to 2.92% compared with 2.94% in the third quarter.Profit at Citi Holdings, Citigroup's ""bad bank"" that has housed the company's sour assets since the 2008-09 financial crisis, soared to $704 million from $87 million a year earlier, thanks in part to the sale of OneMain Financial Group, Citi's subprime lending unit. Net income at Citi's global banking unit fell 20% to $1.3 billion and income from its institutional clients group dropped 18% to $1.4 billion.Citi has sought to become leaner and meaner since the financial crisis. It has sold off a number of its overseas assets in order to slim down. Total assets as of Dec. 31 were $1.7 trillion, putting it behind Wells Fargo in that department.Citi's shares sank 6.5% to 42.43, well below its 50-day line, which fell below its 200-day moving average in October. Its IBD Composite Rating is 48.Elsewhere, U.S. Bancorp earned 80 cents a share for the quarter, up 1.3% and beating views by a penny. Revenue fell 0.2% to $5.2 billion, beating estimates of $5.1 billion. Full-year EPS was $3.16, up 2.6% from the previous year, matching views. Full-year revenue rose 2.5% to $20.1 billion, missing views of $20.2 billion.The Minneapolis-based bank earned $294 million in fees from credit and debit cards, up 8.1% and helping to offset declines in mortgage banking and investment product revenue.Net interest margin rose to 3.06% compared with the third quarter's 3.04%, but fell from Q4 2014's 3.14%. Average total loans grew 4.2% from a year earlier to $256.7 billion while total deposits grew 6.9% to $294.5 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2015, total assets were $421.9 billion, up 4.8%.U.S. Bancorp.'s provision for credit losses rose 5.9% to $305 million. The allowance for credit losses was $4.3 billion, down 1.6% from a year earlier.Shares fell 3% to 38.72, well below its 50-day average.

207,PNC,"Last week Professor Jeremy Siegel and I spoke with Bill Stone, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Strategist of PNC Institutional Asset Management, and James Wood-Collins, CEO of Record Currency Management, about their outlook on the markets, diverging central bank policies and the role of currency in portfolios.Looming Fed HikeProfessor Siegel highlighted the increasing probability of a <href=""#federal%20reserve"">Federal Reserve (Fed) <href=""#rate%20hike"">rate hike, stating, ""The Fed couldn't be any clearer on a December 16 liftoff and that it will be Christmas wrapped,"" implying that subsequent hikes could be deliberate and gradual in nature. He anticipates one increase per quarter—and that, too, will be highly market dependent. Professor Siegel also believes it is possible the second rate hike does not occur until June.Bill Stone corroborates Professor Siegel's thoughts and believes that December is ""go time"" for the Fed and that the markets have to a large degree priced this in. He is somewhat surprised by the sudden re-pricing of Fed probabilities that has had a beneficial impact on market performance.Positioning for a Hike: Growers over Yielders Stone is most concerned about the hidden <href=""#duration"">duration exposure that many portfolios may contain. Hidden exposure implies allocations to high-<href=""#dividend%20yields"">dividend yielders that tend to behave like bonds with ultra-long duration. This is different from <href=""#dividend%20growth"">dividend growers, which have the capability to grow dividends in an environment of rising rates.Stone also notes that dividend yielders—namely companies in the Telecommunication and Utilities sectors—appear expensive, given investors' desperation for yield in this low-interest-rate environment. Dividend growth, on the other hand, is more attractive from a <href=""#valuation"">valuation standpoint, in his view, and is growing in importance, given an environment of potentially rising rates.Positioning for a Hike: King U.S. Dollar James Wood-Collins believes that the best expression for divergent central bank policies—the U.S. on the one hand, and the eurozone and Japan on the other—is a <href=""#long%28or%20long%20position%29"">long U.S. dollar trade. Given that currencies are a <href=""#pair%20trade"">pair trade, and that they are driven primarily by <href=""#interest%20rate%20differentials"">interest rate differentials, a hike on the part of the Fed would push interest rates in favor of the dollar against both the euro and the yen, whose central banks have pledged to keep <href=""#monetary%20policy"">monetary policy as easy as possible. According to Wood-Collins, this market backdrop makes a strong case for U.S. investors to <href=""#hedge"">hedge currency exposure in Europe and Japan.Given the strongly divergent Fed and ECB policies, both Professor Siegel and Stone see a strong possibility for the euro to trade below <href=""#parity"">parity in the near future.Wood-Collins also believes that divergent central bank policies may signal a resurgence of currency strategies that are based on interest rate differentials and <href=""#carry"">carry. He also foresees higher <href=""#volatility"">volatility in this market environment.The Valuation Case for Emerging Market (EM) Stocks and CurrenciesProfessor Siegel, Stone and Wood-Collins all reiterate their conviction that EM stocks and currencies are selling low relative to historic fundamentals. More importantly, much of the EM region trades based on sensitivities to commodities.Stone favors dividend growers in EM, namely the consumer names that coincidentally earn 4%, 5% or 6% in dividend yield. Despite its ""growth-ier"" qualities, this yield is tough to rival.Wood-Collins, in particular, believes that EM currencies could be a rewarding opportunity in the long term, given their convergence in productivity and <href=""#gross%20domestic%20product%20%28gdp%29"">gross domestic product (GDP) per capita to the developed markets and the higher real interest rates borne by EM currencies.Currencies Decoded Unlike investment markets, currency markets are transactional. According to the Bank for International Settlements, there are $5 trillion in daily transactions—which dwarfs trades on the NYSE. Since currencies are a pair trade, one should ask where the risk arrow might be pointing. Wood-Collins lists a few measures on which currencies can be valued or assessed:1. Carry: Driven by interest rate differentials.
"
208,PNC,"2. Value: Looks at indicators such as <href=""#purchasing%20power%20parity"">purchasing power parity and potential reversion to mean.
"
209,PNC,"3. Momentum: Picks up on trend-following strategies—and Wood-Collins points out the importance of following its signals in a disciplined fashion.Bottom Line In summary, our guests are looking to position for the future via stronger U.S. dollar plays and currency-hedged strategies in Europe and Japan. The Fed ought to utilize this market environment to get its first rate hike out of the way to ease investor sentiment.Read the Conversations with Professor Siegel Series. Important Risks Related to this ArticleInvestments focused in Japan or Europe increase the impact of events and developments associated with the regions, which can adversely affect performance.Investments in currency involve additional special risks, such as credit risk and interest rate fluctuations.Hedging can help returns when a foreign currency depreciates against the U.S. dollar, but can hurt when the foreign currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.

210,PNC,"Four financial stocks are making a case that they've hit a bottom, but how convincing a case is it? U.S. Bancorp (USB), PNC Financial (PNC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Northern Trust (NTRS) haven't rallied much after the market's mini flash crash in the week that ended Aug. 28. But they haven't gone down much, either. Despite weak Accumulation/Distribution Ratings, all four are trading tightly, moving sideways and holding above their Aug. 24 lows, leaving some to believe that the selling has run its course.IBD tracks three of them in its Banks-Super Regional industry group. Wells Fargo is a member of the Banks-Money Center group.Interest rates will start heading higher at some point, which should help profitability at banks, thanks to higher net interest margin — the difference between interest income and the amount of interest paid out to lenders.U.S. Bancorp pays a quarterly dividend of 25.5 cents a share, giving it an annualized dividend yield of around 2.5%. At an investor conference in mid-September, the company said that it would have to resort to cost-cutting initiatives if rates don't start rising soon.PNC Financial pays a quarterly dividend of 51 cents a share, giving it a yield of around 2.3%. As more and more consumers embrace mobile and the Internet for banking, PNC is redesigning many of its branches with financial consultants rather than tellers, who typically help with more mundane tasks.Wells Fargo's quarterly dividend of 37.5 cents a share gives it a yield of 2.9%. At the end of the second quarter, it was one of Warren Buffett's largest holdings.Northern Trust's dividend of 36 cents a share results in a yield of 2.1%. In terms of overall fundamentals, Northern Trust is the standout among the four. The company shows five straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth. Sales growth has accelerated for three straight quarters.

211,PNC,"Buying a new-construction home is like purchasing a stock at its initial public offering. It's a bet on the future. Will the home turn out as you expected and be finished on time? Do you fully understand the contract and the ""cost escalators""? If you're buying in phase one, will all the amenities actually get built and meet your expectations? Do you understand the warranty and your rights?
"
212,PNC,"After the real estate bust, residential new construction is having a strong year. PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) is forecasting housing starts of 1.11 million for all of 2015 and 1.18 million next year, up from 1 million in 2014.
"
213,PNC,"Housing starts ""look good and they're getting better,"" said Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at Pittsburgh-based PNC.
"
214,PNC,"But are we back to a full building boom? No. Faucher said that builders are ""afraid of getting burned, so they're hesitant to expand."" And he says that the building industry is experiencing a labor shortage.
"
215,PNC,"The National Association of Realtors said in a news release earlier this month that homebuilding for all housing types ""is underperforming in roughly two-thirds of measured metro areas.""
"
216,PNC,"Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said, ""Even as the labor market began to strengthen, homebuilding failed to keep up and is now contributing to the stronger price appreciation and eroding affordability currently seen throughout the U.S.""
"
217,PNC,"Top U.S. homebuilders include Toll Bros. (TOL), KB Home (KBH), PulteGroup (PHM) and Lennar (LEN). (None of these builders, nor half a dozen other publicly held builders, agreed to be interviewed for this story.)
"
218,PNC,"Contracts, Upgrades, Schedules
"
219,PNC,"Construction schedules are one piece of complicated new-home contracts. Experts advise making sure that you know the schedule and, more importantly, any delay provisions built into the contract. Then expect the unexpected.
"
220,PNC,"Labor shortages may play a role, and delays are often ""weather-based,"" said Linda Wilson, broker-owner of Wilson & Co. Sotheby's International Realty in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Wilson says that buyers of new homes should consider having an agent or lawyer help them review the contract.
"
221,PNC,"""Some people are under the misconception that the builder's Realtor is working for them — and (he or she) is not,"" said Debbie Bennington, an agent with Dickson Realty in Reno, Nev.
"
222,PNC,"""Your agent can help you understand the contract, but the builder isn't going to change it,"" said Wilson. Most builders have a standard contract that's not negotiable.
"
223,PNC,"So buy from a reputable builder with strong financial backing, says Wilson. Also, be warned that the best prices come with the highest risk. Buying early, at phase one, will get you the best price, but you'll be living in a construction zone for a long time and likely without some promised amenities.
"
224,PNC,"""Each phase, the price goes up,"" said Wilson. ""If it's a new project, and you don't know much about it, then I'd wait for the second or third phase.""
"
225,PNC,"And figuring the final price of your home isn't easy either. Most builders offer a long list of upgrades — granite counters, hardwood floors, top-line appliances, etc. So make sure that your price estimate includes all the finishes that you want .
"
226,PNC,"Comb the contract to understand the nitty-gritty — price, deposit, schedule for payments, time for performance and ""what happens with delays and change orders,"" said David Jaffe, vice president, legal advocacy, with the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, D.C. And, Jaffe says, review what the contract says about disputes: How will they be handled, and is there an arbitration clause?
"
227,PNC,"Warranties And Inspections
"
228,PNC,"Often a contract will also include a ""cost escalation"" clause, said Eugene Graf, president of E.G. Construction in Bozeman, Mont. Graf says that costs for ""Sheetrock, shingles and plywood"" can change ""rapidly,"" so builders want the contract to cover possible material cost increases. He also said that banks lending on a new home often ""require a stated potential overage amount.""
"
229,PNC,"New homes usually come with a warranty, but the length can vary. Typically a builder will warrant all of his work for the first year. Beyond that, state laws set the rules for new home warranty coverage and length.
"
230,PNC,"Some buyers opt out of having their new homes inspected as they would an existing home, because they believe that the local building department has fully vetted it. Agents say that opting out can be a huge mistake. ""Residential building inspectors don't inspect everything. ... They don't inspect every home and every mechanical system,"" said Bennington.
"
231,PNC,"Graf, however, says that the building inspectors in his area are very thorough. He also has ""open job sites"" so a buyer ""can go see"" his or her home during construction. He added: ""It's one of our best selling features.""
"
232,PNC,"Jaffe says that unfortunately, some warranties are ""vague,"" and buyers and builders may disagree about what's a defect and what's normal aging. On its website, the NAHB offers information to help buyers understand the construction process and quality standards.
"
233,PNC,"Closing escrow and moving into a home with a major building flaw means that you won't have any leverage to get the builder to fix it quickly and to your satisfaction, and you'll be living through the repair.
"
234,PNC,"Wilson says that she had one client who was ready to move into a new home, but a home inspector found that the driveway drainage was wrong and, during a big rain, water would run into the home's garage. The buyer wouldn't close on the house until the driveway was fixed. The builder initially refused to fix the driveway but eventually agreed to tear it out and replace it.
"
235,PNC,"Amenities And HOA Rules
"
236,PNC,"Do you fully understand the association rules of your new development? What are the parking, landscaping and exterior maintenance requirements for all properties? Can you remodel? If so, what's the permit process? If it's a senior community, what are the restrictions about having family visit?
"
237,PNC,"""It's super exciting to buy new and early, but there are a lot of unknowns,"" said Bennington.
"
238,PNC,"Even the types of homes that a builder is putting up can change.
"
239,PNC,"During the bust, Bennington said, ""There were communities where they said they were going to build a certain size of home, and then they built smaller homes.""
"
240,PNC,"You'll also want to ask detailed questions about any promised amenities, a fancy clubhouse or pool, and when they'll be finished.
"
241,PNC,"Buyer beware. ""Amenities may not show up for years,"" said Wilson, ""and they may not show up at all.""Buying a new-construction home is like purchasing a stock at its initial public offering.

Wilson says that buyers of new homes should consider having an agent or lawyer help them review the contract.""Some people are under the misconception that the builder's Realtor is working for them — and (he or she) is not,"" said Debbie Bennington, an agent with Dickson Realty in Reno, Nev.""Your agent can help you understand the contract, but the builder isn't going to change it,"" said Wilson. Most builders have a standard contract that's not negotiable.So buy from a reputable builder with strong financial backing, says Wilson. Also, be warned that the best prices come with the highest risk. Buying early, at phase one, will get you the best price, but you'll be living in a construction zone for a long time and likely without some promised amenities.""Each phase, the price goes up,"" said Wilson. ""If it's a new project, and you don't know much about it, then I'd wait for the second or third phase.""And figuring the final price of your home isn't easy either. Most builders offer a long list of upgrades — granite counters, hardwood floors, top-line appliances, etc. So make sure that your price estimate includes all the finishes that you want .Comb the contract to understand the nitty-gritty — price, deposit, schedule for payments, time for performance and ""what happens with delays and change orders,"" said David Jaffe, vice president, legal advocacy, with the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, D.C. And, Jaffe says, review what the contract says about disputes: How will they be handled, and is there an arbitration clause?Warranties And InspectionsOften a contract will also include a ""cost escalation"" clause, said Eugene Graf, president of E.G. Construction in Bozeman, Mont. Graf says that costs for ""Sheetrock, shingles and plywood"" can change ""rapidly,"" so builders want the contract to cover possible material cost increases. He also said that banks lending on a new home often ""require a stated potential overage amount.""New homes usually come with a warranty, but the length can vary. Typically a builder will warrant all of his work for the first year. Beyond that, state laws set the rules for new home warranty coverage and length.Some buyers opt out of having their new homes inspected as they would an existing home, because they believe that the local building department has fully vetted it. Agents say that opting out can be a huge mistake. ""Residential building inspectors don't inspect everything. ... They don't inspect every home and every mechanical system,"" said Bennington.Graf, however, says that the building inspectors in his area are very thorough. He also has ""open job sites"" so a buyer ""can go see"" his or her home during construction. He added: ""It's one of our best selling features.""Jaffe says that unfortunately, some warranties are ""vague,"" and buyers and builders may disagree about what's a defect and what's normal aging. On its website, the NAHB offers information to help buyers understand the construction process and quality standards.Closing escrow and moving into a home with a major building flaw means that you won't have any leverage to get the builder to fix it quickly and to your satisfaction, and you'll be living through the repair.Wilson says that she had one client who was ready to move into a new home, but a home inspector found that the driveway drainage was wrong and, during a big rain, water would run into the home's garage. The buyer wouldn't close on the house until the driveway was fixed. The builder initially refused to fix the driveway but eventually agreed to tear it out and replace it.Amenities And HOA RulesDo you fully understand the association rules of your new development? What are the parking, landscaping and exterior maintenance requirements for all properties? Can you remodel? If so, what's the permit process? If it's a senior community, what are the restrictions about having family visit?""It's super exciting to buy new and early, but there are a lot of unknowns,"" said Bennington.Even the types of homes that a builder is putting up can change.During the bust, Bennington said, ""There were communities where they said they were going to build a certain size of home, and then they built smaller homes.""You'll also want to ask detailed questions about any promised amenities, a fancy clubhouse or pool, and when they'll be finished.Buyer beware. ""Amenities may not show up for years,"" said Wilson, ""and they may not show up at all.""

242,PNC,"A week that started off with business as usual ended on a tumultuous note, with the market swinging wildly in response to the Fed's statement Thursday.Stocks initially rose Thursday afternoon following the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates, then sold off late in the session to end mixed.On Friday, the major indexes sank early before paring some of their losses.Some industry groups were particularly affected by the Fed decision. The super regional banks group reversed sharply lower Thursday afternoon and closed down nearly 3%. On Friday, it lost another 3%.Super regionals ranked No. 126 among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, down from No. 63 six weeks ago. Go to Investors.com to view the full industry group list and rankings.Most of the stocks in the group, including Northern Trust (NTRS), PNC Financial (PNC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB), fell further below their 200-day moving averages. They've been toiling below the support line since last month's big market sell-off.Banks benefit from higher interest rates because they can get bigger net margins. When rates are low, their borrowing costs are low. But the amount they can charge on loans, and banks' earnings from other investments, are also low.Money center bank stocks are taking a hit, too. The group reversed Thursday for a more than 1% loss, and fell north of 2% Friday. It fell to No. 123 from No. 70 six weeks ago.UBS (UBS) gapped down Friday, breaching its 200-day moving average for the first time since March.It's now 13% below a 22.27 cup-with-handle buy point cleared in mid-July. UBS, with a 67 Composite Rating, is the top stock in the group based on that metric.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also gapped down Friday. The stock is holding above its Aug. 24 low, when it triggered the 8%-loss sell rule as it sank as much as 21% during the session. It's now 3% below a 62.97 buy point initially cleared in April.Also among financials, investment bankers and brokers (No. 121) lost further ground Friday.Charles Schwab (SCHW), Credit Suisse (CS), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Cowen (COWN) each gave up more than 3%.Utility stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, rose both sessions. They tend to outperform when bond yields are low, as they are now.But if rates go up, utility stocks face more competition from bonds because bond yields typically rise.The water supply group (No. 102) was one of the few gainers Friday. The gas distribution utilities group (No. 72) was nearly flat. (For more on utilities, see today's Income Investor column on Page B15.)Real estate investment trusts also tend to move with rates. Investors like them for high yields, but not as much when bond yields go up.Property REITs (No. 128) and mortgage REITs (No. 132) were also among the day's better performers, relative to other groups.
"
243,PNC,"Stocks reversed higher in early afternoon trading after starting off with steep losses on the heels of a disappointing September job report. The Nasdaq led with a 0.7% gain while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were each up 0.5%. Volume was tracking slightly higher in the stock market today vs. the same time Thursday.Gold miners, casino operators and biotechs were among the session's top gainers. Casino stocks gained despite a 33% year-over-year drop in Macau gambling revenue in September, on a Bloomberg report the Chinese government may take steps to support the once-hot gambling enclave's economy.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) led with a 18% jump, Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) soared 13%, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) 10% and MGM Resorts International (MGM) 4%. All four stocks are still well below their 52-week highs.Bank stocks sagged as a disappointing September job report fueled uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) continued to weigh on the Dow, down about 1% each.""(The job report) likely rules out an increase in the fed funds rate when the FOMC next meets in late October, and a mid-December rate increase now looks less likely,"" PNC Senior Economist Gus Faucher said in note. ""Financial markets are now pricing in the first increase in the funds rate in March.""But Pfizer (PFE) reversed upward for a 3% gain in heavy volume, on track for a fourth straight advance. The drugmaker on Wednesday said it expects its recently completed buy of Hospira to boost 2015 EPS by 3 cents a share and revenue by $1.5 billion. It guided profit of $2.04-$2.10 per share on revenue of $46.5 billion to $47.5 billion.Among IBD 50 stocks, NetEase (NTES) led with a 4% gain, nearly reclaiming its 50-day moving average, where it's found resistance since mid-August. Cambrex (CBM), Dave & Buster's (PLAY) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) were each up 3%.Follow Nancy Gondo on Twitter @IBD_NGondo.

""When you don't have trust, people show up and do the work, but they don't do great work,"" Nan Russell, a Whitefish, Mont.-based author, speaker and workplace consultant, told IBD. ""They're not going to share ideas or give discretionary effort. People want to work for somebody they trust and who trusts them.""
"
245,PNC,"Here's how to win that trust from your people.
"
246,PNC," Do what you tell them you'll do. Don't assume your staff will have faith in you simply because you're in charge.

"
250,PNC,"""Trust becomes an important vehicle in sales,"" said David Lapin, who runs a Los Angeles-based leadership consulting firm. ""I have to ask myself if I trust that the company cares about the things it talks about.""
"
251,PNC," Make sacrifices. Stand by your principles, even if ignoring them will get you a big sale. It'll pay off in the long run because others will know where your principles lie.
"
252,PNC,"Lapin was a commodities trader and once lost a huge deal because he wouldn't take a bribe. The CEO congratulated him for keeping the firm's reputation intact.

"
255,PNC," Actions speak volumes. Back up your words with what you do. Don't make yourself exempt from drug testing or give yourself unnecessary perks. You can't tell employees that people are your top priority, then cut benefits. ""People look to see if everything matches up with what you say,"" Russell said.
"
256,PNC," Stay grounded. You'll earn the trust of your people if you remain humble, Lapin says. Put the interests of your employees, shareholders and suppliers ahead of your own. ""You don't trust arrogant people,"" he said.
"
257,PNC," Show weakness. Be vulnerable around your people. Admit mistakes and demonstrate that you're a regular team player. ""People don't trust someone who seems too perfect,"" Lapin said.
"
258,PNC," Back it up. Set expected standards for how people at the firm should act. Then follow through, Russell says. Don't tolerate salespeople misleading clients.
"
259,PNC," Invest. Devote your effort toward teaching employees to make integrity a priority.

260,PNC,"Evaluate and promote them based on how well they live up to principles.

The risk of contagion to global markets is limited, given the small number of foreign investors in China's mainland stocks, but the crash is a growing threat to the world's No. 2 economy and its fastest-growing one.In light of all of Beijing's effort to halt the fall, ""I am a little bit surprised it has gone as far as it has,"" said Sung Won Sohn, a professor at California State University Channel Islands.Historically, there hasn't been much parallel pacing between China's stock markets and its economy, said Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services.

That's 21.6% off its April 27 52-week high.The collapse in Chinese securities has defied Beijing's efforts to stop the panic. China's government promised more credit to finance trading and ordered state companies to buy their own shares back, helping to prop prices of shares still in the market. It also boosted the amount of equities that insurance companies are permitted to hold to 40% of assets from 30%. Limits on margin trading (borrowing money to buy stocks) and short selling also were dealt anew by regulators.Executives now must buy more of their own firms' shares if prices fall more than 30% in 10 days.In spite of the government's influence, markets move to their own logic and groupthink, and the sell-off's ferocity caught some analysts by surprise. Morgan Stanley advised clients to avoid buying into China. Bank of America Merrill Lynch described China's securities markets as a ""falling knife"" and said the bottom is ""highly unpredictable."" The effects for Chinese investors, coming when China's economy isn't growing as much as the government would like amid a sluggish real estate market, could be long-term, they warned.""The large losses could hurt current investors' psychology severely and it may be years before the pain fades and/or a new generation of investors with no such bad memory emerges,"" BofA Merrill Lynch noted.Prices Still Super HotChinese stocks still remain among the world's hottest performers year over year. Shenzhen has soared 68.2%, while Shanghai, which opened for trading in 1990, has rocketed up 70% over the last year. That's why analysts suggest an easing of the bubble, a ""correction,"" is superior to a deeper collapse.""The market is still way ahead of itself, ahead of the fundamentals,"" said Sohn, the CSU economist.Hong Kong's benchmark, which didn't quite hit the mainland's lofty highs, is down a manageable 2.8% from a year ago.The number of new investors who entered China's stock markets this year and more foreign investors have boosted the chances of global contagion, but not by much, said PNC's Adams.""It's a risk worth watching, but I don't think a 30% correction in Shanghai will have the similar impact as it would in New York, London or Japan. But it's going to make it harder for the Chinese government to get more equity into the corporate sector.""

"
338,PNC,"You know the basic steps along the financial road of life. Start a retirement fund. Prepare your will. Avoid debt like it's a deadly virus.But what other steps should you take?The question is not academic. A recent Federal Reserve study showed that 64% of people age 45 to 59 don't have an emergency fund in case they lose their job.""Planning sounds easy, but it's shocking how many people put it off,"" said Tim McGrath, managing director of Chicago's Riverpoint Wealth Management.You've probably already started a retirement account and thought about a will. What about less obvious steps?Here are nine key ones for the decades before retirement: Social Security. Unless you'll need the added income right away in retirement, plan on delaying the start of benefits, because your benefit increases about 8% a year for every year that you wait until full retirement age, Williams says. Roth retirement accounts. The younger you are and the more likely it is that your tax bracket will rise or stay the same in retirement, the better off you'll be with a Roth-style IRA or 401(k). ""The way to think about it is in after-tax, spendable income in retirement,"" said Judith Ward, a senior financial planner for T. Rowe Price. ""If a Roth will be better for you, the sooner you switch or start using it, the better."" Life insurance. OK, maybe you need it. But how much? Use online calculators to get a rough idea.""Start to figure out if it's worth the cost by pricing a benefit that's 10 times your salary,"" Ward said.You may need more if your spouse can't support the family by herself or himself if you die, Ward says. Beneficiaries. Check the designation on everything from retirement accounts to bank accounts, especially after a divorce. The money goes to the named beneficiary, regardless of heirs named in your will, Ward says. Liability insurance. ""High-net-worth people should weigh the cost of coverage that matches your net worth,"" said McGrath. Charity. Giving gifts of highly appreciated stock achieves a good deed. It also lets you avoid capital gains tax on the profitable sale of the securities, McGrath says. Buy/sell agreements. If you own a business with partners, create a written contingency plan in case one of you dies.Partners rarely want to do business with a dead partner's spouse, says Aaron Thiel, a planner with PNC Wealth Management in Sarasota, Fla.A buy/sell agreement lets a deceased partner's spouse turn in stock shares or business interests owned by the deceased partner in exchange for a predetermined amount of cash or a combination of cash and loans.Often, the firm buys the assets from the decedent's spouse with proceeds from a company-owned life or disability insurance policy. Health savings account. Contributions are not part of your taxable income. Qualified withdrawals are also tax free. ""Start young and build it up for health expenses in retirement,"" McGrath said.Remember, you can use an HSA only in tandem with a high-deductible health insurance plan. That kind of plan is generally better suited for young, healthy workers. Home equity line of credit. This is a financial lifeboat if a financial emergency arises. ""Get it while you've got a job,"" said Steve Williams, head of U.S. financial planning for BMO Private Bank in Chicago. ""If you lose your job, it'll be harder to get.""A $500,000 line may cost you about $100 a year, Williams says. You'd pay prevailing interest rates only if you actually tap into it.

342,PNC,"Comerica reported Q4 earnings per share up 3 cents from last year to 80 cents, topping analyst forecasts for 76 cents. Revenue rose 0.9% to $640 million, also beating views.

"
368,PNC,"This year, the Fed examined 31 banks, each with assets exceeding $50 billion. All 31 banks passed DFAST last week, which means they met the Fed's minimum capital requirements. It was the first time they all passed since the test's 2009 inception.

And the Fed cited ""numerous and significant deficiencies"" in Deutsche Bank's capital planning.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) boosted their dividends and Morgan approved a new buyback plan, joining other banks that received the Fed's OK of their capital plans.Shares of BofA fell 1% late, while Morgan Stanley rose 2% and Wells Fargo edged up 0.1%.The second round of the exams — the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) — is more stringent than round one, the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST), because it examines banks' abilities to pay dividends, buy back shares and still serve borrowers during times of severe economic distress.This year, the Fed examined 31 banks, each with assets exceeding $50 billion. All 31 banks passed DFAST last week, which means they met the Fed's minimum capital requirements. It was the first time they all passed since the test's 2009 inception.A More Likely Place To TripRound 2 is where banks are more likely to stumble. Michael Corbat, the CEO of Citigroup (C), should be breathing easier, since the New York-based lender passed this year's tests after failing two out of the last three years. Last year's failure resulted in Citi's selling overseas branches as well as selling its consumer finance unit, OneMain Financial, for $4.25 billion.This is the first year Citigroup will be able to boost its dividend since the financial crisis. Corbat and Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach's jobs reportedly were on the line during this year's stress tests. Citi's passage comes as a big win for them. Citi shares rose 3.7% in after-hours trading.HSBC (HSBC) and Zions Bancorp (ZION) failed last year's CCAR but passed this year's exam.Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley met minimum capital requirements on a post-test basis after submitting adjustments.""This is becoming less and less an adversarial process between the organizations,"" said Ernest Patrikis, a former New York Fed official now with the White & Case law firm. ""I think for the banking system as a whole, we should feel a bit better.""Musing Over Board ControlWhile CCAR has become the key test of banks' health since the Great Recession, Patrikis said he'd like to see the day when a bank's board — not the Fed — again has the power to return money to owners. ""Banks should be allowed to have more freedom to raise dividends,"" he said.In addition to the banks listed above, the Federal Reserve had no objections to the plans of Ally Financial (ALLY), American Express (AXP), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), BB&T (BBT), BBVA Compass (BBVA), Bank of Montreal Quebec (BMO), Capital One Financial (COF), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Discover Financial Services (DFS), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings (MTU), Northern Trust (NTRS), PNC Financial Services (PNC), Regions Financial (RF), State Street (STT), SunTrust Banks (STI) and U.S. Bancorp (USB).

"
387,PNC,"Retail sales grew at the fastest pace in 18 months during March, suggesting that consumers and the economy may be finally emerging from winter hibernation.
"
388,PNC,"Sales rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1% from February, the Commerce Department said, more than the 0.7% expected. It was the strongest month-to-month gain since September 2012.
"
389,PNC,"Auto sales, which rose 3.1%, helped propel sales overall. But even with auto sales stripped out, the resulting 0.7% increase was the best since February 2013. Most sectors saw a rise, and February data were revised up strongly.
"
390,PNC,"Retail sales figures can be volatile from month to month but have been trending higher the past few years. Economists watch the data closely, as consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the economy.
"
391,PNC,"Other recent economic data offer convincing reasons for the March bump. Aggregate wages rose 0.7%, the Labor Department said earlier in the month. Gasoline prices fell, said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, giving consumers a little extra discretionary money. Stocks and home values both rose, contributing to a wealth effect, he says.
"
392,PNC,"""This is real consumer spending, real demand,"" Hoffman said.
"
393,PNC,"Debating Winter's Impact
"
394,PNC,"After two months of harsh winter weather, says National Retail Federation chief economist Jack Kleinhenz, those consumers were releasing some pent-up demand when they went shopping in March.
"
395,PNC,"""Improving economic conditions and consumer confidence should push consumers to return to spending habits this spring,"" he said in a statement. ""We remain optimistic that retail sales will continue their positive march this spring.""
"
396,PNC,"With the winter in the rearview mirror, a combination of factors bode well for the economy in 2014. Hoffman thinks the second quarter will compensate for the weakness in the first, and the second half will mark a ""break out of the 2% zone that we've been in for years.""
"
397,PNC,"Some economists disagree on how much the weather has impacted the economy. Hoffman thinks that weather as an explanation for sluggish activity in January and February ""hits the nail on the head"" and that the thaw in March proves it.
"
398,PNC,"Jeffrey Rosen, chief economist for Briefing.com, is more skeptical. Internet sales — a category that the weather is not likely to influence — rose 1.7% on the month in March, he noted. ""I've always been in the camp that says winter was overblown,"" Rosen said.
"
399,PNC,"Rosen thinks that wage growth accounts for most of the sales gains. The length of the workweek and hours worked rose, the latter to a multiyear high. It means that businesses will need to step up hiring and boost hours and wages more than they have in the past few years. 
"
400,PNC,"""We've had low growth and businesses at record high profits, suggesting they can run lean,"" he said. ""But in the end, consumers can only buy if they have income growth.""
"
401,PNC,"But other economists believe that sluggishness in the winter will result in pent-up demand being pushed forward into 2014.
"
402,PNC,"Sal Guatieri, senior economist with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients that the March data bring expectations of spending growth from a 2.0% gain in Q1 to ""a complete recovery"" in Q2, setting up an annualized 3 1/2% increase in 2014. That will help boost GDP, Guatieri noted.
"
403,PNC,"Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said that the rosy March data were received with relief. ""It's a story we all hoped would be in the numbers,"" he said.
"
404,PNC,"""We knew that weather depressed January and held back February, and we were looking for that rebound in last week's chain-store sales numbers. But the weak weather-induced chain-store sales numbers didn't make the case as strongly and as convincingly as the retail sales did today.""
"
405,PNC,"He says the Commerce Department report showed nice gains in retail sales in several store categories, such as general merchandise, clothing and building materials.
"
406,PNC,"Sales at general-merchandise stores, which include giants such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT), increased 1.9%, while building-materials and garden-supply stores, such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), rose 1.8%.
"
407,PNC,"Another housing-related category, home-furnishings stores, posted a 1% gain. It was likely good news for retailers such as Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Restoration Hardware Holdings (RH) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).
"
408,PNC,"Sales at clothing and accessories stores, which include giant apparel retailer Gap (GPS) and women's clothier Ann (ANN), rose 1% in pent-up demand from the prior two months.
"
409,PNC,"The Discount Dilemma
"
410,PNC,"Two big-ticket consumer questions remain. Auto sales bounced back nicely in March, to an annualized 16.4 million pace, the fastest in more than seven years. But automakers had to offer deep discounts to entice consumers in March. Still, most economists think that while the pace will ease a bit, it will stay strong, since the average age of cars on the road remains high. Hoffman expects sales of 16 million in 2014.
"
411,PNC,"The housing market is another question. Rosen said that the combination of higher interest rates and higher home prices is ""concerning"" in its impact on demand. Declining sales mean less demand for construction and less price appreciation for current homeowners. It also hits retail sales, since homebuying tends to lead to increased demand for home furnishings, building materials and electronics.
"
412,PNC,"Still, the March pop in retail spending jibes with other brightening economic data. Consumer sentiment rose to a nine-month high last week. Producer prices also rose faster than expected in March, a positive sign of more demand in the economy.
"
413,PNC,"Even mortgage-purchase applications rose 3.0% in the week ended April 4, the third straight week of gains and a possible sign that winter's grip on the housing market may be easing. Homebuying is ""the most weather-sensitive of all,"" Hoffman said. ""I think we'll see a pretty good rebound in homebuilding and homebuying, and that would be the icing on the cake,"" he added.Retail sales grew at the fastest pace in 18 months during March, suggesting that consumers and the economy may be finally emerging from winter hibernation.Sales rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1% from February, the Commerce Department said, more than the 0.7% expected.

414,PNC,"Even though overall foreclosure numbers continue to decrease across the U.S. year over year, auctions have picked up in many states recently as investors grab remaining bargains.
"
415,PNC,"The increases come amid questions about the path ahead. Some industry watchers see foreclosures and auctions winding down early next year. Others note many markets are already at pre-bust levels or expect foreclosures will still be getting mopped up in certain markets well into 2015 and beyond.
"
416,PNC,"Some investors and flippers intend to go hard this year and then adapt their business strategies after 2015. For others, a foreclosure slowdown means little, because their time-proven tactics predate the property bust.

423,PNC,"Scheduled foreclosure auctions nationwide dropped 8% in January from a year earlier but rose in 27 states, including Oregon (up 326%), Connecticut (up 223%), Maryland (up 113%), New York (up 73%), and Nevada (up 73%), according to RealtyTrac.
"
424,PNC,"It added that foreclosure auctions in New York were at the highest monthly level since October 2010 and scheduled foreclosure auctions in Nevada were at the highest level since February 2012.

"
427,PNC,"But with home prices now rising in many areas, he said, even if it takes six months to foreclose on a home ""it's going to be worth more (later) than it is today.""
"
428,PNC,"Some investors have noticed the uptick. Alex Sifakis, president of JWB Real Estate Capital in Jacksonville, Fla., says he's seeing an increase in properties coming to auction, but he hasn't been buying at auctions recently due to heavy competition from institutions, which have driven up prices.
"
429,PNC,"Instead, he's been finding potential sellers through mailings, billboards, and directly approaching distressed owners. Still, if more properties become available he's willing to reconsider sourcing properties at auction.
"

"

449,PNC,"2013's No. 1 forecaster was Michael Drury, chief economist at Memphis-based McVean Trading & Investments, which specializes in agriculture futures. Drury is bearish. He thinks the bond market's recent lows have been signalling weakness.
"
450,PNC,"""I don't think rates are zero because of the Fed, I think it's because of the invisible hand,"" he said. ""I think we're closer to the beginning of the next recession than the start of a takeoff.""
"
451,PNC,"No. 2 was David Kotok himself. He is most concerned about volatility in the year ahead as the Federal Reserve normalizes after several years of the most dramatic, unconventional monetary policy in history.
"
452,PNC,"""This is the year of change,"" Kotok said. ""For the first time, markets have to say, 'What happens to this suppressed volatility when central bank policies begin to change and they don't change in a coordinated way?'""
"
453,PNC,"David Berson, chief economist with Nationwide Insurance, was third in 2013's survey. Berson is the most upbeat of the top three — with some caveats. Expansions almost always end because the Fed tightens too hard in response to inflation-caused imbalances in the economy, which aren't showing up yet, he said.
"
454,PNC,"""That suggests to me the expansion can go much farther until we get there. We could go another 4-5 years,"" Berson said.
"
455,PNC,"Three such differing outlooks on the state of the economy bring three different sets of predictions about economic indicators. Berson sees GDP growth at 3.2% in the coming year, while Drury and Kotok see 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively. The group median is 3%.
"
456,PNC,"One indicator that the 2013 survey respondents got wrong was the unemployment rate. It was 7.2% when they met in August 2013, and the group predicted that it would stand at 6.7% a year later. On Friday, the Labor Department said that July's rate was 6.2%, edging higher from June.
"
457,PNC,"Berson and Drury expect the jobless rate to decline to 5.5% by next August, while Kotok and the group median see 5.7%.
"
458,PNC,"The group as a whole thinks the S&P 500 index will rise about 4% by July 31, 2015, which would be the smallest such gain since outright declines in 2008 and 2009.
"
459,PNC,"Kotok thinks the S&P 500 will be 1977, not far above Tuesday's close at 1920. Berson forecasts 2075. Drury, the long-term bear, sees 2100.
"
460,PNC,"""There might be one or two more good years in the markets, but there might also be a fairly sizable correction,"" Drury explained. ""I think a more conservative portfolio is appropriate. Rather than trying to make a little money in the next two years, you should be girding for the correction and trying to make a lot of money after.""
"
461,PNC,"Cumberland moved into its largest cash position in a long time in early July, Kotok said.
"
462,PNC,"""We're in the most dangerous time of year in terms of seasonal flows, along with a Fed policy which for the first time is a negative for financial markets,"" he said.
"
463,PNC,"Many investors, Kotok included, believe that equity markets benefitted handsomely from central banks keeping rates at zero to encourage more risk-taking among investors — and will see declines as the punch bowl is pulled away.
"
464,PNC,"Berson isn't a money manager; but as a lifelong housing watcher, he has an optimistic view of that market. The S&P/Case-Shiller home price index will rise 4.1%, he said, less than half of May's 9.3% yearly advance.
"
465,PNC,"""A better job market will lead to household formation,"" he said. ""Double-digit gains are abnormal and ultimately harmful."" That's because such large spikes pressure affordability and incite speculation in housing investment.
"
466,PNC,"Survey coordinator Hoffman said that in recent years the distribution of responses has narrowed quite a bit. In other words, there's more consensus and fewer outliers than in the past.
"
467,PNC,"Still, there was some significant disparity: Bets on the 10-year yield ranged from 2.1% to 4.5%. One maverick bet the that S&P 500 would plunge to 800 and another is counting on 5.6% GDP growth.
"
468,PNC,"""The rosy scenario is we continue a gradual recovery with about 200,000 jobs added per month, rates rise slowly, and inflation is benign,"" Kotok told IBD. ""History says it never works that way. Behavior is never at the mean. It's somewhere else.""Every summer, wealth management firm Cumberland Advisors' chief executive, David Kotok, convenes a few dozen of the most successful economists and investors in the deep woods of Maine for fishing, camaraderie and thoughtful discussion.A staple of ""Camp Kotok"" is an annual survey that asks participants for their bets on various economic indicators a year hence. About half the group weighs in on such metrics as the U.S. 10-year yield, the value of the S&P 500, the jobless rate, the consumer price index and more.So what did campers predict for the next 12 months at the July 31-Aug. 3 event?""The story is the economy is going to go faster, the unemployment rate is going to come down, and the Fed will be closer to raising rates — or will already be raising them,"" said Stu Hoffman, chief economist with PNC Financial Services and the coordinator of the survey for the past several years.But that's the aggregate overview.

503,PNC,"With the S&P 500 pressing on to all-time highs, is the stock market too good to be true? Are we — shudder — approaching a bubble?
"
504,PNC,"One way to gauge the risk is to look at the number of S&P 500 industries with nosebleed price-earnings ratios when the market bubble burst in March 2000. A P-E ratio of 30 or higher is often looked at as unsustainably high for most companies.

"
506,PNC,"As the bubble was bursting 14 years ago, 16 of the S&P 500's 62 industries had P-E ratios topping 30. That accounted for 70% of S&P 500 companies' total market value.

507,PNC,"Of course, the market doesn't need to be in a bubble the size of 2000's to portend a big sell-off, but the absence of a bubble reduces the risk of a market blowoff.

512,PNC,"General Electric (GE) is one likely beneficiary, Kleintop says. ""Transportation and railroad equipment has been in high demand,"" he said.
"
513,PNC,"Illinois Tool Works (ITW) should benefit from the manufacturing renaissance, he says. They make goods used to expand or revamp factories.
"
514,PNC,"Tech hardware is a second segment that should gain from increased capital goods spending. Business hiring in general is climbing. That should boost hardware and services revenues for IBM (IBM), Kleintop says.
"
515,PNC,"Regional banks are a third segment Kleintop likes. PNC (PNC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) stand to gain from more borrowing as the economy warms. Also, rising rates make lending more profitable. PNC has IBD's Composite Rating of 91.

518,PNC,"Regional banks ETFs are rising this week. There are many reasons behind this trend.The economy is gaining momentum and most of the recent economic reports, including the jobs report, have been better than expected. Regional banks benefit from an improving economy as loan growth picks up.And rates are rising.

This will likely trigger a revote and create more uncertainty about the country’s future in the European Union.Meanwhile, new reports suggested that the U.S. is on track to export a record amount of oil to Asia in the coming months, snagging more market share from Russia and OPEC. This comes on the back of news that Russia and OPEC might be forced to increase production to counteract a huge decline in Venezuelan output.On the first half of today’s Free Lunch, Ryan touches on both of these stories, so be sure to tune in and catch up with what you need to know this morning!Later in the episode, Ryan speaks to Zacks Strategist Dave Bartosiak about Wall Street regulation and the first major rollback of Dodd-Frank rules which sought to keep control of America’s financial institutions.

Now, some aspects of the bill are being overturned, giving more leeway to all but the largest banks in the country.The new “deregulation” will have the most impact on companies operating between unique thresholds in terms of assets, including American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), PNC (PNC  -  Free Report), and BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report).Interested in hearing about both sides of the Dodd-Frank argument?

520,PNC,"On May 28, we issued an updated research report on The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report). The company’s cost-containment efforts to drive operational efficiency along with steady loan and deposit growth indicate its upside potential. However, lack of loan diversification remains a concern.The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.6%.In the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up slightly to $10.54 for the current year. Hence, PNC Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Further, shares of this banking giant have recorded a year-to-date return of 3.7% against slight decline for the industry.PNC Financial’s efforts to reduce expenses keep us encouraged. The company successfully realized its continuous improvement savings program (CIP) goals for the last three years (ended 2017) of about $1.25 billion. For 2018, management has a CIP target of $250 million. The company's consistent focus on core expense management might help generate positive operating leverage in the quarters ahead.The company’s strong balance sheet position enables it to strengthen business through strategic initiatives. In 2017, PNC Financial acquired companies, which helped it expand product offering and presence. Thus, the company’s bottom line is likely to get further support if it continues to make planned investments.With one of the most attractive business mixes in the banking industry, PNC Financial continues to make steady progress toward improving its top line. A rising rate environment has helped ease margin pressure greatly, in turn boosting its net interest income. Further, the company’s fee income depicted upward movement in the last reported quarter and is expected to continue increasing with the execution of strategic initiatives.However, a significant portion of PNC Financial’s loan portfolio comprises commercial loans. Such high exposure to commercial loans depicts lack of diversification, which can be risky for the company amid a challenging economy and competitive markets.Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has witnessed an 5.1% upward estimate revision for current-year earnings in the last 60 days. Over the past six months, the company’s share price has been up 9.4%. It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

521,PNC,"Over the last five trading days, banking stocks put up a lackluster show. Though improving U.S. economic data and rising 10-year Treasury bond yields were positives, investors were a bit concerned on the time uncertainty related to the easing of banking regulations and soft loan growth. Nevertheless, strong economy and increasing commodity prices aided a rise in bond yields followed by mortgage rates.Mortgage rates improved to 4.61%, recording a seven-year high since May 2011, as the 10-year Treasury yield hit 3.122%, the highest level since July 2011, on a sell-off recorded in the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Increases in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity.Further, litigations and probes pertaining to banks’ past shoddy activities dominated headlines. The law enforcement agencies are also on track to work to resolve such issues and avoid lengthy litigations. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending May 11, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is in trouble again as its employees have been accused this time for modifying or adding false information related to the bank’s corporate customers, without bringing to their notice, in order to meet a regulatory deadline. Despite strict regulatory scrutiny and promises made by the bank to improve internal controls, disclosures of such misconducts have shattered the bank’s image.Per the report, the scandal took place between late 2017 and the first few months of 2018. Employees at its Wholesale Banking segment have added or changed some personal information such as birth dates, social security numbers and addresses for clients it dealt with during that period. Wells Fargo has been facing a Jun 30 deadline to comply with a regulatory order related to anti-money laundering controls. In an internal investigation, Wells Fargo became aware of these misdoings. The matter has been brought up with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, who is currently investigating the matter.2. Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) has been fined $7.3 million by Hong Kong’s securities regulator. The Securities and Futures Commission said that the bank had failed to discharge its duties of conducting proper due diligence as a sponsor for China-based Real Gold Mining Ltd.’s initial public offering (IPO) in 2009.The mining company has been banned from trading since 2011, after irregularities were discovered in its accounting system. The SFC noted that the bank “failed to conduct adequate and reasonable due diligence on Real Gold’s customers and properly supervise its staff when carrying out the sponsor work on Real Gold’s listing application.”3. With an aim to provide access to its sophisticated alternative investment strategies to a broader client base, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) is reducing the minimum requirement needed to participate in various alternative investment strategies that the company’s asset-management arm offers. The new limit has been set at $100,000, down from the previous requirement of $10 million. This reduction will expand access to certain J.P. Morgan Global Alternative strategies to the masses, which was earlier restricted only to the institutions and the ultra-rich.For this, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, the asset-management arm of the bank has agreed to use the technology of iCapital Network Inc. — a financial technology platform. Per the agreement, J.P. Morgan Asset Management will partner with iCapital so that high net worth investors and their advisors can access certain J.P. Morgan Global Alternative strategies by using iCapital’s digital platform.Price PerformanceHere is how the seven major stocks performed: CompanyLast Week6 monthsJPM-0.8%16.3%BAC-0.4%16.7%WFC-0.4%1.5%C-1.8%1.2%COF4.4%11.1%USB-0.7%-0.3%PNC-0.2%14.5%In the last five trading sessions, Capital One Financial (COF  -  Free Report) was the major gainer, with its shares rallying 4.4%.

522,PNC,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PNC due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.PNC Financial Beats Q1 Earnings Estimates, Revenues UpPNC Financial reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $2.43 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Moreover, the bottom line reflected a 24% increase from the prior-year quarter.Continued easing of pressure on net interest margin helped the company earn higher net interest income during the quarter. Though mortgage banking revenues declined, overall non-interest income witnessed year-over-year growth. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent. Further, the results were partially offset by higher provisions.The company’s net income for the quarter was $1.24 billion, up 15.4% from the prior-year quarter.Segment wise, on a year-over-year basis, quarterly net income at Corporate & Institutional Banking and Asset Management improved 20.1% and 44.7%, respectively. Also, net income for the Retail Banking segment increased 3.6%. However, Other, including the BlackRock segment’s net income declined 11.8% from the prior-year quarter.Revenue Growth Offsets Higher ExpensesTotal revenues for the quarter came in at $4.11 billion, rising 6% year over year.Net interest income was up 9% year over year to $2.36 billion. Also, net interest margin increased 14 basis points (bps) to 2.91%.Non-interest income was up 2% year over year to $1.75 billion, driven by higher asset management income, consumer services income, service charges on deposits and other income, partially offset by lower income from residential mortgage.PNC Financial’s non-interest expenses were $2.53 billion, increasing 5% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily due to higher personnel costs.As of Mar 31, 2018, total loans rose 1% sequentially to $221.6 billion. However, total deposits declined slightly to $264.7 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAllowance for loan and lease losses increased 2% year over year to $2.60 billion. Also, provision for credit losses was $92 million, up 5% from $88 million in the prior-year quarter.However, non-performing assets declined 9% to $2 billion. Further, net charge-offs fell 4% year over year to $113 million.Capital Position WeakensAs of Mar 31, 2018, the Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, which became effective Jan 1, 2018, was 9.6% compared with 9.8% at Dec 31, 2017.Share RepurchaseIn the first quarter, PNC Financial repurchased 4.8 million common shares for $0.7 billion. Also, dividends of $0.4 billion were distributed.OutlookSecond-Quarter 2018The company expects loans to grow modestly on a sequential basis.Management expects NII and fee income to increase in low-single digits sequentially. Other non-interest income is anticipated in the range of $225-$275 million, excluding net securities and visa activity.Non-interest expenses are expected to be up by low-single digits on a sequential basis.Provisions for loan loss are estimated to be in the range of $100-$150 million.Full-Year 2018 Compared with Adjusted Full-Year 2017The company assumes steady growth in GDP along with increasing short-term interest rates. In 2018, it expects two rate hikes of 25 bps each in June and December.Loans are anticipated to grow in mid-single digits.Management anticipates revenues to increase in mid-single digits.Further, non-interest expenses are predicted to rise at low-single digit rates.The effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 17%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and Consensus  The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and Consensus | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, PNC has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, PNC has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

523,PNC,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks was bullish. Strong economic growth, desired inflation and a steady labor market boosted investors’ confidence. Moreover, the recent upswing in oil prices is expected to improve near-term inflation outlook, thereby smoothing the path to rise in interest rates.Mortgage rates also slightly improved to 4.55%, as money was pulled out of the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Increase in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity.Further, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations, and resolution of litigations and probes related to legacy matters and business misconducts persisted in the last five trading days.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending Apr 27, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. Legal hassles continue for major banks. Recently, per a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) has agreed to resolve a consolidated securities fraud class action suit related to the fake-accounts scandal revoked in September 2016. The settlement amount comes to around $480 million.Wells Fargo stated it ""reached an agreement in principle"" with the parties that brought the complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. However, though the deal awaits certain customary conditions and final court approval, the San Francisco-based bank has already fully reserved the amount, as of Mar 31, 2018.Per the filing, “reasonably possible” legal charges could be equivalent to $2.6 billion beyond amount reserved as of Mar 31, 2018. (Read more: Wells Fargo Resolves Sales Scam-Related Suit, To Pay $480M)2. During its Investors’ Day presentation held this week, Wells Fargo came out with impressive expense outlook and expectations of lower impact on earnings from the regulatory cap on assets. The bank also mentioned that it expects to reward its shareholders with higher returns in the long term. It raised the higher end of its payout ratio target to 55-80%, from 55-75% it had set in 2016. However, net interest income, which makes up more than 55% of revenues, is expected to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. Management expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates. The bank expects to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2018, followed by another $2 billion in 2019. It plans to achieve most of these savings by streamlining its lines of businesses along with 300 branch closures.The bank reiterated that it expects total noninterest expenses to be in the range of $53.5-$54.5 billion for 2018, excluding litigation and remediation accruals expenses.Considering Wells Fargo’s involvement in a horde of litigation issues, either due to poor risk control measures or supervision over employees, the Federal Reserve had ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets under $1.95 trillion in February 2018.At the time, the bank stated that it expects the restriction’s impact on its after tax net income to be about $400 million. However, at the Investors’ Day Wells Fargo’s treasurer, Neal Blinde said that modest growth in loans and deposits balance helped reduce the impact to about $100 million.3. As part of its efforts to do away with less profitable businesses, Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) will sell roughly $17 billion of first and second lien mortgages to DLJ Mortgage Capital Inc., a subsidiary of Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report). The deal, expected to close later this quarter, is expected to result in one-time gain for Capital One. (Read more: Capital One to Sell $17B of Mortgages & Resume Share Buyback)4. As part of its efforts to expand into newer markets, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) wants to set up a joint-venture brokerage in China. For this, the company is seeking approval from the securities regulator in the country. Gao Li, a spokeswoman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, recently stated that J.P. Morgan Broking (Hong Kong) Ltd., a unit of JPMorgan submitted an application to acquire 51% stake in a Chinese securities venture. The application will be reviewed by the regulator efficiently, Li said.This move by the bank comes after China, in April, pledged to open its financial markets and hence released guidelines giving permission to foreign companies to own a maximum of 51% of their local securities joint ventures. Notably, the country is expected to remove all ownership limits for foreign companies after three years.5. KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) board of directors has approved a 14.3% hike in the quarterly common stock dividend.

524,PNC,"SunTrust Banks' (STI  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.29 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. Also, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 91 cents.Results were primarily driven by rise in net interest income, lower expenses as well as lower provisions. Also, an improvement in overall asset quality was a tailwind. However, decline in non-interest income hurt results to some extent.Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $612 million, up 36% from the prior-year quarter.Net Interest Income Increases, Costs DeclineTotal revenues (taxable equivalent basis) for the quarter were $2.26 billion, almost stable year over year. However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.28 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 4% year over year to $1.46 billion.On a year-over-year basis, net interest margin was up 15 basis points (bps) to 3.24%, mainly reflecting higher earning asset yields, lower premium amortization expenses and positive mix shift in the loan portfolio.Non-interest income was $796 million, down 6% from the prior-year quarter. The decline was due to a fall in capital markets-related income, mortgage-related income as well as client transaction-related fees.Non-interest expenses declined 3% from the year-ago quarter to $1.42 billion, largely due to lower operating losses and other non-interest expenses.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $778 million as of Mar 31, 2018, down 9% from the prior-year-quarter end. Non-performing loans fell 5 bps year over year to 0.50% of total loans held for investment.Further, the rate of net charge-offs decreased 10 bps year over year to 0.22% of total average loans held for investment. Also, provision for credit losses plunged 76% from the year-ago quarter to $28 million.Strong Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, SunTrust had total assets of $204.9 billion while shareholders’ equity was $24.3 billion, representing nearly 12% of total assets.As of Mar 31, 2018, loans held for investments were $142.6 billion, down marginally from the prior-quarter end. Total consumer and commercial deposits increased 1% from the prior quarter to $161.4 billion.SunTrust’s estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III (on a fully phased-in basis) was 9.85% as of Mar 31, 2018.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, the company bought back shares worth $330 million.Our ViewpointSunTrust remains well positioned for growth, given its favorable deposit mix and enhanced credit quality. Easing margin pressure and initiatives to enhance efficiency are likely to support its revenues. However, a slowdown in the mortgage business is expected to hurt the top-line growth. This makes us apprehensive for the near-term. Also, exposure to risky loan portfolio remains a concern.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc.

525,PNC,"BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents. The figure recorded 31.1% surge from the year-ago quarter.Results reflected a slight rise in revenues and lower operating expenses. However, higher credit costs and a decline in loan balance were the undermining factors.Results excluded merger-related and restructuring charges. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $745 million or 94 cents per share, up from $378 million or 46 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Grow Slightly, Expenses DeclineTotal revenues (taxable-equivalent) came in at $2.84 billion, up marginally year over year.

Net interest margin fell 2 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.44%.Non-interest income increased nearly 1% year over year to $1.18 billion. Higher investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, and bankcard fees and merchant discounts were partly offset by decline in insurance income and mortgage banking income.Non-interest expenses of $1.69 billion fell 19.8% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower outside IT services costs and net merger-related and restructuring charges as well as absence of loss on early extinguishment of debt.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 57.3%, down from 58.0% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates rise in profitability.As of Mar 31, 2018, total deposits were nearly $158.2 billion, up marginally from the prior quarter. Total loans and leases of $144.2 billion were down slightly on a sequential basis.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Mar 31, 2018, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $669 million, down 16.5% year over year.

Return on average common equity improved to 11.43% from 5.72% as of Mar 31, 2017.As of Mar 31, 2018, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12%, on par with the year-ago quarter.

Also, expected growth in loans, along with an improving rate scenario, is likely to propel its organic growth trajectory in the quarters ahead. However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability to some extent.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteBB&T carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, escalating operating expenses remained a major drag.Net income came in at $381.6 million compared with $276.1 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Margins & Revenues Improve, Costs EscalateTotal revenues of $1.48 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 billion. Also, the figure improved 15% year over year.On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, net interest income of $392.7 million was up 8% year over year. This was driven by elevated levels of average earning assets and higher net interest margin (NIM).NIM  was 1.38%, up 3 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The increase chiefly reflected higher short-term interest rate, partially offset by rise in premium amortization and a balance-sheet mix shift.Non-interest income advanced 17% from the year-ago quarter to $1.09 billion. Rise in trust, investment and other servicing fees, along with foreign exchange trading income, security commissions and trading income, were the primary reasons for this upswing. These were partially offset by lower treasury management fees, other operating income and investment security losses.Non-interest expenses flared up 11% year over year to $995.3 million in the quarter. The rise was mainly driven by an increase in all components of expenses.Improvement in AUC & AUMAs of Mar 31, 2018, Northern Trust’s total AUC increased 14% year over year to $8.111 trillion while total AUM rose 16% to $1.16 trillion.Credit Quality ImprovesTotal allowance for credit losses came in at $147.8 million, down 22% year over year. Non-performing assets decreased 31% to $128.9 million as of Mar 31, 2018. Also, credit provision was $3 million in the quarter compared with $1 million reported in the prior-year quarter.However, net charge-offs were $3 million, up 50% from the year-ago quarter.Strong Capital PositionUnder the Advanced Approach, as of Mar 31, 2018, Tier 1 capital ratio, total capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio came in at 14.4%, 16.2% and 7.6% compared with 14.2%, 15.6% and 8.2%, respectively, in the prior-year quarter. All ratios exceeded the regulatory requirements.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring the reported quarter, the company repurchased 2.5 million shares for $263.2 million at an average price of $104.51 per share. This includes shares related to share-based compensation.Our ViewpointResults of Northern Trust display a decent performance in the reported quarter. We remain optimistic by the continued growth in AUC, revenues and an improving credit quality, to some extent. Furthermore, a positive impact of rising rates was visible. Though escalating expenses might pose a threat to the company’s profitability, benefits of tax reform are anticipated to act as a tailwind.Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteNorthern Trust carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The rise was primarily due to higher personnel costs.As of Mar 31, 2018, total loans rose 1% sequentially to $221.6 billion.

530,PNC,"The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 13, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for PNC Financial. The quarter witnessed a rise in consumer confidence, which led to loan growth. Also, the rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank.Moreover, PNC Financial’s bottom line is expected to benefit from lower tax rates as it is likely to have retained a remarkable part of its revenues. Also, improved M&A and equity underwriting activities during the quarter are likely to drive fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $4.15 billion indicates a 6.8% year-over-year improvement.Before we discuss the factors that might impact PNC Financial’s first-quarter results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s fourth-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and higher fee income. These factors also helped it in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses and provision for loan losses.Notably, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 4.1%.The earnings beat translated into improved price performance. Over the past year, shares of PNC Financial have gained 32.7%, outperforming the 21.8% growth recorded by the industry.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: PNC Financial might report higher interest income as the quarter continued to witness rise in interest rates and improvement in lending scenario. The U.S. consumer sentiment reached its highest level since 2004 during the quarter along with the unemployment rate remaining at record low levels. Such factors are likely to have led to upbeat lending activities.Also, the company’s net interest margin (NIM) is likely to expand with support from two rate hikes since December 2017. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, NIM is expected to expand 15 basis points to 2.92%, year over year.Notably, the consensus estimate for net interest income is projected to be $2.34 billion, up 8.4% year over year.Controlled Expenses: The company has a cost-saving program in place for the year to keep expenses under control. Also, management expects non-interest expenses to be down by low-single digits on a sequential basis.Lower Mortgage Banking Revenues: The company is likely to continue witnessing lower revenues from this division owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates. Per the consensus estimate, residential mortgage revenues are likely to decline 9.7% to $102 million in the first quarter, on a year-over-year basis.Non-Interest Income Might Rise: As the first quarter was decent in terms of investment banking and equity underwriting business due to higher volumes of M&As, the related fees are expected to increase marginally.However, debt underwriting activities during the quarter were not encouraging, so the related fees are likely to remain muted.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that PNC Financial will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Nevertheless, with earnings estimates for the first quarter been revised slightly upward over the last 30 days, the company is expected to witness 23.5% year-over-year earnings growth.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

531,PNC,"Most banks that reported first-quarter 2018 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of rising rates, lower taxes and improved trading activities. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, banks’ results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, the results show eased margin pressure.Importantly, high volatility led to improved trading activities in the quarter, leading to higher trading revenues for banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing. Also, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and personnel, and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor. Nevertheless, legal expenses remained under control. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Apr 13, 2018)Important Earnings of the Week1.

Nonetheless, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income, with lower mortgage revenues, were the undermining factors. Additionally, expenses soared.

The reported figure was up 44% from the prior-year quarter. Results in the reported quarter included 11 cents per share of mark-to-market gains related to the adoption of new recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost.Decent loan growth (driven mainly by improved wholesale loans) and higher interest rates aided net interest income growth. Further, higher equity trading income (up 26%) and fixed income trading (up 8%) supported the top line. Additionally, mortgage banking income witnessed a rise, driven by growth in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by fall in mortgage origination volume.

532,PNC,"The first-quarter earnings season is already knocking at the doors with big names — JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) — all reporting financial numbers tomorrow, before the opening bell.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This reversed the uptrend experienced by banks since last September.Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector affected the stock market rally in the quarter. All these activities indicate a favorable momentum on the capital markets aiding trading revenues, primarily for big banks.Notably, the first-quarter earnings are expected to report decent numbers as compared with the last quarter (impacted by huge one-time charges related to the tax reform), with a rising interest-rate environment aiding net interest margins — the backbone for banks’ top-line growth.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending will likely energize interest income for banks. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are predicted to improve slightly on a sequential basis in the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans, to some extent.Mortgage business is anticipated to witness a slowdown in the first quarter. With interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this source.The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt-origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could deal a blow to the banks.However, strong equity issuances globally might have got boosted from IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are projected to escalate. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As in certain sectors will likely help banks garner advisory fees.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.On the cost front, while the absence of considerable legal expenses since the last few quarters is encouraging, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in first-quarter 2018 are projected to rise 11.3% year over year.Let’s take a look at the four major banks scheduled to announce results tomorrow.JPMorgan will report the first-quarter earnings before the opening bell. Steady rise in net interest income and slowdown in mortgage banking is expected. Investment banking income is projected to remain stable or increase marginally year over year. Furthermore, with increased volatility during the quarter, management projects first-quarter market revenues to rise at a mid-to-high single-digit rate, on a year-over-year basis. Similar to the prior quarters, equity trading revenues are also expected to render support to the total trading revenues of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. (Read more: Higher Trading & Rates to Support JPMorgan Q1 Earnings).Notably, JPMorgan surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and EPS Surprise JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and EPS Surprise | JPMorgan Chase & Co. QuoteOn Friday, yet another big bank, Wells Fargo, is also slated to announce results. With a Zacks Rank of 3 and Earnings ESP of +0.73%, the chances of a likely earnings beat in the quarter to be reported are bright. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Wells Fargo is likely to benefit from easing margin and high interest income, though marginally. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent. Nonetheless, mounting expenses, continual auto-loan portfolio runoff and low mortgage business are expected to dent the banking giant’s results.

Nonetheless, the company is anticipated to witness improvement in consumer banking revenues, while pressure on margins is likely to somewhat ease. Additionally, rebound in trading revenues is expected to act as a tailwind.

QuoteLikewise, we cannot conclusively predict earnings beat for PNC Financial in the first quarter, with an Earnings ESP of +0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Projected higher net-interest income and consumer loan growth will likely support earnings. In addition, an increase in fee income is estimated on equity underwriting business strength. However, the company is likely to continue witnessing lower mortgage revenues owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates.

533,PNC,"The performance of investment banking, one of the primary source of revenues for Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), is expected to be muted in first-quarter 2018. This could have an adverse impact on the bank’s results, scheduled to be released on Monday, Apr 16.Investment banking income comprises underwriting revenues and advisory fees. So, let’s check how these are likely to perform in the to-be-reported quarter.Unlike prior quarters, growth in underwriting fees, consisting of debt and equity underwriting, is expected to be muted. Rising interest rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuances. As debt origination fees account for nearly 40% of total investment banking fees for BofA, this will likely have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues.Further, high volatility in the equity markets across the globe is expected to have somewhat slowed down equity issuances. While fourth-quarter 2017 was an exception, IPOs and follow-on offerings in the to-be-reported quarter are likely to have normalized. Thus, equity underwriting fees are anticipated to remain stable or improve marginally.Talking about advisory fees, M&A activity in terms of deals closed globally witnessed a fall in the first quarter, though the overall deal value recorded a significant rise. Thus, as number of deals declined, this will likely adversely impact advisory fees to some extent. But as BofA is one of the leading players in this space, it may report a modest increase in advisory revenues.For this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment.

534,PNC,"Starting tomorrow, quarterly results from major banks will kick-off the first quarter earnings season. The resurgence of dormant volatility due to trade war tensions, technology industry woes and inflation will certainly drive trading revenues. A tighter rate environment will also boost net interest margins.Banks are the biggest earnings contributors of the Finance sector. The sector’s earnings outlook has notably improved as a result of tax cuts, higher interest rates, and generally favorable economic backdrop. The sector is expected to report 19.2% higher earnings on 4.5% higher revenues, which will follow the sector’s flattish performance in the preceding period. (Read: Bank Earnings in the Spotlight)Major banks reporting earnings this week include Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report). With JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Apr 13, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both of these have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Return on Assets (ROA)Examining earnings per share alone would not generate any significant insights when determining the level of profitability of a bank. Return on Assets is a ratio which reveals how efficiently a bank is utilizing its assets to generate profits.Currently, JPMorgan holds total assets of $377.3 billion while Wells Fargo has total assets of $253.2 billion. Our research shows that the average one year trailing 12-month ROA for Wells Fargo stands at 1.14%, higher than 1.05% for JPMorgan.Price PerformanceJPMorgan has lost 1.8% over the last three months, outperforming the broader industry which has declined 7.1% over the same period. Wells Fargo has dropped 17% over the same period, underperforming both the broader industry and JPMorgan. ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the broader industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has the potential to gain in the near future. The industry has an average one year trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 1.76, which is below the S&P 500 average of 3.74. Hence, it might be a good idea not to stay away from stocks belonging to this industry.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.39, Wells Fargo is undervalued compared to the S&P 500 and the industry. However, though JPMorgan is also undervalued compared to the industry and the S&P 500, with a P/B ratio of 1.65, it is pricier than Wells Fargo.   Dividend YieldWells Fargo’s dividend yield over the last one year period is 3%. With a dividend yield of 2.03%, JPMorgan shareholders earn lower dividend yield than both Wells Fargo and the broader industry, which has an average dividend yield of 2.06%.Earnings History and ESPConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, JPMorgan has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 8.7%. In comparison, Wells Fargo has delivered positive surprises in three of the four prior quarters with an average earnings surprise of 0.3%. But the situation changes when considering Earnings ESP values, with JPMorgan's being +0.29% and Wells Fargo’s being +0.73%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that JPMorgan holds an edge over Wells Fargo when considering price performance and a more detailed earnings history. However, Wells Fargo is superior when considering valuation, return on assets and dividend yield.Additionally, it carries an ESP reading of +0.73%, better than JPMorgan’s figure of +0.29%. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 and seem to be evenly matched but Wells Fargo is preferable ahead of earnings, since it holds a clear edge in the Earnings ESP stakes.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

535,PNC,"Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) climbed on Monday, only days before the banking giant is set to report its first quarter financial results. This could be a sign that investors think JPMorgan is poised to post strong Q1 earnings. Let’s dive into the numbers to see what’s really in store.    JPMorgan’s move was part of a broader resurgence throughout the market. But volatility is unlikely to disappear any time soon, with trade tensions between the U.S. and China continuing to escalate.With that said, one of the best ways for investors to come out on top amid this current bearish period is to look for stocks that are set to top quarterly earnings estimates and avoid ones that might miss.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for JPMorgan’s Q1 earnings to soar by 38.2% and hit $2.28 per share. JPMorgan has also experienced solid earnings estimate revision activity recently, having earned five upward earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days, against just one downward revision.However, this still doesn’t give investors any idea if JPMorgan is expected to top our current earnings estimate. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.JPMorgan is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and rocks an Earnings ESP of -0.80%. Furthermore, at the moment, the company’s Most Accurate Estimate is $2.26 per share, which comes in 2 cents below our consensus estimate. This means that investors might want to avoid JPMorgan ahead of earnings.JPMorgan is expected to report its Q1 earnings results before the opening bell on Friday, April 13. Fellow banking powers, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report), are also set to report their quarterly earnings on Friday, with Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) scheduled for next Monday.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

536,PNC,"Over the last four trading days, performance of banking stocks has been encouraging. Easing U.S.-China trade war tension has provided some respite to investors, infusing overall positivity in the market.Mortgage rates declined this week, hitting 4.4%, along with bond yields, on fears of a trade war. Despite this, investors are apprehensive about parking funds in the housing market, thanks to the volatility in the financial world. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time gainers.Further, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield shrunk during the week, as demand for safe-haven assets increased due to the political tension, only to bounce back near to 2.82% as fears of the trade war waned.Notably, mortgage applications plunged last week, per the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. In addition, the refinance share of mortgage activity came in at 38.5% of all applications.Though economic data might be affected marginally due to slapping of trade tariffs by the United States and China, the first-quarter GDP is expected to grow moderately and consumer spending is anticipated to bear minimal brunt. Therefore, positive numbers and anticipations of an improving job market might lead to rise in housing demand.Regarding company-specific news related to banks, streamlining operations and steady capital-deployment activities persisted over the last four trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Mar 9, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

537,PNC,"Shares of PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) climbed as part of Wednesday’s broader market resurgence. Still, the recent volatility is likely far from over after trade war speculation revved up once again. This means that investors will be on the lookout for stocks that are expected to perform well during the upcoming first quarter earnings season.PNC had seen its stock price climb 30% over the last year before it slipped in early March, along with many other financial services firms during the tech-induced selloff. Luckily for investors, a market-driven decline is more manageable than a company-specific, fundamental related downturn.This doesn’t mean that investors should just dive back into PNC based on market trends. They should instead focus on some of PNC’s most important fundamentals and see how the banking giant is expected to perform in the first quarter.  With that said, let’s jump into some PNC projections ahead of its upcoming Q1 financial results, as investors look to find much-needed stability.Latest Outlook PNC’s first quarter revenues are expected to climb by 7.1% to hit $4.16 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the bank is projected to see its quarterly earnings soar by 23.5% to reach $2.42 per share.PNC’s recent earnings estimate revision activity has been mixed, with PNC earning three upward earnings estimate revisions against two downward revisions, all within the last 30 days. However, within the last seven days, PNC has earned two earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside.As we approach the release of PNC’s first quarter 2018 financial results, the firm’s Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.43 per share.ValuationPNC is currently trading with a Forward P/E of 13.9. This marks a relatively large premium compared to the “Banks - Major Regional” industry, which is currently trading at an average of 11.8x forward earnings.However, PNC’s current valuation marks a discount compared to where it had been trading at during the last few months.Shares of PNC had dipped more than 5% over the last four weeks, which is a major reason for PNC’s newly discounted valuation. Investors should also note that the regional banking industry’s decline far outpaces PNC’s recent downturn.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of PNC’s Q1 report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteWe can see that PNC’s has posted strong results over the last few of years. It is also worth noting that PNC’s stock price has performed really well following the release of its quarterly earnings results in four of the last six quarters.Bottom LinePast performance is no indicator of future success. But investors should remember that PNC’s top line is expected to grow, while its bottom line is projected to expand by over 23%. Better still, PNC has earned two upward earnings estimate revisions within the last seven days and is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).PNC is scheduled to report its first quarter 2018 financial results before markets open on Friday, April 13.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

538,PNC,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks remained optimistic. Rebound in trading activities (after dismal 2017 performance) is perhaps the primary reason for this bullish price performance.Banks like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) expect trading revenues to improve in first-quarter 2018. This is likely to be driven by solid revenues in foreign exchange, emerging markets and equities trading. Specifically, Citigroup expects “low-to-mid” single digit year-over-year increase in trading revenues and JPMorgan projects market revenues to rise in mid-to-high single-digit rate from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, progress in rolling back parts of the Dodd Frank Act cheered investors. The Senate is working on a bipartisan banking bill expected to lower stringent banking regulations. This will likely reduce regulatory compliance cost for several banks.On the other hand, mortgage rates continued to rise, with 30-year mortgages averaging 4.46% (marking the ninth consecutive weekly increase). The rise seems to be attributable to chances of rate hike later this month and impending trade war following the imposition of tariffs. This steady rise in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity, thereby hurting banks mortgage banking revenues to some extent.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, business misconducts continued to dominate headlines for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Mar 2, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

There have been issues of incorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record of the values associated with certain assets.However, Wells Fargo has not yet determined the number of accounts that were affected along with the reason that led to the wrongdoing.Shea Leordeanu, a spokeswoman for the bank’s brokerage division, recently said in a statement that the bank has made ""significant progress in our work to identify and fix any issues, make things right and build a better, stronger company.""Thus, Galvin said that his office was seeking information about the scope of Wells Fargo’s investigation. They have asked the bank to give them information regarding “inappropriate referrals of brokerage customers to managed and advisory accounts, unsuitable recommendations of alternative investments, as well as unsuitable referrals and recommendations in connection with 401(k) rollovers.”Galvin said, “Given the recent retirement savings crisis in America, referrals and recommendations involving 401(k) accounts should be closely scrutinized, in light of the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule.”2.

539,PNC,"Over the last five trading days, volatility in the stock market affected the banking stocks as well. The Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s congressional testimony dominated, wherein he presented an optimistic picture of the U.S. economy. This view hints at a rise in inflation, which will give the Fed all the more reason to take a hawkish stance in raising interest rates.Additionally, growth in economy, low unemployment rate and strong consumer sentiment will drive the demand for loans and other related products of banks. These will support banks’ financials though the markets seem to be wary of such a scenario. Hence, this led to significant volatility and bank stocks’ performance turned bearish over the last five trading sessions.Driven by the Fed’s upbeat view on the economy, mortgage rates were also on an upswing with 30-year mortgages averaging 4.43% (highest in more than four years). However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers.

U.S. Bank’s long-term deposits rating of Aa1, issuer and senior unsecured debt rating of A1, baseline credit assessment (BCA) of aa3 and counterparty risk assessment of Aa2(cr) are also under review. However, short-term ratings of Prime-1 for short-term deposits and senior debts were affirmed and are not under review.Following the legal settlement, Moody’s felt the necessity to review whether the company’s risk management system continues to be better in comparison to its competitors. Though, the settlement amount was beyond Moody’s expectations, it anticipates U.S. Bancorp’s earnings and capital position remains well poised to bear the impact.The rating agency will be considering whether U.S. Bank’s BCA rating of aa3 is still justified. Also, the changes in board processes along with oversight and the ability to guide management in identifying and mitigating potential future risk will be reviewed.U.S. Bancorp’s enterprise-wide risk governance, asset quality and operational risks will also be in focus of the review process.

541,PNC,"U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) long-term ratings are under review for downgrade by Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation. In March 2017, the rating agency had rated U.S. Bancorp’s senior unsecured and subordinated debt as A1.Moody’s initiated the review on account of the $613 million settlement that U.S. Bancorp had agreed upon with several U.S. regulatory bodies last week due to shortcomings in its anti-money laundering and willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. (Read more: U.S. Bancorp to Pay Penalty of $613M for Money Laundering)Ratings for U.S. Bancorp’s subsidiaries along with its bank subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association, have been placed for review. U.S. Bank’s long-term deposits rating of Aa1, issuer and senior unsecured debt rating of A1, baseline credit assessment (BCA) of aa3 and counterparty risk assessment of Aa2(cr) are also under review. However, short-term ratings of Prime-1 for short-term deposits and senior debts were affirmed and are not under review.Following the legal settlement, Moody’s felt the necessity to review whether the company’s risk management system continues to be better in comparison to its competitors. Though, the settlement amount was beyond Moody’s expectations, it anticipates U.S. Bancorp’s earnings and capital position remains well poised to bear the impact.The rating agency will be considering whether U.S. Bank’s BCA rating of aa3 is still justified. Also, the changes in board processes along with oversight and the ability to guide management in identifying and mitigating potential future risk will be reviewed.U.S. Bancorp’s enterprise-wide risk governance, asset quality and operational risks will also be in focus of the review process. Notably, the company remains exposed to the risk of coming into light some other breach of law, which would lead to a violation of the two-year deferred prosecution agreement that the company had agreed upon with the regulators.What Can Drive the Ratings UpRatings of the company might witness an upgradation if Moody's is of the opinion that its enterprise risk governance and management stand superior to its peers and that it is likely to maintain above-average and consistent financial metrics.What Can Bring the Ratings DownOn the flip side, long-term ratings can be downgraded if Moody’s finds that the company’s enterprise-wide risk governance and management are not strong enough to place it above its peers. A sustained weakening in asset quality, capital or profitability metrics could also act as a negative factor.Shares of U.S. Bancorp have gained 4.7% over the past six months, underperforming the 19.7% growth for the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank & Key PicksThe stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

542,PNC,"The financial sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. After President Donald Trump passed the tax reform last year, analysts are highly optimistic about the financial sector’s performance owing to recent trends in the sector.The Senate recently passed the deregulation bill, scaling back Dodd Frank. This is expected to be a huge positive for regional banks. Moreover, the current market sentiment around rate hikes by the Fed is expected to play in favor of the overall financial sector.Cause for AppealIn a landmark victory for Trump, the Senate passed a massive banking deregulation bill. In a rare showing of bipartisanship, the Senate voted 67 to 31 in favor of the bill, intended to help small banks become more competitive. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets would be exempted from the Volcker Rule, which prohibits federally insured institutions from trading for their own profits and also puts regulatory measures in place to limit their ownership of risky investments.Although some hurdles still remain, as the House may seek a more expansive rollback of the Dodd-Frank act, the bill is widely expected to become law. Moreover, although the regional banking sector celebrated this event, skeptics have warned of dire consequences in case it becomes law (read: Time for Top Bank ETFs Ahead of Powell's First Fed Meeting?).Further, driving positive sentiment for the overall financial sector is the current scenario around interest rates. Traders place a 94.4% probability around a rate hike in Jerome Powell’s first FOMC meeting, per the CME Fedwatch tool. Moreover, the debate on if the Fed will go ahead with three rate hikes or four in 2018 is still doing the rounds. Rate hikes are particularly positive for financial stocks, as it leads to an increase in the prime rates, at which banks lend to customers.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the space.Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks in the U.S. equity markets.

543,PNC,"For investors seeking momentum, iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (IAT  -  Free Report) is probably on radar now. The fund just hit a 52-week high, and is up about 27% from its 52-week low price of $41.83/share.But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:IAT in Focus    This ETF offers exposure to small and mid-size U.S. regional banks with heavy concentration on the top two firms U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial Services (PNC  -  Free Report) at 14.2% and 12.4%, respectively, while other firms hold no more than 7.12% share. While regional banks make up for a substantial portion, diversified banks make up for about 14.2% share in the basket. The fund charges investors 44 basis points a year in fees (see: all the Financial ETFs here).Why the Move?The banking corner of the financial space has been an area to watch lately especially after the speculation of faster-than-expected rates hike. The upbeat jobs report initially sparked inflation fears and the prospect of speedy rates hike. Then, the Fed minutes signaled a hawkish stance and now the new Fed chairperson Jerome Powell has hinted at more rate hikes than the three penciled in for this year in its first testimony to Congress. Rising rates have been great for the banking sector, as it will bolster their profit margins.More Gains Ahead? Currently, IAT has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook. Therefore, it is hard to get a handle on its future returns one way or the other. However, many of the segments that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank, so there is definitely still some promise for those who want to ride on this surging ETF a little longer.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

544,PNC,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) plans to refund about $330 million to its credit card customers by the latter half of this year, after having confessed to charging higher interest rates to some of the defaulters, since 2011.Per the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, credit card issuing companies are required to review the accounts of customers whose interest rates had risen after a missed payment or bounced checks. The companies are to determine whether the customer has resumed making timely payments or has displayed some other creditworthy behavior.On being satisfied of the customer’s financial standing, the rates are supposed to be lowered.In one such review, Citigroup discovered to have kept overcharging about 1.75 million accounts. The bank said to have found flaws in the methodology it used to calculate the reduced rates in some accounts.Majority of the affected accounts witnessed smaller rate cuts than they were eligible to, while the rest did not get the reduction at all. The New York based lender will be making average refunds of $190.    Also, the bank disclosed to have found no wrongdoings on part of its employees. Further, it apologized for having delayed in identifying the issue and promised to make amends at the earliest.Previously in 2015, the financial regulators had made Citigroup pay nearly $700 million to credit card customers who were made to buy unnecessary add-on services. Per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s findings, seven million accounts had been targets of “deceptive” marketing.The recent disclosure is likely to have a little impact on the Citigroup’s reputation. Moreover, the company, with its global footprint and attractive core business, seems to be well poised for growth.Shares of Citigroup have gained 28.4% over the past year, outperforming the 19.1% growth for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space are The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report), State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2.

546,PNC,"Major indices regained stability following an erratic week that ended Feb 9. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 4.3%, marking the largest gain since the election of Trump. On top of that, the S&P 500 registered a gain of 4.3% over the last five trading sessions through the week ending Feb 16, the highest since 2013.It seems investors are no longer fretting over the spike in inflation rates but are instead focused on record-low unemployment levels and better-than-expected job addition. In fact, analysts believe that the record job additions and strong GDP data will help the indices maintain the bullish momentum.Investors should know that out of the 10 sectors tracking the S&P 500 index, the Financial industry rallied 4.7% last week. In particular, banks are poised to generate more profits from higher lending rates. In other words, the possibility of aggressive rate hikes by the Fed through 2018 will likely boost bank profits.Fed May Raise Rate AggressivelyPer the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index ticked up 0.5% through January 2018, beating market expectations of 0.3%. The index rose 2.1% over the past 12 months, indicating that the central bank might make an aggressive move to raise policy rates.Leading investment management firm BlackRock added that the central bank could lift policy rates three or four times in 2018. The rate hike will increase the borrowing cost, leading to the payment of higher interest to lenders. This is expected to ensure higher lending income for banks.Loans to GrowThe mid-month report of the University of Michigan shows that the U.S. consumer sentiment index for the month of February has not only touched a record high but has also risen more than market expectations.The index scaled 99.9 in February, surpassing the estimate of 95.5 made by Reuters economists. It also reflects the second-highest mark over the past 14 years. This clearly shows that consumers are more interested in the news of low unemployment, wage growth, and solid GDP data than the market's tumultuous movement. Hence, significant job addition and healthy consumer sentiments will boost the demand for loans and other related products of banks.GDP Data Solid: The nation’s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017, following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, this marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.Notably, in the first quarter of this year, GDP is expected to jump 5.4%, per the latest estimate by Atlanta Fed.Significant Job Addition & Low Unemployment: Per the U.S. Labor Department report, 200,000 new non-farm payroll jobs were created in January, beating market expectations. According to a survey by Reuters, most economists were expecting an addition of 180,000 jobs.Also, the jobless rate remained at an ultra-low level of 4.1% and workers’ hourly wages increased 2.9% year over year in January 2017.Tax Reforms to Benefit BanksThe tax bill, which was signed into law last year, will likely benefit banks. Although major banks took a hit in the fourth quarter owing to non-recurring non-cash chargea related to the tax reform bill, financial institutions expect the reform to prove beneficial in the long term.During the fourth quarter, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) reported net loss of $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per share. The results included a non-recurring non-cash charge related to the tax reform of $22 billion. However, Citigroup expects lower effective tax rate to drive net income.Moreover, with the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) expects its effective tax rate to be 17% in the first quarter of 2018, 19% in 2018, and nearly 20% in the near term.Both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) believe that the tax reform will likely lower their effective tax rates to 19% for 2018. Media reports claimed that the rate for 2018 will be significantly below the actual rate paid during 2016 and hence will increase the combined profit of banks by at least $7 billion this year.Which Stocks to Focus On?Picking bank stocks with strong fundamentals seems to be a smart option but the task can be a daunting one.This is where our proprietary Stock Screener comes in handy.

547,PNC,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks has been bullish. The 10-year Treasury bond yields escalated at four-year highs on higher-than-expected inflation. Positive economic growth, along with central banks’ moves globally to improve interest rates from ultra-low levels, boosted yields which supported bank stocks, encouraging investors to focus more on bank stocks.Additionally, investors’ confidence received a boost from President Trump’s much-awaited $200-billion infrastructure plan that rolled out earlier this week.Mortgage rates were also on an upswing, hitting a nearly four-year high of 4.38%, as money was pulled out of the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Increase in mortgage rates will limit reduce refinancing activity.Further, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations, and resolution of litigations and probes related to legacy matters and business misconducts persisted in the last five trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Feb 9, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

548,PNC,"Investors had a tough time making up their minds about Fed Minutes on Wednesday.  Initially, concerns about a lack of broad-based wage growth allayed ongoing fears that rising inflation would end the markets’ rally. However, things turned around completely during the last 45 minutes of the trading day following a spike in bond yields.Overall, the Fed’s latest report indicates that an increase in economic growth and an uptrend in inflation is reason enough for the central bank to keep raising rates. This was the one clear, unequivocal inflation which came through. Rate hikes will most certainly boost banks higher, which is why adding them to your portfolio looks like a smart option.Pace of Rate Hikes Likely to IncreaseA significant number of the participants of the Fed meeting held between Jan 30-31 said that they had raised their growth projections from the preceding month. Resilient global economic growth, bullish financial markets and the stimulus released by recent tax cuts would propel the economy higher than what is being currently expected.  Others were of the opinion that these same factors had increased “upside risks” for the economy.But the majority of the participants opined that firmer expectations for economic growth have raised the odds in favor of gradual monetary policy tightening. This view was reflected in the manner in which the report’s language was changed to include an indication regarding “further” rate increases.Scanty Evidence on Wage Growth?Members of the U.S. central bank agreed that they have failed to recognize the true impact of recent tax cuts. But there was uncertainty about what impact these cuts would have on wages. Following the tax cuts, several companies have issued bonuses to their employees. But the long term impact of these recent cash transfers remains unclear at this point.Ultimately, the Fed found little evidence up to their meeting about a sector wide increase in wage growth. This part of the report gladdened the hearts of investors initially.However, they were quick to recognize that the Fed’s meeting was closely followed by strong jobs data which reflected a year-over-year pickup in wage growth. Also released almost immediately afterward was strong CPI data which exceeded most expectations.Outlook for Inflation ImprovesOnly a “few” of the 12 districts surveyed by the Federal Reserve observed that companies in those regions had relevant pricing power. Meanwhile, a small section of officials took a dovish stance, arguing that inflation would continue to come in under the Fed target of 2%. They think recent tax cuts would force businesses to engage in a pricing war to capture market share.But the overwhelming majority of officials at the Fed projected that an increase in inflation was likely to ensue. According to the minutes, the index for core personal consumption expenditure or core PCE would increase at a noticeably faster pace this year. This would imply a substantial hike over the 1.5% pace recorded in December.Our ChoicesThe overall tone of the latest Fed meeting minutes indicates that a majority of members favor a gradual step up in rates over the current year. A strong growth environment supportive financial markets and recent tax cuts have pushed up growth projections which in turn have raised the odds for rate hikes.This is why it makes good sense to pick select bank stocks at this point.

553,PNC,"Stocks opened higher on Monday as investors seem to think the U.S.-led air strikes on Syria won’t lead to a much larger conflict. The strikes also coincided with the real start of first quarter earnings season, which investors should use as a way to fight off the volatility that has plagued markets recently.Earnings season kicked into gear last Friday when banking giants, JPMorgan Chase (JMP  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report), reported their Q1 financial results. Going forward, investors should use this highly anticipated period to try to recoup any losses they might have suffered during the extended bearish run.With that said, investors still need to be selective during earnings season and hunt for stocks that look poised to top quarterly earnings estimates. Conversely, investors should stay away from any companies that might disappoint by reporting lower-than-expected earnings results.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three stocks that look ready to post an earnings beat this week.Check them out now: 1.     Honeywell International (HON  -  Free Report)Shares of Honeywell climbed on Monday, which might signal that investors have reason to be excited about the company famous for its thermostats and other control technologies for buildings, homes, and industries. Honeywell is indeed expected to see its revenues climb by 4.7% to reach $9.94 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s earnings are projected to climb by 13.9% to $1.89 per share.Honeywell is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.46%. Diving a little deeper, HON’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $1.90 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. This means that Honeywell could be ready to top Q1 earnings estimates when it reports its financial results before the market opens on Friday, April 20.2.       E-Trade Financial (ETFC  -  Free Report)Volatility might not be great for investors, but online brokerage firms such as E-Trade can benefit hugely. This has been reflected in E-Trade’s stock price, which is up 71% over the last year, and also managed to come out of the recent market downturn nearly unscathed. E-Trade is expected to see its first quarter revenues climb by 23.3% to reach $681.74 million. The company’s bottom line is projected to hit $0.78 per share, which would mark stellar 62.5% expansion from the year-ago period. Better still, E-Trade is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an Earnings ESP of 1.14%, with its Most Accurate Estimate coming in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. Therefore, investors should consider E-Trade a stock that looks poised to beat earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday, April 19.3.       Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report)Shares of Abbott popped on Monday morning just a couple of days before the diversified healthcare company is set to report its first quarter earnings results. And it looks like Abbott investors have reason to be excited, with the company’s quarterly revenues projected to surge by more than 14% to hit $7.26 billion.Meanwhile, Abbott’s earnings are expected to expand by 20.8% to reach $0.58 per share. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and boasts an Earnings ESP of 0.75%. This means that investors might see Abbott top Q1 earnings estimates when the company reports its financial results before the opening bell on Wednesday, April 18.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

554,PNC,"In the midst of rollercoaster trading that has seen massive one-day swings in major stock indexes become commonplace, investors will now be forced to gear up for another busy stretch of earnings announcements—with the Q1 report season officially getting underway when several financial behemoths release their latest results on Friday.Major bank stocks have slightly outpaced the S&P 500 over the past year, but interest rate uncertainty has created headwinds for the space recently. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond have moved sideways over the last two months, marking a change to the uptrend in treasury yields that had been in place since September.With that said, the Fed appears poised to continue tightening its policies, with market uncertainty almost entirely related to whether the central bank will announce four rates hikes, or more, this year. News on this front will continue to influence bank stocks as investors in the space clamor for the earnings growth catalyst that is a higher interest rate.In the meantime, investors will be fixated on the latest quarterly earnings reports from the finance sector’s major bellwethers. So what should we expect from the upcoming report season? Let’s take a closer look.The 30,000-Foot ViewBased on the latest available estimates, we expect the Finance sector—of which the Major Banks industry is the biggest earnings contributor—to report Q1 earnings growth of 19.1% on 4.5% revenue growth. This would follow 0.6% earnings growth and 4% revenue growth in Q4.The previous earnings cycle was complicated by massive one-time charges related to tax law changes, which probably explains some of the large uptick in the growth rate. But we also know that 1Q17 saw the Finance sector report earnings growth of 10.5%, so year-over-year comparisons are not exactly soft—making a 19%+ growth rate that much more impressive.The Major Banks group is actually projected to be the slowest-growing industry within the Finance sector, although its estimate 11.1% EPS growth is certainly nothing to scoff at. Still, investors will hope that this group can get off to a great start with better-than-expected results from its top players, many of whom are reporting this Friday.First Batch of Bellwether ReportsOne key question that will be answered come Friday morning is whether a sharp uptick in market volatility has proved helpful to the markets and trading segments of the big banks. To answer this, investors will look to the reports of JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report).Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect JPMorgan and Citigroup to report earnings growth of 38.2% and 19.1%, respectively. Our consensus estimates are also calling for these companies to post respective net sales growth of 11.6% and 4.5%.Meanwhile, our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file projects that JPMorgan will report total revenue of $7.1 billion in its Markets & Investor Services segment. This would represent growth of 8.9% from the year-ago period, which would mark an improvement from the double-digit declines this unit has witnessed recently. We do not have comparable estimates for Citigroup, but investors should expect markets activity to be a key catalyst there as well.Several major banks with little to no exposure to capital markets operation, including Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) will also report on Friday. Our Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for these firms to report earnings growth of 7.0% and 23.5%, respectively.Bottom LineFriday’s reports come at an interesting moment for the finance sector and the market as a whole. Both the sector and the broader market are facing headwinds and catalysts, with interest rate uncertainty and trade war woes outweighing the positives recently. Nevertheless, investors could be quick to forget about these challenges if earnings results are powerful.Want more market analysis from this author?

555,PNC,"Buoyed by top-line strength, Synovus Financial Corporation (SNV  -  Free Report) recorded a positive earnings surprise of 5.9% in fourth-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. Also, the reported figure came in 33.3% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Higher revenues, backed by strong loan balances, drove organic growth. Notably, lower efficiency ratio was a tailwind. Moreover, a positive impact of rising rates was witnessed. However, escalating expenses and provisions remain a concern for investors.  Including the loss on early extinguishment of debt and charges, relating to Federal tax reform, net income available to common shareholders came in at $27 million or 23 cents per share, compared with $66 million or 54 cents per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.For full-year 2017, adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.53 per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.50. Also, earnings compared favorably with the prior-year figure of $1.98. For full-year 2017, net income of $265.2 million was reported, up 12.1% year over year.Top-Line Strength Reflected, Expenses Flare UpFor full-year 2017, the company reported revenues of $1.37 billion, up 16.7% on a year-over-year basis. Results also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 billion.Total revenues for the quarter came in at $339.1 million, rising 10.3% from the prior-year quarter. The reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $338.7 million.Net interest income increased 15.5% from the year-ago quarter to $269.7 million. Further, net interest margin expanded 36 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.65%.Non-interest income decreased on a year-over-year basis to $69.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in other fee income and bank card fees. However, it got offset by an increase in fiduciary and asset management fees, and brokerage revenues. Adjusted non-interest income was $69.3 million, up 0.9% year over year.On the other hand, total non-interest expenses were $226.5 million, while adjusted non-interest expenses came in at $201.1 million, up 17.2% and 7.6% respectively, from the prior-year quarter. Notably, increase in advertising, third???party processing, and salaries and other personnel expenses led to the rise, partially offset by lower foreclosed real estate expenses and amortization of intangibles.Adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 59.29%, as compared with 61.81% in the year-earlier quarter. A decline in ratio indicates improvement in profitability.Total deposits came in at $26.1 billion, almost stable from the prior quarter figure. Total net loans climbed 1.2% sequentially to $24.8 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagCredit quality metrics for Synovus was a mixed bag in the quarter.Net charge-offs climbed 7.9% year over year to $9 million. The annualized net charge-off ratio was 0.15%, up 1 bps from the year-earlier quarter. Provision for loan losses jumped 36.8% from the year-ago quarter to $8.6 million.Non-performing loans were down 24.7% year over year to $115.6 million. The non-performing loan ratio came in at 0.47%, contracting 17 bps from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, total non-performing assets amounted to $130.6 million, underlining a decline of 25.7%, whereas, the non-performing asset ratio contracted 21 bps to 0.53%., year over year.Capital Position ImprovesTier 1 capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 10.38% and 12.23% respectively, compared with 10.07% and 12.01% as of Dec 31, 2016.Also, as of Dec 31, 2017, Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio (fully phased-in) was 9.88% compared with 9.51% in the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 Leverage ratio was 9.19% compared with 8.99% in the comparable period last year.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring 2017, Synovus returned over $175.1 million to shareholders, through common share repurchases, resulting in the repurchase of 4 million shares. Notably, during the fourth quarter, the company completed the $39.2 million common stock buy-back program.Additionally, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $150 million of the company’s common stock, to be executed during 2018.The board also announced a 67% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from 15 cents to 25 cents per share. The new dividend will be paid in Apr 2018.Our TakeSynovus’ results have been quite decent in the quarter. We believe that the company’s focus on both organic and inorganic growth, together with cost containment efforts, will pay off and aid bottom-line expansion in subsequent years. Though escalating expenses and provisions raise concerns, a lower efficiency ratio indicates optimism.Synovus Financial Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Synovus Financial Corp.

The upsurge was mainly due to growth in capital markets fees and other income.Adjusted non-interest expense inched up 1% year over year to $633 million.

Non-interest expense is anticipated to decrease in the range of 2-4%.NIM for 2018 is estimated to remain flat as compared with the prior year on a GAAP basis as expansion in NIM is anticipated to offset the reduced benefit of purchase accounting. Further, efficiency ratio is projected at 55-57%.Management predicts average loans and leases to increase in the range of 4-6% on an annual basis, while average deposits are expected to increase around 3-5%.Overall, asset quality metrics are likely to remain stable with moderate quarterly volatility, given the current low level of problem assets and credit costs.Management anticipates NCOs to remain below the long-term normalized range of 35-55 basis points.The effective tax rate for 2018 is estimated in the range of 16-17%.Our ViewpointHuntington reported an encouraging quarter.

The figure came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 82 cents.Easing margin pressure on rising rates was witnessed in the quarter.

Higher funding costs and elevated cash balances partially mitigated the rise in margins.U.S. Bancorp’s non-interest income increased slightly on a year-over-year basis to $2.4 billion.

559,PNC,"During the Q4 earnings season, the Finance sector performed well. Despite inflation-related issues and heightening chances of political uncertainty, easing margin pressure, consumer loan growth, tax benefits from the tax reform and controlled expenses helped most banking stocks to perform well. Therefore, we can add some of these stocks to our portfolio based on the robust fundamentals and solid long-term growth opportunities.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

The company's fee income has grown at a five-year CAGR (2013-2017) of 1.3%, with marginal fall recorded in 2016. The positive trend continued mainly on rising asset-management revenues and other income. Additionally, in 2017, the company reported a rise in net interest margin (NIM) and net interest income (NII), after witnessing a volatile trend for years since 2009.The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 5.15% (as against the industry average of about 4.61%) indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Earnings Strength: Earnings are anticipated to display an upswing in the near term, as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 22.18% compared to the S&P 500 average rate of 16.2%. Also, PNC Financial recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 4.13%, over the trailing four quarters.Prudent Expense Management: Though escalation in non-interest expenses was experienced in 2017 on rising personnel and equipment costs, expenses declined at a CAGR of 2.5% over the last five years (2012-2016). Furthermore, the company successfully realized its continuous improvement savings program (CIP) goals for the last three years (ended 2017) of about $1.25 billion. For 2018, management has a CIP target of $250 million.Stock is Undervalued: PNC Financial has P/E and P/B ratios of 14.61 and 1.51 compared to the S&P 500 average of 17.26 and 3.15, respectively. Based on these ratios, the stock seems undervalued.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report).

560,PNC,"We are almost in the middle of the earnings season, with results from more than 250 S&P 500 members already out. Major Banks on the index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector's total earnings) reported 2.4% year-over-year earnings growth. This compares unfavorably with 6.5% growth registered in the prior quarter.Major banks’ results in fourth-quarter 2017 were aided by an improving economy, higher interest rates and a slight rise in lending activities. Apart from these, strength in investment banking, a strong balance sheet and solid asset quality offered support. But these were not enough to boost their financial performance.Factors that weighed on major banks’ third-quarter financial performance persisted in the fourth quarter as well. These include trading weakness and slowdown in mortgage banking. Also, increased investments in technology to enhance digital offerings led to elevated expense levels.On top of these, earnings were adversely affected by huge one-time charges related to changes in the tax law, though the act will result in gains for banks over the long term.Wondering why should one invest in major banks despite dismal fourth-quarter performance? Well, there are several factors that will likely lead to improved performance for these banks going forward.Factors to Drive EarningsFirstly, if the Federal Reserve sticks to its plan of increasing rates three times in 2018, it will further help banks in expanding net interest margin. This along with rise in loan demand will eventually drive revenue growth.In case the inflation rate improves (the latest data indicates some improvement), there are chances of aggressive rate hikes by the Fed next year. So, banks are anticipated to benefit more.Secondly, while all sectors are likely to benefit from the lower tax rates, major bank are expected to gain the most because they are amongst the highest tax payers in the United States.Also, driven by the tax legislation provisions related to repatriation of overseas cash, banks will be in a win-win situation. This is because, as overseas cash is brought back, it will likely provide an impetus to M&As activities, thereby giving a boost to investment banking. Also, as the act will lower tax rates for wealthy individuals, asset management units of these banks are projected to witness a rise in fund inflow.Finally, growing investor optimism about reduced regulations is likely to boost bank stocks. Once there is a reduction in the number of banks tagged as systemically important financial institutions, the compliance costs for the major banks will decline.Upbeat ExpectationsMajor banks’ earnings are expected to accelerate in 2018 with 22.7% growth compared with 7.1% rise for the Finance sector. Also, we note that the industry is currently positioned at the top 6% out of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.Also, major banks seem undervalued compared with the broader finance sector. The industry’s current price-earnings (F1) and price/book ratios of 12.6 and 1.8, respectively, are lower than the finance sector figures.Therefore, we believe investors will benefit by betting on major bank stocks, as the industry is likely to perform better in the near term.Picking the Potential WinnersNot all major banking stocks appear to be wise investment options at the moment. Investors need to pick those stocks that have witnessed robust growth and still have plenty of upside left.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected major banks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

562,PNC,"Driven by top-line strength, Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.51 compared favorably with $1.11 recorded in the year-ago quarter. Results include tax benefits and other one-time items. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.30.Higher revenues and credit provisions were positives. In addition, the quarter witnessed a rise in assets under custody, as well as assets under management. Moreover, credit metrics marked a significant improvement. However, escalating operating expenses remained a major drag.Net income came in at $356.6 million compared with $266.5 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.For full-year 2017, net income was $1.2 billion or $4.92 per share compared with $1.03 billion or $4.32 per share in the previous year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $4.69.Margins & Revenues Improve, Costs EscalateFor full-year 2017, revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis, were $5.42 billion, up 9% from $4.99 billion in 2016. Additionally, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.38 billion.Total revenues of $1.44 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 billion. Results also improved 16% year over year.On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, net interest income of $396 million was up 20% year over year. This was driven by elevated levels of average earning assets and higher net interest margin.Net interest margin (NIM) was 1.39%, up 19 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The increase chiefly reflected higher short-term interest rates and reduced premium amortization. The positives were partially mitigated by an unfavorable balance-sheet mix shift.Non-interest income advanced 14% from the year-ago quarter to $1.04 billion. Rise in trust, investment and other servicing fees, along with foreign exchange trading income, other operating income, security commissions and trading income, were the primary reasons for this upswing. These were partially offset by lower treasury management fees and investment security losses.Non-interest expenses flared up 15% year over year to $1 billion in the quarter. The rise was mainly driven by an elevation in mostly all components of expenses.Improvement in Assets Under Management and CustodyAs of Dec 31, 2017, Northern Trust’s total assets under custody increased 20% year over year to $8.08 trillion, while total assets under management rose 23% to $1.16 trillion.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal allowance for credit losses came in at $153.8 million, down 20% year over year.

Also, credit provision was $13 million in the quarter compared with $22 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Further, non-performing assets decreased 6.1% year over year to $155.3 million as of Dec 31, 2017.  Strong Capital PositionUnder the Advanced Approach, as of Dec 31, 2017, Tier 1 capital ratio, total capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio came in at 14.8%, 16.7% and 7.8% compared with 13.7%, 15.1% and 8%, respectively, in the prior-year quarter. All ratios exceeded the regulatory requirements.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring 2017, Northern Trust repurchased 5.8 million shares for $523.1 million at an average price of $90.25 per share. Notably, during the reported quarter, the company repurchased 1.81 million shares for $170.6 million at an average price of $94.11 per share. This includes shares related to share-based compensation.Our ViewpointResults of Northern Trust display a decent performance in the reported quarter. We remain optimistic by the continued growth in assets under custody, revenues and an improving credit quality, to some extent. Furthermore, positive impact of rising rates was visible. Though escalating expenses might pose a threat to the company’s profitability, benefits of tax reform are anticipated to act as a tailwind. Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteCurrently, Northern Trust carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

565,PNC,"The performance of investment banking, one of the primary source of revenues for Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), is expected to be moderate in second-quarter 2018. This could provide some support to the bank’s results, scheduled on Monday, Jul 16.Investment banking income basically comprises underwriting revenues and advisory fees. So, let’s check how these are likely to perform in the to-be-reported quarter.Growth in total underwriting fees, consisting of debt and equity underwriting, is expected to be modest. Rising interest rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuances. As debt origination fees account for roughly 40% of total investment banking fees for BofA, this will likely have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues.However, equity issuances globally are expected to get a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Thus, equity underwriting fees are anticipated to remain stable or improve marginally. This, in turn, is expected to provide some support to overall underwriting fees for BofA.Talking about advisory fees, global M&A activity in terms of deals closed represent a strong second quarter. Thus, this will likely result in an increase in advisory fees. Also, as BofA is one of the leading players in this space, it will likely witness an improvement in advisory revenues.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $5 billion reflects a 1.3% rise on a sequential basis.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Overall Earnings & Revenue ProjectionsNotably for BofA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 57 cents reflects a 23.9% increase on a year-over-year basis. However, the consensus estimate for sales of $22.5 billion indicates a 1.5% fall from the prior-year quarter.Click here to know more about the factors that could influence BofA’s overall results.Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteOur TakeAmid an improving operating backdrop, modest growth in investment banking revenues is expected to lend support to BofA’s top line to some extent.

566,PNC,"The Federal Reserve announced the first rate hike of 2018 at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting Wednesday, under Chairman Jerome Powell’s debut meeting. The Fed was tempted by the strengthening economy, optimism on reaching the inflation target this year and impressive labor market gains.The benchmark federal funds rate has been hiked to 1.50-1.75% from the 1.25-1.50% raised in December 2017. Notably, this is the sixth increase in interest rates since the financial crisis, which led the Fed to lower rates to nearly zero.“The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months,” the policy-setting FOMC stated on Wednesday in Washington. Officials repeated the previous language that they anticipate “further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy.”Policymakers increased their expectations for economic growth and continued with their projections of total three hikes in 2018. Furthermore, they increased their projection to three hikes in 2019 from the two forecasted in the December meeting.The central bank projects economic growth at the rate of 2.7% in 2018, up from the previous expectation of 2.5%, attributed to the encouraging U.S. consumer confidence. Further, growth rate is anticipated to be 2.4% in 2019 — moderately higher than the December forecast of 2.1%.“The job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears to be moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer running goal,” Powell stated in a press conference.Additionally, based on the updated economic projections, Fed expects inflation to be at 1.9% this year, near about its target of 2%. The unemployment rate in 2018 is predicted to fall to 3.8%, down from the prior forecast of 3.9%. Also, it is estimated to decline to 3.6% in 2019, again down from the previous projection of 3.9%.“Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low,” the FOMC said. The statement noted that household spending and business investment “have moderated” from impressive fourth-quarter readings.With decent economic growth, balanced near-term risks to economic outlook and recent strong gains in the labor market, rate hike is an added advantage for banks. Moreover, temporary concerns over inflation are expected to be subdued.Following the interest rate-hike announcement, most Wall Street biggies, including Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), increased their prime lending rate to 4.75%, effective Mar 22, 2018.Notably, PNC Financial and BofA, Zacks #3 (Hold)-ranked players, highlight their optimism on the banks’ bright future prospects, with shares rising 10.1% and 8%, respectively, year to date.

567,PNC,"The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 13, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in net interest income as well as non-interest income, partially offset by higher expenses.Moreover, PNC Financial has an impressive earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.6%.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the to-be-reported quarter were not adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.58 has been revised marginally downward over the past 30 days. Nonetheless, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 22.9%.Notably, the company’s price performance in the past three months has not been impressive. Its shares have lost 5.3% compared with 0.4% decline of the industry.Now, before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s discuss the factors that are likely to impact PNC Financial’s second-quarter results.Factors to Impact Q2 ResultsNet Interest Income to Improve: The second quarter has witnessed a modest improvement in commercial as well as consumer lending. Also, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $331.4 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects growth of 2.3% year over year. Thus, given the improvement in the lending scenario PNC Financial’s net interest income (NII) is expected to improve while flattening of yield curve will likely somewhat hurt.Management expects NII to grow in the low-single digit, on a sequential basis.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII for the second quarter is $2.4 billion, which reflects an improvement of 6.2% year over year.Non-Interest Income to Rise: Although the performance of the equity markets was not very impressive during the second quarter, the company’s asset management revenues are expected to witness a rise, supported by higher earnings from its equity investment in BlackRock. Consensus estimates for asset management revenues are $459 million, which reflects growth of 15.3% year over year.Moreover, given the continued momentum in customer activity, in terms of using credit and debit cards, PNC Financial’s consumer services revenues are likely to improve. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consumer services revenues of $372 million reflects growth of 3.3% year over year.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for corporate services revenues is $471 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8.5%. Also, estimates for service charges on deposits are $174 million, reflecting 2.4% rise on a year-over-year basis.Additionally, despite a slowdown in refinancing activities during the quarter under review, due to the continued rise in rates, mortgage originations were decent. Thus, residential mortgage revenues are also expected to witness a modest improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $106 million, reflecting growth of 1.9% year over year.With the improvement in all components of fee income, total non-interest income is expected to rise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-interest income is $1.8 billion, indicating 1.4% rise on a year-over-year basis.Thus, given the rise in both NII as well as fee income, total revenues are likely to improve. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the second quarter is $4.3 billion reflecting an improvement of 4.7% year over year.Controlled Expenses: While management expects non-interest expenses to be up by low-single digits on a sequential basis, the company’s continued efforts toward its cost-saving program is likely to keep overall expenses under control.Now, let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of PNC Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is -0.23%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Jul 17. It has an Earnings ESP of +1.60% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Blackstone Group L.P.

Moreover, expenses dropped on efficiency savings by the bank.However, Citigroup’s costs of credit for the fourth quarter were up 16% year over year to $2.1 billion. This rise largely reflects net credit losses of $1.9 billion and a net loan loss reserve build of $165 million.For full-year 2017, adjusted net income came in at $15.8 billion compared with $14.9 billion recorded in 2016.Top-Line Strength & Low Expenses RecordedFor full-year 2017, the company reported revenues of $71.4 billion, up 2% year over year. Furthermore, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $71.2 billion.Revenues inched up 1% year over year to $17.3 billion in the reported quarter. The rise highlights elevated revenues in the global consumer banking, mostly offset by decline in institutional clients group and corporate/other revenues. The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.1 billion.At Institutional Clients Group (ICG), revenues came in at $8.1 billion in the quarter, down 1% year over year. Though securities services revenues increased 14%, lower equity markets (down 23%) and fixed income revenues (down 18%) offset the rise on a year-over-year basis. Notably, revenues from total banking climbed 11%.Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues increased 6% year over year to $8.4 billion, mainly driven by higher revenues in North America, Latin America and Asia GCB.Corporate/Other revenues were $746 million, decreasing 13% from the prior-year quarter. The decline mainly underlined legacy assets runoff.Operating expenses at Citigroup were down slightly year over year to $10.1 billion. Efficiency savings and the winding-down of legacy assets mitigated increased volume-related expenses and ongoing investments.Strong Balance SheetAt quarter end, Citigroup’s end of period assets was $1.84 trillion, up 3% year over year. The company’s loans grew 7% year over year to $667 billion. Deposits increased 3% year over year to $960 billion.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-accrual assets decreased 17% year over year to $4.8 billion.

The company’s supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.7%, down from 7.2% in the year-earlier quarter.As of Dec 31, 2017, book value per share was $70.85, down 5% year over year and tangible book value per share was $60.40, down 6% from the prior-year period. Results include mainly the estimated impact of the Tax Reform.Capital DeploymentDuring fourth-quarter 2017, Citigroup repurchased about 74 million of common stock. Notably, the company returned around $6.3 billion to common shareholders as common stock repurchases and dividends.Our ViewpointCitigroup reported impressive results this time around also, though the bank was impacted by non-recurring non-cash charges related to the tax reform. Furthermore, restructuring efforts, including streamlining moves, will likely continue to ease the bank’s burden on the expense base. The company exhibits capital strength which continues to support its dividend and a share buyback program. Also, rise in revenues is commendable.One can consider a strong brand like Citigroup to be a sound investment option over the long term, given its global footprint and attractive core business. Additionally, the company’s growth looks encouraging amid the rising rate environment, as well as anticipated potential ease of regulations under President Trump’s administration.Nevertheless, several legal hassles and escalating costs of credit remain concerns for the company. Citigroup Inc.

It returned a total of $724 million to its shareholders in the year.Impressive Outlook for Full-Year 2018Comerica provided guidance for full-year 2018 assuming continuation of the current economic environment and low rates, along with $270 million of benefits from the GEAR Up initiative.The company anticipates net interest income to benefit from loan growth and increase in interest rates. Full-year benefit from the rate hikes in 2017 is expected to be $110-$125 million (assuming a 20-40% deposit beta for the December rate increase). Notably, elevated interest recoveries of $28 million in 2017 are not expected in 2018.Non-interest income is expected to increase 4%, benefitting from GEAR Up opportunities, which will drive modest growth in treasury management, card fees, brokerage fees and fiduciary income. This expectation excludes deferred compensation of $8 million in 2017.Non-interest expenses are predicted to be up 1%, affected by restructuring expenses of about $47-$57 million and an additional $50 million benefit from the GEAR Up initiatives. Also, expenses related to revenue growth such as outside processing expenses are likely to increase. Pressure will also be created from higher technology expenses and inflationary conditions.Provision for credit losses is expected to reflect continued solid performance in its overall portfolio. Notably, net charge-offs are expected to remain low while provisions are expected to be in the range of 20-25 bps.Income tax expenses are anticipated to be approximately 23% of pre-tax income on the assumption of no tax impact from employee stock transactions.Comerica expects average loans to increase in line with the gross domestic product, reflecting rise in most lines of business while remaining stable in Energy and Corporate Banking.Our ViewpointComerica reported another strong quarter. The company remains well poised to benefit from its ongoing strategic initiatives. Additionally, its strong capital position continues to lend support. Further, the top line continues to benefit from easing pressure on margins.

574,PNC,"As soon as the tax reform got into effect, a flurry of wage hikes and bonus payments started showing up. The tax bill cuts “the corporate rate from 35% to 21%, gives pass-through businesses like the Trump Organization a 20% tax deduction, raises the standard deduction, expands the child tax credit, and temporarily lowers individual rates across the board (read: Tax Bill: What ETF Investors Need to Know).”The Trump administration is also proposing a move from the current worldwide tax system to a territorial system, allowing companies to send their offshore profits back to the United States without extra taxes. This will result in extra cash, which may prove beneficial for shareholder-value maximization.Per a Tax Policy Center analysis, the bill will lower taxes for Americans in all income groups in 2018, but increase after-tax income by an average of 2.2%. However, the tax cut for individuals will gradually decrease over time and close completely in 2025.For individuals, the final version keeps the seven tax brackets intact but lowers the rates for most others. The new tax rates are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% compared with the current structure of 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35% and 39.6%. The framework offers tax relief to middle-class families by doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for a married couple filing jointly (read: ETFs to Bet on the Final Tax Bill: What Hot, What's Not).Impact on Consumers Since corporates will be benefiting from steep cuts, an increasing number of companies are paying one-time cash bonuses. Many employers are boosting wages. And a certain group of companies say that they will raise matching contributions to workers' 401(k) plans.Walmart announced recently that it plans to hike the starting pay for hourly workers to $11 and pay up to $1,000 in a one-time cash bonus to suitable associates based on seniority. As per an article published on usatoday.com, many reputed U.S. companies including AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report), American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report), PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) have announced bonuses.The source went on to explain that BB&T also increased the minimum hourly pay rate from $12 to $15, effective Jan 1, 2018. Fifth Third Bank hiked the minimum wage to $15 per hour for all employees while PNC Financial will raise the minimum pay rate to $15 an hour by the end of 2018.Added to this, companies like Visa (V  -  Free Report) and Aflac Inc (AFL  -  Free Report) have announced that they are taking steps to help employees save for retirement. These companies are “boosting matching contributions to employees' 401(k) retirement plans.”Consumer ETFs in FocusThe dual effect of wage hike and tax cuts should translate into higher disposable income for consumers. As a result, consumer ETFs should be investors’ top focus. iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF (IYC  -  Free Report), First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund (FXD  -  Free Report), and PowerShares S&P SmallCap Consumer Discretionary Portfolio (PSCD  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks ETF Rank #2, should thus be great picks (read: E-Commerce Face-Off: Wal-Mart Vs.

575,PNC,"The long-awaited (unofficial) start to Q2 earnings season is finally upon us with this morning’s influx of major Wall Street banks reporting results, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). These arrive as roughly 5% of the S&P 500 have already reported quarterly results, mostly those with fiscal quarters ending in May, not June.Before we splash into that pool, however, we also see a new read on Import Prices for June: the Import Price Index slipped 0.4% last month, following a 0.9% jump in May and well off the +0.6% analysts were expecting. This is the largest monthly drop since February of this year. These month-by-month figures do have a bent toward more volatility that smooths out year over year, however. To wit, we still see Import Prices up 4.3% from June 2017.U.S. Exports rose 0.3% in June, halving the 0.6% gains from the previous month. We are not prepared, at this hour, to make any speculation regarding Import/Export numbers in the months ahead, especially with the day-to-day static of trade tariff turmoil potentially making analysts weary of future results in these metrics. What we do know is that, despite somewhat of a disappointment in the June numbers, U.S. import and export business has proven strong over the past year.Speaking of strong, JPMorgan once again outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines for its Q2 earnings report this morning: earnings of $2.29 per share topped estimates of $2.22, while revenues reaching $28.39 billion surpassed both the $27.66 billion in the Zacks consensus and the year-ago figure of $26.7 billion.Investment banking, fixed income and equity market revenues all posted notable gains year over year — the latter which posted an impressive 24% gain. For more on JPM’s earnings, click here.Citigroup also outpaced Zacks consensus estimates for both earnings and revenues in its Q2 report — $1.62 versus $1.54 per share on the bottom line, and $18.5 billion versus $18.4 billion on the top.

Earnings per share of $2.72 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58. Moreover, the bottom line reflected a 30% increase from the prior-year quarter.Shares of PNC Financial climbed more than 1% in pre-market trading reflecting investors’ optimism on continued easing of pressure on net interest margin that led to higher net interest income during the quarter.

The rise was primarily due to higher personnel and marketing-related costs.As of Jun 30, 2018, total loans rose nearly 1% sequentially to $222.8 billion. Also, total deposits improved slightly to $264.9 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesProvision for credit losses was $80 million, down 18.4% from $98 million in the prior-year quarter.

578,PNC,"Investors in The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2018 $65.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for PNC Financial Services shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, PNC Financial Services is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Banks - Major Regional industry that ranks in the Top 11% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.15 per share to $2.31 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about PNC Financial Services right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

The bottom line recorded 7.7% improvement from the year-ago quarter.Results reflected a rise in revenues driven by higher rates and loan growth. However, an increase in operating expenses and higher credit costs were the undermining factors.Results excluded merger-related and restructuring charges and adjustments related to the tax reform. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $614 million or 77 cents per share compared with $592 million or 74 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.For 2017, adjusted earnings of $3.14 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.77.

Rise in all fee income components except insurance income and mortgage banking fees, drove the increase.Non-interest expenses of $1.86 billion increased 11.2% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a rise in personnel expenses, net merger-related and restructuring charges and professional service costs.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 57.2%, down from 58.3% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates rise in profitability.As of Dec 31, 2017, total deposits were nearly $157.4 billion, up marginally from the prior quarter. Also, total loans and leases of $144.8 billion were up slightly on a sequential basis.Credit Quality ImprovedAs of Dec 31, 2017, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $627 million, down 22.9% year over year.

These efforts will also support bottom-line growth in the near term. Also, expected growth in loans, along with an improving rate scenario, is likely to propel its organic growth trajectory in the quarters ahead. However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability to some extent.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteCurrently, BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.68, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.90.

However, the figure handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.6 billion.Quarterly revenues, as per business segments, are as follows:The Institutional Client Services division recorded revenues of $2.4 billion, down 34% year over year. The fall indicates lower net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution revenues (down 50% year over year), adversely affected by lower revenues from interest rate products, commodities, mortgage products, currencies and credit products.Fall in equities client execution, partially offset by rise in securities service revenues, resulted in the downside in Equities revenues (down 14%).The Investment Banking division generated revenues of $2.1 billion, up 44% year over year. Results highlight higher underwriting revenues (up 76%), aided by elevated debt and equity underwriting revenues. In addition, higher financial advisory revenues (up 9%) were recorded.The Investment Management division recorded revenues of $1.7 billion, up 4% year over year. The growth was mainly driven by higher management and other fees, along with transaction fees, partially offset by lower incentive fees.The Investing and Lending division’s revenues of $1.7 billion in the quarter were 12% higher on a year-over-year basis. The upside stemmed from the surge in revenues from investments in equities.Total operating expenses flared up 1% year over year to $4.7 billion. Expenses moved up mainly due to rise in non-compensation expenses (up 10%), partly offset by decline in compensation and employee-benefit expenses (down 12%).Expenses included rise in almost all components, partially offset by lower other costs.Strong Capital PositionGoldman displayed a robust capital position in the reported quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.9% under the Basel III Advanced Approach, highlighting the valid transitional provisions. The figure was down from 13.1% recorded in the prior-year quarter. Notably, the ratio was impacted by 70 basis points (bps) due to the tax legislation.The company’s supplementary leverage ratio, on a fully phased-in basis, was 5.8% at the end of the reported quarter, down from 6.4% recorded in the previous quarter. Notably, the ratio was impacted by 30 bps due to the tax legislation.Adjusted return on average common shareholders’ equity, on an annualized basis, was 10.8% as of Dec 31, 2017.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring 2017, Goldman repurchased 29 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $231.87 and a total cost of $6.72 billion. Notably, during fourth-quarter 2017, the company repurchased 6.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $241.13 and a total cost of $1.59 billion.ConclusionResults of Goldman highlight an impressive quarter. Though trading activities and tax expense related to the recent tax reform weighed on the results, robust investment banking results and underwriting business were positive factors.The company’s well-diversified business, apart from its solid investment banking operations, continues to ensure earnings stability. Its focus to capitalize on new growth opportunities through several strategic investments, including the digital consumer lending platform, will likely bolster overall business growth. However, costs stemming from brokerage and market development remain near- to medium-term headwinds. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

583,PNC,"The expected fall in JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) trading revenues will likely have an adverse impact on fourth-quarter 2017 earnings given the significant dependence of its top line on this source. Nevertheless, this may not lead the company to report bleak results on Jan 12. Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly investment banking — are expected to offset the trading slump.Also, though market volatility has not improved much in the last quarter, the decrease in trading revenues will primarily be attributable to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed significantly higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results.In 2017, several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and lack of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have incited volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates along with absence of specific catalysts have been a drag.At an investor conference in early December 2017, Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer at JPMorgan, stated that the company’s trading business till then in the fourth quarter was down roughly 15% year over year. Lake further said “there haven’t been that many catalysts” and volatility remains ""low across the spectrum.""Similar to the last couple of quarters, lower fixed income trading is expected to be primarily responsible for lower trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $2.86 billion reflects a decline of 15.3% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the consensus estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.57 billion indicates a marginal rise from the last-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence JPMorgan’s Q4 results:Continuation of investment banking strength: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees might have continued in the to-be-reported quarter primarily on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances.As the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees for JPMorgan, this will lead to strong gains.Also, despite being seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for JPMorgan.The company projects investment banking income to be up in high-single-digits range for the fourth quarter.Steady rise in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in improvement in interest income.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment. Seasonality is also expected to hurt mortgage banking revenues. Moreover, JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession. Mortgage banking revenues are expected to be down 7.3% year over year to $1.57 billion.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will not likely be a major support. Also, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might impact JPMorgan’s earnings unusually.Impact of new tax code: In early December 2017 (before the passage of the tax act), JPMorgan executive had noted that the U.S. corporate tax overhaul will hurt earnings in the fourth quarter. The company had expected one-time charge related to cash repatriation to be more than $2 billion.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:JPMorgan does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is -0.05%.Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

585,PNC,"The second-quarter 2018 earnings season is already knocking at the doors with big names — JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) — all reporting financial numbers tomorrow, before the opening bell.After an impressive first-quarter performance driven by significant volatility, major banks lost momentum on the flattening of the yield curve. Therefore, net interest margin (the backbone for banks’ top-line growth) is expected to have remained subdued in the second quarter.Further, volatility-driven growth in trading revenues, which supported the top line during the January-March quarter, is likely to be muted in the second quarter. Though uncertainty mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions induced volatility, client activity returned to normalized levels. Therefore, not much support is expected from this source of revenues, primarily for big banks.In addition to benefits from rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending will likely energize interest income for banks. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are predicted to improve slightly in the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might have offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), and consumer loans, to some extent.Mortgage business is anticipated to have continued to witness a slowdown in the April-June quarter. With interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this source.Further, investment banking performance is anticipated to have been flat. Strong equity issuances globally might have been boosted by IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are projected to have escalated. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As in certain sectors will likely have helped banks garner advisory fees. These are, however, expected to have been more than offset by lower debt origination fees, as rising rates will have limited corporates’ involvement in these activities.Additionally, credit quality is likely to have remained strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.On the cost front, while the absence of considerable legal expenses since the last few quarters is encouraging, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might have escalated costs moderately.In addition, passage of the new law to lessen banks’ regulatory burden and lower tax rates will have supported bottom-line growth.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in second-quarter 2018 are projected to rise 8.5% year over year.Let’s take a look at the four major banks scheduled to announce results tomorrow.JPMorgan will report the second-quarter earnings before the opening bell. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of +0.06%, the chances of a likely earnings beat in the quarter to be reported are bright. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Client activity returned to normalized levels in the to-be-reported quarter. So, this will likely have led to relatively stable trading revenues in the quarter. Nonetheless, similar to the prior quarters, equity trading revenues are expected to have supported total trading revenues in the second quarter. A modest improvement in lending — mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — will likely have led to an increase in net interest income (NII). A rise in interest rates will provide some support to the stock, despite flattening of the yield curve (Read more: Trading & Loan Growth to Drive JPMorgan's Q2 Earnings).Notably, JPMorgan surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and EPS Surprise JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and EPS Surprise | JPMorgan Chase & Co. QuoteOn Friday, yet another big bank, Wells Fargo, is also slated to announce results. Wells Fargo is likely to have benefited from easing margin and high interest income, though marginally, in Q2. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might have offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent. Nonetheless, mounting expenses resulting from legal costs and low mortgage business are expected to dent this banking giant’s results. (Read more: Will Legal Hassles Impact Wells Fargo's Q2 Earnings?).Wells Fargo posted an average beat of 0.71% over the preceding four quarters, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of them, as demonstrated in the chart below:Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteFor another big bank, Citigroup, we cannot conclusively predict earnings beat in the quarter, as higher credit costs are expected to have hurt its financials. Moreover, volatility-driven trading revenues are expected to have remained flat year over year in the second quarter. Nonetheless, the company is anticipated to witness improvement in consumer banking revenues, while pressure on margins is likely to somewhat ease. Notably, the equities business is expected to have remained strong in the quarter to be reported, whereas the fixed income business might have experienced a disappointing performance. (Read more: Will Flattish Trading Dampen Citigroup's Q2 Earnings?).Further, this Zacks #3 Ranked stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citigroup Inc. QuoteLikewise, we cannot conclusively predict earnings beat for PNC Financial in the second quarter, with an Earnings ESP of -0.23% and a Zacks Rank #3. Given the improvement in the lending scenario, net interest income (NII) is expected to improve, while flattening of yield curve will likely somewhat hurt. Moreover, given the continued momentum in customer activity, in terms of using credit and debit cards, consumer services revenues are expected to have improved. Additionally, despite a slowdown in refinancing activities during the quarter under review, due to the persistent rise in rates, mortgage originations were decent. Thus, residential mortgage revenues are also expected to have witnessed a modest improvement.However, though management expects non-interest expenses to be up in low-single digits on a sequential basis, the company’s continued efforts toward its cost-saving program are likely to keep overall expenses under control.

586,PNC,"Shares of the country’s biggest banks—including JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report)—surged on Monday morning after the Senate finally passed its tax bill over the weekend.The reform package, which—among other things—slashes the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, inspired the bulk of last week’s trading, including a noticeable rally in the aforementioned bank stocks. Now, these financial behemoths are moving even higher as investors become increasingly optimistic that some form of the bill will eventually become law.Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo were all up more than 2% in morning trading Monday. Shares of JPMorgan also gained more than 2%, touching a new all-time high of $108.40 in the process. Elsewhere, investment behemoth Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) was up over 1.5%, while smaller national banks like PNC (PNC  -  Free Report), Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report), and Fifth Third (FITB  -  Free Report) were also in the green.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are components, moved more than 1.2% higher in early morning hours. The SPDR KBW Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) gained over 2.5%, and the Financial SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) surged about 2%.On top of the tax reform bill, investors seem excited about direction of the Federal Reserve. Last week, confirmation testimony from Fed chair nominee Jerome Powell all but confirmed another interest rate hike at the central bank’s next policy meeting.Trump’s pick to succeed Janet Yellen also hinted that he believes deregulation might be necessary in today’s banking industry (also read: 5 Bank Stocks to Buy on Jerome H. Powell Testimony).Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was in the red on Monday, supporting the thesis that investors may finally be cashing out of the red-hot sector. Tech has dominated Wall Street throughout 2017, but as geopolitical tensions continue to rise, large funds may be shifting to the seemingly less-volatile financial world.Looking ahead, the banking rally will depend on the Fed’s monetary policy, so in addition to the rate cut, investors will want to pay attention to what the nation’s top economists say about 2018. If the tax bill passes, these bank giants could see an improvement to their bottom lines next year, but other factors could always have an influence.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

588,PNC,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) has agreed to pay about $613 million in penalty to the U.S. regulators for deliberate violations of the Bank Secrecy Act by its subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association.Willful ViolationsThe bank has been slapped with charges of failing to put together proper anti-money laundering (AML) control programs along with intentionally not reporting suspicious activities to the authorities.For a period of nearly six years (ended 2014), U.S. Bancorp was found of using weak AML measures. The bank lowered the number of suspicious activities that could be identified by its monitoring systems due to limited number of employees present to track them.Also, the bank had hidden this fact from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Despite knowledge of these improper practices and repeated warnings from the reviewers of staff levels to be “stretched dangerously thin”, U.S. Bancorp chose to conceal facts from the minutes of internal meetings.Further, the regulators also noted the bank’s failure to properly track Western Union transactions made by non-customers at its branches. Suspicious transactions were allowed to go uninvestigated despite employees raising concerns.Second allegation on the bank was keeping the wrongdoings of Scott Tucker, a former professional race car driver, from the authorities until it received a subpoena from the U.S. attorney in Manhattan in 2013.The bank allowed Tucker to use accounts under tribal names to conduct fraudulent payday lending scheme. Since 2008, these sham companies had lent millions of loans to the customers and generated profits that he spent to fulfil his lavish needs.In 2011, investigators reported about these misdoings to which the bank responded by closing Tucker’s accounts in the names of the tribal companies but refrained from filing a suspicious report. Moreover, they allowed him to operate through non-tribal accounts letting millions from illegal payday business schemes to flow in.Penalties ImposedU.S. Bancorp has signed a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York and has agreed to pay a fine of $453 million.The bank is also liable to pay $75 million to the OCC, $70 million to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Federal Reserve will be paid $15 million.Apart from penalty, the bank will continue to undertake proper modifications of its AML program, only after which charges will be dismissed by the government.Our TakeThough this settlement might impact U.S. Bancorp’s financials to an extent, it still remains well poised for growth on the back of its solid business model and diverse revenue streams.Also, such incidents help instill investors’ confidence in regulating bodies and keep banks from engaging in illegal activities.Shares of U.S. Bancorp have gained 6.5% over the past six months, underperforming 20.5% rally for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

589,PNC,"Following the release of the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results last week, the Federal Reserve approved the capital plans of 34 financial institutions out of the 35 participating (including the U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets) in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).However, the capital plan of the U.S. holding company of Germany-based Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) has been rejected by the Fed on qualitative reasons. Notably, the bank’s plan failed to receive consent on flaws in assumptions for forecast of revenues and losses.Moreover, the capital plans of Goldman GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) received conditional consent with their total dividend payouts and stock buybacks to be maintained at the current levels. Additionally, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) plan has been given a green signal with the clause of improving its hypothetical lending risks analysis with other big banks.The Fed’s nod for most of the major U.S. banks reflects stability in the banking system to a great extent.""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" said Fed’s vice chairman Randal Quarles.Root of the Capital RulesCurrently authorized under the Dodd-Frank financial-services law, these stress tests were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. During the economic downturn, big financial institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed, while several others were on the verge of a meltdown. Such a turbulent situation compelled the U.S. government to infuse billions of dollars into credit markets and save the entire financial system from crumbling. Stress tests have been annually conducted since 2009.These major banks, now, have the privilege to raise dividends and buy back shares. This year’s stress test was the toughest, with severe adverse scenario featuring a severe global recession and the U.S. unemployment rate increasing to 10%, along with a steepening Treasury yield curve. Further, changes in tax rates had an adverse impact on banks’ financials as the tax law eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that inclined to increase net income at the time of financial crisis.Under this hypothetical scenario, these banks will incur a loss of $578 million. Notably, the projected losses included $113 billion from credit card loans for the banks, at an equal level with trading and counterparty positions. Also, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio (in aggregate) would fall to 7.9% from an actual 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the figure is well above the 4.5% minimum mark set by regulators.This apart, the Fed requires the big banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 3% of their assets and certain other positions.Banks that AcedWells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Since the first round of stress tests, there has been substantial increase in capitals of U.S. firms. The common equity capital ratio has also more than doubled from the 5.2% in first-quarter 2009 to 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017 of the 35 bank-holding companies which participated in the 2018 CCAR. Such positive results reflect rise in common equity capital from about $800 billion to more than $1.2 trillion during the same period.Recovery on the WayGiven the tax cuts and easing of stringent regulations, banks’ optimism has yielded results. With the capital plan approvals, banks keen to reward shareholders by enhancing the size of their capital-deployment plans (raising dividends and repurchasing shares) have announced respective dividend hikes and share repurchase plans.Nevertheless, the Fed’s approval to increase dividend payment and accelerate the share buyback program will definitely help banks attract more investments, moving ahead.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

590,PNC,"Over the last five trading days, bank stocks have put up a lackluster show. Mortgage rates declined in the week, hitting 4.57%, along with bond yields, on escalating U.S.-China trade war fears.Further, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield shrunk during this week, as demand for safe-haven assets increased.On the other hand, on Thursday, the Federal Reserve released the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results, which, to a great extent, reflect stability in the banking system. In fact, this reaffirms that the U.S. banking giants are adequately capitalized to survive under a tremendously difficult economic scenario.All bank holding companies (BHCs), including certain U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, have passed the first round of test.Nevertheless, coming to company-specific news, litigations and probes pertaining to the past shoddy activities dominated headlines. The law enforcement agencies are also on track to resolve such issues, avoiding lengthy litigations. Moreover, restructuring activities of banks continued with the target of improving operational efficiency.  (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending Jun 15, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. Resolution to past misconducts related to interest rate rigging continues for banks. Recently, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) charged JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) with $65-million penalty for trying to manipulate ISDAfix rates — the benchmark rate for fixed interest rate swap rates — between 2007 and 2012. Per the CFTC, employees at JPMorgan made false reports and attempted to manipulate the reference rate by “bidding, offering, and executing transactions in targeted interest rate products” during the five-year period. (Read more: JPMorgan to Pay $65 Million as Swap Rate Manipulation Charge)Among others, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) has agreed to resolve a lawsuit that accused it of rigging London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

591,PNC,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has entered into an agreement with Popular (BPOP  -  Free Report) to divest certain assets and liabilities of its auto finance business in Puerto Rico. The all cash deal is expected to close by mid-2018.Wells Fargo’s auto lending segment landed in trouble last year when its customers were financially hurt due to issues related to auto Collateral Protection Insurance policies. Per its fourth-quarter earnings release, auto loan originations fell nearly 33% on a year-over-year basis.Terms of the DealThe deal has been valued at $1.7 billion which reflects a 4.5% discount on the value of assets that are to be sold.Reliable Financial Services and Reliable Finance Holding Company, subsidiaries of Wells Fargo, will sell about $1.5 billion in retail auto loans and $340 million in commercial loans to the banking subsidiary of Popular, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico.Past DivesturesRecently, Wells Fargo divested its Shareowner Services business to Equiniti Group plc for $227 million. Equiniti Group is the leading provider of share registration and associated investor services in the United Kingdom.Further, in November 2017, the bank completed the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA to USI Insurance Services. The motive behind this divesture was to bring banking activities back into focus.Our ViewpointWells Fargo has been trimming its operations ever since its downward journey started after the fake account scandal in September 2016. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve put a cap of $2 trillion on its assets. This is likely to further push the bank into concentrating on core operations.Though litigation costs will continue to be burden in the near term, the bank’s cost-cutting initiatives might lend some support to its financials. Also, its strong capital position and much attentive management might keep it from falling into trouble again.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 13% over the past six months, underperforming 15.4% rally for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A couple of stocks worth considering in the same space are The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report),both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PNC Financial has increased 3.1% for the current year, in the last 30 days.

592,PNC,"Stock market correction seems to be in the offing as over the last five trading days extreme volatility was witnessed. The banking stocks are not untouched by this.It all started last Friday when January job and wage data was released. Needless to say, wages grew at the fastest pace last month in more than eight-and-a-half years. Though this indicates an improving economy, it raised fears of rise in inflation, in turn, reinforcing assumptions of a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.Additionally, a two-year budget deal announced by top senators will likely further strengthen the economy, thus giving the Fed all the more reason to raise rates. This also drove up the bond yields.While indications of an improving economy and expectations for a more hawkish Fed stance are beneficial for banks on the whole, overall markets seem to be wary of such a scenario.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) dominated the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Its business mishandlings continue to hurt.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jan 29, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

594,PNC,"Ahead of today’s opening bell, Q4 earnings season finally gets rolling this Friday. Though we have seen companies like Delta and Fed Ex report for the quarter in the past days and weeks, this morning we see a flock of banks and investment firms all reporting Q4 numbers, signaling the next three weeks of heavy earnings data to be reported ahead.First up, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 7 cents per share, coming in at $1.76. (This, by the way, excludes a 69 cent-per-share impact — $2.4 billion — as a result of the pending tax reform laws.) Revenues in the quarter reached $25.5 billion, versus the $25.0 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company returned a total of $67 billion to shareholders in 2017, by way of share buybacks and dividend yields. These numbers illustrate a healthy quarter — augmented a bit by a big drop in Fixed Income Markets (-27%) — with a very positive outlook. For more on JPM’s earnings, click here.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report) posted strong Q4 results, putting up $6.24 per share versus the $6.08 consensus estimate, on $3.47 billion in revenues that outpaced the $3.35 billion expected. From a top-line standpoint, this represents gains of 20% year over year. Fiscal year earnings hit $22.60 per share, +17% year over year. For more on BLK’s earnings, click here.However, we see a mixed report for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) this morning. The Zacks Rank #3 bank topped earnings estimates, posting $1.16 versus $1.07 anticipated, but missed on revenues — $22,050 million compared with the $22,381 million in the Zacks consensus estimate. The company is also still trying to win back trust from customers following its fake accounts scandal.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) also surpassed estimates for its Q4 sales and earnings — $2.29 per share beat the $2.20 we had been looking for, where revenues of $4.26 billion outperformed the expected $4.17 billion. This amounts to top-line gains of 10% year over year. For more on PNC’s earnings, click here.Consumer Price Index & Retail SalesFinally today, another couple key metrics from a domestic economic standpoint: both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Sales reads hit the tape ahead of today’s open. The CPI read follows the Producer Price Index (PPI) for December, which came in lower than expected.For the CPI headline we see +0.1%, lower than the +0.3% we were looking for but at least still in positive territory. Ex-food & energy, this number does hit 0.3%. Year over year we see CPI growth of 2.1%, down a tick from November’s read. These numbers appear lukewarm, but are at least a little hotter than the PPI figures we saw earlier.Retail Sales came in-line with expectations at +0.4%, following a by-most-accounts strong holiday shopping season. Ex-auto sales — as well as ex-autos & gas — this figure stays at 0.4%. Not only that, but the prior retail headline, from before the holidays, was revised considerably upward, from 0.8% last read to 1.4% this morning. We may see these numbers manifest in quarterly earnings for retailers, but we’re about a month away from seeing those reports come in.

597,PNC,"Over the last five trading days, the most important development was the Fed’s decision to raise the outlook for number of rate hikes to four this year, apart from increasing the interest rates for the second time in 2018. Also, the central bank provided improved economic growth forecast for the year.As banks are the biggest beneficiary of higher interest rates and their overall growth is tied to that of the nation, these developments will likely further support their profitability.However, banks’ price performance was bearish over the last five trading sessions. So, what could be the reasons behind this dismal investor stance?Well, one of the reasons seems to be lackluster performance of the broader market over the same time frame. Impending trade war fear and geo-political tensions were the primary reasons for this dismal performance. So, banking stocks did not remain untouched.Further, the finding by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) wasn’t alone in opening unauthorized accounts and that there are several other major banks with similar business misconducts made investors skeptical. While no names were disclosed, the concern that banks may face additional probes and lawsuits hurt investor sentiments.Additionally, in line with other major banks, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) also provided soft trading outlook for the second quarter.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending Jun 1, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

598,PNC,"As expected, the Fed has raised interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2%. This also marks the seventh rate hike since December 2015. The central bank signaled a hawkish outlook tweaking its language for economic growth to “rising at a solid rate"" from “moderate” provided in May (read: June Rate Hike in the Cards: ETFs to Win & Lose).It also dropped its word ""stayed low"" for unemployment and “moderated” for household spending. The Fed now believes that the unemployment rate has ""declined” and household spending ""has picked up."" All these indicate two more lift-offs that would translate into four total increases in 2018.  The Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, stated that the economy had strengthened significantly since the 2008 financial crisis and is approaching a “normal” level that could allow the Fed to soon step back and play less of a hands-on role in encouraging economic activity. This reflects optimism about the health of the economy and a faster-than-expected rates hike that would shoot up the borrowing cost for cars, home mortgages and credit cards over the next year (read: Time to Buy Consumer Discretionary ETFs: 5 Top Picks).The Fed also raised its forecast for GDP growth to 2.8% for this year compared with the previous expectation of 2.7% and lowered the expectation for unemployment rate to 3.6% from 3.8%. Additionally, inflation forecast rose to 2.1% for this year through 2021.Coming to unwinding of the balance sheet, the Fed will increase the monthly cap of its $4.4 trillion balance sheet shrinkage by $10 billion per month beginning in July, bringing the total monthly reduction of its balance sheet to $40 billion from $30 billion as of June. This move will continue to push long-term rates higher.A Boon for BanksA rising rate environment is highly beneficial for cyclical sectors like financial, technology industrials and consumer discretionary but banks are in the most advantageous position. This is because they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. With the steep rise in long-term interest rates, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits (see: all the Financial ETFs here).While focusing on a particular stock in this space is certainly an option, investing in a basket of stocks via ETFs could lead to risk-adjusted returns. Given this, we have highlighted five bank ETFs that would gain from a hawkish Fed and have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report)This fund, having AUM of $5.3 billion and average trading volume of around 6.2 million, offers exposure to the regional banks. It follows the S&P Regional Banks Select Industry Index, charging investors 35 basis points a year in fees. Holding 120 securities in its basket, the fund is widely spread out with each security holding less than 2.3% of assets. The fund has risen 9.7% so far this year and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1.iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (IAT  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to 53 small and mid-cap regional bank stocks by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Regional Banks Index. It is largely concentrated on the top two firms, US Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial Services (PNC  -  Free Report), with a combined 25% of assets. Other firms hold no more than 7.01% share. The fund has amassed $930.8 million in its asset base while sees a good volume of 182,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees and has gained 5.8% so far this year. IAT has a Zacks ETF Rank #1.Invesco KBW Regional Banking ETF (KBWR  -  Free Report)This fund follows the KBW Regional Banking Index, holding 50 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for less than 4% share.

600,PNC,"On Dec 1, we issued an updated research report on The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report). The company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.58%.Further, shares of this Pennsylvania-based banking giant have recorded a year-to-date return of 20.6% compared with 15.6% growth recorded by the industry.We believe this growth story has been aided by the company’s cost-containment efforts to drive operational efficiency. Also, it continues to benefit from steady loan and deposit growth, along with higher fee income, and continues to enhance shareholder value with dividend and buybacks.We believe PNC Financial is well positioned to drive operational efficiency through its cost effective measures. Management successfully realized its 2015 and 2016 continuous improvement savings program ('CIP') goals of $500 million and $400 million, respectively. For 2017, management anticipates CIP target of $350 million. The company's continued focus on core expense management will help generate positive operating leverage in the quarters ahead.With one of the most attractive business mixes in the banking industry, PNC Financial continues to make steady progress toward improving its top line. With the gradual change in the rate environment, margin pressure for the bank has eased. Further, the company’s fee income depicted upward movement, with growth of 5.6% year over year in the first nine months of 2017.Additionally, backed by a strong capital position, the company remains committed to enhance shareholder value. Following the Federal Reserve's approval of its 2017 capital plan, the company announced a 36% hike in its quarterly dividend in July 2017. The capital plan also includes a new share repurchase authorization to buy back shares worth nearly $2.7 billion. However, unfavorable debt/equity ratio compared with the broader industry and the volatile performance in the past few quarters might not aid capital-deployment activities to be sustainable.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved up slightly to $8.44 per share for 2017, while the same remained unchanged at $9.32 for 2018. Hence, PNC Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key Picks from the SectorFederated Investors, Inc. (FII  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the past 30 days.

602,PNC,"Over the last five trading days, the performance of banking stocks has been bearish. Expected delays in corporate tax reform and a flattening of the yield curve drove investor pessimism over bank stocks.Earlier this week, Democrats won elections in Virginia and New Jersey, which indicates increased prospects for their representatives in next year's midterm elections. This development increases investor apprehension, as this might challenge Republicans' plans of lessening regulations for banks. Expected weakness in economic numbers also added to the woes.Mortgage rates declined this week, hitting 3.9%, awaiting tax-reform results. Notably, concerns rose after the message sent by Republicans last week, “We think homeowners and home buyers have gotten much too sweet a deal from the federal tax code for far too long — and now we’re going to whack them down.”Nevertheless, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations and increased digital offerings persisted over the last five trading days.  (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Oct 27, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

603,PNC,"The matter of Janet Yellen’s succession has been troubling experts and individual investors alike over the past few weeks. With President Trump nearly certain to nominate Fed governor Jerome Powell as the central bank’s next Chairman, it is important to consider what his approach toward heading this crucial institution would be like.Such considerations gain greater importance when you reckon that he is an outsider of sorts, yet largely likely to follow in Yellen’s footsteps on policy matters.Powell Likely to Continue on Yellen’s PathAn establishment insider for an extended period and a lawyer by training, Powell would be the first Fed Chair since the legendary Paul Volcker not to possess a doctorate in economics. However, he tends to focus on the details, having the reputation of walking into meetings with a mass of material.The former under-secretary has also had the opportunity to oversee all of the Fed’s 12 regional banks. Such vast administrative experience will stand him in good stead when he takes over the most coveted job in the world of economics.Powell is largely expected to stick to the policy path which Yellen has taken. Though he has not taken on a very public role during his tenure at the Fed, he has largely backed Yellen’s strategy of gradually raising rates. This is the approach that he is likely to maintain as the Fed Chair.Predictable but Good for Business?And yet, market watchers and industry experts at large believe that he will be good for the United States’ business environment. His predilection for deregulation has been known for some time now with Powell often emerging as the only voice opposing excessive regulation. Powell has stressed on several occasions that excessive regulations, however well intentioned, may end up preventing the economy from achieving its full potential.So the former private equity executive will likely emerge as a voice of moderation given Trump’s continuous assaults on allegedly burdensome regulations holding back much needed credit flow. What is likely to ultimately emerge is a Fed Chair who sticks to Yellen’s path on monetary stimulus yet loosens banking regulations.In fact one criticism of Powell is that he has more experience on regulation than on monetary policy. But this could actually work to his advantage in the Trump era where regulations are viewed as an unnecessary encumbrance to progress. In the past Powell has said that he is in favor of making changes to regulations. Such an approach is likely to favor financial stocks, in particular, banks.Bank Stocks to WatchWith Trump already having taken several steps to loosen regulations, the appointment of Powell could be another shot in the arm for the financial industry. The banking sector has turned in strong performance this year, as is visible from the gains made by several key sectoral indexes.

605,PNC," Financials stocks are the best performers among all S&P sectors over the past month, thanks mainly to the improving economy and rising hopes of a rate hike by the Fed in December.

606,PNC,"Amid an expected trading slump, rising rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects a 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million.Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and higher interest rates supported net interest income. Further, rise in advisory fees supported top-line growth. A slight fall in operating expenses acted as a tailwind.As expected, fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Likewise, underwriting fees (both equity and fixed income) witnessed a fall. Also, a decline in mortgage banking income, due to higher funding costs and fall in mortgage origination volume, was a headwind.Apart from these, results were adversely impacted by an increase in provision for credit losses, mainly due to reserve build in Card portfolio.The overall performance of JPMorgan’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments, except Corporate & Investment Bank, reported a rise in net income on a year-over-year basis.Among other positives, both credit card sales volume and merchant processing volume grew 13%. Further, both Commercial Banking average loan balances and Asset Management average loan balances rose 10%.Trading Slump Offset by Higher Rates & Loan Growth, Costs DownManaged net revenues of $26.2 billion in the quarter were up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.7 billion. Rising rates and loan growth were the primary reasons for the top-line improvement. These were partially offset by lower trading revenues, investment banking fees and mortgage banking fees.Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $14.3 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter. The fall was primarily driven by lower marketing costs and stable compensation expenses, partially offset by technology, communications and equipment costs.Credit Quality WorsensProvision for credit losses increased 14% year over year to $1.5 billion, primarily due to reserve build in Consumer loan portfolio. Also, net charge-offs were up 13% year over year to $1.3 billion.However, as of Sep 30, 2017, non-performing assets were $6.2 billion, down 21% from the year-ago period.Strong Capital PositionTier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 14.3% as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 13.6% as of Sep 30, 2016. Tier 1 common equity capital ratio (estimated) was 12.6% as of Sep 30, 2017, up from 12.0% as of Sep 30, 2016. Total capital ratio came in at 16.1% (estimated) as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 15.1% as of Sep 30, 2016.Book value per share was $66.95 as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with $63.79 as of Sep 30, 2016. Tangible book value per common share came in at $54.03 as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with $51.23 as of Sep 30, 2016.Bottom LineContinued improvement in loans and higher interest rates are projected to support JPMorgan’s revenues, going forward. With the Fed expected to continue raising rates, the company’s interest income will likely increase.However, slowdown in trading owing to low volatility and muted investment banking performance are likely to continue in the near term.J P Morgan Chase & Co Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  J P Morgan Chase & Co Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | J P Morgan Chase & Co QuoteCurrently, JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

607,PNC,"The Q4 earnings season is knocking at the door and investors are keen to see how major banks will perform this time, after reporting impressive results in the first three quarters of 2017.The last year has been a roller coaster ride for banks. Though the year begun on an optimistic note with high expectations from President Trump’s electoral promises, it lost some steam in the middle only to regain the bullish trend at the end.Banks showed resilience driven by the Fed’s hawkish stance (three rate hikes in 2017) and the gradually improving U.S. economy. Also, progress on the lesser banking regulation front cheered investors.Further, the new tax act drove the banks too. While the act will result in gains for banks over the long term, the to-be-reported quarter earnings will be adversely affected by huge one-time charges related to the changes in the tax law.Additionally, factors that weighed on major banks’ prior-quarter results persisted in Q4 as well. These, including trading weakness, slowdown in mortgage banking and stable net interest margins, will likely hamper profitability of major banks. On top of these, the above-mentioned charges add fuel to the fire.Also, while the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings is expected to escalate costs moderately.As such, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector'stotal earnings) are expected to witness a 6.3% year-over-year decline in earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This compares unfavorably with 6.5% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Analysis article).Nevertheless, strength in investment banking driven by a potential rise in equity issuances (strong rally in the equity market globally) and persistent increase in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) is expected to provide respite to some extent.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a slight improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer will offer marginal support interest income for banks.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Choosing the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are not likely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. So, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.5 Major Banks Set for Earnings SurprisesHere are five major regional bank stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming announcements:The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 12.

608,PNC,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is already knocking at the doors with big names — JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report) — all reporting financial numbers tomorrow, before the opening bell.In 2017, several political and geopolitical developments, interest-rate hikes, tax act movements and absence of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have driven volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates, along with absence of positive catalysts, have been on the downside.Notably, the U.S. corporate tax overhaul is expected to hurt earnings in the fourth quarter on one-time charge related to cash repatriation and write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs).Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are expected to be in line on a sequential basis during the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth might be offset by rising consumer loans. Therefore, interest income for banks is likely to improve marginally.Credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards. Though a continued momentum in investment banking business is anticipated to support bottom-line numbers, banks might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the quarter.Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the banks’ top lines. As the interest-rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. Therefore, debt origination fees will lead to solid gains.Also, despite being a seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 turned triumphant. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for banks.On the cost front, banks might record marginally higher expense level due to digitization. Further, the recent tax reform is likely to result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in fourth-quarter 2017 are projected to rise 2.8% year over year.Nonetheless, there might be a surprise in store for major banking stocks this earnings season. Let’s take a look at the three major banks scheduled to announce results tomorrow.JPMorgan will report the fourth-quarter earnings before the opening bell. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of 0.00%, we are unable to conclusively predict an earnings beat in the quarter to be reported. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Steady rise in net interest income and slowdown in mortgage banking due to seasonality is expected. Investment banking income is projected to be up in the high-single-digits range for the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, weak trading activities and the company’s expectation of one-time charge related to cash repatriation to be more than $2 billion due to the U.S. corporate tax overhaul is likely to be major drag. (Read more: Can JPMorgan's Q4 Earnings Brave Trading Slump?).Notably, JPMorgan surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:J P Morgan Chase & Co Price and EPS Surprise J P Morgan Chase & Co Price and EPS Surprise | J P Morgan Chase & Co QuoteOn Friday, yet another big bank, Wells Fargo, is also slated to announce results. With a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +0.76%, the chances of a likely earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter are bright. Wells Fargo is likely to benefit from easing margin and high interest income, though marginally. Particularly, weakness in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth might be offset by rising consumer loans. Nonetheless, mounting expenses, continual auto loan portfolio runoff and low mortgage business due to seasonality are expected to dent the banking giant’s results. Furthermore, though the company has not provided any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the quarter. (Read more: Can Wells Fargo Q4 Earnings Hide Mortgage Weakness?).Wells Fargo posted an average beat of 2.75% for the preceding four quarters, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of them, as demonstrated in the chart below: Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteLikewise PNC Financial is also likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter, with an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Expected higher net-interest income and consumer loan growth are anticipated to support earnings. Management projects its net interest income for the quarter under review to increase in low-single digits on a sequential basis. Moreover, an increase in fee income is estimated on investment banking and underwriting business strength. However, one-time restructuring expenses due to the tax reform might be on the downside. (Read more: Why Earnings Beat is Likely for PNC Financial in Q4).PNC Financial posted an average beat of 4.58% for the last four quarters, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of them. PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

609,PNC,"The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 12, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for PNC Financial. The quarter witnessed a rise in consumer confidence, which led to growth in consumer loan portfolio. Also, the rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank. Though, flatter yield curves offset the benefits to some extent, pressure on PNC Financial’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017.Moreover, President Trump’s success in executing the tax overhaul boosted the stock market during the quarter, which would greatly support PNC Financial’s fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $4.17 billion indicates a 7.6% year-over-year improvement for the to-be-reported quarter.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s third-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and higher fee income. These factors also helped it in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses and provision for loan losses.Notably, PNC Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 4.6%.The earnings beat translated into improved price performance. Over the past year, shares of PNC Financial have gained 21.8%, outperforming the 18.8% growth recorded by the industry.PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to PNC Financial’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of PNC Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is +0.55%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Though, earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 have been revised slightly downward over the past 30 days, they reflect year-over-year growth of 11.7% and 15.5%, respectively.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: In addition to higher interest rates, moderate improvement in lending, mostly in the consumer front, is likely to perk up interest income. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest income is projected to be $2.39 billion, up 12.1% year over year.Management expects its net interest income for the to-be-reported quarter to increase in low-single digits on a sequential basis.Controlled Expenses: The company had a cost-saving program in place during the year to keep expenses under control. However, these efforts are likely to be partially offset by one-time restructuring expenses due to the tax reform.Muted Non-Interest Income: The fourth quarter was exceptionally good for the investment banking and underwriting business, which might support the company’s fee income.On the other hand, with overall low volumes of M&A during the quarter, the related fees are expected to be lower. Per the consensus estimate, total non-interest income is expected to be $1.75 billion, slightly up year over year.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and a Zacks Rank of 2. It is slated to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18.

610,PNC,"The projected decline in Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) mortgage business will likely impact its fourth-quarter earnings given significant dependence of its top line on this source. However, this might not lead the company to report dismal results on Jan 12. Benefits of higher rates and loan growth are anticipated to be positive factors.Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues are expected to be low resulting from seasonality that might be eased due to immaterial negative MSR valuation adjustments. Notably, expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment.Here are the other factors influencing Q4 results:Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are expected to be in line on a sequential basis during the fourth quarter. Particularly, weakness in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth will likely be offset by rising consumer loans. However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue into the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Also, the bank is cutting back its auto lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income. Notably, management projects NII to grow in low- to mid-single digits for 2017.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo may record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Wells Fargo anticipates the efficiency ratio to be around 61% in 2017, excluding the $1-billion discrete litigation accrual recorded in third-quarter 2017 and any other non-recurring expenses. Further, the company is targeting around $4 billion of cost savings by 2019. Of the total cost savings target, 21% is expected to be achieved in 2017.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Also, though the company has not providing any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.76%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged over the last seven days and is expected to grow 0.97% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $22.4 billion, up 3.9% year over year. Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 23.

611,PNC,"The long wait for relief of regulatory burden may finally be over. While the Trump administration continues to push for the reversal the Dodd Frank Act, a bipartisan agreement announced on Monday came as a breather. This is expected to pave the way for significant changes and bring major relief to banks.Highlights of the AgreementThe major relief from the plan, unveiled by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, is likely to come in the form of reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill aims to raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 40. Thus, the banks including SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief.The move is expected to not only lower regulatory compliance costs but also lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Per the plan put forward under the bipartisan deal, banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief once the bill is enacted while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later.Further, the bill gives authority to the Federal Reserve to fast-track the exemption. Notably, the Fed will be required to conduct stress test for banks in the $100-$250 billion range periodically.For several regional banks with more than $250 million in assets, the bill is not so important. Some of these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) banks like The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp, though functioning as community banks, will stay subjected to stricter regulations. This will put them in a disadvantageous position to some extent in terms of lower costs.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other BenefitsThe bill also has something to offer to the smaller community banks and credit unions with total assets of less than $10 billion. These will be exempted from implementing Volcker Rule (prevents proprietary trading) and from following stringent capital and liquidity rules as long as leverage ratio is in the range of 8-10%. Also, it aims to ease mortgage rules for small banks.Moreover, the bill is expected to be beneficial to trust and custodial banks like State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report). There is a provision that prevents deposits held at the Fed by such banks to be included in calculating the supplementary leverage ratio. This will aid these companies in clearing the annual stress tests.Reactions & Road AheadBankers and the overall banking industry cheered the deal. The KBW Regional Banking Index closed the day 1.3% higher.Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association in a statement said, “While this legislation could go much further, ABA still views this bipartisan bill as an important first step in right-sizing the rules for America’s banks.”Further, Crapo said, “The bipartisan proposals on which we have agreed will significantly improve our financial regulatory framework and foster economic growth by right-sizing regulation, particularly for smaller financial institutions and community banks.”Nonetheless, the road ahead is expected to be bumpy. The deal is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations.Still, it is the most important step taken by the Senate to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth. Also, it is critical in securing the support that was lacking from the earlier efforts to lessen undue regulatory burden.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

612,PNC,"Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) announced that it expects to achieve a pretax gain of about $150 million from the divesture of Hilton Honors credit card portfolio to American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report). The deal is expected to be completed by first-quarter 2018.Citigroup’s partnership with Hilton Honors was scheduled to be terminated by the end of this year.

With this license, the bank would be able to provide investment banking services including debt and equity capital markets operations in the region.Citigroup’s efforts to streamline international businesses will support revenue growth and drive operational efficiency. However, pending legal hassles are likely to weigh on its financials.Shares of Citigroup have gained 23.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally of 12.3%.Currently, Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

613,PNC,"Big banks are gearing up for the third-quarter earnings season this week. Investors are hopeful that bank profits will rise on the White House’s intention to slash corporate taxes and ease banking regulations. Higher wage growth, in the meantime, is expected to counter setbacks stemming from soft loan growth. Yet, multiple banks believe that trading revenues are trending lower in the current quarter.Nevertheless, let us focus on banks that are likely to make the most of the third-quarter earnings season. Such banks are poised to report upbeat earnings results, which will eventually lead to an uptick in share price.America’s Leading Banks Mint MoneyFive of America’s biggest banks are expected to register $21 billion in profits in Q3. Such banks include JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc (C  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC  -  Free Report).Undoubtedly, JP Morgan is the most valuable U.S. bank, with assets more than $2.1 trillion. Jamie Dimon’s company is likely to post $6.4 billion in profits in Q3, which will in time make it the most profitable. The shares of the bank have already seen steady gains since June 2016. Such gains came in despite the latest dip in September that hit the 200-day simple moving average.Citigroup’s shares also continue to hit milestones, thanks to a more than 50% surge since Trump’s election. The banking behemoth is now worth more than $200 billion. Bank of America, in the meantime, celebrated a landmark of its own last week, when its share price touched the $26 mark for the first time since September 2008, the month Lehman Brothers had shut down.Wells Fargo also continues to make big money, even if its CEO Tim Sloan faces tough questions regarding the recent auto insurance and mortgage fee controversies. The bank is expected to register $5 billion in profits in the said quarter. And don’t forget, PNC Financial Services, the sixth largest bank in terms of asset size, is positioned to see the strongest earnings growth from last quarter.But, it’s just not the large banks that are expected to make money. The overall banking industry is doing really well. Bank stocks, collectively, are up more than 8% over the past month, roughly double the S&P 500’s performance in that time period (read more: Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable?).And how can we forget that banks have already earned a record $48.3 billion in Q2, which was well above the pre-crisis high of $38 billion in 2006, according to the FDIC.Banks Set to Gain Under Trump’s Tax Plan & DeregulationIt’s no wonder that bank’s profitability will be enhanced by proposed tax cuts and deregulation. The corporate tax rate is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. Banks face high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%.Lowering of domestic tax rate will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This will, ultimately, boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.The Republican, bill better known as the Financial Choice Act, in the meanwhile, would free up banks by giving more power to banking authorities and spurring lending activities.Loan Growth, Trading Activities SoftWe shouldn’t forget that loan growth for commercial banks has declined precipitously since last November, to 2.1% from 8.1%, as per the Federal Reserve data.Higher wage growth, however, is expected to drive demand for retail and small business loan. Wages have increased 0.5% to average of $26.55 an hour in September, per the Labor Department data. In fact, in the last 12 months, hourly pay increased 2.9%, up from 2.7% in the prior month and also in line with a post-recession high.But, the major concern for banks is lack of activity on trading floors. Jamie Dimon expects trading revenue decline of 20% in the three months ending September 30, while Citigroup’s Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach also expects trading revenues to fall 15% from the year-ago period. Bank of America did confirm that it’s seeing a similar trend. The only hope in this case is that investment pros expect markets to be choppier in the later half of this year, which could well spur trading activities.5 Bank Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q3Barring a drop in trading revenues, banks are likely to see solid growth in Q3.

614,PNC,"An appeal has been made by the AFL-CIO to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to look for possible insider trading in a particular transaction. This transaction involved trading of Navient Corporation (NAVI  -  Free Report) shares just before the U.S. Department of Education’s resolve to end all decision-sharing agreements with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) was made public.On Aug 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Education had sent a letter to the CFPB, informing them that the Education Department would no longer provide them with any information that they needed to supervise student loan companies.This announcement was beneficial for all student loan contractors, especially Navient, which has continuously been the CFPB’s target for abusive student lending practices. The CFPB had filed a lawsuit against the company in January for “cheating many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans.”Once the decision-sharing bond between the Education Department and the CFPB is cut, it could put this lawsuit in risk. This in turn would benefit Navient in the future.The Congress made the news public only on Sep 1. However, in the hours between the CFPB being informed about the policy change and the Congress making the news public, nearly 900,000 shares of Navient were purchased.The letter sent by the labor union to the SEC mentions that the trades were carried out in three large blocks. The 900,000 shares that were purchased by some unknown investors at or after the close of the markets on Aug 31 represented nearly 24% of the day’s total trading volume. Per the AFL-CIO, each share was purchased at $13.20. Once the trading was complete, just before the public disclosure of the news, shares of the company had risen more than 4%.The AFL-CIO said in the letter, “News that the U.S. Department of Education had terminated its [memorandum of understanding] with the CFPB should have been considered material, non-public information until the House Committee on Education and the Workforce issued its press release on Sept. 1.”However, the SEC has declined to make any comments regarding the appeal made by the AFL-CIO, while Patricia Christel, a spokeswoman for Navient said that the company did not have any prior information about the policy shift before it was made public.Shares of the company have lost 11.6% over the past year compared with 20% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the finance space are The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD  -  Free Report), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

615,PNC,"The expected fall in Bank of America Corp.’s (BAC  -  Free Report) trading income will adversely impact its third-quarter earnings, slated on Friday, Oct 13. However, the bank is anticipated to record year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues.BofA’s performance in the last quarter reflected improved investment banking fees and higher net interest income while trading income witnessed a slump. The same tough operating backdrop continued in the third quarter as well.Earnings estimate revisions depict pessimism too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter was revised 1.1% downward over the last 30 days.Earnings WhispersDecrease in earnings estimates increase chances of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:BofA does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is -0.66%.Zacks Rank: BofA’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects 10.8% improvement on a year-over-year basis. Further, BofA has a decent surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteFactors to Impact Q3 ResultsTrading slump: The third quarter appears to be disappointing for BofA in terms of trading business similar to the prior quarter. In September, the bank’s chief financial officer, Paul Donofrio projected nearly 15% year-over-year decline in trading income. Similar to the last quarter, slump in fixed-income revenues is expected to be the primary reason for this decline.While the fall is largely attributable to higher-than-usual volatility in the year-ago quarter, trading activities remained sluggish in the third quarter. Absence of any tangible development on the proposed reforms by the Trump administration and an unchanged monetary policy of the Fed were the main reasons for reduced volatility for the major part of the quarter.Investment banking to offer some support: Given the higher debt originations during the quarter (mainly on expectation of persistent rise in interest rates), debt underwriting fees are expected to continue rising in the to-be-reported quarter. However, overall low volumes of M&A and equity issuance during the quarter are expected to result in a decline in the related fees. But as BofA is one of the leading players in this space, it might not suffer a significant loss.Mortgage revenues not to be a major support: An expected higher rate environment might have led to a rise in demand for refinancing activities during the quarter, thus helping BofA record some mortgage revenues. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no big support is expected from this segment. So, the contribution of mortgage revenues to total revenues will not be much.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on modest loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during quarter is expected to support NII. Further, management expects NII to increase sequentially, assuming realization of the forward curve and modest growth in loans and deposits. Nonetheless, the sale of non-U.S. consumer credit card operation will have a marginal negative impact.Reduced scope for cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support this quarter. But given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall expenses should remain more or less stable.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few major bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Oct 13. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

617,PNC,"Most banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of top-line strength and lower provisions. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, the results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing significantly. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing. Also, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and personnel, and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor.

622,PNC,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 13, before the opening bell. Its earnings are likely to improve year over year, but revenues might decline.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been much in the news following the sales scam that came into light in September 2016. The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business and online bill pay services.Therefore, the bank has been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.Wells Fargo has undertaken a number of steps to restore its reputation, post scandal. Recently, at a heated senator meeting, Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer — Timothy Sloan — vigorously tried defending America’s third-largest bank for its past wrongdoings amid a volley of questions raised by the senators.Sloan apologized for causing its customers trouble and promised to take appropriate steps to make it a better bank in the times to come. The bank still has a long way to go before it can put all these troubles behind and focus on improving its performance.Amid such adversities, shares of Wells Fargo have gained just around 1% so far, this year, significantly lagging 10.5% growth recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release exert more pressure on the stock? Notably, Wells Fargo delivered an earnings beat in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.99%. However, our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat in the third quarter.Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteA stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.06. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsExpenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo may record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Notably, management projects technology costs to remain at an elevated level in the third quarter, before declining in the fourth quarter. Wells Fargo anticipates the efficiency ratio to be in the range of 60-61%, but the company is targeting around $4 billion of cost savings by year-end 2019.Notably, legal costs related to sales scam scandal might also escalate expenses for the bank.Mortgage Business to Surge:  Wells Fargo — one of the largest mortgage lenders in the nation — might record rise in mortgage banking revenues. Higher mortgage banking is expected on stronger origination volumes. However, the bank projects decline in the auto portfolio to reflect lower origination volumes. Management tightened credit underwriting standards in response to early signs of rising delinquencies in the industry and declining used car values. As a result, the quality of originations has improved and the company expects the size of the auto portfolio to decline persistently in 2017.Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment.Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter. Particularly, growth in commercial and consumer loans, with slowdown in commercial real estate loans is expected. However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue in the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Notably, the bank is cutting back its auto lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.28% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Earnings ESP for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

623,PNC,"The Q3 earnings season is just around the corner and investors are eagerly awaiting the results of banks that have been in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons.While investors’ optimism over the Fed’s plans to unwind its giant balance sheet and keep raising interest rates should drive bank stocks higher in the upcoming months, Q3 results are not expected to be overwhelming.This is because, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance Sector's total earnings) are expected to witness 5.1% year-over-year decline in earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This compares with 10% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article).Reduction in equity issuance, feeble equity trading volumes and subdued volumes of M&A’s are expected to negatively impact fee income growth for banks this time around. However, a persistent rise in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) and stability of fixed income trading flows will likely provide some respite.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer might energize interest income for banks.Credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards. Though a continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support the bottom-line numbers, banks might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the third quarter.On the cost front, while the absence of considerable legal expenses is positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Selecting the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are unlikely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. Therefore, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.5 Major Banks Set for Earnings SurprisesHere are five major regional bank stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming announcements:Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

624,PNC,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 13, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s second-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and decline in provision for loan losses. These factors also helped it in surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses.The earnings beat translated into improved price performance. Over the last three months, shares of PNC Financial have gained 7.5% compared with 3.4% growth recorded by the industry.Notably, PNC Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 5.1%. PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to PNC Financial’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of PNC Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is +0.07%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Nonetheless, the estimates have remained stable over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13 per share for the third quarter reflects growth of 15.3% year over year.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: In addition to higher interest rates, moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer — might perk up interest income.Management expects its net interest income for the to-be-reported quarter to increase in low-single digits while fee income is expected to remain stable.Expenses to Remain Stable: The company anticipates its non-interest expenses to remain stable in the third quarter.Provision for Loan Losses: The company expects the provisions to be in the range of $75-$125 million in the to-be-reported quarter. Provision for loan losses in the year-ago quarter was $87 million.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.68% and a Zacks Rank #3.

626,PNC,"Monday, October 9, 2017In quarters past, we in the world of finance reporting would be sounding the trumpets for the ushering in of a new Earnings Season, which was to commence with aluminum giant Alcoa’s (AA  -  Free Report) report after the closing bell with Monday or Tuesday of a week just like this. But really, this was always just a convenient formality that didn’t have much integral meaning to earnings season as a whole nor the general domestic and global economies they help illustrate. If you want to get an early foothold on the global marketplace, for instance, you’d do better to focus on FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) numbers (which happened to miss consensus estimates by 20% in its fiscal Q1 2018 report a few weeks ago).That said, if you are interested in the lion’s share of data related to quarterly gains from the finance sector, then you have indeed found the right week. By this time Thursday morning, we will have seen Q3 earnings results from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). By the opening bell this Friday, we’ll also see Q3 reports from Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and PNC (PNC  -  Free Report). Major banks represent nearly half the total earnings for the finance sector, which is why we can make informed projections about whether or not we’re looking at a strong quarter or not just by tracking these large U.S. banks.Bank stocks did not impress the market in Q2. Yet in the past month — the direct run-up to Q3 earnings season — banks are up 8%, according to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian. Anticipation of a generous tax reform (tax cut) policy, plus a strong likelihood of a December interest rate hike from the Fed, helped bolster stock prices. But would disappointing earnings and revenue results start a pullback from record highs, not just among companies in the finance sector but across the board? After all, what industries can claim they have no involvement with the biggest Wall Street banks?Consider also that Q3 reports for the banks will not have any actualized data related to tax policy or a higher interest rate, thus they will not appear on the books this quarter. The good news is yearly comps should be beatable, so expectations of a lousy quarter are not warranted at this stage. For a comprehensive report on this week’s coming earnings reports, please read Sheraz’s latest Earnings Preview: Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable?Aside from the big banks, we also look for earnings data Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) on Wednesday morning and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) on Thursday. So while the frequency of new reports will be milder than we will see in the coming next few weeks, we will hear from several heavy hitters representing different sectors. In the meantime, will stock indexes keep their brave chin pointed forward to new record highs? If this week’s reporting companies all beat estimates and raise guidance, how much higher can we expect markets to rise?It should be fun. Futures this Monday morning are all up a half-hour before regular-day trading begins.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

627,PNC,"Recently, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration servicing units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. In order to expand presence in Luxembourg and provide fund administration service in Switzerland, Northern Trust had entered into the deal with UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) in February 2017.This acquisition has positioned Northern Trust as a leading administrator in Switzerland and also placed it among the top 10 asset servicing providers, in terms of assets under administration, in the Luxembourg market.Terms of AgreementThe acquisition has enabled Northern Trust to provide fund administrative services for funds with approximately $413 billion (CHF420 billion) in assets (as of Dec 31, 2016).Post acquisition, around 200 new employees joined Northern Trust. Moreover, the bank has opened a new office in Basel, Switzerland.“We are pleased to announce the completion of our acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration servicing units in Luxembourg and Switzerland,” said Teresa Parker, president, Europe, Middle East and Africa region at Northern Trust. “This acquisition is a cornerstone of our strategic expansion plan for Continental Europe and represents a significant opportunity to broaden our scale, capabilities, products and market reach across Europe, enabling us to further enhance our services to existing and future clients and strengthening our position as a leader in the region,” added Parker.ConclusionThis acquisition will not only help Northern Trust expand its current client base, but also will enable it to diversify product and service offerings across Europe. This acquisition, as an initiative to tackle the macroeconomic headwinds, is anticipated to boost the company’s financial results. The deal also reflects its strong capital and balance sheet position.Over the last couple of years, Northern Trust has been focused on initiating new businesses. As a result, it has been successful in adding institutional clients and assets.Northern Trust’s stock has gained 6.6% over the last six months compared with 8.4% growth registered by the industry.Currently, Northern Trust carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the same space are M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

628,PNC,"Georgia-based Synovus Financial Corp. (SNV  -  Free Report) turned out to be a potential buyer of the financial unit of outdoor goods retailer, Cabela's Incorporated . Recently, the bank completed the purchase of Cabela's banking operation — World's Foremost Bank — which issues store-branded credit cards.Further, the bank subsequently resells the credit-card portfolio to Virginia-based Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report), while holding back about $1.1 billion in deposits.Per the terms, Synovus received $75 million from Cabela’s and Capital One. The bank will likely deploy the proceeds for funding, including balance-sheet restructuring activities, debt repayment and capital distribution.BackgroundBass Pro Shops — retailer of outdoor gear and apparel — was supposed to purchase the retail business of Cabela's in October 2016, while Capital One Financial was supposed to buy the banking unit. However, the deal did not materialize as the bank was undergoing the anti-money-laundering controls’ probe which delayed regulatory approvals.Therefore, Cabela's sold the financial unit to Synovus, which holds $30 billion in assets and has 250 branches across the south.Earlier in September, Synovus received the regulatory approval from the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System for the acquisition.Nonetheless, the deal was also subject to the completion of the merger of Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops, which has received regulatory approvals, as well as the nod from Cabela’s shareholders. Per the deal, Bass Pro acquired Cabela’s for $61.50 per share in cash, representing an aggregate transaction value of approximately $5 billion.ConclusionSynovus’ results have been quite decent in the last quarter. We believe the company’s focus on both organic and inorganic growth, together with cost-containment efforts, will gradually pay off and aid bottom-line expansion in subsequent years.Moreover, the deal will likely provide additional liquidity for organic growth. This, in turn, will help the company achieve long-term targets, which include return on assets of 1% and efficiency ratio to remain lower than 60%.Another finance company worth considering includes The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), which recorded upward earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

629,PNC,"Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) has agreed to pay $2.5 million to the federal government to settle an investigation conducted by the United States into its trading activities, going by Charlotte Business Journal. The investigation, between 2009 and 2010 was led by the FBI’s Charlotte Division and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Region.There were claims that some of BofA’s traders on the swaps desk in New York had used insider information to trade ahead of block futures trades with counterparties.Upon investigating, the bank confessed that at least three of its traders overheard calls between large counterparties and its sales people about block futures trades that were going to be executed.However, without disclosing the same to the company, they used the information to hedge risks that were projected to arise from the respective block trades.Although the settlement between BofA and the United States was reached in 2015, it was announced on Friday, Sep 22, 2017, by Jill Westmoreland Rose, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.Along with this announcement, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also announced its settlement with Merrill Lynch regarding an investigation that it held to see how the latter failed to keep records of its trading activities.Rose said, “The settlement underscores the expectation that everyone, from Wall Street to main street, act honestly and ethically in their financial transactions.” She added, “The financial system depends on the integrity of everyone involved in it. The settlement reinforces our expectation that firms effectively monitor their employees and deal candidly with all regulators and law enforcement agencies.”While investigations are common in the banking universe, mentioned below are a few stocks from the space that are worth a look for some good reasons.M&T Bank Corporation’s (MTB  -  Free Report) shares have gained more than 30% in a year’s time.

630,PNC,"CIT Group Inc.’s (CIT  -  Free Report) efforts toward streamlining operations in order to improve efficiency are impressive. Given a solid capital position, the company is likely to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has moved 2.2% upward over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its earnings growth potential. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of the company have gained 33.1% in a year’s time, outperforming the 21.7% rally for the industry it belongs to. Given the positive estimate revisions and a solid Zacks Rank, the stock should further gain.Over the past few years, the company has been taking several initiatives to restructure and streamline its operations with the aim of improving efficiency and becoming a regional commercial banking institution. As part of these efforts, it has made several divestures. In June, it announced a deal to sell its European Rail business, while in April the company sold stakes in the joint ventures with Tokyo Century Corporation and divested its aircraft leasing business.Also, the company’s efforts toward restructuring its balance sheet through repayment and refinancing of high-cost debt should lower its funding cost and continue to support net finance margin growth.Moreover, given a solid capital position, the company remains well poised to deploy capital meaningfully, thereby continuing to enhance shareholder value.However, continuously rising expenses are likely to hurt profitability. Though the company is taking several cost-saving initiatives, expenses are expected to remain elevated because of its continued investments in franchise.Also, deteriorating credit quality and sluggish growth in the industries, where the company provides finance, continue to be key near-term concerns.A few other top-ranked stocks from the finance space are mentioned below.The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 13.2% for the current fiscal year over the past 60 days.

633,PNC,"When the Federal Reserve had begun quantitative easing (QE) program in November 2008 and lowered the interest rates to near zero, the economy was in a mess with a significantly high unemployment rate, plummeting housing and financial markets, and lower consumer spending. The main goal was to stabilize the economy and spur growth, primarily by revitalizing the banks.With the Fed injecting money into the economy, banks had more money to lend and earn from that. This liquidity infusion also fueled deposit growth. Over the years, major banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) recorded a significant increase in their deposit balances.As the economy was in shambles, lending activity failed to rise significantly. So, the banks were saddled with considerable amount of deposits. But with gradual economic recovery, loan demand improved. Along with this, banks witnessed a rise in deposits. So, they didn’t face much competition for attracting deposits to meet higher demand for loans.As economy has stabilized and there seems to be no need for liquidity support, the Fed is gradually tightening its monetary policy. In December 2015, the central bank raised its interest rates for the first time in a decade. Since then, three more rate hikes have been announced.Given the continued improvement in the economy, interest rate hikes will likely continue. With banks being one of the biggest beneficiaries of higher rates, this will support their revenue growth.Moreover, last month, the Fed announced the timeline for commencing its balance-sheet (currently standing at a whopping $4.5 trillion) normalization program. Banks are likely to benefit from this as well. As the Fed buys back short-term duration securities, the yield curve will become steeper. This, in turn, will result in rise in the yield on long-term bonds and thus banks will gain from improved margin spreads.While everyone is looking at the banks’ benefits from the Fed’s tightening monetary policy, there is a downside to it as well.Increased Competition for DepositsThe Fed’s plan to unwind its balance sheet is expected to result in deposit outflows. Also, as the money supply in the economy will reduce, lesser amount will get deposited in the banks.Such a scenario will lead to increased competition among banks to attract deposits. Similar sentiments are being echoed by top executives of major banks.William Demchak, chairman and chief executive of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), at an investors’ conference in September noted that competition for customer deposits could increase “partly as a result of the Fed draining cash out of the system by shrinking its balance sheet.”Earlier in July at second quarter earnings conference call, U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) chief financial officer Terrance Dolan said “…as excess liquidity comes out of the market you could expect to see and you will expect to see more competition with respect to deposits.”Competition will likely be more intense for wholesale deposits — those coming from institutional clients and large companies.Also, as the rise of online banking has made it easier from customers to switch banks and with the Fed expected to further increase interest rates, it will become easy for banks to offer higher rates on deposits. For customers stuck with persistently low deposit rates till now, banks providing higher rates on savings account will become more attractive.Nevertheless, with economy improving gradually, deposits are expected to rise as well. Specifically, retail deposits are expected to rise driven by higher rates on deposits.Overall, deposits are expected to continue increasing given the economic growth, though the pace of rise is likely to be slower compared with the QE period.Of the above-mentioned major banks, JPMorgan, BB&T, Bank of America, PNC Financial and Citigroup carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

634,PNC,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is well poised for bottom-line growth, given its efficient cost-saving initiatives. Also, easing margin pressure should aid top-line growth. However, higher dependence on fee-based income as a source of revenue makes us a little apprehensive.Analysts have maintained a neutral stance on the company’s earnings growth potential. As a result, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has remained stable over the past 30 days.Looking at the fundamentals, the company’s non-interest expenses have declined at a three-year (2014-2016) CAGR of 7%. Given, the consistent cost-saving initiatives, the company remains well poised to lower its overall costs. Declining expenses are expected to continue to support bottom-line growth in the near term.Also, amid an improving operating environment and with the increase in interest rates, pressure on the company’s net interest margin (NIM) seems to be gradually easing. Notably, management expects any further rate hike to positively impact margins as well as net interest revenue.Given a solid capital position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital-deployment activities.However, more than 75% of BNY Mellon’s revenue is generated from fee income. The concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee-based revenues could alter the company’s financial position if there is any change in individual investment preferences or a slowdown in capital market activities.Mentioned below are a few stocks from the finance space, which you may consider.The earnings estimate of Raymond James Financial, Inc.

635,PNC,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks was bullish. The Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance in its just-concluded September meeting was the primary reason for increased investors’ optimism for banks.While the downsizing of balance sheet was expected, what surprised the market was the Fed signaling four more rate hikes over the next 12 months. With banks being one of the main beneficiaries of the interest rate hikes, the stocks moved higher and 10-year Treasury bond yields rose.Moving on to bank specific news, over the last five trading sessions, three major banks announced dividend hikes (as part of their 2017 capital plan).

636,PNC,"In the Q2 earnings season, the Finance sector was one of the best performers. Though uncertainty over further interest rate hikes on mixed U.S. economic data and increasing signals of rising political commotion are perceived, we can still hold some of the banking stocks in our basket, based on strong fundamentals and solid long-term growth opportunity.Lazard Ltd. (LAZ  -  Free Report) is one such stock. While the investment manager’s significant dependence on global markets remains a headwind, its consistent organic growth and cost-management initiatives are expected to be key drivers over the long run.The company’s robust fundamentals have contributed to 18.4% gain in share price over the last year compared with 22% growth recorded by the industry.Moreover, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised around 1% upward for the current year, over the last 90 days. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Organic growth remains a key strength at Lazard, as highlighted by its revenue growth trend. Though operating revenues descended just 2% year over year in 2016, the figure witnessed a CAGR of 6.8% over the five-year period (2011-2015), with the increasing trend continuing in the first half of 2017. Notably, in September 2016, Lazard expanded its financial advisory in North America, with the acquisition of Canada-based Verus Partners, an independent boutique. Additionally, in October 2016, the company acquired its remaining 50% stake in MBA Lazard, its financial advisory business in Latin America, to strengthen its operations in Latin America, as well as global markets.Lazard has been diligently working on its cost-containment measures. In 2012, the company announced cost-reduction initiatives for which the full impact of the savings was reflected in 2014 with the positive impact continuing in the current year as well. Further, the company’s investment strategies in global, local and emerging markets in both equities and fixed income boosted its AUM. The increasing trend continued in the first half of 2017 and is expected to go ahead in the upcoming quarters as well, with anticipated improvement in the market.However, the investment manager’s heavy reliance on overseas revenues, which account for nearly 43% of total operating revenues, remains a concern. A plethora of risks stemming from the regulatory and political environment, foreign exchange fluctuations and performance of regional economy can adversely affect the top line.Stocks to ConsiderBancFirst Corporation (BANF  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

638,PNC,"In quarters past, we in the world of finance reporting would be sounding the trumpets for the ushering in of a new Earnings Season, which was to commence with aluminum giant Alcoa’s (AA  -  Free Report) report after the closing bell with Monday or Tuesday of a week just like this. But really, this was always just a convenient formality that didn’t have much integral meaning to earnings season as a whole nor the general domestic and global economies they help illustrate. If you want to get an early foothold on the global marketplace, for instance, you’d do better to focus on FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) numbers (which happened to miss consensus estimates by 20% in its fiscal Q1 2018 report a few weeks ago).That said, if you are interested in the lion’s share of data related to quarterly gains from the finance sector, then you have indeed found the right week. By this time Thursday morning, we will have seen Q3 earnings results from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). By the opening bell this Friday, we’ll also see Q3 reports from Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and PNC (PNC  -  Free Report). Major banks represent nearly half the total earnings for the finance sector, which is why we can make informed projections about whether or not we’re looking at a strong quarter or not just by tracking these large U.S. banks.Bank stocks did not impress the market in Q2. Yet in the past month — the direct run-up to Q3 earnings season — banks are up 8%, according to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian. Anticipation of a generous tax reform (tax cut) policy, plus a strong likelihood of a December interest rate hike from the Fed, helped bolster stock prices. But would disappointing earnings and revenue results start a pullback from record highs, not just among companies in the finance sector but across the board? After all, what industries can claim they have no involvement with the biggest Wall Street banks?Consider also that Q3 reports for the banks will not have any actualized data related to tax policy or a higher interest rate, thus they will not appear on the books this quarter. The good news is yearly comps should be beatable, so expectations of a lousy quarter are not warranted at this stage. For a comprehensive report on this week’s coming earnings reports, please read Sheraz’s latest Earnings Preview: Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable?Aside from the big banks, we also look for earnings data Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) on Wednesday morning and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) on Thursday. So while the frequency of new reports will be milder than we will see in the coming next few weeks, we will hear from several heavy hitters representing different sectors.In the meantime, will stock indexes keep their brave chin pointed forward to new record highs? If this week’s reporting companies all beat estimates and raise guidance, how much higher can we expect markets to rise?It should be fun. Futures this Monday morning are all up a half-hour before regular-day trading begins.

639,PNC,"Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) has agreed to pay $1.74 billion to the estate of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. for a case that was filed during 2008 financial crisis. The settlement comes as a tailwind for Lehman’s unsecured creditors in the 10-year old bankruptcy case.Citigroup had claimed that Lehman owed it $2 billion as a result of bankruptcy. However, Lehman accused Citigroup of making a false claim, as at that time it had access to $2.1 billion it had on deposit for trades with the bank. Lehman also charged the company of making up extra costs and using unfair methods in order to justify its claim.Further, Lehman claimed that even after bankruptcy, Citigroup had charged it with costs for replacing trades even though it had hedged its risk and not replaced individual trades.During a trial held in New York, Lehman brought forward phone recordings and messages from Citigroup traders, which showed how they tried to take advantage of the situation.However, Citigroup said that it followed accepted standards for closing trades and used best professional judgment to determine close-out amounts on the trades. The contracts were governed by International Swaps & Derivatives Association master agreements, which gave Citigroup the right to assess the close-out costs as long as it used commercially reasonable procedures.Nevertheless, Citigroup is pleased to have settled the case with Lehman, per a bank spokesperson.Citigroup remains on track to settle all the pending legal matters since the financial crisis.

642,PNC,"After the Federal Reserve signaled a likely rate hike by the end of this year, hopes were renewed among investors targeting bank stocks. The Fed announced that it would raise the interest rates four more times by the end of next year. This came as a sweet surprise for investors, as they were not expecting any update on rate hike this time around.The news led to an increase in SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) by 1.6% in the past two days as against a 0.2% decline recorded by the S&P 500 index.As the current inflation rate remains below the Fed’s target level, chances of an interest rate hike were low this time around among market participants. However, investors were waiting for another important decision that is likely to significantly benefit banks.Putting all speculation to rest, the Fed finally announced that it will begin reducing its balance sheet starting next month. The Fed’s balance sheet stands currently at a staggering $4.5 trillion, thanks to its efforts to increase liquidity by large-scale purchases of assets during the last financial crisis. The decision to unwind was the result of months of vigilant research and hard work put in by the central bank to tighten the monetary policy.Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, said in the meeting that the economy was strong enough to survive further rate increases and the reduction in the balance sheet.Why Are Banks Likely to Profit?Anticipation of Rate Hike: Banks typically benefit from rising interest rates. The benefit primarily comes from a steep yield curve, i.e. when the spread between long-term and short-term rates is wide. Deposits usually carry short-term rates while loans are often tied to long-term rates.Accordingly, a rise in rates enables banks to charge more for loans, leading to an increase in their spread income. Also, rising rates reflect an improving domestic economy that boosts banking business.Downsizing of Balance Sheet: Balance sheet reduction is also going to profit banks. That’s because if the Fed decides to buy back some or all short-term duration securities, the yield curve will be steeper. This means that the yield on long-term bonds will increase. This will also lead to improved margin spreads for banks.Choosing the Winning StocksWhile the Fed’s moves will likely benefit the entire banking sector, stocks that been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a favorable Zacks Rank should generate solid returns.  BancFirst Corporation (BANF  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

It had promised to provide a transparent pricing policy to the merchants.However, per the lawsuit filed in Brooklyn, on behalf of Patti's Pitas, a now-closed restaurant in Pennsylvania, tour operator Queen City Tours in Charlotte, NC, and other merchants, the venture failed to live up to its promises.

Also, the figure was up 14.4% year over year.Higher net interest income (reflecting rise in interest rates) and fee income supported the results. Further, assets under custody and administration and assets under management (AUM) recorded growth.

However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.84 billion.Net interest revenues, on an operating basis, increased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $617 million.

All components of fee income showed improvement except processing fees and other revenues.On an operating basis, non-interest expenses were $1.96 billion, up 7.2% on a year-over-year basis.

646,PNC,"It’s finally here, and people like me now have something concrete to talk about: Q2 Earnings Season. It tends to be the quarter that least affects stocks and the market as a whole, based on the summer season and where it lays within the fiscal year: Q1 kicks off performance metrics for the full year, and Q3 brings them into the final stretch. Q4 is the final word. Q2 is… Q2.JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) beat Q2 estimates on both top and bottom lines, reporting $1.82 per share compared to the Zacks consensus of $1.57. Revenues of $26.4 billion topped expectations of $24.8 billion, as well as the year-ago number of $25.2 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon was quoted as saying the U.S. consumer remains healthy, but that without gridlock in Washington DC, his company would grow faster.JPM shared are trading down in the pre-market following the earnings announcement, which may speak to the “quality” of the beat. Certain aspects like a low loss provision in the quarter might be seen as temporary. But the company was boosted by lending, which illustrates financial market activity which we may see pop up elsewhere in the economy.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) beat earnings expectations as well, reporting $1.28 per share — 7 cents better than the Zacks consensus expectation of $1.21. Revenues of $17.90 billion also topped the consensus estimate of $17.32 billion, up 2% year over year. Healthier revenue streams were somewhat offset by higher costs of credit in the quarter. Like JPMorgan, Citigroup has a recent history of beating earnings estimates quarter after quarter. Pre-market shares are down slightly, however.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) also beat the Zacks consensus, by 5 cents to $1.07 per share. Revenues, however, missed just slightly at $22.2 billion from the $22.3 billion expected. Pre-market shares of Wells Fargo are also down following the report; perhaps whatever good was expected by financial analysts has already been baked into the share price. Although market participants look to be in a relatively hesitant move at this hour, so perhaps we’re merely looking at the present mood of traders, subject to change.PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates as well this morning, posting a 9-cent beat to $2.10 per share. Revenues of $4.06 billion improved on the $4.00 billion expected, 7% greater than in the year-ago quarter. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is also trading down slightly in today’s pre-market.Keep in mind these banking majors are all up big from this time a year ago, 50+% in some cases (aside from Wells Fargo, which has had its internal issues about generating false accounts and its subsequent comeuppance from regulators; it is up only 16% year over year). So perhaps a “sell the news” scenario is in place for these companies on the first full day of Q2 earnings season, which is nothing to fear for longer-term market participants.Inflation Metrics MutedElsewhere, a new Consumer Price Index (CPI) report this morning for June in unchanged, slightly under analysts’ expectations. The core year-over-year read was 1.7%, about in-line with the modest gains expected in this inflation metric. A decline in energy prices (-2.8%) and airline fares (-2.7%) were notable in these latest monthly numbers.Retail Sales for June were also in negative territory: -0.2% on the headline, whereas analysts had been expecting a positive number. This follows a -0.3% read from May, meaning retailers have seen overall prices slip half of a full percentage point over the past two months. The drop in auto sales (-0.2%) are coming off tougher comps from a year ago, but we see broad-based weakness in retail pricing from last month.This is the sort of thing Janet Yellen and her cohorts at the Fed pay close attention to. We are not seeing inflation bubbling up in the economy as we had expected, especially in light of strong and consistent U.S. employment figures as of late. So while the pre-market appears cautious in trading right now, the mood may shift as it did during Yellen’s testimony a couple days ago: that factors indicate a lesser likelihood of raised interest rates in the near future, which may again spring market buying to new highs.

The reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4 billion.Net interest income was up 9% year over year to $2.26 billion due to higher loan and securities balances. Also, net interest margin increased 14 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.84%.Non-interest income was up 4% year over year to $1.80 billion, driven by higher corporate services, asset management and other income, partially offset by lower income from residential mortgage.PNC Financial’s non-interest expenses were $2.48 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.

The Fed plans to begin the gradual unwinding process in October and also announced that it plans to trim the assets by $10 billion each month. Fed also stated that this rate would be increased further by another $10 billion every three months to gradually reach a maximum of $50 billion a month.Such assets consist primarily of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, which the Fed accumulated in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis under its quantitative easing program. This was done in a bid to keep the mortgage rates low and provide liquidity to the economy.Fed Indicates a Possible Rate Hike in DecemberThe Fed kept the interest- rates unchanged as expected. Currently pegged at 1% to 1.25%, the central bank announced that it expects to hike the interest rate to 1.4% by the year end. Moreover, it maintained its initial forecast for 2018, expecting to hike the benchmark interest rate to 2.1%. However, the Fed decreased its outlook for 2019 from its initial forecast in June. The Fed stated that it anticipates the interest rate to hover around 2.7% by the end of 2019, lower than the initial forecast of 2.9%.The Fed’s interest rate projections, known as the dot-plot, indicated that there might be one rate hike in December, three more in 2018 and two further rate hikes in 2019. The CME FedWatch now estimated the possibility of a rate hike in December to 70%.Such hawkish statements from the Fed led to a surge in the 10-year Treasury yield by 2.3%. The 2-year Treasury note yield surged 1.5% — its highest level since November 2008. This boosted the financial shares and boded well for banks. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) rose 1.2% to 43.25 and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) surged almost 0.6%. Shares of banks also rose following Fed’s announcement.

This figure is also lower than 5.44 million units for the month of July.Existing home sales has dropped for the fourth time in the last five months and economists commented that this was because of a paucity of available homes that can be bought.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

649,PNC,"BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Better-than-expected results were driven by an increase in revenues and lower expenses. The quarter also witnessed an increase in loans and leases. Moreover, profitability improved in the quarter. However, provision for credit losses increased, which was a headwind.Results excluded merger-related and restructuring charges. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $631 million or 77 cents per share compared with $541 million or 66 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues up, Costs DownTotal revenue (taxable-equivalent) for the quarter came in at $2.90 billion, up 3.9% year over year.Tax-equivalent net interest income rose 1.1% from the prior-year quarter to $1.68 billion. Also, net interest margin increased 6 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.47%.Non-interest income increased nearly 8% year over year to $1.22 billion. Rise in almost all fee income components, except mortgage banking income, led to the growth. Also, the quarter witnessed nil net FDIC loss share income.Non-interest expense of $1.74 billion decreased 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a fall in amortization of intangibles, net merger-related and restructuring charges and outside IT services related costs.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 58.6%, down from 59.6% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates a rise in profitability.As of Jun 30, 2017, total deposits were nearly $157 billion, down from $161.3 billion in the prior-quarter. However, total loans and leases were $145.1 billion, up 0.8% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $690 million, down 22.1% year over year.

Also, during the quarter, allowance for loan and lease losses came in at 1.03% of total loans and leases held for investment, down 3 bps year over year.However, net charge-offs were 0.37% of average loans and leases, up 9 bps year over year. Further, provision for credit losses was $135 million at the end of the quarter, reflecting an increase of 21.6% year over year.Profitability & Capital Ratios ImprovedAt the end of the reported quarter, return on average assets was 1.22%, up from 1.06% in the prior-year quarter. Return on average common equity increased to 9.30% from 8.21% as of Jun 30, 2016.As of Jun 30, 2017, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.1%, compared with 11.7% in the year-ago quarter. BB&T's estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III (on a fully phased-in basis) was approximately 10.2% as of Jun 30, 2017.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, BB&T repurchased $160 million worth shares through open-market purchases.Our TakeWe believe BB&T to remain well positioned for revenue growth through strategic acquisitions. These efforts will also support bottom-line growth in the near term. Moreover, consistent growth in loans along with improving rate scenario should propel its organic growth trajectory.However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability. Also, the company’s exposure to risky loans continues to be a near-term concern.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteCurrently, BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

650,PNC,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has been rated down to AA (low) from AA by DBRS, a Toronto-based credit rating agency. Its involvement in fake-account scandal has majorly led to this rating downgrade.The downward rating reflects Wells Fargo’s operational inefficiency and improper management. The rating agency also took into account the bank’s falling reputation because of the several legal issues that have come to light of late.Further, DBRS also considered the amount of expenses the bank has already incurred and would be facing in the near term.Wells Fargo has already agreed to pay $142 million in settlement of class-action suit for opening accounts without its customers’ permission. Also, it paid refunds of about $3.7 million to its customers through July 2017.However, this was not the end for Wells Fargo’s troubles. Some more disclosures regarding problems in other consumer-related products were made.The bank had been accused of charging high termination fees and unauthorized credit card fees along with issues in its auto insurance business in August 2017. Later, news of Wells Fargo closing authentic bank accounts without permission was reported. Moreover, as a result of an expanded review, the bank revealed that another 1.4 million fake accounts were created by its employees illegally. It has agreed to pay another $2.8 million as refunds to customers.The regulators are yet to take actions against the bank. Recently, the Fed Chair Janet Yellen called Wells Fargo’s actions ""egregious and unacceptable"" and disclosed that the Fed is trying to understand the main reasons for these problems.DBRS’ rating still keeps Wells Fargo among the highest-rated banks because of its diversified franchise and strong capital position. However, the rating agency disclosed that higher-than- expected litigation costs are leading to reduced profits. In fact, any further asset quality deterioration would lead to a negative rating.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 17.6% over the past year, underperforming the 36.4% rally for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report), FB Financial Corporation (FBK  -  Free Report) and M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report).

651,PNC,"All eyes are currently on the crucial two-day FOMC meeting slated to start today. The central bank is expected to hold rates steady but start shrinking its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet, which is mostly composed of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities purchased until 2014 since recession (read: Asset Rollback Top Priority of Fed: ETFs in Focus).Additionally, investors will be watching Fed’s future course of action on rates hike as the fastest pace of increase in August inflation since spring increased the odds of a rate hike in December. The market is now expecting more than a 50% chance of a December rate hike, up from about 30% chance one week ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.Unwinding of Balance Sheet: Boost to BanksIn June, the Fed laid out plans of reducing bond holdings. So long, it has reinvested the entire proceeds it got from bonds. Now, the Fed will use a cap system every month to execute its roll off plans and reinvest the rest. The central bank has set a roll off target of $10 billion that will increase quarterly until it reaches $50 billion ($30 billion for Treasuries and $20 billion for mortgage-backed securities) a month. The process is likely to continue until the balance sheet reaches about $2-$2.5 trillion.The decision to reverse the Quantitate Easing policy is a step toward monetary tightening and will lower demand for the currency, leaving an adverse impact on global liquidity. The historic move will push long-term rates higher relative to short-term rates and in turn benefit bank stocks. This is because banks seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. With the steep rise in long-term interest rates, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits (read: De-Stress Your Portfolio by Betting on Bank ETFs).Given this, we have highlighted bank ETFs that would likely gain from the Fed’s likely move.SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE  -  Free Report)This fund offers equal weight exposure to 73 banking stocks by tracking the S&P Banks Select Industry Index.

652,PNC,"Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS  -  Free Report) has received the European Commission’s (EC) consent for an alternative remedy package it had put forth in July 2017, which promises to make U.K.’s small and medium-sized banking market more competitive.The package had been proposed as an alternative to the sale of Williams & Glyn. This divesture was part of the conditions that the EC had imposed on the bank for the £45.5 billion bailout it received during the crisis.What the Remedy Plan EntailsUnder the package, Royal Bank of Scotland would establish a “Capability and Innovation Fund” with £425 million, which would be granted to challenger banks in the U.K. banking and financial technology sectors in order to encourage them to improve their financial stability.Further, the bank will also provide another £350 million to “Incentivized Switching Scheme” which shall grant funds to eligible challenger banks to help them incentivize small business customers to move their accounts and loans from RBS, paid in the form of “dowries” to the receiving bank.Also, if the uptake among customers looking to switch banks is not enough, the bank will provide £50 million more.In order to administer both the funds, an “Independent Body” will be established that would also coordinate activities between the Royal Bank of Scotland and the challenger banks. A contribution of £20 million would be made to meet the operational expenses.The package is expected to be launched in the first half of 2018.The British bank also disclosed that the package is consistent with the £800 million provision it had built in relation to the expected costs.Our ViewpointThe bank would now be able to put behind the bailout and look forward to developing its business. Also, it would be able to distribute excess capital to its shareholders, thus enhancing their value.Shares of Royal Bank of Scotland have gained 24.6% year to date, outperforming the 18.1% rally for the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report), State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and FB Financial Corporation (FBK  -  Free Report).

653,PNC,"Financial stocks suffered sell-offs on Friday despite upbeat earnings. Bellwethers like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings. Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) missed revenue estimates but beat on earnings (read: De-Stress Your Portfolio by Betting on Bank ETFs).Though there were positive attributes like loan growth and improving net interest spread, the decline in U.S. Treasury yields weighed on the sector. Added to this, a somewhat subdued outlook provided by a few industry leaders led to Friday’s fall in banking shares.Decline in YieldsThe yield on the 10-year note dropped five basis points to 2.298% on July 14 on downbeat inflation number and retail sales data. This once again stirred speculation over whether the Fed will be able to enact one more rate hike this year. In any case, dovish remarks from Fed chief Yellen kept Treasury yields at check (read: Dovish Yellen Testimony to Boost These ETFs).The Fed chair has full faith in the U.S. economic growth momentum with a solid labor market, though she remains cautious about subdued inflation and wage growth. Yellen indicated that since the neutral rate – at which economic growth matches its potential and inflation – “is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds would not have to rise all that much further to get to a neutral policy stance.""Inside Doubtfulness Tied to the Outlook J.P Morgan expects net interest income to grow by $4 billion this year, down from the prior guidance of $4.5 billion, due to a combination of mortgage adjustments, weakness in markets-related income, and an unexpected slump in 10-year bond yields, as per an article published on Reuters. Shares of JPM were down 0.9% on July 14.Reuters went on to explain that Citi Group depends less on deposits from consumers, who have not required higher rates as fast as institutional customers. Notably, a huge portion of Citigroup’s loan growth originated from credit cards which are devoid of balances and thus do “not earn interest from those loans.” Shares of Citigroup lost about 0.5% on July 14.Wells Fargo benefited from higher interest rates but “stagnant lending and weaker revenue in areas like mortgage banking” were concerns. Wells Fargo witnessed a slump in car loans and tighter lending standards hurt the segment, going by article published on BBC News. WFC lost about 1.1% on July 14.PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) also came up with an impressive scorecard but dampened analysts’ mood as it did not beef up its guidance. The stock shed over 0.1% on July 14.Banking ETFs’ PerformanceThe largest financial ETF Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report) lost over 0.4% on July 14. Banking ETFs like SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF(KRE  -  Free Report), PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report), iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF ((IAT  -  Free Report)), SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE  -  Free Report) and First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank Index Fund ((QABA  -  Free Report)) shed about 0.6%, 0.8%, 0.7%, 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively, on July 14 (see all financial ETFs).What Lies Ahead?Overall, the banking sector is on growth path. JP Morgan reported a 4.7% year-over-year increase in total net revenues to $26.4 billion for the second quarter of the year. An 8% jump in interest income spurred by rising rates and an advancement in the number of loans facilitated revenue improvement.There was also a double-digit uptick in J.P. Morgan’s card sales and merchant processing volumes. Citigroup reported 2% year-over-year expansion in revenues to $17.9 billion helped by the retail division and investment banking.Investors should note that major banks are expected to report about 4.5% earnings growth in the second quarter of 2017. Zacks Industry Rank for banks is still in the top 28%. Still, the interest rate is the key risk in the space, which is why the Zacks Sector Rank for banks is in the bottom 25%.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.The loans underlying the servicing rights have been guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Also, the MSRs will be included in Wells Fargo’s third-quarter results. The company also assured that the customers will receive detailed welcome information at the time of transfer.As of Jun 30, 2017, Wells Fargo had a servicing portfolio of about $1.5 trillion, which made it the leading servicer of mortgage loans.Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo’s consumer lending division, said that mortgage servicing is a core business for the bank and this transaction is seen as an opportunity to strategically grow its portfolio.Though Wells Fargo is making efforts to uplift its reputation in the market, the unending litigations faced by it keep offsetting them.On Sep 7, the federal appeals court ordered to reopen the whistleblower lawsuit filed by two former employees of Wells Fargo, who claimed to have been fired on attempting to report about their employers hiding mortgage improprieties and losses worth billions of dollars.However, Wells Fargo had recently hit the news for facing a class-action lawsuit alleging the bank to have charged unjustified rate-lock extension fees to borrowers who were not liable to pay them. Also, consumer agencies across the United States have received complaints against the bank for having charged rate-lock extension fees wrongly to customers ranging from $1,000 to as high as $4,500.Amid all the pessimism with regard to Wells Fargo, it shares have lost 9.9% over the past year versus the industry’s rally of 2%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space worth considering are The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

655,PNC,"State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) is well poised for future growth, given its global network, wide range of innovative products and services, and sturdy capital position. Also, easing margin pressure is expected to aid top-line improvement.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has moved 3.6% upward over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its earnings growth potential. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).State Street’s share price has increased 23.2% so far this year, outperforming the 6.3% rally for the industry it belongs to. Given the positive estimate revisions and a solid Zacks Rank, the stock should gain further.Looking at the fundamentals, State Street’s revenues have increased at a CAGR of 1.5% over the past five years (2012–2016), primarily driven by higher management fees and securities finance income. Moreover, revenues are expected to continue rising, given the company’s continued investment in new products and the acquisition of GE Asset Management.Also, with the economic recovery and the gradual change in rate environment, pressure on State Street’s net interest margin (NIM) seems to be easing. Given the optimistic view on future rate hikes, the company’s margin is expected to improve further, thereby supporting top-line growth.Further, given a stable capital position and impressive earnings strength, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, continuously rising expenses remains a major concern for the company. Expenses have increased at a five-year (2012–2016) CAGR of 4.1%, primarily due to a rise in compensation, and acquisition and restructuring costs. Elevated expenses are likely to curb bottom-line growth in the quarters ahead.A few other top-ranked stocks from the finance space are mentioned below.The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 13.2% for the current fiscal year over the past 60 days.

656,PNC,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks has been bullish. Though a tepid trading revenue outlook from some of the major banks indicates a bleak earnings picture, the rising 10-year Treasury bond yields supported bank stocks. Lesser-than-expected losses from the hurricanes primarily helped yields rise.Further, interest rate is expected to remain unchanged in next week’s Fed meeting. However, details on the Fed’s plans to shrink its portfolio of treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities worth $4.5 trillion are likely to unwind.Nevertheless, strategies to enhance profitability through cost-control efforts persisted over the last five trading days.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Aug 18, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

657,PNC,"Friday, July 14th, 2017It’s finally here, and people like me now have something concrete to talk about: Q2 Earnings Season. It tends to be the quarter that least affects stocks and the market as a whole, based on the summer season and where it lays within the fiscal year: Q1 kicks off performance metrics for the full year, and Q3 brings them into the final stretch. Q4 is the final word. Q2 is… Q2.JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) beat Q2 estimates on both top and bottom lines, reporting $1.82 per share compared to the Zacks consensus of $1.57. Revenues of $26.4 billion topped expectations of $24.8 billion, as well as the year-ago number of $25.2 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon was quoted as saying the U.S. consumer remains healthy, but that without gridlock in Washington DC, his company would grow faster.JPM shared are trading down in the pre-market following the earnings announcement, which may speak to the “quality” of the beat. Certain aspects like a low loss provision in the quarter might be seen as temporary. But the company was boosted by lending, which illustrates financial market activity which we may see pop up elsewhere in the economy.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) beat earnings expectations as well, reporting $1.28 per share — 7 cents better than the Zacks consensus expectation of $1.21. Revenues of $17.90 billion also topped the consensus estimate of $17.32 billion, up 2% year over year. Healthier revenue streams were somewhat offset by higher costs of credit in the quarter. Like JPMorgan, Citigroup has a recent history of beating earnings estimates quarter after quarter. Pre-market shares are down slightly, however.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) also beat the Zacks consensus, by 5 cents to $1.07 per share. Revenues, however, missed just slightly at $22.2 billion from the $22.3 billion expected. Pre-market shares of Wells Fargo are also down following the report; perhaps whatever good was expected by financial analysts has already been baked into the share price. Although market participants look to be in a relatively hesitant move at this hour, so perhaps we’re merely looking at the present mood of traders, subject to change.PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates as well this morning, posting a 9-cent beat to $2.10 per share. Revenues of $4.06 billion improved on the $4.00 billion expected, 7% greater than in the year-ago quarter. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is also trading down slightly in today’s pre-market.Keep in mind these banking majors are all up big from this time a year ago, 50+% in some cases (aside from Wells Fargo, which has had its internal issues about generating false accounts and its subsequent comeuppance from regulators; it is up only 16% year over year). So perhaps a “sell the news” scenario is in place for these companies on the first full day of Q2 earnings season, which is nothing to fear for longer-term market participants.Inflation Metrics MutedElsewhere, a new Consumer Price Index (CPI) report this morning for June in unchanged, slightly under analysts’ expectations. The core year-over-year read was 1.7%, about in-line with the modest gains expected in this inflation metric. A decline in energy prices (-2.8%) and airline fares (-2.7%) were notable in these latest monthly numbers.Retail Sales for June were also in negative territory: -0.2% on the headline, whereas analysts had been expecting a positive number. This follows a -0.3% read from May, meaning retailers have seen overall prices slip half of a full percentage point over the past two months. The drop in auto sales (-0.2%) are coming off tougher comps from a year ago, but we see broad-based weakness in retail pricing from last month.This is the sort of thing Janet Yellen and her cohorts at the Fed pay close attention to. We are not seeing inflation bubbling up in the economy as we had expected, especially in light of strong and consistent U.S. employment figures as of late. So while the pre-market appears cautious in trading right now, the mood may shift as it did during Yellen’s testimony a couple days ago: that factors indicate a lesser likelihood of raised interest rates in the near future, which may again spring market buying to new highs.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

658,PNC,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. The earnings season has kick started and this time, banks are expected to be hurt by a tough operating backdrop. This seems to be one of the primary reasons for investors’ pessimistic stance.A number of factors including weak trading and investment banking activities, lower-than-expected interest rates and lesser demand for refinancing activities during the quarter must be weighing on investors’ mind. All these are expected to hurt banks’ revenue growth to some extent. With expense reduction not likely to be a major support, there is less chance of impressive growth in the banks’ bottom line.Nonetheless, the last five trading sessions witnessed streamlining efforts. Banks are continuing with such initiatives with an aim to focus on core operations and enhance profitability, going forward.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jul 7, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

661,PNC,"During the last earnings season, the Finance sector was one of the best performers. Despite inflation-related issues and rising chances of political uncertainty, we can add some banking stocks to our portfolio based on the banks’ strong fundamentals and solid long-term prospects.With organic and inorganic growth strategies, as well as a strong capital position, M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) appears to be one such stock. The company’s focus on the most attractive business mixes in the banking industry to tackle macroeconomic headwinds and strategic priorities, including core technology infrastructure, is anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.M& T Bank not only beat estimates in Q2, but also has been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its future prospects. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2017 and 2018 inched up marginally.Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have gained around 32% over the past year compared with 34.3% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Notably, M&T Bank has a number of other aspects which make it an attractive investment option.Why M&T Bank is a Golden Egg  Revenue Growth: M&T Bank continues to make steady progress toward bolstering its revenues. Since 2008, the company has recorded a consistent rise in net interest income. Over the last six years (ended December 2016), it has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 7.7%, with the trend continuing in the first six months of 2017 as well.The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 6.3% (as against the industry average of about 6.22%) indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Earnings Per Share Strength: Earnings are anticipated to display an upswing in the near term, as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 14.7% compared to the industry average rate of 12.6%. Also, M&T Bank recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 4.66%, over the trailing four quarters.Inorganic Growth Routes: Given its robust liquidity position, M&T Bank is well positioned to grow on the back of acquisitions. The growth has been reflected in the company’s accomplishment of several major acquisitions in and out of the United States, in the last several years. The completion of the merger with Hudson City in November 2015 expanded the company’s retail branch network in the Eastern United States, with access to 135 Hudson branches, situated primarily in New Jersey. Further, product and balance-sheet diversification, stemming from the acquisition, will likely support the company’s top line.Steady Capital Deployment: M&T Bank’s capital deployment activities remain impressive. The company’s 2017 capital plan was approved by the Fed. The plan included share buyback of up to $900 million over the four-quarter period, effective July 2017. Further, it included a dividend hike on common stock in the range of 5-80 cents per share to be provided in second-quarter 2018. The latest quarterly common stock dividend hike was 7% in February 2017.Stock is Undervalued: M&T Bank has P/E ratio and P/B ratio of 16.2 and 1.52 compared to the S&P 500 average of 19.11 and 3.14, respectively. Based on these ratios, the stock seems undervalued.Strong Leverage: M&T Bank’s debt/equity ratio is valued at 0.51 compared to the industry average of 0.88, indicating relatively lower debt burden. It highlights the financial stability of the company even in adverse economic conditions.Stocks to ConsiderBancFirst Corporation (BANF  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

Further, projected increase in EPS is also encouraging.However, the stretched valuation limits the stock’s upside potential.

664,PNC,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) recently made an undisclosed investment in Bill.com, the largest business-to-business (B2B) payments network in the U.S. The move is part of the company’s efforts toward enabling its business clients do away with paper checks, and instead make and receive payments electronically.Bill.com’s technology is likely to be integrated into JPMorgan’s digital system by early 2018. The association will benefit the banks’ customers by allowing them to have access to Bill.com’s network comprising almost 2.5 million users.Notably, according to Stephen Markwell, a product strategy head for JPMorgan, though various customers have started making use of electronic payment tools, there is still a huge amount of business payments that are made using checks. In fact, around $4 is spent by companies for printing and handling each check.Hence, once businesses start making and receiving payments electronically, it will save a lot of their time, money and effort, which goes into managing bills manually.Markwell says, “Bill payment is a huge source of pain for businesses,” adding, “Every step of that process is manual, inefficient, error-prone, and ripe for electronification.”However, this is not the first time that JPMorgan is using the expertise of another firm to better serve its clients. In order to make auto purchases easier and to simplify small business lending and mortgage origination, the bank had in the past announced partnerships with firms like Truecar, On Deck Capital Inc. and Roostify.The company’s price performance looks impressive. Its shares have gained 40.6% in a year’s time, outperforming the 34.3% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report) and State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

668,PNC,"On Sep 4, we issued an updated research report on M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report). The bank currently displays strength in top-line and capital position. However, increasing cost base remains a woe.M&T Bank’s net interest income has been rising consistently, recording a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 7.7% over the last six years (ended 2016). Reduced margin pressure on the back of rate hikes will also benefit the bank.  M&T Bank continues to enhance shareholders’ value through steady capital deployment activities. It raised the common stock dividend by 7% in February 2017 and plans another hike in second-quarter 2018 in the range of 5 cents to 80 cents per share. The bank also has a share repurchase program of up to $900 million underway. These activities look impressive due to M&T Bank’s favorable debt/equity ratio when compared to the broader industry.However, M&T Bank’s consistently rising cost base remains a major concern.
