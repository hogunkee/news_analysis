0,RTN,"Raytheon (RTN) expects missile defense demand to remain strong, in the Asia region specifically, regardless of what happens in expected U.S.-North Korea talks, as the maker of the Patriot defense system reported strong Q1 earnings.The Trump administration dispatched CIA Director Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang earlier for preliminary discussions, and negotiations between President Trump and Kim Jong-Un may start in the next month or so. Meanwhile, North Korea has already announced it would stop nuclear missile tests.But Raytheon CFO Toby O'Brien told IBD that he sees demand across all regions of the world and doesn't see that slowing down any time soon.Regional customers also continue to modernize their arsenals with increased demand for new capabilities, such as the latest version of the Standard Missile-3 and the Standard Missile-6.The Patriot missile-defense system remained a strong driver of Q1 results. Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems unit saw sales rise 7% to $1.49 billion, led by an international Patriot contract award. During Q1, the unit booked over $2 billion for Patriot capabilities to the U.S. and its allies.Earnings per share from continuing operations jumped 27% to $2.20, beating Zacks Investment Research estimates by 10 cents. Net sales climbed 4.5% to $6.27 billion, better then views for $6.17 billion.Intelligence, Information and Services revenue grew 5% to $1.58 billion. Missile Systems sales climbed 5% to $1.85 billion, led by higher net sales on classified programs. Space and Airborne Systems sales edged up 1% to $1.57 billion.Missile sales should get a further boost after the State Department cleared the way last month for Saudi Arabia to buy nearly 6,700 Raytheon anti-tank missiles following Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to Washington, D.C., as the Trump administration relaxes export restrictions on U.S. weapons.Bookings improved to $6.3 billion from $5.7 billion a year ago. Total backlog at the end of Q1 was $38.14 billion, down from $38.21 billion at the end of 2017 but up from $36.05 billion a year ago. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $283 million compared to an outflow of $41 million a year ago.Raytheon now sees full-year EPS at $9.70-$9.90, above consensus for $9.69 and up from its prior views of $9.55-$9.75, on net sales of $26.5 billion-$27 billion, vs. consensus for $26.81 billion, up from a prior view of $26.4 billion-$26.9 billion. Management still sees 2018 operating cash flow at $3.6 billion-$4 billion but said it is also tracking above views.""We delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter with our sales, earnings per share and cash flow all ahead of our expectations,"" Chairman and CEO Thomas Kennedy said in a statement.Shares were down 1.2% at 211.09 on the stock market today, slipping into sell territory intraday after breaking out last week. Defense stocks were slammed this week after Lockheed Martin (LMT) didn't raise its cash flow guidance after raising the outlook on EPS, revenue and other key financial figures amid a steep increase in Pentagon spending.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

""Not going to get rid of conventional missile technology. There is going to be a time and place for both.""Raytheon's results also follow U.S.-led air strikes in Syria earlier this month that involved the company's Tomahawk cruise missiles.But Russia claimed this week that it took possession of an unexploded Tomahawk and will use it to improve its own weapons, according to the TASS government run news agency. U.S. officials have refuted those claims, according to a CNBC report.O'Brien said in an interview that he heard of the report but referred comment to the Pentagon.On Wednesday, Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported Q1 earnings and revenue above Wall Street estimates, but kept cash flow and sales guidance flat. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views when it announced results Wednesday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingBoeing Nearly Done With China Plant, Brushes Off Trade-War FearsDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

Start HereRaytheon broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 190.35 entry from a flat base. If a stock you're watching climbs above a buy point then retreats 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new consolidation and breakout. Also understand that the most recent pattern is a later-stage base, and such bases are more prone to failure. The company posted 7% earnings growth in its most recent report. Sales rose 4%. Raytheon earns the No. 18 rank among its peers in the Aerospace/Defense industry group.

VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) vaulted nearly 4% each. Both ETFs reclaimed their 50-day moving average lines as they extended their advance for a third straight session. Biotech, banks and semiconductors were also among top sector fund gainers in the stock market today.Bitcoin finally got back above the $9,000 barrier.

6,RTN,"If your ETF tumbled in the market sell-off, consider it a good sign if it's bouncing off the 50-day moving average.X That's what iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) is trying to do, after it came 10.6% off its Feb. 1 peak. Shares are near the 50-day line. If it bounces back above the line, it would give the ETF a follow-on entry. But bear in mind that the stock market is on shakier ground, and buying any stock or ETF is riskier right now.The fund's so-far bullish reaction mirrors that found in the charts of its major components. Boeing (BA) is near new highs after making a second pullback to the 10-week moving average, a cousin of the 50-day average plotted on weekly IBD Charts.The company — the largest iShares U.S. Aerospace holding, accounting for more than 12% of  its portfolio — is seeing strong demand for its commercial jets, despite stiff competition from Airbus (EADSY). Reports say Boeing will form a joint venture with Embraer (ERJ) on the Brazilian company's regional jets.United Technologies (UTX) (8% of the portfolio) briefly erased a 13% gain from its 123.38 buy point before it bounced back temporarily. Lockheed Martin (LMT) (nearly 8%), Raytheon (RTN) (6.5%) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) (about 6%) have risen from pullbacks to the 50-day line.While the commercial plane business is helping mainly Boeing and its suppliers, the defense side of the ETF is witnessing its own boom. The Pentagon's National Defense Strategy published last month shows a shift from anti-insurgency warfare to fighting traditional foes such as Russia and China.""With the heightened focus on near-peer adversaries, such as China and Russia, we believe support for increased defense spending, and more importantly some of the specific areas of focus, will remain high,"" analysts at Canaccord Genuity noted in a Jan. 22 report.In the Defense Department paper, nuclear forces, cyberspace warfare, missile defense and command and control systems were some of the areas where modernization is planned, and where major defense contractors could play significant roles.Aerovironment (AVAV), Kratos Defense & Security (KTOS) and Cubic (CUB) are smaller holdings of iShares U.S. Defense that Canaccord says have high percentages of their business in defense. The fund has 40 total holdings.Defense spending rarely goes out of fashion, and the fund has a good long-term track record. As of year-end, its three-year average annual total return is 19.2%, the five year return is 23.9% and the 10-year is 12.1%, according to the iShares website.RELATED:Boeing's Cash Flow Could Jump 35%; Lockheed Cash Boom Also SeenLockheed Martin, Raytheon Missile Defense System Fails Test Over Hawaii2 Defense ETFs Near Buy Points As U.S. Faces North Korea ThreatBoeing, Embraer Will Reportedly Form Commercial Jet Joint Venture

"" The plan that we outlined for you, the production rate that we've put in place is not dependent on the Iranian orders.

15,RTN,"Japan and South Korea are considering adding the short takeoff/vertical landing variant of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 to their fleets, according to reports, potentially allowing the U.S. allies to project power farther as regional tensions heat up.X Both countries are already buying scores of the conventional-takeoff version, the F-35A, but having the F-35B in their arsenals would enable them to deploy the stealth fighters from ships, not just from land bases.South Korea's Yonhap news agency said military officials are looking at the F-35B for its Dokdo-class amphibious assault ships. Seoul already has one of the 14,300-ton, 653-foot ships and a second is scheduled for deployment in 2020, according to Military.com.Meanwhile, Japan is mulling the F-35B for use on its helicopter carriers as it looks to defend its smaller islands against China's growing maritime presence, government sources told The Japan Times.The U.S. Marines approved the F-35B for combat in 2015, and a squadron is deployed in Japan. The U.K. and Italian air forces will also operate the F-35B.Lockheed shares were up 0.8% at 322.10 on the stock market today, just below a 322.29 buy point. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a key subcontractor on the program, rose 0.7%, and United Technologies (UTX), which makes engines for the F-35, added 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The F-35Bs would complement the significant commitments from the two countries. South Korea has ordered 40 F-35As and earlier this month announced plans to buy 20 more, while Japan has ordered 42 F-35As.Interest in additional stealth fighters comes as North Korea has made rapid progress on its nuclear and missile programs.Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said last month that it's possible for the F-35 to shoot down nuclear missiles from North Korea or Iran with its Raytheon (RTN) AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles just seconds after takeoff.Boeing's (BA) F-15 could also be used if it had the right sensors but the stealthy fifth-generation F-35 already has key sensors installed, Aviation Week noted in a report earlier this month.In particular, Northrop has developed the F-35's infrared AN/AAQ-37 sensors that serve as an aircraft and missile warning system and the jet's fire control radar. The company has been testing the sensors on ballistic missiles for several years, according to the report.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Boeing, Lockheed, Defense Giants Eye 2018 Deals That Could Reshape SectorDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsPentagon's No. 2 Has This Confusing 'Mindset' On Lockheed's F-35

16,RTN,"Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and other defense contractors have key contracts in their sights in 2018 that could reshape the industry for years to come.The Air Force is looking for a new trainer plane to replace its aging fleet of Northrop T-38C Talons and will decide in July who receives about $16 billion to produce 350 aircraft.X A Lockheed Martin-Korea Aerospace Industries team is offering the T-50A, an upgraded version of the T-50 already in service in South Korea. Boeing is working with Saab to build a clean-sheet design. Italy's Leonardo is offering the T-100, but is a very long shot.The stakes are especially high for Boeing, which needs a new fighter contract as F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet production slows and demand shifts to Lockheed's next-generation F-35. If Boeing loses, it could be forced to make major job cuts at its St. Louis plant. Boeing showed off its offering recently.Lockheed is touting the proven effectiveness of the T-50A and says it can be ready on day one for the Air Force, which is looking to field the fighters as quickly as possible. On the other hand, Boeing's new design is seen as having ""more robust"" capabilities  and offers pilots extra flexibility in the cockpit.""Each team thinks they are the obvious right choice,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS. ""I think the possibly of a bid protest is high because the companies are so convinced they are right.""Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, gives the T-50A a slight advantage: ""They have no upfront costs and it's a highly cost based contract, a classic price shoot out.""The Navy is looking to field the first carrier-based drone for aerial refueling, and a contract award is expected in September. The Pentagon has earmarked $2.16 billion for the program through fiscal 2021, though the contract's total value would be larger.The competition is down to Lockheed, Boeing, and privately held General Atomics after Northrop Grumman announced it was dropping out of the race in October.Before dropping out of the contest, Northrop was seen as one of the front-runners as its X-47B prototype had been used in take off and landing demonstrations from aircraft carriers.Now, Lockheed is likely in the lead as its offering would be able to handle upgrades to strike and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, said Mark Bobbi and Derrick Maple, experts at IHS Markit. But if cost is the main concern then General Atomics is the likely winner.By the end of March, the Air Force expects to award a contract for hypersonic strike weapons that can fly five times the speed of sound and would be launched from fighters and bombers.Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing, Raytheon (RTN), and Orbital ATK (OA), which is being bought by Northrop, are bidding on the contract.Hypersonic weapons could be the most disruptive battlefield technology since stealth, combining speed, range and maneuverability to take unpredictable flight paths, making them nearly impossible to shoot down with today's technology.The contract will help push the Air Force to ""accelerate the development of hypersonic technologies"" a spokesman for the service said as China and Russia race to close the gap in technology.High-tempo operations in the Middle East and rising tensions in Europe have put a priority on fielding modernized ground vehicles. The Army plans to award two engineering and manufacturing development contracts by the end of 2018 for a new light tank.So far, bidders include General Dynamics (GD), BAE Systems and a team led by Science Applications (SAIC), according to Defense News.The Marine Corps is also expected to decide between BAE Systems and Science Applications for its Amphibious Combat Vehicle contract in 2018. The service plans to build 204 of the vehicles to replace its aging amphibious assault vehicle fleet.Key foreign contests will formally kick off in 2018, though awards will come later.By mid-2018, France and Germany plan to agree on a roadmap for jointly developing a next-generation fighter. But the new jet is unlikely to be available by 2025, so Germany is looking at Boeing's F-15 and Super Hornet as well as Lockheed's F-35 as possible stopgaps until then.India expects to open competition for a carrier-based fighter jet by the middle of the year. New Dehli is in dire need of new planes as its 900 fighters, mostly Russian-built aircraft, are nearing the end of their service lives.Finland is in the market for 64 jets to replace its Boeing F/A-18 Hornets and will ask for offers from Boeing and Lockheed early next year along with some European firms. But a contract award isn't expected until 2021.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

17,RTN,"Boeing (BA) earnings and revenue are seen rising, and the aerospace giant could announce even bigger shareholder returns when it releases fourth-quarter results Wednesday.X Analysts expect per-share profit to climb 18% to $2.91, with revenue up 6.6% to $24.83 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Boeing has already said Q4 commercial aircraft deliveries rose to 209 from 185 a year ago as production rates on the 737 and 787 ramp up.Boeing's improving operational efficiency has lifted cash flow, and in October management raised its overall 2017 cash flow guidance to $12.5 billion from $12.25 billion.That has raised hopes for bigger shareholder returns, and investors were rewarded in December, when Boeing announced an $18 billion repurchase program and raised its dividend 20% to $1.71.Since then, the White House and Congress have enacted a steep cut in the corporate tax rate, providing companies with even more cash to potentially return to shareholders. Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC) lifted its dividend and gave strong 2018 guidance.Boeing shares closed down 0.7% at 340.82 on the stock market today and are 3% off a record high set less than two weeks ago.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.During the conference call with analysts, Boeing could give an update on takeover talks with Brazil's Embraer (ERJ) as it looks to stay competitive in the narrow-body market after Airbus (EADSY) took a majority stake in Bombardier's (BDRBF) struggling C-Series jets.Brazilian officials have come out against a Boeing takeover of Embraer as the company's defense unit is seen as a major sticking point in negotiations, and they suggested a joint venture. But Boeing is reportedly only interested in taking full control.And in a surprise turn of events, the U.S. International Trade Commission unanimously ruled against Boeing Friday in a trading dispute with Bombardier, blocking a Commerce Department decision to levy import duties of nearly 300% on C-Series jets. But the verdict can still be appealed by Boeing.Boeing could also give more details about a possible new mid-market jet that analysts have dubbed the ""797."" Last week, United Airlines (UAL) said it was waiting for more information about a new jet before it considered  other possibilities to replace its 757 and 767 planes as airlines look to open routes to smaller cities.Meanwhile, Boeing's KC-46 tanker for the Air Force has been a major headache for Boeing and has racked up charges of $2.9 billion before taxes and $1.9 billion after taxes on the modified 767. Boeing originally planned to deliver the first tankers by the end of 2017, but now the first one won't be delivered until the spring.Last week Gen. Carlton Everhart, the head of Air Mobility Command, told the Air Force Times that Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration could get final FAA certification for the KC-46 in the next 60-70 days.Defense contractors have had a positive earnings season overall. Lockheed Martin (LMT) beat earnings and revenue forecasts Monday and issued strong full year guidance.Last week, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon on GD missed on revenue while Northrop beat and gave strong 2018 guidance.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Lockheed Martin Beats Earnings, Revenue Views, Guides Profit HighBoeing, Lockheed, Defense Giants Eye 2018 Deals That Could Reshape Sector

18,RTN,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages hit record highs amid a wave of earnings and a weaker dollar, though the greenback rebounded somewhat. Netflix (NFLX) skyrocketed on blowout subscriber growth and a bullish outlook. Celgene (CELG) will buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Intel (INTC) surged on its earnings and outlook, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and some other top chips failed to impress with their quarterly financials, but Apple (AAPL) continued to lag amid a growing chorus of concerns regarding iPhone X sales and production. Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors. Texas Instruments (TXN) posted in-line results and its shares were punished. The sector continues to wrestle with concerns that the chip cycle has ebbed. Top chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) beat views, but sold off on the news. Meanwhile, Xilinx joined Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) in benefiting from the sale of high-performance chips for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookBiotech mergers heated up with Celgene (CELG) agreeing to pay $9 billion for the 90% of CAR-T drug developer Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own while Sanofi (SNY) reached a deal with Biogen (BIIB) hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion. Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus. On Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) reported sales grew 15% to $3.31 billion and topped the consensus. Adjusted earnings grew 4% but were short. Also Thursday, Celgene beat lowered analyst views. AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views. Verizon (VZ) missed on EPS but topped on revenue. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped views, but fell on a patent ruling vs. its blockbuster arthritis fighter Remicade.President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imported large washing machines and parts, and up to 30% on solar panels. The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%. First Solar (FSLR), which initially popped, closed up less than 1%. China-based Daqo New Energy (DQ) lost about 4%.U.S. crude topped $65 a barrel and Brent edged above $71 briefly as oil inventories continued to drop. Oilfield service provider Halliburton (HAL) crushed quarterly forecasts, with international growth outpacing domestic growth. Shares shot up 5%, clearing a buy point.

But shares fell nearly 6% as markets priced in the possibility that GE would fully spin off the business.Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue. Northrop gave strong 2018 guidance and lifted its dividend. Raytheon and GD said orders and backlog were strong. All three defense firms surged to record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion. Negotiations with Indonesia about ownership of its massive Grasberg mine are progressing but haven't erased uncertainty about the company's outlook.Casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) both put up Q4 results that beat on the top and bottom line, helped by the rebound in Macau, the world's largest gaming market. Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson cited an acceleration in the mass gaming market in the Chinese administrative region, the only area of the nation where gambling is legal. But Wynn shares plunged Friday, erasing nearly all its weekly gains, on a report of allegations of serious sexual misconduct by CEO Steve Wynn.Ford Motor (F) saw EPS climb 30% to 39 cents as revenue grew 15% to $41.3 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of 42 cents on sales of $37.5 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Ford is buying mobility startups Autonomic and TransLoc.

Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) delivered strong results and generally affirmed ambitious 2018 financial targets, sending shares to a fresh 52-week high.New Oriental Education (EDU) logged 8% EPS growth, short of views, while a 37% sales gain to $467.2 million narrowly beat fiscal Q2 estimates. Student enrollments grew 43%. The China-based after-school education provider offered guided Q3 sales views higher, but shares tumbled, though they recouped some losses by the end of the week. TAL Education (TAL), meanwhile, surged nearly 18% on Thursday, retaking their 50-day, after Q3 EPS jumped 168% on 66% revenue growth to $433 million. TAL enrollments swelled 85%.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) beat on both their top and bottom lines. Fiscal Q1 earnings per share jumped 95% at TD Ameritrade as revenue expanded 46% to $1.26 billion. It sees full-year earnings of  $2.55-$3.05 excluding items, vs. expectations for $2.69. TD Ameritrade also said it will allow customers to buy and sell certain ETFs 24/7, five days a week. E-Trade reported Q4 EPS up 49% and revenue up 25% to $637 million. It'll also acquire one million retail brokerage accounts from Capital One Financial (COF) with about $18 billion in assets. Shares of both online brokers fell modestly for the week.Millennial-focused free investing app Robinhood will let people buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with zero commission.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) reported adjusted income of $2.54 per share on $892 million in sales, rising a respective 25% and 18%. Both metrics topped expectations. But the robot-surgery gear maker gave cautious guidance.Homebuilder NVR (NVR) missed Q4 earnings and sales views. Shares tumbled 11%, crashing through its 10-week line for the first time in more than a year in huge volume. Along with DOJ subpoena of the mortgage unit of Lennar (LEN) and a bigger-than-expected new-home sales decline, other homebuilders also suffered notable declines.

But a new report puts the Patriot's effectiveness in doubt.X Missile experts told the New York Times that it's likely none of the five Patriot defense batteries hit the Scud missile. Instead, the missile probably traveled over the missile defense system's interceptors and fell apart on its own, near Riyadh's airport.""You shoot five times at this missile and they all miss? That's shocking,"" Laura Grego, a missile expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told the New York Times. ""That's shocking because this system is supposed to work.Raytheon didn't immediately have a response to the report.Shares closed down 0.7% at 185.54 on the stock market today. Lockheed Martin (LMT), which is looking to sell its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to Saudi Arabia, finished 0.6% lower.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important.

X As you try to find the best stocks to buy and watch, be sure to pay attention to relative price strength.IBD's unique RS Rating tracks technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that identifies how a stock's price action over the trailing 52 weeks compares to other publicly traded companies. Decades of market research reveals that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains typically have an 80 or higher RS Rating in the early stages of their moves. See if Raytheon can continue to show renewed price strength and clear that threshold. Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineRaytheon broke out earlier, but is now approximately 4% below the prior 222.92 entry from a flat base. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new pattern to take shape. Also understand that the most recent consolidation is a later-stage base, and those involve more risk. While sales growth fell last quarter from 8% to 4%, EPS grew 27%, up from -9% in the prior report. Raytheon holds the No. 23 rank among its peers in the Aerospace/Defense industry group.

So they are moving to a ground-based solution there,"" said Tom Karako, a senior fellow and missile defense analyst at CSIS.The new radar will be deployed in Hawaii and have a 180-degree field of view toward North Korea, he said. He added that there might be a second radar planned for somewhere in the Pacific.Raytheon shares closed down 1% on the stock market today.

Trump later tweeted there ""is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.""However, satellite images have since shown North Korea upgrading the plutonium production reactor and support buildings at its Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center.While all the defense contractors picked have extensive missile defense experience, Lockheed has scored some key radar contracts recently.Lockheed is currently building the Long Range Discrimination Radar in Alaska. But Karako said the radar is too far north to see missiles headed to Hawaii from North Korea.Lockheed is also reportedly building its long-range radar for two of Japan's planned Aegis Ashore missile defense systems.Despite the large price tag, the X-Band Radar replacement can't be used against other emerging threats, such as hypersonic boost glide vehicles or a cruise missile attack, Karako said.""The Pentagon's missile defense review isn't out yet, but it was specifically tasked by Congress to look at the full range of missiles,"" he said.To counter sophisticated emerging threats from near-peer adversaries like China and Russia, space-based sensors will be needed as ground-based radars are limited by the curvature of the earth.Still, ground-based radars like the one slated for Hawaii will still be necessary as they augment space-based radars' coverage.Space-based sensors have been discussed by every administration since President Reagan's but haven't made it off the drawing board.""I predict this year a decision will be made,"" Karako saidYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To WatchThis U.S. Ally Buys Boeing Spy Planes As China Tension Heats UpAir Force Urges This New Hypersonic Weapons Mindset, Faster RolloutAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense Works

25,RTN,"SEATTLE — New Zealand will buy four Boeing (BA) P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare planes, as the U.S. ally steps up operations in the South China Sea.The P-8s, which will replace New Zealand's P-3 Orion fleet, will cost $1.6 billion and include training. They will be ready for operations starting in 2023.The order comes as New Zealand and other U.S. allies look to counter China's more aggressive stance in the region.Boeing stock rose 2.2% to 341.92 on the stock market today, still below its 50-day moving average.The U.S. Navy is the biggest customer for the P-8 and has 120 planes on order. But international sales can help keep costs down.""What we are doing is bundling U.S. Navy and international customers together so the U.S. Navy and the international customers get that lower unit price,"" Stephen Tripp, senior manager of global sales for the P-8 told IBD during a visit to the factory in June.  ""It's a challenge to bring new customers in a time that works for them clearly but also that works well in this collective bargaining.""Lower costs aren't the only advantage as tensions rise in the South China Sea and with Russia.""Everyone flying those jets work perfectly well with one another — compatible, interoperable; working together, all flying P-8s can share maintenance facilities,"" Tripp said.More foreign sales are expected soon and Tripp said his goal was to have two to three more customers signed up in the next two years.South Korea picked the P-8 in a contract worth $1.71 billion, a Boeing official told Reuters last month.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTripp said it was difficult to determine the exact timing of foreign orders as the State Department and Congress must approve all foreign military sales before the contracts become official.

But military hardware sales to Turkey are in question as Congress considers blocking the sale of the new Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 jet.The P-8 is a modified Boeing 737-800ERX, replacing Lockheed's P-3 Orion turboprop. The aircraft uses a high-power radar to scan for ships and submarines and a modified radar from the Boeing EA-18 Growler to scan for targets on land or near the coasts.Once a submarine is spotted, the aircraft can deploy sonobuoys to track and relay information about the location of hostile submarines. Or the plane can launch weapons like the Raytheon (RTN) Mark 54 Lightweight Hybrid Torpedo or Boeing's AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship missile. Winged torpedoes with a GPS guidance system are in development.Demand for anti-submarine capabilities is rising as China has accelerated its submarine building, increasing tensions in the South China Sea. Russia used submarines to launch strikes in Syria and has increased submarine activity in Europe.But the P-8 also assists in search and rescue efforts. It was involved in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, MH370, in 2014 and Argentina's missing submarine in 2017.The body of the jet is built in Boeing's current 737 production line in Renton, but with some modifications like a thicker skin, stiffer wings and a bomb bay door. Then the jet is flown down the street to the P-8 facility near Boeing Field.There it gets militarized and completes final testing.

30,RTN,"The American public's first sign that space warfare is being waged won't be giant explosions lighting up the sky or X-Wing fighters crashing to the ground. Instead, everyday conveniences that we take for granted would be disrupted, such as ATMs and streaming videos.X But the world's most powerful military could be crippled if an enemy destroyed or disabled critical space infrastructure as part of a space war. Navigation, guided missiles and missile-warning alerts rely on GPS satellites. Critical intelligence comes from spy satellites. Drones, Navy ships and infantry grunts use communications satellites. And the disruption of your mundane comforts, which increasingly rely on satellite communications, eventually could grind daily life to a halt.""Our entire global economy and our way of life (are) enabled by space capabilities,"" said Col. Shawn Fairhurst, deputy director at Air Force Space Command.Despite the success of American companies like SpaceX in the new space race, the U.S. is more vulnerable than ever to war in space. Russia and China are ramping up their offensive potential. And while the effects of space warfare on worldwide commerce would hurt the U.S. and its adversaries alike, the U.S. military's unmatched global footprint and forward-deployed posture mean it is especially dependent on space-based assets.IBD'S TAKE: A new Space Age is dawning as billionaires like Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos look to explore deeper into the final frontier and make space exploration and commercial development more affordable.  So what was once a key enabler of U.S. dominance – famously on display during the first Gulf War when precision weapons and space-based imaging left the world awe-struck – is becoming a channel that adversaries can exploit to gain the upper hand.Russia and China ""are building those capabilities to challenge the United States of America, to challenge our allies and to change the balance of power in the world,"" Gen. John Hyten, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in December. ""We cannot allow that to happen.""On Feb. 21, Susan Gordon, the principal deputy director of national intelligence, warned that China and Russia have laser weapons designed to damage space-based sensors. Two days later, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein predicted that it will only be ""a matter of years"" before space warfare is waged.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportAmid the growing alarm about a war in space, the Pentagon plans to pour more money into space capabilities. Companies like Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) — which make rockets, satellites and other space assets — are poised to receive those dollars.Space was once seen as a sanctuary from military activity, even as it served as a stage for Cold War bragging rights. The Outer Space Treaty, enacted in 1967, outlaws the use of nuclear weapons in space and prohibits testing weapons or building military bases on the moon or other celestial bodies. Since then, satellites have enveloped the planet, while the International Space Station has been maintained as a sign of global scientific cooperation.But China and Russia have made no secret of their space warfare ambitions and could have anti-satellite weapons ready for combat in the next few years, according to the latest threat assessment report from the U.S. intelligence community, released Feb. 13.The threat has been growing for years. In 2007, China shocked the world when it fired a ground-based missile to destroy an old weather satellite in what was widely seen as a test of an anti-satellite system.Last month's U.S. intelligence report said China has been training with such ground-based anti-satellite missiles, and Russia is developing similar technology.Blowing up a satellite carries risks for the attacker, as it would create a massive debris field of perhaps 10,000 pieces and could put its own satellites in jeopardy too.But the intelligence report noted less blunt methods, such as Russia's ""experiment satellites"" now in orbit. These satellites have official missions like inspection, refueling and repair, but could be turned into weapons that stop short of destroying their targets.China has a satellite with an extendable robotic arm that it says can be used to collect space junk but likely can also be used to cripple working satellites. And Russia reportedly has highly maneuverable satellites secretly launched into orbit in 2015 that can be used to bump into other satellites.The U.S. isn't helpless. It has potentially dual-use technology that could be given offensive missions too. Satellites that can dock with existing satellites to refuel them could be turned into weapons by ordering them to bump enemy satellites out of orbit or equipping them with jammers or lasers, says Theresa Hitchens, senior research associate at the University of Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies. China has been working on similar technology.Northrop also provides anti-jamming capabilities but warns that ""only a very small amount of defense satellite communications are secure and protected against intercept and jamming threats."" The company declined to provide additional information about its anti-jamming and other defense capabilities for military or commercial satellites.Besides active defenses, the U.S. can make individual satellites less appealing as targets during a war in space.One way would be building large satellites used by many nations, so any attack would be seen as aggression against a potential coalition. Another way would be to develop more maneuverable satellites that could avoid collisions from other satellites, missiles or space debris.The military is also looking at deploying greater quantities of smaller satellites that spread out capabilities, instead of the current model of building large satellites that make ""juicy targets,"" according to Hyten.The U.S. can employ ground-based jammers, but they are only effective when the targeted satellite is in range. Lasers could also be used to temporarily blind or permanently disable a satellite, but the technology isn't mature enough yet to be effective against a large satellite.The bottom line is that the U.S. has much more to lose in space combat than its adversaries do.""We don't have good options for fighting back because this is an asymmetrical situation,"" as potential adversaries aren't as reliant on space systems, Hitchens said. ""It's not a tit-for-tat thing like it is for nuclear weapons.""Policymakers are aware of the threat and are working to address it. The National Defense Strategy released in January emphasized the need to ""prioritize investments in resilience, reconstitution, and operations to assure our space capabilities"" as ""attacks against our critical defense, government, and economic infrastructure must be anticipated.""In its fiscal 2019 budget request, the Air Force is seeking an 8% increase in space funding, the second straight year of significant increases to the space portfolio. The budget focuses on building more jam-resistant GPS satellites, while improving systems for missile warnings and situational awareness in space.Perhaps just as important as more funding and hardware is figuring out what kind of response an attack would merit. With no established norms of space warfare, it may be difficult to prevent an attack from spiraling out of control.For example, China could use an anti-satellite missile as a warning shot to tell the U.S. to back down and de-escalate a situation, Hitchens says. But the result could be the exact opposite. The U.S. could see the move as a sign of aggression and attack the missile's launch site, escalating the situation into an attack on the Chinese homeland.Another wrinkle is the fast-growing commercial space industry, with SpaceX showing it can deliver large military and spy satellites via its new Falcon Heavy rocket. SpaceX, Boeing and OneWeb are among the numerous companies with plans to launch thousands of satellites into low Earth orbit in the coming years.The new constellations about to enter space would provide space-based internet services as well as surveillance and tracking. Such capabilities are useful to companies that want to keep tabs on shipping fleets, but in theory they could help the military too.""If a commercial system is being deliberately used to provide the military with capabilities, in the time of war it's a legitimate target,"" Hitchens said.So what happens if China and Russia use their space assets on a commercial satellite? Is that an act of war?""That is a policy issue that is being actively discussed,"" said Stephen Flanagan, a senior political analyst at Rand Corp.While outer space is itself a vacuum, any fight there won't happen in a vacuum.Fairhurst says a war won't likely start in space. Instead, wars that start on the ground or at sea would extend into space.So options range from economic sanctions to a proportional response in a different domain, like an air- or ground-based attack.""We aren't locked into an answer,"" Fairhurst said. ""But the bottom line is that as a nation we have a right to defend ourselves if attacked. And just because we are attacked in space doesn't mean we have to respond in space.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Boeing And Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In SpaceSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsIn This Space Race, Here's Where SpaceX May Not Come In First

35,RTN,"Tesla kept charging higher and continued to work on its new base, while software companies also helped sustain the Nasdaq composite's leadership in stocks today. Meanwhile, the market presents at least four new reasons why investors should stay bullish on growth stocks.The tech-rich Nasdaq composite gained more than 0.5%.At that level, the premier index for growth stocks has now climbed 509% from its March 2009 low of 1265.The S&P 500, hampered by sell-offs in the ship transport, meat, oil drilling, mortgage services, and aerospace and defense industries, was mostly flat after rising nearly 0.3% intraday. The Dow Jones industrial average edged about 0.2% lower. Volume was running mildly higher vs. the same time on Monday on both main exchanges.Kirby (KEX), part of IBD's fourth-ranked Transport-Ship industry group, sailed sharply lower.

Watch for a new potential base to form.Meanwhile, futures traders are counting a virtually 100% probability that the Federal Reserve will execute another quarter-point hike in short-term interest rates on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank has been raising rates since December 2015, when the fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%.Tesla (TSLA), as noted in this recent Stock Market Today column, is still fashioning the right side of a brand-new base. However, the stock is still feeling the overhead supply of sellers near 350, a critical level of upside price resistance. At 341, the stock is now less than 13% below its all-time peak of 389.61.Sentiment appears to be warming to the high possibility that the electric-vehicle pioneer is getting past serious difficulty in ramping up Model 3 production. On Tuesday, CEO Elon Musk announced a 9% cut in total staff, centered on salaried employees. A company memo to employees said that no production associates got laid off.The company seeks to get profitable while also meeting the tremendous demand for its entry-level all-electric car. The planned staff cuts should reduce total headcount to 37,000.Tesla shares show a terrible Relative Price Strength Rating of 25 on a scale of 1 to 99. But as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B on a scale of A to E. A rating above the neutral C grade means that over the past 13 weeks, institutions have likely been accumulating the stock on net.In IBD's automakers group, only Ferrari (RACE) and General Motors (GM) show better Accumulation/Distribution ratings than Tesla at A- each. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see Tesla swinging from a net loss of $6.82 a share in 2018 to a net profit of $2.46 a share in 2019. Both estimates have recently moved up.Meanwhile, the market is showing at least four new reasons why the stock market's six-year bull run (after a 20%-plus correction in 2011) may have more room to run.One, market breadth continues to improve. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been climbing for five straight weeks. This means that more stocks are advancing than declining. This also means that more high-rated stocks stand a chance of breaking out.Two, the new highs list remains robust. As seen in Monday's IBD-screened list, a total 325 stocks on the Nasdaq and NYSE hit 52-week or all-time highs, swamping the 42 names making new lows. More stocks hitting new highs boost the probability of breakouts.Three, leading stocks are outperforming the major indexes.Among the top 10-ranked names in the IBD 50, the average gain approached 3%.Four, investor sentiment is not wildly optimistic. On Tuesday, the put-call volume ratio stood at 0.68. During the March 2000 tech market top, this ratio of bearish put options to bullish call options sank beneath 0.4. Such a low ratio pointed to a severe evaporation of bearish sentiment among options traders.The Investors Intelligence report on newsletter editors also shows the bullish ratio at 52.9%, well below its mid-January peak of 66%.

41,RTN,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could be the first missile defense system to target intercontinental ballistic missiles in the key boost phase, according to a report from Aviation Week, as North Korea develops missiles that could reach deeper into U.S. territory.X Last week, Pyongyang launched an ICBM that went higher any other missile it's fired, with the apogee indicating an ability to hit the U.S. East Coast and the West Coast.But Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said last month that it's possible for the F-35 to shoot down nuclear missiles from North Korea or Iran with its Raytheon (RTN) AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) just seconds after takeoff.""It's like an act of God,"" Hunter said. ""You have F-35s, you have AMRAAMs, and you can shoot these things down as they go up.""Boeing's (BA) F-15 could also be used if it had the right sensors but the stealthy fifth-generation F-35 already has key sensors installed, Aviation Week noted.In particular, Northrop Grumman (NOC) has developed the F-35's infrared AN/AAQ-37 sensors that serve as an aircraft and missile warning system and the jet's fire control radar. The company has been testing the sensors on ballistic missiles for several years, according to the report.Tom Lawhead, head of the Air Force Joint Strike Fighter Integration Office, agrees with Hunter and told Aviation Week that the technology is feasible with the F-35. Northrop would need three years from starting integration to achieve full missile defense potential.Northrop has tested a ground-based system coupled with a radar-enabled aircraft in 2014 as a proof of concept, and Missile Defense Agency Deputy Director Rear Adm.

A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Boost-phase defense has been the goal of missile defense experts for decades, as existing systems are geared toward latter phases of a flight path.Raytheon's Patriot system is useful against conventional weapons and works by intercepting missiles in the low atmosphere in their final approach toward the target, or terminal phase.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is designed to shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase as well.But nuclear missiles will deliver multiple warheads and decoys making terminal defenses less effective.The Air Force has tested a laser that's mounted in a Boeing 747 — to shoot down missiles in their boost phase — but the program was canceled for being too expensive. Drones could do the same job, but analysts aren't sure the technology is mature enough.RELATED: Report Doubts Effectiveness Of Raytheon's Patriot In Recent AttackAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksRaytheon Hits Buy Zone As Romania Buys Patriot; U.S. Arms Sales SurgeThese Defense Giants Poised To Gain From New Missile Defense MovesDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system is designed to intercept ballistic missiles in midcourse flight.The money would also pay for 50 more Lockheed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptors. THAAD, which is designed to shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase, is currently deployed in South Korea, Guam and Alaska.The additional funds would also cover 16 Standard Missile-3 Block IIA interceptors made by Raytheon as well as missile detection radar upgrades and intelligence capabilities, among other items.""This request supports additional efforts to detect, defeat, and defend against any North Korean use of ballistic missiles against the United States, its deployed forces, allies, or partners,"" Trump wrote in a letter to Congress.Boeing shares closed up 0.8% on the stock market today.

""Even Emirates is under more pressure than it's accustomed to. But Dubai is at least a sizable local market; Abu Dhabi is much smaller.""One potential order to watch is a 20-plane deal for the A380 from Emirates, which Bloomberg reported is in talks with Airbus. But Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, said delivery time lines are key, as Emirates last year pushed back the delivery of 12 jets.""No one else wants this plane,"" he said.Low-cost Gulf carriers, however, are faring better than their larger peers, and Kaplan said Flydubai could order some narrowbody jets, noting that single-aisle demand has been stronger vs. twin-aisle overall.Meanwhile, Bombardier is bringing a C Series 300 for display, just weeks after Airbus took a majority stake in the struggling narrowbody business. Any new C Series orders would put pressure on Boeing as it considers building a middle-of-the-market plane.Boeing sees a ""pretty significant"" market opportunity and is ""really getting deep"" into further discussions with more than 50 customers, CFO Greg Smith told analysts at Baird's Global Industrial Conference Wednesday.Business jet orders could be big at the show as lower oil prices have helped boost private air travel,  said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer for Tigress Financial. That could help General Dynamics' Gulfstream corporate-jet business.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.On the defense side, Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon (RTN) and others will show off their wares, with the Pentagon putting Lockheed's F-22 and F-16 on display.Missile defense orders from the region are rising as tensions heat up with Iran. Last month, Lockheed said Saudi Arabia ""seems intent on moving quickly"" with its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense order.Regional conflicts have kept defense spending up, despite low oil prices, Aboulafia said, particularly for precision weapons, which are seeing heavy use.Aboulafia also wonders if the United Arab Emirates will order Eurofighter's Typhoon, Dassault's Rafale or Boeing's Super Hornet as a stopgap before it can get U.S. authorization to buy the more advanced F-35 from Lockheed in the next five years. Aircraft with intelligence and surveillance capabilities will also be in demand, he added.But all defense orders are government to government and need approval from the State Department and Congress.Shares of Boeing fell 1.1% in the stock market today.

Instead, it will likely help boost public support for increased military spending after a huge bump in the fiscal 2018 and 2019 budgets.Still, Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, believes being included in the ""Top Gun"" sequel is good marketing.He also thinks the decision may indicate which aircraft the Navy feels is emblematic of the service.""Most interesting angle is the Navy mind set,"" he said in an interview.

52,RTN,"The F-35 is preparing for key operational tests that will allow Lockheed Martin (LMT) to begin full-rate production on the stealth fighter and massively boost its growth.XAcquisition rules require the completion of combat testing certification, or Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E), before Lockheed can crank out F-35s at full tilt.The F-35 underwent cold-weather testing at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, in February, as part pre-IOT&E activity. Then last month, the F-35 went through more pre-IOT&E tests at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., to evaluate close air support and combat search and rescue capabilities.Actual IOT&E, which includes rigorous combat testing, is scheduled to start in September (more than a year behind schedule) and finish by May 2019.

The company has been steadily boosting its production rate, but getting to full output would nearly double the pace.Lockheed delivered 66 F-35s last year, and sees production and delivery of 91 jets this year.

53,RTN,"THE PENTAGON — The Air Force needs to change how it thinks about hypersonic technology and will announce within weeks a faster timeline for development and fielding, a top acquisition official said, after Lockheed Martin (LMT) received a hypersonic weapons contract earlier this month.XThe Pentagon has been under fire for years over sluggish development and acquisition practices, while the U.S. sees adversaries like China and Russia speed new weapons along.

And China is expected to field a weapon sometime in the next decade.But Air Force acquisition chief Will Roper thinks U.S. development of hypersonic technology can be sped up, with an initiative to be unveiled soon.""I'm not ready to say how much the acceleration is going to be — has a chance to be significant,"" he told reporters at a roundtable at the Pentagon Friday.Hypersonic weapons are being designed to travel at five times the speed of sound, rendering their targets nearly defenseless, and analysts believe that hypersonic weapons have the potential to be the most disruptive battlefield technology since the advent of stealth.""It's time to think about operationalizing them,"" Roper said of hypersonics. ""It's not to say it hasn't been treated seriously, but there is a very different mindset if you're moving towards 'we need to have an operational capability' vs. 'we're working on science and technology.'""Roper said that means getting out to do aggressive testing and being OK with failure.Lockheed shares dipped 0.4% to 32.84 on the stock market today, closing below their 200-day line for the first time since October 2016.

70,RTN,"A couple of top-performing defense and aerospace ETFs have strikingly similar charts, yet their portfolios are significantly different.X SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense (XAR) and iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) are both forming flat bases and are near buy points. SPDR Aerospace's chart shows a potential buy point at 83.05, while iShares Aerospace & Defense has a buy point at 184.70. It edged above that level Thursday but fell below it Friday in the general market sell-off.Both ETFs share the industry titans such as Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN). The two funds have about 35 stocks each, but the portfolios are structured differently.SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense is an equal-weighted index in which small caps such as aircraft components maker Triumph Group (TGI) and rocket builder Orbital ATK (OA) have as much weighting as Northrop and Boeing, with market capitalization of $53 billion and $160 billion, respectively.IBD's TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.By comparison, iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF uses the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace and Defense Index, in which Boeing has 10.5% of the weighting and Triumph Group only about 1%. The eight smallest components account for less than 1% each.Regardless of structure, the two ETFs have performed in a remarkably similar manner. Both have five-year average annual gains of about 24%, three-year average gains of about 18% (through Oct. 31) and year-to-date gains of around 30%.Most of the major defense stocks have performed quite well in 2017, and are trading near all-time highs.Defense stocks usually perform well even in times of peace, because defense spending rarely drops. This year, operations in Syria and Iraq against ISIS are winding down, but North Korea's fast-moving missile program poses new security threats for the U.S. and its allies. U.S. forces remain in battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan.Lockheed builds the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, which can shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Raytheon builds the Patriot missile defense system. President Trump is seeking an additional $4 billion for missile defense programs amid rising tensions with North Korea.Commercial aviation is another major factor in these ETFs, and that business continues to roll on rising orders for more-efficient jetliners, a trend reinforced in this month's Dubai air show.""The order strength, and positive headlines against more modest expectations, at the Dubai airshow provide additional evidence of the strength in the commercial (plane) cycle,"" Canaccord Genuity analysts Ken Herbert and Jamaine Aggrey wrote in a report.

71,RTN,"It will cost more than a trillion dollars to improve America's nuclear forces, according to a new estimate, but analysts argue that the Pentagon can get by with less.XThe Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday put the price tag at $1.2 trillion dollars through 2046, just 6% of total defense spending over 30 years but 20% higher than its estimate three years ago. The bill includes about $800 billion to make incremental upgrades to existing weapons near the end of their usable life spans, and about $400 billion for modernization efforts like the new Northrop Grumman (NOC) B-21 bomber.The total figure is actually $1.7 trillion with inflation included, noted Tom Collina, director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund, which is focused on reducing nuclear weapons.In addition to the B-21, the Pentagon has already award initial contracts to other defense giants like Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) for everything from nuclear-armed missiles to nuclear-armed submarines.The massive cost estimate for the nuclear force comes as the Defense Department faces other big-ticket priorities such as Lockheed's F-35 and pushing the Navy's fleet back above 300 ships.But the bill doesn't have to be that high for taxpayers and the CBO offered suggestions on how to lower costs. Here are some:America's nuclear force has for decades been based on the triad of land-, air- and sea-based weapons. But getting rid of the land-based ICBM leg, would save $120 billion though 2046. Of that, roughly $90 billion would come from canceling a replacement program. In August, the Air Force awarded Boeing and Northrop preliminary design phase contracts for it.Former Defense Secretary William Perry and retired Gen. James Cartwright, former vice chair of the Joint Chiefs, wrote a letter to President Trump on behalf of the Ploughshares Fund, arguing that ICBMs create instability and increase the possibility of accidental nuclear war.""Our ICBMs are in danger of being launched in the case of another false alarm (we have experienced three to date), thereby starting a civilization-ending nuclear war by accident.""But during his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Defense Secretary James Mattis backed the development of new ICBMs.Perry and Cartwright support the building of ""an appropriate number of new, nuclear-armed submarines as the most survivable leg of the deterrent"" and new bombers that also have conventional applications.Going without the new  Long Range Standoff weapon would save $28 billion through 2046. Last month, the Air Force also awarded Lockheed and Raytheon preliminary design phase contracts for the LRSO.While CBO warned the lack of cruise missiles ""would diminish the capability of U.S. nuclear forces, particularly for limited nuclear strikes,"" Collina said the LRSO creates more instability as Russia can't tell if the air-launched missiles are nuclear or conventional and could spark a nuclear response to a conventional weapon.""Have conventional weapons  do the job instead,"" he suggested. ""We have conventional cruise missiles that can take out air defenses. We don't have to use nuclear missiles.""IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.The Defense Department is currently reassessing its nuclear strategy as part of its Nuclear Posture Review, which will be sent to the White House by the end of the year.Collina noted that the U.S. can still maintain plenty of bang for fewer bucks.""The core of our power are conventional forces that can be deployed and project power around the world,"" he said. ""We can still be a nuclear power and have way fewer nuclear weapons than we have today.""Boeing shares rose 0.2% to 258.50 on the stock market today, still in buy range. Lockheed fell 0.5%, just below buy zone, Raytheon edged up less than 0.1%, Northrop lost 0.45% and General Dynamics eased 0.7%.RELATED:Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

Sales at the Integrated Defense Systems division, which includes the Patriot missile defense system, rose 4% to $1.4 billion.Backlog at the end of the  quarter was $36.7 billion, up from $35.7 billion at the end of Q3 2016. Raytheon booked $145 million in order for the Tomahawk cruise missile and $102 million for the Standard Missile 3.""Global customer demand drove an increase in our backlog, which positions us well for continued growth in 2018,"" CEO Thomas Kennedy said in the earnings release.Outlook: Raytheon now sees 2017 EPS of $7.45-$7.55, up from its earlier outlook of $7.35-$7.50, and narrowed its full-year sales outlook to $25.3 billion-$25.6 billion, from a prior guidance of $25.1 billion-$25.6 billion.

75,RTN,"Major indexes recouped some of Wednesday's moderate losses while investors awaited a deluge of quarterly results from big-cap tech firms. Biotechs slid on Celgene's (CELG) 18% plunge following disappointing Q3 results.XIBD's biotech-biomedical industry subgroup fell more than 1%, joining military defense, ethical drug, hospital and medical software firms on the downside.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was up around 0.1%, lagging a 0.4% lift for the Dow Jones industrial average and a nearly 0.3% rise for the S&P 500. The S&P SmallCap 600 padded its early gains, rallying nearly 0.6%. Volume decreased vs. the same time on both main exchanges.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, quietly positioned itself for a potential rebound back above the critical 50-day moving average. Shares rose nearly 0.7% to 157.42, edging back above a prior flat-base buy point at 156.75.The megacap tech leader, which reports fiscal Q4 results late Monday, still holds a solid gain since it initially broke out of a first-stage bottoming base on Jan. 6-9, a cup-with-handle showing a 118.12 entry. Shares have rallied as much as 39% since then.The Street expects Q4 earnings to rise 12% to $1.87 a share, extending a streak of low double-digit EPS growth to a third quarter. After that, growth is expected to accelerate; fiscal year 2018 profit is expected to rise 24% to $11.15 a share.Apple's IBD ratings have improved since the start of the year.On Jan. 1, the iPhone and iPad giant showed a lousy Earnings Per Share Rating of 45 and a Relative Price Strength Rating of 59. Today, they've risen to 85 and 77, respectively, on a scale of 1 to 99.Apple's example in 2017 is a good lesson in how a stock chart can help an investor spot an excellent turnaround situation. Four quarters ago, the company posted a 15% drop in Q4 earnings per share and a 9% slump in revenue (its third straight year-over-year drop). With such results, and a lagging stock price, no wonder Apple's IBD ratings plunged into mediocrity.However, under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook, the company continues to create innovative and popular new products. The company also has set a goal of doubling its services-related revenue by decade's end.Sales have risen 3%, 5% and 7% in the past three quarters. The Street sees Q4 sales rising 8%, to $50.79 billion, continuing a slow-yet-steady acceleration in top-line growth.Fiscal year 2018, which ends in September next year, could be even better. Apple's revenue is seen increasing 17% to $266.6 billion, up from an expected 5% gain in the just-ended fiscal year 2017.Celgene reported a respectable 21% jump in Q3 profit to $1.91 a share, and that beat the consensus estimate by 2%. But perhaps Wall Street had been hoping for a bigger beat. Meanwhile, a 10% gain on the top line to $3.29 billion marked the weakest year-over-year increase in more than four years.Did Celgene give investors any sell signals before Thursday's tumble? In fact, yes.Back in June, the cancer treatment specialist bolted out of a somewhat lopsided cup base at 127.74, then rallied 15% to as high as 147.17. But a sharp gap down in heavy trading on Oct. 5 gave a strong hint at a change in the character of the action.Just days later on Oct. 13, Celgene then tripped below its 50-day moving average. Volume ballooned 40% above the 50-day average, a sign that institutions were locking in gains.IBD'S TAKE: In some cases, a great stock will punctuate the end of a rally with multiple sell signals, covered frequently in IBD's Investor's Corner and daily market columns. Check out this article on how to spot multiple sell signals to lock in profits and raise cash to maximize your portfolio return.Fortinet (FTNT) may be working on a  new handle on a double-bottom base. The security software firm is an industry peer of Palo Alto Networks (PANW), currently a member of Leaderboard, IBD's premium stockpicking and chart annotating service.Fortinet, slated to report Q3 results after the close today, has moved past a 39.61 buy point within a 13-week double-bottom base. In this base, the second low of 35.44 undercut the first low of 35.87. Fortinet broke out on Oct. 18 in heavy volume and remains in buy range.The buy zone goes up to 41.59.Meanwhile, since Fortinet has not yet climbed to new highs, the possibility of an alternate buy point exists.Notice on the daily chart how the stock has pulled back mildly over the past several sessions. A good handle features such action, running lower along the lows as the stock trades lightly. In a proper handle, the decline usually never exceeds more than 12%. However, a handle must also be a minimum five trading days long; Fortinet has pulled back just four sessions.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the midcap stock sports a good Composite Rating of 94 on a scale of 1 to 99. Despite a mediocre RS Rating, the up/down volume ratio of 1.4 points to heavy-volume buying by institutions over the past 50 sessions.Other top-rated stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group include Nice (NICE) (96 Composite, but thinly trade), Symantec (SYMC) (79 Composite, but also posting a big turnaround in 2017), and Qualys (QLYS) (94 Composite, testing support near the 50-day moving average following an Aug. 3 breakout past a flat base at 44.45).Elsewhere in the stock market, certain consumer-spending plays thrived.Group 1 Automotive (GPI) broke out past a 75.52 buy point in a long cup with handle as shares rose 10% to 77.82. Volume is running more than four times its 50-day average. The buy zone goes up to 79.30.Earnings rose 14% to $2.23 a share, snapping a two-quarter streak of falling profits. Revenue rose 7% to $3.01 billion, matching the biggest increase in seven quarters.On the downside, Raytheon (RTN) undercut its 50-day moving average in heavy volume since late June as shares in the missile maker dropped more than 4% to 180.59. The stock has rallied as much as 32% since clearing a flat-base pattern at 143.49 on Nov. 9 last year.Raytheon reported a 7% increase in Q3 earnings to $1.97 a share, beating views. But it's also the third quarter of single-digit EPS growth in the past four quarters. Revenue rose 4% to $6.28 billion.A continued dive beneath the 50-day line would trigger a key IBD sell signal.Raytheon faced such a challenge soon after the Nov. 9 breakout last year. The stock spiked through its 50-day moving average on both Dec. 12 and on Jan. 26 this year, but immediately rebounded.RELATED:Know The Cup With Handle; What Makes This Chart Pattern Special?This Psychological Market Indicator Just Made A Mini-SpikeWhat Is The I In CAN SLIM?How To Find Excellent Stocks Like Nvidia: Begin Your Search Here

90,RTN,"Defense contractors hanging tough in the stock market correction are your stocks to watch this week. Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and L3 Technologies (LLL) have relative strength lines that are at or near highs. Our spotlight on military contractors comes as President Trump on Friday signed a two-year budget bill that will provide the military an additional $165 billion in defense spending.X It's important to stress that in the current stock market correction, these are names to watch for future set-ups, not to buy right now. Stocks that hold up well during a downturn may form new bases and be among the first to break out in a new market uptrend.But if the technicals begin to falter, investors should drop them from their watch lists.The relative strength line is the blue line on the charts below, separate from price action. The RS line shows a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Measuring a stock's relative strength is helpful when separating strong stocks from weak ones. An RS line at an all-time high is especially positive.Boeing is primarily a civilian aircraft maker, but it's still a major defense contractor as well. Shares have hit some turbulence amid the broad selloff, but the Dow Jones industrial average stalwart is holding somewhat near its recent peak.

But Trump tweeted later today that the budget didn't fully fund a border wall and lacked a resolution for the DACA program, which he moved to end last year. He signed it anyway, citing national security priorities.Missile defense will get $11.5 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion from the fiscal 2017 budget and more than the $9.5 billion the Missile Defense Agency requested. The figure includes the $2 billion appropriated in December as part of a special supplemental budget deal.The MDA will get $393 million to speed up Boeing's modernization of the kill vehicle in 20 Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System interceptors in Fort Greely, Alaska.Under the proposed budget, Congress approved 24 new Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets, 10 more than the Navy requested.There are also funds for three more Boeing KC-46 tankers, on top of the 15 the Air Force requested. The over-budget and behind schedule tanker has come under fire the past year. Boeing has booked $2.9 billion before taxes, or $1.9 billion after taxes, in charges for cost overruns associated with the tanker, which is based on a 767 airframe.The Army will get $577 million for 17 Boeing AH-64E Apache helicopters, and the Navy will get $501 million for three more Boeing P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft.Boeing shares closed up 0.4% on the stock market today, paring intraday gains sharply after sinking 5.2% Thursday as concerns about a trade war with China hurt prospects for the company's commercial aircraft business.Congress approved $2.9 billion for 20 more F-35s, bringing the total for this fiscal year to 90 planes.The Navy will get eight more of the carrier variant of the fifth-generation jet and the Marines will get four more short take off/vertical landing F-35s as well as two carrier versions. The Air Force didn't get its entire wish list, but will get 56 F-35s in total, just four shy of its 60 request.Northrop is a major subcontractor on the F-35, and United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit makes the engine.The proposed budget now includes $165 million for more Lockheed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense interceptors along with $178 million for Raytheon (RTN) SM -3 interceptors and $137 million for another test of Raytheon's SM-3 Block IIA missile. Both interceptors are for use in Lockheed's Aegis Ashore system.The bill also included 12 more Lockheed C-130J Super Hercules planes for the Air National Guard and the Army National Guard got $108 million for eight Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.Lockheed rose 2.8%, Northrop gained 2.1%, while United Tech fell 1.4%.Along with the increase in F-35s, Congress approved $84 million for six more Northrop MQ-8 Fire Scout unmanned helicopters.The Navy will get $23.8 billion for shipbuilding, up by $2.6 billion from 2017.

93,RTN,"Boeing (BA) has received a $6.56 billion contract to continue managing the U.S. missile defense system intended to stop North Korean or Iranian intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Defense Department said.X The sole-source contract announced Wednesday extends Boeing's management role for six more years, through 2023, and brings its total contract to $12.6 billion. It includes overseeing the addition of 20 ground-based interceptors to the 44 already stationed in California and Alaska.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to perfect a nuclear warhead and a missile that could hit the U.S. mainland, adding to the urgency of U.S. missile defense efforts. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said, ""North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.""Boeing oversees development and support of the network of interceptors, sensors and communications links, sharing funding with subcontractors: Orbital ATK (OA) builds the rocket booster, Raytheon (RTN) makes the hit-to-kill warhead, Northrop Grumman (NOC) provides the battle management system and Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) makes the warhead's in-flight guidance system.The Pentagon released an initial $213.8 million Wednesday as a modification to Boeing's current $6.14 billion management, development and sustainment contract, which expires this year.As the Missile Defense Agency's prime contractor, Boeing will manage the accelerated construction of a new 20-missile field at Fort Greely, Alaska, plus the additional interceptors. Boeing also will oversee development and integration of an upgraded warhead known as the ""Redesigned Kill Vehicle.""Confidence in the $36 billion missile defense system was bolstered last week by a new assessment from the Pentagon's operational testing director based on the successful interception in May of a dummy warhead. The system ""demonstrated the capability to defend the U.S. homeland from a small number"" of ICBMs launched ""with simple countermeasures when the"" U.S. employs ""its full sensors/command and control architecture,"" Robert Behler said in a report to top Pentagon officials.Laura Grego, senior scientist for the Global Security Program of the Union of Concerned Scientists, questioned even that carefully hedged formulation. The system has destroyed ""its target fewer than half the 17 times it has been tested, and its record is not improving over time. Since the 2004 deployment decision, the system has a three-for-nine record,"" including the test in May, she said in an email.On Tuesday, General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that North Korea's capabilities aren't yet as advanced as Kim purports.North Korea has yet to demonstrate essential capabilities for an ICBM that could hit the U.S. mainland, including maneuvering in space, an adequate guidance system and housing that could protect a nuclear warhead from burning up on re-entry.The capability gap provides ""an opening to have"" a conversation with North Korea about a possible missile test freeze, Selva said.While North Korea's nuclear weapons program is the most advanced threat, Trump has vowed to seek new sanctions on Iran for its continued development of ballistic missiles. Iran maintains it has no intention to develop nuclear weapons, and its nuclear program is constrained by its 2015 deal with the U.S. and other world powers.

99,RTN,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) said Wednesday that it would not submit a bid for the Navy's unmanned tanker competition, despite being seen as a major player in the contest.XWe ""made a decision not to bid MQ-25 based on the particular nature of that"" request for proposal, CEO Wes Bush said during the company's Q3 earnings call.The Navy released an official request for proposal for the MQ-25A earlier this month and now the competition is down to Lockheed Martin (LMT), Boeing (BA), and General Atomics. A final contact is expected next year. The Pentagon has earmarked $2.16 billion for the program through fiscal 2021, though the contract's total value would be larger.Northrop, whose Global Hawk helped earn the company prominence in drone technology, was expected to be a formidable bidder for the Navy drone, as its X-47B prototype had been used in Navy technology demonstrations, which even included takeoff and landing operations from an aircraft carrier.But the Navy has scaled back its drone program from its original inception as a strike and surveillance aircraft, with its mission now targeted for aerial refueling.Bush said the decision not to bid wasn't just about winning the contract but looking at the ability to meet all of the requirements. But ""broadly things are going really well"" for the company's unmanned systems, he said, adding that the MQ-4C Triton unmanned intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drone is moving along.Northrop shares jumped 3.7% to close at a record high of 304.75 on the stock market today.Northrop's Q3 earnings rose 10% to $3.68 while sales rose 6% to $6.53 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.92 with revenue of $6.32 billion.Aerospace Systems unit sales rose 11% to $3.1 billion on higher F/A-18 Super Hornet and other manned aircraft sales, including a restricted manned aircraft, which is likely company's secretive B-21 bomber. Mission system sales rose 5% on higher sensor sales for the F-35.Northrop makes the F/A-18's aft/center fuselage section and vertical tails and is also a major subcontractor on Lockheed's F-35.Northrop raised its full-year EPS outlook to $12.90-$13.10 from a prior guidance of $12.10-$12.40. It now sees 2017 sales of $25.5 billion from a prior outlook of $25 billion. The new forecasts are bullish vs. consensus views for EPS of $12.91 on revenue of $12.59 billion.Management also said its acquisition of Orbital ATK (OA) for $9.2 billion will add to Northrop's earnings no later than first full year after the acquisition closes sometime in the first half of 2018.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.General Dynamics (GD) and Boeing also announced Q3 results Wednesday.General Dynamics saw a 7% increase in EPS to $2.52 but revenue dipped 1% to $7.58 billion. Analysts expected EPS of $2.43 on revenue of $7.43. Backlog was $63.9 billion, up 9.2%.Boeing's results beat Wall Street estimates but the company recorded another charge on its KC-46 tanker program for the Air Force.General Dynamics shares fell 2.3%, and Boeing lost 2.85%.Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled for Thursday.Lockheed Martin reported Q3 results that fell short of analyst expectations Tuesday but raised its full year EPS outlook.RELATED: Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingBoeing Beats Q3 Views But Raised Earnings Outlook Implies Weak Q4Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

100,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Raytheon (RTN) are among top defense companies reporting earnings this week as increasing global tensions have helped lift their stocks.XAnalysts expect the F-35 maker's earnings to fall 10% to $3.25 per share but revenue is seen rising 11% to $12.83 billion.F-35 deliveries are skewed to the back-half of the year, giving Lockheed a likely boost in Q3. The company is expected to deliver 66 of the fighters this year, up from 46 in 2016.Missile defense sales should also be a hot topic on the company's conference call for the maker of the THAAD antimissile system.""The pace of inquiries, the depth of the inquiries and intensity are increasing month by month,"" Timothy Cahill, the VP of Integrated Air & Missile Defense told reporters at the annual Association of the United States Army conference earlier this month.Cahill said Lockheed is getting interest from countries, especially in Europe, that didn't have a high priority on missile defense in the past.The U.S. is also focused on increasing missile defense at home. The Defense Department has asked Congress to shift $416 million into missile defense programs like Lockheed's Aegis systems.Lockheed closed Friday at 320, still in buy range from a 308.58 buy point cleared in late September.Northrop Grumman is out Wednesday. Analysts see EPS dipping 3% to $2.92 with revenue up 2.6% to $6.3 billion.The company will likely give updates on its $9.2 billion buyout of Orbital ATK (OA) announced during the quarter.The deal gives helps Northrop expand its missile defense capabilities and catch up to rivals in the market, because Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for Boeing's (BA) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system used by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. It also builds target vehicles for tests.It could also help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system.But Northorp will likely stay quiet about its secretive B-21 bomber. At an Air Force Association breakfast last week, Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said the program is on track and ""marching to acquisitions timelines.""Boeing, General Dynamics (GD) and FLIR (FLIR) are also out Wednesday.Northrop and Boeing shares are just out of buying range, while FLIR is somewhat extended. But General Dynamics, at 213.86, is in a buy zone from a 206 entry.On Thursday, analysts see Raytheon reporting a 6% increase in EPS to $1.90 and a 5% boost in revenue to $6.33 billion.The company has been a big beneficiary of the growing demand for missile defense systems. Raytheon also builds the Patriot, which was purchased by Romania over the summer. A big Patriot contract with Poland has also been signed, while countries in the Middle East and Asia are lining up to buy or upgrade systems.Raytheon is well extended from a May breakout.RELATED: Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingTech, Industrial, Medical, Consumer Giants Top Investing Action PlanDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News
"
101,RTN,"The most disruptive battlefield technology since the advent of stealth may be just a few years away, and the U.S. is locked in a race with Russia and China to develop it first.XHypersonic weapons are being designed to travel at five times the speed of sound, rendering their targets nearly defenseless and promising to rewrite battle plans around the world.""We still want to have stealth capabilities, but I would like to argue that hypersonics give you next-level capabilities,"" said Mark Lewis, chair of the Institute for Defense Analyses' Science and Technology Policy Institute. ""With stealth, they can't see me. With hypersonics, even if they do see me, there's not a lot they can do to stop me.""The Pentagon awarded contracts last year for hypersonic test vehicles, and prototypes are expected in 2020. Later this year, a separate contract for a hypersonic strike weapon to be launched from fighters and bombers will be awarded to either Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Boeing (BA), Raytheon (RTN), or Orbital ATK (OA), which is being bought by Northrop. Meanwhile, China and Russia are expected to field hypersonic weapons sometime in the next decade.A Rand Corp. report last month highlighted the disruptive potential of hypersonic weapons, warning that even a relatively small hypersonic arsenal could threaten a major power's forward-projected forces, or even their homelands.Deeper into the future, aircraft equipped with hypersonic technology could further disrupt warfighting or even commercial airspace. And outer space could become more accessible with hypersonic vehicles as more companies look to low-cost launch options.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Eventually, hypersonics could be a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the aerospace industry. But the price of each weapon system is still unknown because too few weapons have been built to get a good figure, Lewis notes.In addition to warfighters, Pentagon number crunchers could see upside in the new technology as well. While individual hypersonic missiles would be more expensive than conventional ones, some argue that firing hypersonics, which are more deadly, could prove more effective on targets and less expensive in practice, he adds.""It's part of the discussion we are having today,"" Lewis said.To be sure, hypersonic weapons wouldn't be the fastest on the planet. Traditional intercontinental ballistic missiles fly at 20 times the speed of sound. But they follow predictable trajectories.Existing missile-defense systems like Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD), Boeing's Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system and Raytheon's Patriot system all work by predicting where and when incoming missiles will land.But hypersonic weapons combine speed, range and maneuverability to take unpredictable flight paths, making them extremely difficult, if not impossible, to shoot down with today's technology.""So our radars and antimissile missile systems aren't really designed to defend against them, in theory,"" said Greg Zacharias, chief scientist of the Air Force.That means aircraft carriers, the linchpin of America's ability to project force abroad, would be vulnerable to hypersonic weapons, severely limiting where they could operate.But at the Association of the U.S. Army conference earlier this month, Tim Cahill, vice president of air and missile defense at Lockheed, said some of its existing systems like THAAD and Aegis ""have a lot of capability right now against"" hypersonic targets even though they weren't designed to take out those types of weapons.The company is working on enhancements, like improving radars and command and control systems. But existing systems still have areas that minor adjustments won't address. While Cahill wouldn't give a specific timeline, he acknowledged a need for larger modifications that will take years to complete.""With something as disruptive as hypersonics, all services will have to rethink how they do business,"" said Fred Kennedy, director of the tactical technology office at the Pentagon's secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).The Missile Defense Agency has requested more than $75 million to research potential methods for defending against hypersonic weapons.There is also a window to intercept hypersonic weapons in their initial, or ""boost,"" phase when they behave more like regular ICBMs, says Ian Williams, director of the missile defense project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.But for now, the U.S. doesn't have an operational boost-phase defense system.On the flip side, America's adversaries would be unable to defend against hypersonic weapons screaming toward them, making them optimal in time-critical situations.If the U.S. saw North Korea or another hostile power readying a missile for launch, an American hypersonic weapon could be quickly deployed and take out the missile before it took off, Zacharias says.The U.S. military has flirted with hypersonic weapons technology on and off for years. But a new urgency has taken over as U.S. adversaries and emerging powers pursue hypersonics.The White House Office of Management and Budget released a report in August listing hypersonic weapons and defenses as a top research and development priority. And the administration's fiscal 2018 budget request includes $292.5 million for hypersonic science and technology. That's up from just $79 million spent in 2012. Then there's the contract for a hypersonic weapon expected to be awarded by the Pentagon this year.Those efforts would build on a breakthrough that came with the 2013 flight of Boeing's X-51 Waverider, which provided proof that hypersonic technology was feasible.Now Darpa is looking at two major technologies: a tactical boost glide vehicle and the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC).The glider concept envisions a rocket that carries a weapon to Mach 5 or above. Once that speed is reached, the weapon would separate from the rocket and ""glide"" at hypersonic speed to its target. Last year, Darpa awarded Lockheed a $147 million contract to build a prototype.The HAWC envisions a ""scramjet"" hypersonic engine, which would use its forward trajectory to compress incoming air, instead of relying on an oxidizer like a rocket does. Without the extra fuel, the engine is lighter and can fly faster. In 2016, Darpa awarded Raytheon a $174.7 million contract and Lockheed a $171.2 million contract for the HAWC. Zacharias says prototypes are on track for delivery in 2020.In an earlier interview with IBD, Orbital ATK predicted hypersonic weapons would become a reality in the next five years, saying the company has the technological know-how to manufacture hypersonic vehicles.Meanwhile, Russia is working on a hypersonic glide vehicle as part of its Project 4202, and China is developing its own DF-ZF hypersonic glider. Russia is also developing the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile. India is working on its own hypersonic missile, the BrahMos II, with Russia. Australia, Japan and some European countries have hypersonic programs as well.""Interest in (hypersonics) seems to really be spiking in the Pentagon, in part because some other countries like China have gotten extremely active in this technology area themselves,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS.Further into the future, the Air Force is looking at hypersonic drones and vehicles that don't need to be launched from an aircraft or rocket.Lockheed's secretive Skunk Works division and Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) have been working on a proof-of-concept plane as an update to the iconic SR-71 Blackbird spy plane.The new unmanned vehicle would fly at Mach 6, twice as fast as its predecessor, thanks to a traditional turbine engine that takes the plane to Mach 3, coupled with a scramjet engine that propels the SR-72 to hypersonic speeds. The plane could be ready for use by 2030.""The technology is mature,"" Rob Weiss, Lockheed's Skunk Works chief, told IBD in July. Hypersonics are ""ready to be demonstrated. There has been steady progress to advance the technology, which is our primary focus now.""And if you combine hypersonic aircraft with hypersonic missiles? That could enable an attack into defended airspace ""at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour,"" according to Lockheed.The Air Force's Zacharias said commercial players could be interested in using hypersonic scramjet engines to get flights into orbit because it would be cheaper than using a rocket.Lower-cost access to space is becoming a bigger commercial priority amid plans to launch new satellite constellations.The technology could reduce travel time from the U.S. to Tokyo to three hours, says John Hernandez, senior analyst at the Frost & Sullivan consulting firm. That's down from more than 12 hours on a nonstop commercial flight today.And hypersonics don't have the same problem with sonic booms that supersonic jets have, because they fly higher in the atmosphere.Still, significant government participation would be needed for commercial development.""It's hard to imagine a startup company having the resources to invest in the levels needed to make space applications possible,"" Lewis said. ""That's the government's role. One realm that NASA can contribute to is civilian applications.""RELATED:Pentagon Looks To Speed Up These Missile Defense SystemsAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksWhat Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

Congress now has 30 days to approve the deal.Cahill said he couldn't say how much of the $15 billion deal would go specifically to Lockheed but that it was ""a very substantial sale"" for the company.After getting congressional approval, Saudi Arabia will then have to formally put in a contract for the system, but Cahill thinks that the deal will be done quickly.There is a ""sense of urgency on all parties.""Lockheed shares rose 0.1% to 317.71 on the stock market today, still in buy range from a 308.58 flat-base buy point.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now?

Lockheed builds PAC-3 interceptors for the system.Cahill said Lockheed is getting interest from countries that didn't have a high priority on missile defense in the past.

106,RTN,"Boeing (BA) topped Q4 estimates Wednesday and offered upbeat guidance for the coming year as recent tax cuts unlock more investment, which could go toward developing a new passenger jet.X The aerospace giant expects to spend $3.7 billion on research and development in 2018, up from $3.2 billion last year, with capital investment expected to climb to $2.2 billion from $1.7 billion.On a conference call with analysts, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said tax reforms would increase Boeing's ability to invest in innovation as well as the underlying production and supply chain, ""solidifying the business case"" of the new midmarket plane.""If we launch, it would give us additional confidence,"" he added.But the company wouldn't say if it would make a decision on the new plane this year, saying it had a lot of time to do its research and the tax cut didn't change its project time frame of 2024-2025 to start deliveries if it decides to launch a new plane.Muilenburg also said that the decision on the new plane wasn't impacted by talks to acquire a major stake in Brazilian planemaker Embraer (ERJ). But sources earlier told Bloomberg that Boeing would get Embraer engineers' expertise to help jump-start the new midmarket plane.Boeing also said it would use tax savings for training and workplace investments, but it has no plans to increase hiring to make up for rounds of layoffs in recent years.Shares surged 4.9% to 354.27 on the stock market today, hitting a new all-time high. That gave a huge boost to the price-weighted Dow Jones industrial average.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Boeing sees full year EPS of $13.80-$14, above consensus views for $12.07, on revenue of $96 billion-$98 billion, above consensus for $94.8 billion, reflecting commercial deliveries of 810-815 planes (up from 763 in 2017). Operating cash flow is expected to increase to $15 billion from $13.3 billion in 2017.During the company's conference call officials said that the outlook could be updated as the impact of tax reform is fully understood.For Q4, Boeing reported adjusted EPS of $4.80, including a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. That beat analysts' views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, beating views for $24.83 billion.Commercial aircraft revenue grew 8% to $15.47 billion. Earlier, Boeing said Q4 commercial aircraft deliveries rose to 209 from 185 a year ago as production rates on the 737 and 787 ramp up.Net orders for 414 commercial planes were booked in Q4, with the backlog at more than 5,800 airplanes valued at $421 billion. The defense backlog was $50 billion, of which 40% represents orders from international customers. Total company backlog rose to $488 billion from $474 billion at the beginning of the quarter.Defense, space and security revenue rose 5% to $5.54 billion. Global services revenue jumped 14% to $4 billion.Boeing didn't record a charge with the troublesome KC-46 tanker for the Air Force this quarter, after racking up $2.9 billion before taxes and $1.9 billion after taxes in charges on the modified 767.Last week Gen. Carlton Everhart, the head of Air Mobility Command, told the Air Force Times that Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration could get final FAA certification for the KC-46 in the next 60-70 days.Defense contractors have had a positive earnings season overall. Lockheed Martin (LMT) beat earnings and revenue forecasts Monday and issued strong full-year guidance.Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and GD missed on revenue while Northrop beat and gave strong 2018 guidance.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

108,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported fourth-quarter results ahead of Wall Street expectations Monday and gave strong profit guidance.X Excluding a one-time $1.9 billion charge due to the new tax act, earnings jumped 32% to $4.30 per share while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of $4.06 a share on revenue of $14.75 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Lockheed sees 2018 earnings of $15.20-$15.50 a share and revenue of $50 billion to $51.5 billion vs. analyst consensus for earnings of $14 a share on sales of $51.53 billion.Lockheed shares closed up 1.9% to a new high of 351.42 on the stock market today. Boeing (BA), which reports Wednesday, slipped 0.7% to 340.82.Aeronautics unit sales rose 11.8% to $6.04 billion on increased production of the F-35 and deliveries of the C-130 as profit margins widened by 20%. The F-35, the costliest procurement program in Defense Department history, is seeing faster rates of production, and Lockheed met its delivery target last year despite Pentagon warnings that the company would fall short.But the aircraft's performance after it comes off the assembly line has come under scrutiny. A recent report from the Pentagon's top weapons tester found that efforts to improve the F-35's reliability are ""stagnant,"" according to Bloomberg.But Lockheed later defended the program, saying that reliability of the F-35's weapons systems has been improving over successive production lots, with newer jets averaging more than 60% availability.Bloomberg also reported that Lockheed is asking the Pentagon for $212 million for restructuring costs for its acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, claiming it will save taxpayers money.Missile and fire control unit sales jumped 30.5% to $2.29 billion on increased air and missile defense deliveries, but space systems unit sales fell 12% to $2.45 billion on fewer government satellite launches.When asked if some of the tax cut savings could be spent on R&D for efforts to develop a boost phase missile defense — shooting down a missile during the ascent phase — during the conference call, Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said that spending on R&D ""would be right in line for our customers.""Missile defense was highlighted as a priority in Washington's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy and Hewson touted a recent test pairing the company's Aegis defense system with the F-35 to spot targets sooner. She also mentioned investments in hypersonics and directed energy R&D.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Rotary and mission systems sales climbed 14% to $4.35 billion. But Lockheed still expects a muted year for commercial helicopters. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner said oil and gas will have to stay at $65 per barrel for longer before there will be ramp up in commercial sales.""We're not expecting large increase in commercial helicopters in 2018 and looking flat in 2019,"" he said during the company's conference call. ""But that could change pretty quickly based on oil and gas prices.""Lockheed also said it plans to invest $5 billion in its pension plans to pre-pay through 2021 to see a $1 billion benefit under a new accounting standard.Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped fourth-quarter profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue while Northrop beat.Northrop also lifted its dividend and gave strong 2018 guidance.

""There will be some charges (to earnings) and some noise that will be a little challenging to look through that to see what the outlook is for the rest of the year.""Last week, the Pentagon released the 2018 National Defense Strategy with a shift in focus to ""great power competition"" instead of terrorism, prioritizing high end weapons like Lockheed's F-35 fifth-generation fighter and the nuclear recapitalization program.""I think clearly the fundamentals still remain longer term very positive and .... the National Defense Strategy release last Friday points to helping build the political foundation for budget increases in highly specialized areas of investment"" like space and unmanned systems, said Ken Herbert, managing director at Canaccord Genuity.While the strategy lays out long-term spending priorities, the Defense Department still doesn't have a budget yet for 2018 and Congress continues to lurch through short-term budgets that carry over prior spending levels. Herbert expects ""timing around fiscal '18 budget will continue to be a headwind and negative overhang.""On Wednesday, General Dynamics reported adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of tax reform, up 32.3% to $2.50, beating analyst exceptions.  Revenue rose 8.1% to $8.3 billion, but fell short.Northrop reports early Thursday, and EPS is seen climbing 3.4% to $2.75 with revenue dipping 0.4% to $6.37 billion. Analysts would like to get answers about the failed deployment of Northrop's Zuma satellite, but so far the company has kept quiet about the launch earlier this month, citing the classified nature of the mission.Little is known about the Zuma satellite except that Northrop made it for a government customer and it was supposed to be launched into low Earth orbit. But sources told Bloomberg that the Falcon 9's second stage failed, with both the satellite and the second-stage booster falling into the ocean.Raytheon also reports early Thursday, and analysts see EPS up 7.4% to $2.02 with revenue climbing 9.6% to $6.83 billion. Missile defense sales are in the spotlight as international partners like Romania and Poland look to beef up defenses against Russia with new Raytheon-built Patriot systems.In general, ""international sales will be asked about a lot because that's been very strong,"" Canaccord's Herbert said, as the Trump administration has pushed for more foreign sales vs. prior administrations.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.While Lockheed is typically the first defense contractor to report, its results come out next week, on Jan. 29. EPS is seen jumping 25% to $4.06 with revenue up 7.3% to $14.75 billion.With international demand for Raytheon's missile-defense products rising, sales of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system will also be scrutinized.Windau also expects more commentary on F-35 production, as it ramps up to full tilt, as well as progress on cutting costs. Last week, the State Department gave Belgium approval to purchase 34 F-35s valued at $6.53 billion to replace its Lockheed F-16s.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

112,RTN,"ARLINGTON, Va. — Lockheed Martin (LMT) could submit its T-50A aircraft for an Air Force experiment this year on low-cost planes, an executive said Tuesday, while touting its potential in the trainer aircraft market both in the U.S. and overseas.The Air Force will fly selected aircraft this summer at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico to see if they could be used against targets that lack significant air defenses, sparing more sophisticated fighters like Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet and Lockheed's F-35 and reducing operating costs.But Rob Weiss, Lockheed's executive vice president for Advanced Development Programs, said the company still needs to determine if the T-50A can meet the Air Force's requirements on the fuel-burn rate and ability to take off from an austere runway.Meanwhile, the Air Force is also holding a competition to build a new trainer aircraft.Lockheed and partner Korea Aerospace Industries are using an existing off-the-shelf design for the T-50A offering, and Weiss said it could be delivered to the Air Force in 2022, two years ahead of schedule.The T-50A is the ""most affordable alternative and the only alternative in our view that can be delivered on time,"" he told reporters at Lockheed's annual media day.Boeing and partner Saab are developing a competing, clean-sheet trainer design, something Weiss said Lockheed decided against two years ago because it wouldn't be ready by the targeted 2024 initial operational capability date.Lockheed shares closed down 1.1% at 269 on the stock market today amid a broad market sell-off, dipping below buy range after breaking out last week. Boeing retreated 1.9%.Analysts have said Lockheed is the likely front-runner in the trainer contest, after Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) bowed out of the competition for the $16.3 billion, 350-aircraft contract.But even if Lockheed loses the U.S. Air Force's contest, Weiss said the T-50A offering also has potential in overseas markets, estimating that the total worldwide market could be 1,000-2,000 aircraft, including the 350 planes the Air Force plans to buy.RELATED: Lockheed Not Bothered By Trump's Call With Boeing CEO, F-35 Chief

Among top shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) fell 0.5%,  EOG Resources (EOG) lost 0.7%, and Diamondback Energy (FANG) dipped 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. producers had to become leaner in the face of lower-for-longer oil prices and a debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts. The U.S. military fired 59 Raytheon (RTN) Tomahawk cruise missiles late Thursday, hitting the Shayrat air base, where U.S. officials believe the Syrian government launched a chemical weapons attack earlier this week.While Syria isn't a major crude producer, analysts worry the attack could lead to more instability in the oil rich region.""Syria, bordering Iraq and Turkey, raises the threats to supply routes, pipeline and production along the border with Iraq,"" wrote Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, in his morning energy brief.But while President Trump's action in Syria might raise short term risks in the oil market, Flynn thinks it could reduce risk in the long run if Syrian President Assad and the Islamic State are defeated.Also Friday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that it was still to early to make a call on extending the OPEC and non-OPEC production cut, but the decision would be clearer by the end of this month or beginning of May.The oil market still remains out of balance and U.S. supplies aren't falling as fast as Saudi Arabia and others anticipated, strengthening the chances of the deal's extension for another six months.On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration reported a surprise U.S. crude stockpile gain of 1.6 million barrels.RELATED: Dow's GE, Baker Hughes Eye Big Data Efficiencies As Oil Prices Hit Cap

117,RTN,"Weapons made by Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) could get new infusions of money, as the Pentagon looks for ways to accelerate U.S. defenses amid rapidly advancing North Korean nuclear and missile threats.XThe Defense Department has asked Congress to shift $416 million into missile defense programs, some of which are classified, from Army and Army Reserve operations and maintenance accounts, according to a Sept. 7 request obtained by Defense News.The programs poised to get more funding include upgrades to Lockheed's shipboard Aegis systems, so they can launch Raytheon's Standard Missile-3 Block IIA, Raytheon's Cobra Dane surveillance radar, and Raytheon's sea-based X-band radar, which floats on a Boeing platform.The Pentagon also wants to boost the number of ground-based interceptors in Fort Greely, Alaska, to 64 from 44 and add 20 missile silos. Boeing's Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system is located there.At a recent Capitol Hill hearing, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford alluded to the spending-transfer request, and said, ""We looked at additional radar systems. We looked at THAAD systems, Patriot systems.""Lockheed makes the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, and Raytheon makes the Patriot air-defense system.Lockheed shares were down 0.3% at 309.19 on the stock market today, but still above a flat-base 308.58 buy point. Raytheon slipped 0.3% but remains well above buying territory. Boeing was off 0.4%, staying in its buy zone.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.As money flows toward missile defense, more defense contracts are trying to get in on the action.Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC) announced it would buy Orbital ATK (OA) for $9.2 billion.In addition to making rocket boosters and munitions, Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system.

119,RTN,"Northrop Grumman's (NOC) $9.2 billion acquisition of Orbital ATK (OA) will give the defense giant key missile-defense assets as the sector heats up on increased threats from North Korea and could help it win an important nuclear modernization contact.XRaytheon (RTN), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) dominate the missile defense space, and Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for Boeing's Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system used by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. It also builds target vehicles for tests.Northrop built the control system for the GMD, but doesn't have much in way of launchers, and the Orbital deal would help Northrop expand its capabilities and catch up to rivals, as well as ""broaden and deepen"" its space portfolio, Pete Skibitski, a Drexel Hamilton analyst, said in a research note.""The missile/missile defense front is the most intriguing aspect of this combination,"" he wrote. ""Adding Orbital ATK clearly makes for a stronger portfolio.""It could even help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system. Last month, the Air Force awarded Boeing $349 million and Northrop $328 million in initial contracts, with a final contact decision expected in 2020.The Northrop-Orbital deal also could be a sign that companies and government funding are shifting towards missiles and missile defense.""It looks like the two companies combined are making a bet on the growth in space and missiles,"" Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS, said in an interview.  ""They are betting the (Defense) Department is going to make the room required (in the budget) to purchase a lot of missiles and other weapons.""Orbital shares soared 20% to close at 132.25 on the stock market today. Northrop climbed 3.4% to finish at 275.97, clearing a 274.71 buy point in a new flat base. Northrop retook its 50-day moving average on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.Northrop will pay $7.8 billion in cash and assume $1.4 billion in debt. That comes out to $134.50 a share for Orbital, a 22% premium to Orbital's Friday close of 110.04. Orbital was at the high end of a buy range from a 105.19 entry as of Friday's close.The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and Orbital will operate as a new business sector within Northrop for the foreseeable future, according to executives from both companies on a conference call Monday.Northrop management said the deal will add to earnings a year after it closes, and stressed there is little overlap between the two companies.But Orbital's ammunition offerings might be spun-off in the future.""From an ammunition perspective, we're not big fans of adding ammo capability to Northrop's portfolio, given we don't see a large land war breaking out anytime soon,"" Skibitski said.Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer for Tigress Financial Partners, said in an interview that he expects no objections from the Pentagon or Federal Trade Commission over the deal.But Vertical Research Partners aerospace and defense analyst Rob Stallard noted that this will be the first major defense acquisition of the Trump administration era. ""This is a test case as to whether concerns over the scale of the primes is still an issue,"" he wrote.Boeing could also make a counterbid as some aspects of missile defense and precision munitions are important to the aerospace giant, but those are rare, he wrote.The deal could spark more merger and acquisition activity in the defense space.""I think this and the Rockwell/United Technologies deal would suggest there is a move towards consolidation,"" Hunter said.But investors might not see companies on the lookout for more missile defense or space companies per se as the sector shrinks.""Interest in other companies may not be a directly comparable move. We are at a state in the industry where there is only so many moves you an make, but that doesn't mean you can't make a move in another direction.""The U.S. and its allies have ramped up missile defense testing and deployment as North Korea continues its missile testing and reportedly has an ICBM that can hit the U.S.In May, Boeing's GMD system was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and successfully intercepted a target ICBM fired from the Marshall Islands. It was the 10th successful test in 18 attempts, but prior tests have failed, including two tests in 2010 that were carefully scripted with the dimensions, trajectory and speed as known factors.Meanwhile, Lockheed's THAAD system is currently deployed in South Korea, Guam and Alaska. In July, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency announced that its THAAD system in Kodiak, Alaska, successfully intercepted an intermediate-range ballistic missile for the first time in a test. So far, the system has a perfect 14-out-of-14 record in tests since 2005.Raytheon makes the popular Patriot system, which is useful against conventional weapons and has a range of just 12 miles, while Lockheed produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) interceptor missiles.RELATED:As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksBoeing May Challenge United Tech's Buyout Of Rockwell CollinsDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

122,RTN,"The Japanese and South Korean governments have unveiled military budget increases geared toward defending against the growing threat from North Korea.XOn Thursday, Japan's Defense Ministry released a request for a 2.5% increase in defense spending $47.78 billion for the fiscal year starting in April 2018. Earlier this week, South Korea said it will boost its military budget next year by 6.9% to $38.4 billion, the biggest hike in eight years.The ministry has earmarked $160 million for missile development programs, including $90 million for studying hypersonic weapons, which fly at five times the speed of sound and could more easily evade enemy defenses, according to Reuters.Japan's defense budget also includes money for Raytheon's (RTN) ship-to-air SM-3 Block IIA missiles that have double the range of Japan's current ship-based missiles, and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) surface-to-air PAC-3 missile for use in the Patriot system.Lockheed's Aegis Ashore missile-defense system or Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system are under consideration too, but a decision between the two isn't expected until later this year.Other defense expenditures include six Lockheed F-35 fighters, four V-22 Ospreys made by Boeing (BA) and Textron's (TXT) Bell unit, a submarine and two compact warships.In South Korea, the government plans to spend more money on spy satellites, surveillance drones, missile defense systems, and long-range air-to-surface missiles, among other things.President Moon Jae-in also approved recently the full deployment of South Korea's THAAD antimissile battery, which was highly controversial earlier this year. The first two antimissile launchers were deployed in April.Raytheon shares were down 0.1% in midday trading on the stock market today, but have soared nearly 30% this year. Lockheed eased 0.2%, and Boeing lost 0.5%. But like Raytheon, defense stocks in general have been strong performers this year, with many well above buying range.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.North Korea has become more aggressive with its missile tests in recent months. On Tuesday, it launched an intermediate-range ballistic Hwasong-12 that can fly up to 3,000 miles over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the launch an ""unprecedented serious and grave threat"" that ""significantly undermines the peace and security of the region"" and called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.The missile test came during joint U.S.-South Korea war games that Pyongyang is against. On Thursday four Lockheed F-35B fighter jets and two B-1B bombers joined four South Korean Boeing F-15 fighters in a show of force flyover of the Korean Peninsula.RELATED:As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksRaytheon Hits New High As Latest N.

123,RTN,"The stock market remained slightly negative as a downbeat jobs report and Thursday night's U.S. bombing of a Syrian airfield weighed on stocks.The S&P 500, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq all edged 0.1% lower. Volume fell modestly across the board vs. the same time Thursday.Among the Dow industrials, Wal-Mart (WMT) was the clear leader in the stock market today, leading the Dow higher with a 1.6% gain. Shares were approaching a 72.90 cup-with-handle buy point. On the downside, financial components, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan lagged, falling 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. Both investment banks remain consolidating under their 50-day lines.In the wake of the Syrian bombing, defense stocks traded higher with Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) both up 1.3%. Lockheed is trading near a 270 cup-base buy point, while Raytheon is just below a 152.68 entry as it tests the 50-day.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) dropped nearly 5% in heavy volume after M Science posted sales estimates well below consensus. The research firm forecast Q1 year-over-year sales growth between 11.1% and 12.1%; the consensus is 14.6%. Shares broke down through the 50-day moving average, which the stock had held above since mid-January. Among other leading restaurants, Dave & Buster's (PLAY) fell 0.8%. Shares remain holding just above a 58.35 flat-base entry.Among stocks breaking out, Cirrus Logic (CRUS) moved above a 64.26 cup-base buy point in early trading. The Apple supplier is up 24% over the past six weeks. Shares moved up 2.6% Friday as volume tracked 40% higher than average. Medidata Solutions (MDSO) followed up Thursday's breakout with a nearly 5% gain. Shares are now extended from a 58.87 entry.The IPO market looked to heat up again with tech unicorn Okta (OKTA) pricing at the high end of its estimated range. Shares surged 36% on the first day of trading. Other recent IPOs include social media company Snap (SNAP), Canadian outerwear retailer Canada Goose (GOOS), and San Francisco-based computer software firm Mulesoft (MULE).Action within the IBD 50 was mixed in midday trading. On the upside, Qorvo (QRVO) and LogMeIn (LOGM) paced the advancers with 3% gains. LogMeIn moved back above the 50-day moving average and needs to spend at least a few weeks above it to form a solid base.On the downside, China-based Autohome (ATHM) dropped 4%. Shares extended their losses underneath the 50-day line.RELATED:Jobless Rate Falls To 10-Year Low Of 4.5%, Keeping Pressure On FedTech Unicorn Okta Prices At High End Of Range; Raises $187 MillionThese Two Stocks Break Out On Way To New Highs

124,RTN,"A blowout private-payroll report from ADP and rebounding oil prices initially helped put the major U.S. stock indexes on pace for weekly gains. A strong start from the tech sector, led by Tesla (TSLA), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and its suppliers also helped send the Nasdaq to fresh record highs.But that all changed with the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting, as policymakers signaled a surprise tilt toward more monetary tightening. Signs of disarray in Washington, D.C., on the effort to overhaul taxes also weighed on markets. Official U.S. jobs data showing conflicting signals Friday failed to bolster the market, nor did a strong IPO from tech company Okta. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about flat  for the week, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq was off 0.6%.The Labor Department's March payroll report showed a gain of just 98,000 jobs, barely over half of what analysts expected, and January's and February's gains were revised lower. But the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5% as a separate survey found a robust jump in employment. Much of the weakness in payrolls was blamed on unseasonable weather. Underlying trends could be stronger. ADP's private-sector hiring report earlier in the week put March's jobs gain at 263,000. The overall direction of jobs, wages and inflation is seen putting pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy.RELATED:Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 14-15 meeting released Wednesday afternoon revealed that policymakers are ready to start shrinking the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.The move, which amounts to a tightening of monetary policy, would begin to reverse the accommodation from the Fed's unconventional asset-buying programs launched in late 2008 to combat the financial crisis.The revelation helped turn a solid stock market advance into a small loss. Some analysts suggested that the Fed's policy signal could mean an unexpected rate hike in September, following a widely expected one in June. That would allow the Fed to start reducing the size of its balance sheet in December by no longer reinvesting all of the principal returned when its bond holdings mature.Separately, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond regional Fed bank, abruptly resigned after admitting that he violated the Fed's confidentiality rules in 2012 by speaking with a financial analyst about policy deliberations.RELATED:Okta (OKTA) raised $187 million late Thursday, pricing 11 million shares at 17, the high end of its estimated range. The stock climbed 38% over its IPO price to close at 23.51 on the Nasdaq Friday. That price values the company at over $2 billion. Okta's Identity Cloud platform provides identity management services for businesses. The San Francisco-based company is the fourth new company worth more than $1 billion to come public this year, following the successful IPOs of MuleSoft (MULE) Presidio (PSDO) and Snap (SNAP).RELATED:Tesla stock soared to a record high, following its Sunday report on car deliveries that beat expectations. Tesla now has a higher market valuation than Ford (F), which sold off Monday on weak U.S. auto sales for March. CEO Elon Musk mocked Tesla short sellers in a Monday tweet. Tesla delivered just over 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter, above its target of 23,000-24,500 vehicles and above Wall Street estimates for about 24,200.RELATED:Panera Bread (PNRA) agreed to be bought by Luxembourg's JAB for $7.5 billion including debt, or $315 per share. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. JAB also owns Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Keurig Green Mountain and Peet's Coffee & Tea. It's the fourth major restaurant acquisition this year following Restaurant Brands' (QSR) purchase of Popeyes, Golden Gate Capital's buyout of Bob Evans Farms and Darden Restaurants (DRI) buying Cheddars. Other transactions could be on the horizon given analysts' forecasts for restaurant traffic to remain under pressure this year as consumers opt to save money and eat at home.RELATED:Google continued introducing remedies to quash an advertising crisis at YouTube that derailed a rally in parent Alphabet's (GOOGL) stock in mid-March. Google introduced a new system that lets outside firms verify ad quality standards on its video service. The advertising uproar began in Europe when major brands complained about ad placement next to videos that promoted hate, violence and racism. Analysts say some advertisers that have suspended ads on YouTube are seeking concessions from Google, aside from resolving the ad placement issue. YouTube, meanwhile, launched a $35 monthly TV streaming service in five U.S. markets — New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia.Meanwhile, Amazon's video business rolled ahead. It won rights to stream 10 National Football League games this fall — taking the ball from Twitter (TWTR), which held the same rights last year. Amazon is paying a big price for the privilege. It's paying $50 million, which is $40 million more than Twitter paid.

It sees potential in the Asia Pacific region, Latin America and Africa.RELATED:The FDA sent the company a complete response letter after Merck (MRK) said it wanted to include data from a trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes with sitagliptin — the chemical name for diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet — in the prescribing information of sitagliptin-containing medicines. A complete response letter is issued when an application is rejected. It means Merck still has some work to do to get approval for including cardiovascular outcomes data on the labels for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR. Merck said it is exploring its options. The stock lost ground early Friday but recouped most of the losses, closing down 0.2%.U.S. airstrikes on Syria lit up defense stocks Friday. Raytheon (RTN), which makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from the Mediterranean Sea, rose 1.5% and remained in buy range from a 152.68 flat-base entry. Lockheed Martin (LMT) lifted 1.2% to just above a 270 buy point. Lockheed makes the Paveway II Plus laser guided bomb. Northrop Grumman (NOC) added 0.9% and Boeing (BA) 0.8%. Boeing makes joint direct-attack munitions kits that turn dumb bombs into smart weapons.Constellation Brands (STZ) reported that Q4 earnings jumped 24% to $1.48 a share as revenue rose 5.5% to $1.63 billion. Results topped analyst estimates for EPS of $1.36 and sales of $1.59 billion. The alcoholic beverage giant, known for its Corona brand, saw beer sales rise 11%. But net sales of wine and spirits were flat. For the year, Constellation sees EPS of $7.70 to $8, above recent analyst estimates, with sales rising 9% to 11%, also above expectations.RELATED:CarMax (KMX) beat analysts' estimates for its fiscal fourth-quarter results, but continued to have difficulties in its subprime business, and a 1.6% drop in the average used-vehicle price reinforced concerns about industry sales and loan quality.

""However, we expect this penetration rate to grow due to pressure to more rapidly design, develop and deliver affordable solutions to the Department of Defense.""President Trump has proposed budget cuts in other agencies in order to increase military spending, an action that could lift all boats in the defense sector. IBD's Aerospace-Defense group, which includes defense contractors, is ranked No. 32 out of 197 industry groups, up from No. 78 four weeks ago.Further, Mercury is ranked No. 7 in the IBD 50, a roster of fast-growing stocks. Defense giants Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) are big Mercury customers, and its products are used by more than 25 prime defense contractors, including Boeing (BA) and General Dynamics (GD).""Even though we think most of the near-term incremental spending from Trump will flow to readiness accounts rather than more procurement, Mercury's solutions help upgrade aging platforms,"" said Gursky in the report.Gursky hiked his priced target on shares of Chelmsford, Mass.-based Mercury to 48 from 45. Mercury stock moved up nearly 1% to 40.16 in the stock market today, and is up 32% thus far this year.IBD'S TAKE: Which companies are hitting 52-week highs?

126,RTN,"President Trump's budget request calls for a $54 billion increase in defense spending and will give the Defense Department latitude on where the extra money goes, according to a Reuters report, after earlier worries that the White House budget chief would be stingy with the Pentagon.OMB Director Mick Mulvaney was a fiscal hawk and sequester backer when he was in the House of Representatives, and the White House's budget proposal seeks offsetting budget cuts equal to the Defense Department boost in other areas of discretionary spending.But the proposal has more money allotted for ships and military aircraft to have ""a more robust presence in key international waterways and chokepoints,"" an official told Reuters.Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares rose 1.3% to 269.39 on the stock market today, nearing a 270 buy point from a cup base. Northrop Grumman (NOC) advanced 1.45% to 248.60, on its way to a 253.90 entry. Raytheon (RTN) picked up 0.9% to 154.82, still in buy range after breaking out last week. Boeing (BA) climbed 1.1%.General Dynamics (GD) advanced 0.4% and Huntington Ingalls (HII) 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Even if Trump ramps up defense spending analysts warn that a massive buildup on the scale of what was seen under President Ronald Reagan is unlikely.The increases in defense spending will be funded by cuts to the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency and other non-military agencies, according to the Reuters report, but won't include cuts from Social Security or Medicare, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday.Additional specifics weren't available, though Trump could reveal some Tuesday night during his address to a joint session of Congress.During his campaign, he promised to increase the Navy's fleet by 78 ships to at least 350, and add at least 100 combat fighters to the Air Force. He also vowed to boost the Army's ranks by 60,000 and the Marine Corps' by 12,000.But it remains to be seen how the White House plans to balance increases in weapons procurement, which would send more money to the big defense contractors, with increases in personnel spending, which requires putting money in housing, chow halls, uniforms and medical care.The additional dollar on warplanes would come after Trump blasted high military aircraft costs and vowed to get a better deal on Lockheed's F-35 and suggested buying updated Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets instead.RELATED:Trump: ObamaCare Repeal Before Tax Cuts, Vows 'Big' Infrastructure BoostTrump Silent On Ex-Im Bank, Hints At 'Big' Boeing Super Hornet OrderInfrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big'

127,RTN,"The Trump administration is set to unveil a budget proposal in the coming week that will offer additional details about defense spending, making Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), United Technologies (UTX), General Dynamics (GD) and Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) stocks to watch.The budget plan, which could be released Thursday, follows a broad outline last month that called for a $54 billion hike in defense spending but didn't specify what programs would benefit. It also didn't say how dollars would be split between new weapons, which would help the Lockheed Martins of the world, and personnel costs like uniforms, medical care and housing.During his campaign, Trump called for adding 78 ships to the Navy, at least 100 aircraft to the Air Force, and tens of thousands of troops to the Army and Marines. He has also backed efforts to recapitalize the U.S. nuclear arsenal, as Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and other defense contractors turn their sights to nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Lockheed Martin — which makes the F-35 stealth fighter jet, Sikorsky helicopters, missiles, and the littoral combat ship — has been trying to clear a cup base with a 270 buy point. Shares ended Friday at 268.66.The Pentagon's top supplier has taken some flak recently. Trump has said he wants to introduce competition into the business of building fighter jets, saying costs for the F-35 were ""out of control"" and that he wanted Boeing to ""price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet."" But such a shift would require a new competition and wouldn't show up in the upcoming budget. Meanwhile, Lockheed has been cutting costs on the F-35, with the latest production contract factoring in unit cost reductions of 7%-8%.

128,RTN,"Northrop Grumman spun off its shipbuilding operations in 2011, but it is developing the B-21 bomber, which could be worth $80 billion, and makes the Global Hawk drone.Northrop is also a major subcontractor on the F-35, making the center fuselage, fire control radar, and the communications and navigation system, while also helping develop the mission system and mission planning software.Other contracts are up for grabs. Northrop, Boeing, Lockheed, and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.Northrop stock is making its way through a cup-with-handle base with a 249.53 entry.

Shares are at 112.14.General Dynamics, which makes tanks and Navy ships, broke out of a flat base in January with a 180.19 buy point.

129,RTN,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) chief financial officer said officials who fill key acquisition positions in the Defense Department and any policy changes would be more important than President Trump's direct actions on sales in the defense sector.During a presentation at Cowen's Aerospace/Defense & Industrials Conference Wednesday, Bruce Tanner was speaking about sales of missile defense systems to Asia and the Middle East as well as F-35 sales in Asia when he was asked about Trump's effect on demand given his ""aggressive stance on some issues.""""The better question would be who is going to fill the acquisition slots in the Pentagon representing the administration and whether or not there's signals sent over a shift in policy,"" he replied. ""I'm not suggesting there is. I don't know. I think that would be more critical maybe than the ongoing influence of the president directly.""During his campaign Trump threatened to withdraw troops from Japan and South Korea unless the countries contributed more on defense. Meanwhile, the U.S. agreed to deploy Lockheed's Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery to South Korea, and Japan is considering the system as well.In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has been a major buyer of Raytheon's (RTN) Patriot air-defense system, though Lockheed makes the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile for the system.Earlier in conference, top Raytheon executives said they have seen ""strong demand signals"" overseas for the Patriot system.The company is currently working on a deal with Poland and another European customer is expected to finalize a deal in late 2017 or early 2018, they added.Raytheon also said it's waiting to see what Trump will do with his corporate tax plan regarding exports, as foreign sales account for 31% of the company's total sales.As part of a larger revamp meant to ease the overall tax burden on companies, Trump and House Republicans have backed a plan that would end taxes on exports and impose a 20% tax on imports.Lockheed shares closed 0.1% higher at 256.74 in the stock market today. Raytheon edged up less than 0.1% to 148.19.Trump has also been critical of the F-35's costs, though the Pentagon and Lockheed had already been working to reduce prices.Last week, the Defense Department reached an $8.2 billion deal for 90 F-35s, representing the 10th batch of fighters. Tanner said Wednesday: ""hopefully every party is satisfied, or else they shouldn't have agreed to it.""Talks are ongoing for the 11th production batch, and Tanner said he hopes they will wrap up by late Q3 or early Q4.But the 9th lot, the contract for which was awarded last year, remains an issue. Earlier, Lockheed said the deal was a ""unilateral contract action"" on the Pentagon's part as both sides struggled to reach an agreement.On Wednesday, Tanner said the company has grounds for legal or other action and is still looking at its options.RELATED: What The Air Force Chief Said In His 5 Minutes With TrumpLockheed Sees 2017 Jump In F-35s But Guides Profit Low Amid Cost Flap

131,RTN,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein said that each member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was given five minutes with President Trump last week to talk about their respective military branches and what they do.When his turn came, Goldfein said at a Mitchell Institute breakfast Friday that he stressed the importance of the Air Force's role in the nuclear triad — weapons delivered by land-based missiles, strategic bombers and submarines — space operations and manpower.He didn't specifically mention Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, of which the Air Force is the biggest buyer.""We have two of the three legs of the nuclear triad and on our worst day as a nation our job as the United States Air Force is to make sure you are where you need to be and make sure you remain connected to nuclear command and control,"" he recounted telling Trump, just before James Mattis was sworn in as defense secretary at a Pentagon ceremony last week.Goldfein also pointed out that the Air Force is responsible for GPS and communications satellites as well as other space-based assets. He stressed the need to continue maintaining air and space superiority, including ""the freedom from attack and the freedom to move"" in both domains.Lastly, Goldfein told Trump about personnel shortages, saying the Air Force was ""too big for the resources we've been given and too small for what the nation demands"" as the service's role expands.Trump's talk with the service chiefs comes as his administration plans to boost spending on weapons and troops, with several big-ticket programs on the way, including Air Force nuclear programs.Last year, the service released its requests for proposals for intercontinental ballistic missiles to replace Boeing's (BA) aging Minuteman system and is also seeking Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. Lockheed, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing are expected to bid, and initial contracts could be awarded this year.Northrop is also developing the B-21 Raider long-range strategic bomber to replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s. Analysts have put the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.Boeing shares edged up 0.1% to 162.40 on the stock market today. Northrop shares climbed 0.7%, Raytheon 0.9% and Lockheed 1%.To develop new rockets, the Pentagon has been working with Boeing, Elon Musk's Space X and others in the private sector.Space X's Falcon 9 was decertified in September after a rocket exploded on the launchpad, but Goldfein said it is ""right on track"" be recertified for national security launches.The Air Force has been tasked to transition to at least two independent domestic commercial launch providers to help drive competition, lower costs and end its reliance on Russian-made rocket engines. Previously, a Boeing-Lockheed joint venture, United Launch Alliance, held a virtual monopoly on Pentagon launches.RELATED: Air Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

132,RTN,"CEOs of Dow stocks General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and 14 other big U.S. exporters are warning that unless Republicans embrace a controversial tax on imports, a once-in-a-generation chance at tax reform will fail and American workers would be the losers.""Our tax code penalizes American workers who make products or provide services sold abroad, while favoring their international competitors,"" the CEOs wrote in a letter to leaders of both parties in Congress.Among other companies whose CEOs co-signed the letter were Caterpillar (CAT), Dow Chemical (DOW), Raytheon (RTN), United Technologies (UTX), Oracle (ORCL) and some of the biggest drug and biotech companies: Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Caterpillar, Merck, Pfizer and United Technologies also are members of the Dow Jones industrial average, in addition to General Electric and Boeing.The letter puts some of the largest U.S. companies squarely behind House Speaker Paul Ryan and other House GOP leaders, who argue that leveling the international playing field by cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20% (or lower) will be impossible without their plan for a 20% tax on imports, which would raise $1 trillion over a decade.Yet the biggest surprise about the letter may be just how few companies signed it, while more than 100 companies, including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Nike (NKE) and the American subsidiary of Toyota (TM), and dozens of trade groups have signed onto the Americans for Affordable Products, created to oppose the House border tax proposal. (Wal-Mart and Nike are also Dow industrials stocks.)Retail stocks were under pressure from early December, as prospects for a border tax were on the rise, but they've made a modest recovery lately as prospects faded. On Tuesday, perhaps helped more by Wal-Mart's positive earnings report as well-received Macy's (M) earnings than weighed down by a revved-up lobbying campaign for the tax, retail shares were on rise. Wal-Mart rose 3% to close at 71.45 on the stock market today, while Target added 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.Under the House proposal for a border-adjusted tax, U.S. companies would pay a 20% tax rate on the full value of imported goods, while export revenue would be tax-free. The border tax would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade to offset the cost of lowering the 35% statutory tax rate to 20%, the conservative Tax Foundation has said.Without the border tax, the ability of Congress to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate will be limited to ""incremental tweaks (that) will not level the playing field for American workers or dramatically reinvigorate economic growth,"" the CEO letter said.It's not clear precisely why so few companies came out in favor of the border tax. Although the proposal seems to be running into a buzz saw among Republicans in the Senate, it's possible that the letter wasn't widely circulated. However, Caroline Freund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has predicted that ""many more big lobbies will be against the BAT (border-adjusted tax) than in favor."" That's because the tax favors labor-intensive industries that export more than they import, with aerospace being a rare example.There's one nagging question about why companies such as GE and Boeing that are so dependent upon exports would back the border tax. Most trade experts who have looked at the tax have big doubts that it would comply with World Trade Organization rules, so it could lead the U.S. into a trade war. Given that uncertainty and the possible consequences, it's hard to understand why companies so dependent upon trade would support the border tax, yet that may partly explain why the list of supporters is so small.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse GOP Border-Tax Plan Would Sock U.S. Tourism — Including Trump Hotels

133,RTN,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) announced Wednesday that it was dropping out of the Air Force's T-X contest, a week after Raytheon (RTN) ended its partnership with Italy's Leonardo on a bid for the trainer.Northrop and partner BAE Systems said in a release that they are dropping out of the race as ""it would not be in the best interest of the companies and their shareholders.""Northrop shares rose dipped 0.1% to 228.82 on the stock market today. Raytheon shares rose 0.5%.Right now Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) are the only contenders for the $16.3 billion, 350-aircraft contract. And Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, thinks Lockheed has the advantage.""You need one of two things to survive a price shootout competition,"" he said. ""You need either no upfront costs or sheer determination and a little bit of desperation.""Lockheed and partner Korea Aerospace Industries are using the existing T-50As and have ""absolutely no upfront costs to speak of to roll into the contract price,"" Aboulafia said.Boeing on the other hand is building a clean-sheet design that is ""heavily optimized"" for the T-X mission, according to Aboulafia. ""They are really eager and aggressive to win it. That matters. You get points for that.""Northrop, an early front-runner for its expertise in building the existing T-38 trainers, already has the B-21 bomber contract and lacks the desperation that Boeing has in the airframe space.Northrop is ""going to be a surviving military airframer into the 2030s. For Boeing, the jury is out.""Boeing lost the B-21 bid in 2015, and production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet will eventually wind down, leaving analysts wondering if Boeing's storied history of building bombers and fighters is coming to an end.Lockheed shares fell 0.2%. Boeing shares rose 0.3%.Last week Raytheon bowed out of the running, saying it and Leonardo were ""unable to reach a business agreement that is in the best interest of the U.S. Air Force.""Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS Markit, said price was probably the reason the Northrop and Raytheon teams dropped out.""No way industry can meet the spec at the unit price USAF wants,"" he wrote in an email. ""You can't get Ferrari performance at a Chevy price.""He said that the Air Force either has to raise the acquisition budget or reduce the number of planes it buys. But getting a larger budget could be a problem under President Trump.""I think the president is going to spend more money on combat aircraft, tanks, ships, sustainment, weapons and missiles than on more for the trainer budget.""Another reason for the possible dropouts is profitability concerns.Profits for subcontractors in the fields of radar and other systems have been much higher than being a prime contractor for a major weapons system, said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.He said this was especially true of Northrop, given its lead role for the B-21 program.RELATED: Lockheed Sees 2017 Jump In F-35s But Guides Profit Low Amid Cost FlapNorthrop, Raytheon Join Lockheed With Weak Views But New Budget Looms

Both gave weak guidance, following cautious outlooks from Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) earlier this week.But Raytheon noted that its 2017 guidance is based on current Pentagon spending plans.

The company forecast a 5.6% compound annual growth rate in revenue from 2016 through 2020, helped by an already-large backlog, which stood at $59.8 billion at the end of 2016.CFO Jason Aiken said on a conference call that GD sees ""notionally upward-directional budgets that underpin and support the defense programs across the board.""The bullish forecast from General Dynamics follows weaker ones from Raytheon (RTN), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) this past week, as the industry awaits more details on defense spending from President Trump, who campaigned on stronger national security and a more aggressive approach to combating ISIS.Shares of General Dynamics, which makes tanks, Navy ships and Gulfstream business jets, jumped 4.4% to 185.12 on the stock market today, breaking out of a flat base with a 180.19 buy point.

In September, Boeing estimated China would need 6,810 airplanes, valued at $1 trillion, over the next 20 years.To stay competitive Muilenburg said the planned 737 completion plant in Zhoushan is ""an important part of the partnership equation.""""That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.,"" he said. ""It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.""Muilenburg was bullish on Trump's focus on the American workforce and tax reforms and regulations for the aerospace sector, but Citron Research warned earlier this month that Trump is a big threat to the industry as he looks to lower military aircraft costs.But strong Q4 results sent Boeing shares up 4.2% to 167.36, hitting record highs on the stock market today, continuing to break out after just clearing a 160.17 buy point on Monday.

But Muilenburg met with Trump and said the company could build a new Air Force One for under $4 billion.But Trump also tweeted last month that he asked Boeing to price out a F/A-18 Super Hornet ""comparable"" to the F-35. But Pentagon officials said they need the new Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 for stealth and other fifth-generation capabilities that the Super Hornet lacks.Shares of Lockheed, which reported Q4 results above analyst views on Tuesday but gave weak 2017 EPS guidance, dipped 1.1% Wednesday.Also Wednesday, Textron (TXT) said Q4 earnings fell 3.7% to 78 cents per share, falling short of views 87 cents.

139,RTN,"As tensions rise with North Korea, which is reportedly able to put nuclear weapons on ballistic missiles that can reach the U.S., America's missile defense systems may be put to the test.But there is no single system. Instead, different systems are designed to intercept warheads at various stages. Here are how some of them work:The Patriot first gained popularity for success against Iraq's Scud missiles during the first Gulf War. Raytheon (RTN) makes the system while Lockheed Martin (LMT) produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) interceptor missiles.The system is useful against conventional weapons. It has a range of just 12 miles and works by intercepting missiles in the low atmosphere in their final approach toward the target, or terminal phase.But a key vulnerability of defenses like the Patriot is that nuclear missiles will deliver multiple warheads and decoys, unlike conventional missiles.""When you're dealing with nuclear, you can't just deal with half, you have to get them all,"" said Tom Collina, director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund, which is focused on reducing nuclear weapons.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is designed to shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase. The system has a range of 124 miles and can intercept missiles both inside and right outside the Earth's atmosphere.

140,RTN,"The THAAD system is currently deployed in South Korea, Guam and Alaska. Last month, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency announced that its THAAD system in Kodiak, Alaska, successfully intercepted an intermediate-range ballistic missile for the first time in a test. So far, the system has a perfect 14-out-of-14 record in tests since 2005.The ship-based Aeigs system can protect against short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during the midflight or terminal stages, and its powerful long-range radar can be used to help improve the accuracy of the Patriot or THAAD. The Aegis can also hit land-based targets, submarines and surface shipsCurrently, there are 84 U.S. Navy ships in service with the weapons system, while Japan and South Korea are in the process of updating their Aegis systems. There is also an onshore variant set to be deployed in Romania and Poland.Boeing's (BA) Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system is designed to intercept ballistic missiles in midcourse flight.But so far tests have been spotty. In May, the antimissile system was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and successfully intercepted a target ICBM fired from the Marshall Islands. It was the 10th successful test in 18 attempts, but prior tests have failed, including two tests in 2010 that were carefully scripted with the dimensions, trajectory and speed as known factors.""Missile defense has taken on a mythical quality right now,"" Collina said. ""They aren't testing the stressful stuff. So they still won't tell you if it works in a real-world situation.""Defenses that target missiles while they are still climbing — before any decoys or countermeasures are released — could in theory get around the problem of decoys and other countermeasures. But a current U.S. boost-phase capability hasn't been fielded.Laura Grego, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the Air Force looked into using a laser that's mounted in a Boeing 747 — to shoot down missiles in their boost phase — but the plan was scrapped for being too expensive. Drones could do the same job, but Grego said she isn't sure the technology is ready.""I think we need to move to boost phase,"" she said. ""The problem with boost phase is that you only have a few minutes (to react), so you have to be close by. So China and Russia could just move launchpads into the interior of the country so you'll never get close enough.""RELATED:Raytheon Hits New High As Latest N.

142,RTN,"The Pentagon has picked Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) to advance to the next stage of a competition for new nuclear-armed cruise missiles that could be launched from bombers like Northrop Grumman's (NOC) forthcoming B-21.XThe Long Range Standoff (LRSO) weapon will replace aging AGM-86B Air Launched Cruise Missiles made by Boeing (BA). Those missiles were initially fielded in the early 1980s.The LRSO is meant to hit targets from long ranges without putting bombers at risk of getting shot down. But critics have charged that the Pentagon doesn't need the LRSO as the B-21 is supposed to be stealthy enough to elude enemy air defenses.Lockheed and Raytheon each received $900 million contracts to develop the technologies for the LRSO and demonstrate the new weapon's reliability, the Air Force announced late Monday. The service will then pick one company to manufacture the LRSO, whose cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion.The Air Force plans to start fielding the next-generation nuclear cruise missile in the late 2020s. Meanwhile, the B-21 is expected to enter service in 2025.""This weapon will modernize the air-based leg of the nuclear triad,"" said Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson in a statement about the LRSO. ""Deterrence works if our adversaries know that we can hold at risk things they value. This weapon will enhance our ability to do so, and we must modernize it cost-effectively.""Shares of Lockheed were flat on the stock market today, but still above buy range. Raytheon rose 0.1%, also above buying territory. Boeing ticked up 0.1%, and Northrop eased 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? Leaderboard is having its best month of the year and the YTD distance is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500.Earlier this week, the Pentagon awarded Boeing and Northrop with similar early-stage development contract for new nuclear ballistic missiles to replace Boeing-made Minuteman IIIs.The Pentagon will then award a single, final contract for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent in late fiscal 2020, with deployment seen in the late 2020s. That contract will be worth up to $85 billion, according to the Pentagon's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. However, the Air Force has put the number around $62 billion.Those contracts will build on earlier deals to upgrade strategic bombers and submarines.In 2015, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s. Development and procurement costs are expected run as much as $80 billion.The Navy has a program underway to replace its Ohio-class nuclear missile submarines. The Columbia-class subs, which are being built by General Dynamics (GD), are expected to be deployed in the 2030s and carry an estimated acquisition cost of about $100 billion.RELATED:Here's How Lucrative A Nuclear Missile Deal May Be For Boeing, NorthropWhat Trump's Afghanistan Strategy Means For Defense StocksMissile Defense Stocks Boosted As Trump's Nuclear Offense Claim DebunkedDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsThe Dow's Top Stock Finally Has A New Entry Point

143,RTN,"The Pentagon is drafting its budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 — the first that will fully show the Trump administration's vision for military spending — and events in Afghanistan, the Korean Peninsula and the U.S. Navy may weigh on the White House's priorities for defense dollars.""The 2017 and 2018 budgets were mostly about just trying to recover some readiness, they didn't look at sustainment and new investment and capabilities,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS.President Trump is reportedly going to announce the deployment of 4,000 more troops as part of his long-awaited plan for Afghanistan when he address the nation tonight at 9 p.m. ET.Hunter said that isn't a major increase, so defense contractors in Afghanistan are unlikely to see a big spike in business. But the troop buildup also means Trump won't withdraw U.S. troops and produce a huge negative for companies.""If Trump had decided to scale back U.S. commitment and withdrawal, those engaged with Afghan security forces couldn't stay there,"" Hunter told IBD.Makers of ground vehicles, like General Dynamics (GD), could get a boost — as well as the companies that help maintain vehicles for the Afghan military.Sales of the low-cost A-29 Super Tucano aircraft, used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force for counterterrorism missions, could also get a boost, Hunter added.The plane's performance in Afghanistan could have implications for the U.S. arsenal too. The Air Force is looking at possibly buying up to 300 low-cost attack aircraft by 2022, to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses as missions continue in the Middle East.The Super Tucano, made jointly by privately held Sierra Nevada and Brazil's Embraer (ERJ), is participating in a U.S. Air Force experiment with light-attack aircraft, along with the Textron (TXT) Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine and the AT-802L Longsword by L3 Technologies (LLL).U.S. and South Korea forces will conduct previously scheduled joint military exercises this week despite pressure from North Korea and China to cancel the event.The war games could prompt North Korea to ratchet up pressure again, after pulling back from its threats to launch missiles toward Guam.Hunter said missile defense spending would have to increase to meet the short-term demands of more intercepts in addition to longer-term R&D, noting that the Office of Management and Budget put out a memo last week that put missile defense at the top of its R&D priorities list.Raytheon (RTN) makes the Patriot system while Lockheed Martin (LMT) builds the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, which is currently deployed outside Seoul, and Boeing (BA) is the prime on the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system used to protect the U.S.RELATED: As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense Works Late Sunday, the USS John S.

146,RTN,"PALMDALE, Calif. — With new sensors and airframe upgrades, Lockheed Martin's (LMT) legendary U-2 spy plane could stay flying for another 40 years or more, which would mark a century of secret reconnaissance from the program.XThe U-2, nicknamed ""The Dragon Lady,"" first flew in 1955 and for decades took photos over war zones and enemy airspace. The Air Force had plans to retire the program in 2019 to save money, but then changed its mind as demand for battlefield intelligence surged during the U.S. campaign against ISIS.The U-2 aircraft in service now were built in the mid-1980s and have about 15,000-16,000 flight hours on them, a fifth of the 75,000 total hours that the planes were designed to withstand, Kyle Franklin, Lockheed's U-2 program director, told IBD at the company's secretive Skunk Works facility""It's an old program,"" he said in an interview. ""But 85% of the life cycle is still left in it.""To keep the high flying spy planes in airworthy shape, Lockheed completely takes apart the U-2 every seven years and rebuilds it to conduct structural inspections and do preventative maintenance.No new U-2 planes are expected to be built, but Franklin is ""confident"" that the existing ones could be flown through the 2040s and could even be ""fielded to 2060 and beyond.""Lockheed shares were down 0.1% at 296.78 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, but still above buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed stock is extended out of buy range, but you can find other top stocks near a buy range among IBD's review screens that sort out stocks poised for a breakout and give detailed chart analysis.Before the U.S. spied on adversaries with satellites in space, there was the U-2, which flies at the edge of space at 70,000 fleet, twice the elevation of commercial airliners. Pilots wear a specialized flight suit that resembles something astronauts wear in space and during long missions eat food, such as caffeinated pudding, out of a tube.During the Cold War, U-2 pilot Gary Powers was shot down over Russia in 1960, then pictures taken on a U-2 mission two years later sparked the Cuban Missile Crisis. The plane was also used in the Vietnam War, and during the first Gulf War it monitored Iraqi troop movements and the location of Scud missiles.Today, U-2s look for IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan and are also used by NASA to track weather data and can be deployed as part of peacetime rescue operations.As the plane's missions evolved, updates were needed. In the 1990s, it was outfitted with new engines. And in the early 2000s, pilots got an updated cockpit that lowered the cabin pressure from that experienced at 30,000 feet, which is roughly the height of Mt. Everest, to the equivalent of 15,000 feet.The latest improvement for the venerable U-2 is smaller, updated sensors, allowing the plane to hold more reconnaissance technology. Lockheed declined to offer more detail.Next year, Lockheed will start test-flying the U-2 with Raytheon's (RTN) updated ASARS-2B radar system, which has increased detection ranges and improved image quality vs. prior versions.Mark Cole, Lockheed's director of business development at the Skunk Works and a former U-2 pilot, said as new technology enables sensors to get smaller, more of them can go on the plane.""As the sensor technology matures, you can put more technology on it,"" he said.The U-2 is also being modernized to meet the Air Force's goal of Open Mission Systems, which is meant to make subsequent updates quicker and cheaper.Lockheed is currently working with the Air Force to figure out a road map and budget guideline for the U-2, and that should be completed sometime this quarter.But don't expect an unmanned system as a future update for the U-2.""We revisit it every 10 years or so,"" Franklin said. ""It can be done, but is it solving a problem? For some of our missions, a man in the loop is very important.""Cole called Northrop Grumman's (NOC) Global Hawk a ""complementing system"" and said that ""the U-2 can do stuff the Global Hawk can't.""RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhat Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

147,RTN,"Missile defense providers Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) rallied to new record highs Wednesday after President Trump vowed to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea amid reports that its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs are advancing more quickly than expected.XTim Cahill, the vice president of Lockheed's Air and Missile Defense business, told Reuters on Tuesday that interest in its missile defense systems has increased in the last 12 to 18 months.Last month, a Lockheed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery in Alaska intercepted a test missile launched from an Air Force cargo plane near Hawaii. The THAAD system is also deployed in South Korea — to the objection of China, which complains that the system's radar could be used for offensive purposes.Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan are having Raytheon upgrade their Patriot systems. NATO member Poland signed a memorandum of understanding to buy Patriot systems after Trump visited that country in July, and the State Department approved the sale of seven Patriot Configuration 3+ defense systems for another NATO partner, Romania.Shares of Lockheed climbed 1.6% to 304.82 on the stock market today, Raytheon jumped 2.3% to 178.75.

Among other defense contractors, Northrop Grumman (NOC) rose 1%, also hitting a new high and above buy range, while General Dynamics (GD) gained 1.4% to retake its 50-day average.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed and Raytheon's stock are extended out of buy range, but you can find other top stocks near their buy range among IBD's review screens that sort out stocks poised for a breakout and give detailed chart analysis.On Wednesday, Trump also implied that he's made America's nuclear arsenal more powerful, though defense observers have pointed out that new weapons won't be fielded until the next decade.My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017In January, Trump signed an executive order for the Pentagon to start a Nuclear Posture Review, but a purchasing plan to modernize the system was started by the Obama administration and isn't expected to be completed until the 2020s.The Pentagon also hasn't awarded contracts yet for new ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable cruise missiles, though they could come this fiscal year. Boeing (BA), Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon are among the companies vying for the contracts. Deployment of the new ballistic missiles is expected in the late 2020s, and the Air Force plans to start fielding the cruise missiles by 2030.Last year, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, and the Navy has a program underway to replace its Ohio-class submarines, which can launch nuclear missiles.

While he announced no specifics about troop numbers or a timeline for the war in Afghanistan, he did say U.S. won't be ""nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.""This shift in focus will change the requirements for weapons systems needed in the war.""American troops will do a decapitation campaign similar to what is going on in Yemen,"" Phillip Lohaus, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said of Trump's policy. ""What that means is essentially more of a reliance on drone strikes and on raids and less of a reliance on troops as a stability presence.""While the stealth fighter isn't deployed in Afghanistan, Trump's seeming commitment to the war there could good long-term news for the F-35, which has high-end sensors that can act like a linchpin guiding other air and ground forces as well as drop bombs and support raids, Lohaus said.Trump's policy is also good for munition makers like Lockheed, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing (BA), whose Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kit, which turns ""dumb"" bombs ""smart.""Lohaus also said to expect more major munition drops like the Massive Ordnance Air Blast, which was used earlier this year in Afghanistan.Lockheed shares closed up 1% at 304.80 on the stock market today, Boeing added 1.7%, and Raytheon gained 1.4%.Helicopters are used to ferry troops and supplies as well as provide air cover.

155,RTN,"Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, who has been tapped as defense secretary, said Thursday that Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 stealth fighter is key for the U.S. and its allies and supports having human pilots fly Northrop Grumman's (NOC) forthcoming B-21 bomber.The F-35 — which has an acquisition price tag of about $400 billion for more than 2,400 planes — has come under sustained criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who again blasted the program Wednesday for being behind schedule and over budget. He also suggested the F-35 would face competition from Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet.The F-35 ""is critical for our own air superiority in the future because of stealth characteristics and some of the electronics capability that's inherent in the airplane,"" Mattis said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.Trump has ""in no way shown any lack of support"" for the F-35, he added, but just wants ""bang for his buck.""Top U.S. allies like the U.K., Israel, Italy and Australia are also partners on the F-35 program (which is in production) or are buyers.""Many of our allies have bet their air superiority on their F-35 program, and it bonds us closely together with them,"" Mattis said earlier.When asked about the B-21 Raider, he paused and said he supports a manned bomber. That program, which is in early development, has been criticized by Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain for not being more transparent on its total acquisition costs, which analysts have put at $50 billion to $80 billion.Northrop's B-21 isn't currently being designed to be unmanned but that capability would be a consideration in the future, the Air Force said last year.Shares of Lockheed closed down 1% at 252.62 on the stock market today. Northrop, which is also a major F-35 subcontractor, fell 1% as well to finish at 229.15, and Boeing slipped 0.7% to 158.29.Mattis also voiced support for the recapitalization of U.S. nuclear assets, including the Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarine, which will replace Ohio-class ""boomers,"" as well as development of new ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles.General Dynamics (GD) is the prime contractor for the Columbia-class subs, which are in the design phase.

158,RTN,"Overall prospects are good for the defense industry in 2017 as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to buy more warships and fighter jets, but analysts warn that a massive buildup on the scale of what was seen under President Ronald Reagan is unlikely.During his campaign, Trump said he would eliminate the ""sequester"" budget constraints on the Pentagon and increase spending. But after the election, Trump named Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a fiscal hawk and sequester backer, as the director of the Office of Management and Budget.""I'm very tempered in the kind of new money I would expect to see in any so-called buildup,"" and the defense industry should ""restrain expectations,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a national security analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.And despite Trump's aggressive campaign talk on defense, he has signaled reluctance to pay up, blasting the costs of Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement program and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. After his Twitter (TWTR) rants, top defense stocks gave up their postelection gains and haven't recovered.Wall Street expects Q4 numbers to show that growth at Lockheed, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon picked up in 2016, but it sees a slowdown in 2017, though that could change when the White House's plans become clearer.Analysts and investors will get their first look at Trump's spending priorities when he submits a defense supplemental budget request within his first 100 days. In the spring, the fiscal 2018 budget proposal comes out. And later in the year, the administration will lay out the Pentagon's next five-year plan.Trump has said he wants to grow the Army by 60,000 soldiers and the Marine Corps by 12,000 Marines as well as boost the Navy's fleet by 78 to 350 ships and add at least 100 combat aircraft at the Air Force.More troops mean the Pentagon will spend more on pay, health care, chow halls and housing. Those costs could crowd out demand for big-budget ground weapons, like a new armored vehicle to replace the Army's Bradley fighting vehicles and Abrams tanks, meaning limited upside for defense contractors hoping for lucrative deals.But targeting a certain fleet size means more Navy ships have to be ordered.Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, sees Trump adding more next-generation attack submarines, noting that the Virginia-class sub is already in serial production and should avoid Trump's ire.""They don't have the same problems that have been the subject of those tweets,"" Cancian told IBD. ""Those were programs that have had or have the prospects of significant cost increases.""But new Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarines could come under fire eventually, as their overall costs become more apparent, he added.General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls (HII) are building the Virginia-class subs, while GD is the prime contractor for the Columbia-class ""boomers,"" which are in the design phase.IBD'S TAKE: The defense industry isn't the only one falling prey to Trump's tweet storms. Trump attacked General Motors for sending Mexican-made cars to U.S. dealers and threatened to levy big import taxes on cars built outside the U.S.Trump has also been a proponent of strengthening America's nuclear arsenal, tweeting last month that the U.S. ""must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability"" and called for an arms race as Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly looks for missiles that can evade countermeasures.So the ballistic-missile subs, along with Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 Raider, could be safe from attack, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS Markit.Meanwhile, the Air Force's request for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system as well as Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles will also likely be funded.""Those are probably the two programs that are on the edge, and my guess is that (Trump) would buy both of those, whereas a Democratic administration might not have,"" Cancian said.The estimated cost of the ICBM program is $62 billion over 30 years, but reports say the Air Force's estimate is billions of dollars short. The LRSO plan's cost has been estimated at $20 billion to $30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two programs, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded this year.Another Air Force priority is the F-35, and Trump's pledge to give the Air Force 100 more combat aircraft could help the program, despite his suggestion that Lockheed's orders may be reduced in favor of more Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets.The Air Force is getting more than 70% of the Pentagon's total procurement of 2,443 F-35s, and it doesn't currently fly the Super Hornet, making it an unlikely addition to the service's fleet.The F-35 is also in production, and costs are already falling as output increases. IHS Markit's Bobbi said Trump will still likely fund the F-35 program after getting further price reductions.And flying under the radar is the Air Force's $16 billion T-X program for 350 trainer aircraft, which Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon are seeking. Bobbi said Trump ""has bigger fish to fry.""Israel is also buying the F-35 and recently increased its order amid a wider rebound in international defense spending as regional tensions in the Middle East, Asia and Europe intensify.Despite funding pressure from lower oil prices, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states will invest in more weapons systems as Iran is expected to update its arsenal. Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain already have F-15s and Super Hornets on order from Lockheed and Boeing.Cancian sees Japan and South Korea buying more missile defense systems from the U.S. as China adds military hardware to its man-made islands in the South China Seas and North Korea tests more nuclear warheads and missiles. South Korea plans to deploy Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system later this year, and Japan is considering it as well.IHS Jane's expects defense investment in the Baltic states to double over the next two years and Western European spending to ""strengthen over the next decade"" on Trump's threats to pull out of NATO unless other members contributed more.""Defense spending returned to a healthy rate of growth in 2016, kicking off what we expect to be a decade of stronger global defense spending,"" said Fenella McGerty, principal analyst at IHS Jane's, in a release. ""Defense spending should recover to pre-financial-crisis levels by 2018.""RELATED: Battle Stations!

159,RTN,"President Donald Trump is as risky for the aerospace industry as Hillary Clinton was to drug manufacturers, according to a report Friday from a noted short seller, which also warned on aerospace supplier TransDigm's (TDG).""President Trump has promised to end the long-standing, infuriating tradition of 'sticking the US Government with tab,' "" Citron Research said in a note. ""He has already made lowering prices for military aircraft a pillar of his transition into office.""During his transition, Trump took to Twitter (TWTR) to call out Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) over high costs for Air Force One and the F-35 program respectively.After meeting with Trump, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company could build a new Air Force One for under $4 billion.Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said after her meeting with Trump that an upcoming contract for the next batch of F-35 fighters will create thousands of jobs and that the company is near a deal for 90 additional F-35s that will ""significantly"" reduce the costs.Last month, the Pentagon's program office said that costs would likely come down ""6%-7%"" for the 10th batch of fighters.Boeing shares rose 0.3% to 159.53 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares climbed 0.3% to 257.73.But Boeing and Lockheed likely won't be the last aerospace companies that Trump targets. Citron wrote that TransDigm's business model relies too much on raising prices to turn a profit, potentially putting it in Trump's cross hairs in the future.The company ""acquires airplane parts companies (over 50 in total), fires employees, and egregiously raises prices"" just like drugmaker Valeant (VRX), Citron claimed.TransDigm didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Shares plunged 9.9% to 226.90.TransDigm is a major supplier to Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and other aerospace giants.IBD'S TAKE: The littoral combat ship, nuclear missiles and Northrop's B-21 are other defense programs Trump could take aim at next.Despite the perception that Trump would be friendlier to the drug industry than Clinton would have been, Trump has recently accused drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" on prices and has vowed to lower them.RELATED: Navy: Lockheed F-35 'On A Completely Different Level' Vs.

We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,"" according to ""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski.A Trump spokesman has since tried to downplay the remark.His latest comment also followed a nuclear call to arms Thursday from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is seeking missiles that can evade countermeasures.""We need to strengthen the strategic nuclear forces, for that we should develop missiles capable of penetrating any current and prospective missile defense systems,"" Putin said at a defense ministry meeting, according to Tass news agency.On Friday, he said during a news conference, ""We will never get dragged into an arms race where we spend resources that we can't afford.""America's nuclear triad of air-, land- and sea-based delivery systems is nearing the end of its life span and needs to be replaced. But that won't come cheaply.Over the summer, the Air Force released its requests for proposals for intercontinental ballistic missiles to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system. The Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years, but a report from the Pentagon's office of independent cost assessment said the Air Force's estimate is too low by ""billions of dollars,"" sources told Bloomberg.The Air Force is also seeking Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. That program's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion.Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing (BA) are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts could be awarded next year.The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016Last year, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s. The Air Force has put the development-phase cost for the B-21 at $23.5 billion, but analysts have estimated the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.The Navy's program to replace its Ohio-class submarines, which can launch nuclear missiles, will cost the service $100 billion.Lockheed shares closed down 1.3% on the stock market today. Northrop dipped 0.3%, Raytheon ended flat, and Boeing gained 0.2%. General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls (HII), which build submarines, finished up 0.4% and down 0.5%, respectively.Trump's affirmation of U.S. nuclear capabilities comes a year after appearing to be stumped by a question on his priorities for the triad and follows recent criticism on the cost of Lockheed's $400 billion F-35 program and Boeing's Air Force One replacement planes.Late Thursday, Trump tweeted that he has asked Boeing to price out F/A-18 Super Hornets, citing the cost of Lockheed's F-35.
"
162,RTN,"Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for defense secretary, may have to recuse himself for at least a year from decisions involving General Dynamics (GD) — the fifth-biggest U.S. defense supplier with $10 billion in contracts last year — after serving on its board.That would take Mattis out of the loop on billion-dollar decisions across the military services. For one, the Pentagon may buy ground-warfare vehicles from General Dynamics for the 65,000 Army troops Trump has promised to add. The company also may benefit from Trump's pledge to expand the Navy to 350 vessels by supplying its Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and Virginia-class nuclear submarines.Most immediately, General Dynamics is the lead contractor to build 12 of the new nuclear missile submarines to replace the aging Ohio class — the Navy's top-priority program. Unless current Secretary Ash Carter acts before departing, Mattis and his deputies may inherit a decision on letting the program enter full-scale development. They would also oversee a planned major increase in its funding in the fiscal 2018-2022 plan. A new draft Navy estimate sees procurement spending increasing to $2.8 billion in fiscal 2019 from $773 million this year.""Mattis will have to recuse himself for at least one year from any contracting issues dealing with the company"" under government ethics regulations in addition to shedding his General Dynamics holdings, Richard Painter, who was chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said in an interview.As a General Dynamics director since August 2013, Mattis has received at least $276,000 in fees plus equity awards valued at more than $1.03 million as of Tuesday's close in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About half of those awards are scheduled to vest in the coming years only if Mattis stays on the board.The company's proxy filing didn't specify what happens to unvested awards given to directors who leave for a job in government. Lucy Ryan, a company spokeswoman, declined to comment beyond the filing.The Trump transition office didn't respond to an e-mailed request for comment about how Mattis intends to handle potential conflicts of interest. Mattis, who retired after a 41-year career in the Marines, has yet to fill out the standard government financial disclosure statement and questionnaire required by the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will hold the confirmation hearing on his nomination, so the full extent of his assets and holdings aren't known.Questions raised by Mattis's participation on the General Dynamics board ""are precisely the kinds of issues the committee must examine during the confirmation process,"" said Chip Unruh, a spokesman for Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the committee's top Democrat.While Mattis would be likely to adjust the Pentagon's budget proposal for fiscal 2018, which is already being crafted, he may have to step back from decisions such as policies and contracts directly affecting Falls Church, Va.-based General Dynamics.""We think he should recuse himself from decisions regarding General Dynamics for at least two years,"" said Mandy Smithberger, a director with the Project on Government Oversight, a defense watchdog organization. ""'Draining the swamp' has to start with the Pentagon,"" said Smithberger, invoking a Trump campaign slogan.Decisions on how Cabinet officials avoid or resolve potential conflicts of interest are reviewed and enforced by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which can spell out requirements to divest assets, to refrain from making decisions that pose a conflict -- or both -- to meet requirements of regulations and law.A guidebook issued to nominees by the ethics office says ""the ethics rules prohibit you from participating as a government official in any particular matter involving specific parties if you have a 'covered relationship' with a party to the matter (or with the representative of a party), whenever a reasonable person would question your impartiality.""A ""covered relationship"" includes ""any organization in which you held a position in the past year or are currently serving as an 'active member,'"" according to the guide.Mattis is a respected figure on Capitol Hill, especially in the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will review the agreement he reaches with the ethics office, the White House and the Defense Department before voting on his nomination. Congress also will have to pass legislation exempting Mattis from a ban on serving as defense secretary within seven years of leaving the military.Under President Barack Obama, some administration officials have been permitted to retain their stock and benefits packages — even the use of corporate offices and travel services — while pledging in ethics agreements to recuse themselves from matters involving their prior employers.Top Pentagon officials often have followed stricter standards when holdings in defense industries are involved.When Deborah Lee James became secretary of the Air Force in 2013, she divested all her stock in defense contractor Science Applications International Corp., her prior employer. She took a pro-rated $150,000 payout on her unvested stock and forfeited the remainder. She pledged to avoid matters involving the company for two years, according to her ethics agreement.The last time a defense official's nomination was slowed over ethics questions was in 2009 with William J. Lynn's nomination to be the new Obama administration's deputy defense secretary. The Raytheon (RTN) executive was a registered lobbyist.Under pressure from Armed Services Committee member Ariz. Sen. John McCain, who's now chairman, Lynn agreed he wouldn't ask to participate in any decision involving six Raytheon programs on which he had served as lobbyist. He also agreed to divest restricted Raytheon stock valued at as much as $500,000 that didn't vest until late 2009 or 2010.""These kinds of situations are not uncommon for nominees at the most senior levels of the Department of Defense,"" said Dustin Walker, a spokesman for McCain. ""That is why the Armed Services Committee has policies in place to address them in the confirmation process.""
"
163,RTN,"ARLINGTON, Va. — President-elect Donald Trump has Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 in his cross hairs as an example of ""out of control"" costs at the Pentagon, but the Joint Strike Fighter's program office said Monday that costs for the next batch of jets will be down ""significantly.""Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager, said Trump's transition team hadn't been briefed by the program office before his tweet about the cost last week. The team has since called to ask more about it, but a meeting hasn't been ""fully scheduled yet.""""I have no doubt that given the controversy over the F-35 program over the years that there is a perception the program is out of control as the first F-35s cost twice as much as we thought they were going to. That's in the past,"" Bogdan told reporters at a briefing.If given the chance to speak to Trump, he would give ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" about the $400 billion stealth fighter program.Under last month's $6.1. billion contract with Lockheed for the ninth batch of 57 F-35s, the cost for the Air Force's A model fell 5.5% to $102.1 million vs. the eighth lot, and the Marines' B model fell 1.8% to $131.6 million.But the Navy's C model rose 2.5% to $132.2 million as two fewer jets were ordered in lot nine.The Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the 10th lot of F-35s, with the cost for each variant seen coming down 6%-7%, Bogdan said.Meanwhile, updating the Autonomic Logistics Information System, the so called brains of the plane, has been ""harder than expected,"" he added.The software will be fielded in February, two months later than anticipated, and issues with insulation on coolant lines have caused production to slow down and won't be caught up until August 2017.Lockheed shares closed up 0.8% on the stock market today. Shares of United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt and Whitney division makes the engines for the fighter, rose 2% on an analyst upgrade. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a key subcontractor on the F-35, edged up 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: The F-35 wasn't the only program to come under fire from Trump. He first threatened to cancel Boeing's Air Force One program.Despite Monday's gains, shares of Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon (RTN) have yet to recover from Trump's F-35 criticism last week, as analysts see high-profile weapons programs coming under more scrutiny.Earlier Monday at an Atlantic Council event, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said she had met with the transition team and explained that ""it's not quite as easy as it seems to get these costs down,"" according to reports.RELATED:Navy Faces Carrier Jet Shortfall, Reportedly Looking At More Super HornetsIsrael Thinks Lockheed F-35s Are Still Awesome, Will Buy More

164,RTN,"Boeing (BA) plans to reduce its commercial-aircraft workforce by 8% by the end of this year with more reductions coming next year, according to reports of a company memo, as European rival Airbus (EADSY) grabs market share.That also comes a week after the aerospace giant announced a 30% dividend hike and a $14 billion stock buyback program.Boeing had signaled earlier this year that it would cut about 4.8% from the commercial division this year, with management reportedly telling workers that the Airbus A321neo was ""stealing massive orders from the 737,"" which makes up the bulk of Boeing's sales.The 8% cut this year, which includes a 10% reduction of executives and managers, was billed as a way to increase overall competitiveness, Reuters reported.The 2017 reduction is expected to be voluntary but Boeing could resort to involuntary cuts, according to Dow Jones.Boeing shares finished 1.1% higher at 156.18 on the stock market today, rising further above buy range after an October breakout.The layoffs come amid several changes for Boeing. Last month, the company named Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric's (GE) aviation business, to head the commercial unit.Production rates for the current-generation 777 are also set to slow as the company gears up for the 777X, and demand for the 747 is waning.Meanwhile, Boeing said earlier this year there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane as well as a longer version of its 737 Max in response to the A321 neo.While that sounds like a major drain on cash, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told analysts at a conference that the company could do both without ""changing our R&D and capex profile"" in the next five years, according to Bloomberg.IBD'S TAKE: Delta Air Lines and Alaska Air shares are both near record highs, but the carriers will end their code-sharing alliance next April.And the election of Donald Trump has proved to be another question mark for Boeing. While the stock has rallied since Election Day, Trump's anti-trade stance could result in some blowback for Boeing's export orders, and his skepticism on big-ticket defense spending could hit Boeing's military programs.Trump has criticized plans for new Air Force One plans with Boeing and decried the cost of the F-35 fighter jet by Lockheed Martin (LMT).But shares of Pentagon contractors like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) have suffered more, as Boeing is seen as less exposed to the defense budget.Northrop Grumman, Lockheed and Raytheon shares rose 0.8%.RELATED:Boeing Sets $16.6 Billion, 80-Jet Iran Air Deal, Still Curbs 777 ProductionLockheed's F-35 Isn't Stealthy Enough To Avoid Trump's Latest Attack

168,RTN,"Boeing (BA) will report second-quarter results Wednesday and analysts are looking for more details about the profitability of the 737 Max line, signs of any new charges on its KC-46 tanker program for the Air Force, foreign military sales, and plans for its new midrange plane.Analysts see the aerospace giant swinging to a profit of $2.32 per share from a loss of 44 cents a share a year ago, when Boeing took $3 billion in pretax charges related to its 787, 747 and KC-46 tanker aircraft programs. Revenue is expected to fall 7.2% to $22.96 billion, as commercial aircraft deliveries in Q2 fell 8% to 183.""It will be interesting to see commercial jet profit just as you're starting to see the 737 Max phase in,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group. ""They know how to build a next-generation 737, but how will they transition into a profitable 737 Max with 777 numbers coming down? More and more profitability is now depending on the 737 line.""On the defense side, more charges are a possibility.Last month, the Air Force said it doesn't expect Boeing to deliver the first of its new tankers until next year, over delays getting FAA airworthiness certifications and completing flight tests, despite assurances from Boeing that deliveries would start by the end of this year.Boeing has said the issues related to the KC-46 tanker are over. But Aboulafia won't rule out another surprise. ""It seems to be behind them, but who can say with that program.""Aboulafia will also be looking for more detail about the Qatar's $12 billion F-15 order as tensions heat up in the Persian Gulf, with President Trump accusing Doha of funding terrorist groups.The F-15 sales are crucial as Boeing seeks to extend production on the aircraft beyond 2019, after completing an order for Saudi Arabia.Analysts will also be eager for an update on Boeing's midmarket plane which analysts have dubbed the 797, in an effort to take back market share from Airbus and its popular A321neo.During the Paris Air Show, Mike Delaney, general manager of airplane developments at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the new plane's fuselage would have a ""hybrid"" cross-section, according to Reuters, but was light on details.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) will also report results Wednesday, and Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled for Thursday.Last week, Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year guidance as increased F-35 sales helped lift Q2 earnings and revenue well above analyst estimates.RELATED: Boeing, Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In Space

The deal is valued at $3.9 billion.Congress still has to approve the deal before it can move forward.Raytheon shares were up 0.2% to 166.9072 on the stock market today. Lockheed reversed to close down 6 cents at 286.36.Earlier this month, Poland singed a memorandum of understanding to buy the Patriot system during President Trump's visit to Warsaw ahead of the G-20 meeting in Germany.Poland had said since March that it expected to sign a deal worth up to $7.6 billion to buy eight Patriot missile defense systems by the end of 2017.Demand for U.S. systems continues to be strong and earlier this year Lockheed Martin's CEO Marillyn Hewson said she wasn't worried about competition from European companies as Lockheed's Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) will likely see more demand from NATO countries after Germany chose the system to replace its Patriot.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is also getting a lot of attention.The system is currently deployed in South Korea. But the new government has suspended the deployment of four more launchers but kept two in place as China pushes to have the system removed over worries it could be used offensively.Saudi Arabia showed interest in the system during President Trump's visit to the kingdom earlier this year and the United Arab Emirates is already a THAAD customer in the Gulf region.The THAAD system intercepted a intermediate-range ballistic missile for the first time in a test announced by the Missile Defense Agency Tuesday.RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsAir Force Insists F-35 Is 'Most Cost-Effective Option' To Modernize Fighters

171,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year guidance Tuesday as increased F-35 sales helped lift second-quarter earnings and revenue well above estimates.XThe defense giant now sees full-year earnings per share of $12.30-$12.60, up from a prior view of $12.15-$12.45 but with the new midpoint still below the $12.54 consensus. Revenue is now seen at $49.8 billion-$51 billion, up from a prior view of $49.5 billion-$50.7 billion and with the new midpoint above the $50.56 billion consensus.For Q2, EPS slipped 2.7% to $3.23 but beat Wall Street views for $3.09, while revenue rose 9.6% to $12.69 billion, above estimates for $12.47 billion.Rotary and mission systems sales, which include the Sikorsky helicopter unit, rose 3.2% to $3.41 billion. Space systems sales rose 8.7% to $2.41 billion. Missiles and fire control sales dipped 2.6% to $1.64 billion. Aeronautics sales grew 19% to $5.23 billion, with the bulk of that gain from higher net sales of about $525 million for the F-35.Lockheed is ramping up production of the F-35 as orders grow. Deliveries from the ninth production batch started in Q1 and continued into Q2. A contract for the 10th production batch was signed earlier this year, with deliveries expected to start next year.On July 7, Lockheed was awarded a $5.6 billion deal to continue work on the 11th batch, while the Pentagon works on a final contract expected by the end of the year.But higher costs continue to haunt the program. Acquisition costs will increase by $27.5 billion, to $406.5 billion, according to a Pentagon report submitted to Congress earlier this month, as the Air Force cuts the number of F-35A models procured yearly to 60 from 80, reducing efficiencies gained from larger buys.But the F-35 joint program office has said prices negotiated with Lockheed and engine maker United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit ""continue to be below SAR estimates.""Shares fell 0.6% to 286.68 on the stock market today.

173,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) became the latest company to come under attack by President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized the defense giant's F-35 stealth fighter program for having ""out of control"" costs.It came a week after he vowed to cancel Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement planes, citing the cost.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the program is perennially under fire for cost overruns and delays. The Pentagon is buying more than 2,400 F-35s for the Air Fore, Navy and Marine Corps, and U.S. allies will buy hundreds more.In a tweet Monday, Trump was hammered to program for escalating expenses.The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Trump reiterated his attack on Boeing and said the F-35's cost is ""out of control.""""We welcome the opportunity to address any questions the president-elect has about the program,"" said Jeff Babione, Lockheed's F-35 general manager, on Monday.He added that the company has reduced the price by more than 70% and predicted it will reach $85 million per plane by 2019-2020. In addition to the acquisition cost, Lockheed is also working on reducing the F-35's operating and sustainment costs, he said.Shares of Lockheed fell 2.4% to 253.23 on the stock market today, but rebounding from a low of 245.50 and closing above their 50-day average. Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, retreated 2.7%, closing near session highs but just below its 50-day line.

""Presumably he won't comment on all defense contracts but will focus on high profile programs. However, given his power as president, this can have an impact on specific programs.""But even if Trump restricts himself to a ""bombastic Twitter shoutout,"" a tougher stance could still affect defense stocks, Cowen added.Among other defense giants, Raytheon (RTN) was down 1.7% Monday, closing above its 50-day. General Dynamics (GD) fell 0.9%.Trump has already taken on Ford (F) and United Tech's Carrier unit for moving production to Mexico.

175,RTN,"Without clear rules of engagement or threats of serious retaliation, warfare in cyberspace is rapidly escalating to uncharted levels, as Russia hacks emails to interfere in the U.S. election, China steals plans for top U.S. weapons programs, and Iran knocks down U.S. banks' networks, costing them tens of millions of dollars.But despite the Pentagon's potent cyber-arsenal — and overall mandate to defend the U.S. from foreign attacks — its mission in cyberspace hasn't extended to regular Americans and companies. That should keep cybersecurity firms like FireEye (FEYE), CyberArk (CYBR) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) as well as defense contractors like Raytheon (RTN) busy on the front lines of the global cyberwar.The debate over the federal government's role is heating up. On Sunday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., described the U.S. response to the Russian hacks as ""totally paralyzed,"" after President Obama said Friday that consequences the U.S. inflicts would be done in a ""thoughtful, methodical way."" The U.S. government is already helping industry improve its own defenses by sharing intelligence, and some experts are calling on the government to be a deterrent by threatening to deliver a devastating counterattack in an echo of the Cold War's strategy of mutually assured destruction.""We need to be more transparent with our offensive capabilities,"" said Frank Cilluffo, associate vice president of the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University, at a conference last month in Washington, D.C. ""What's the benefit of having a doomsday weapon if the bad guys don't know?""Obama took a more measured tone at his year-end press conference Friday, saying some responses to attacks will be public while some will be known only to the recipient and not the broader public.""There have been folks out there who suggest somehow that if we went out there and made big announcements and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spook the Russians,"" he added.But there are already significant sanctions against Russia and its relations with the U.S. have deteriorated sharply, Obama continued, so developing a response that ratchets up costs on Moscow without causing problems for the U.S. is ""worth taking the time to think through and figure out. And that's exactly what we've done.""From 2017 to 2021, cumulative worldwide spending on cybersecurity will top $1 trillion, according to a Cybersecurity Ventures report. Damages from cybercrime will cost $6 trillion annually by 2021, up from $3 trillion in 2015, the report said. The latest data breach at Yahoo (YHOO) could cause Verizon Communications (VZ) to scrap its $4.8 billion takeover.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) alone spends $600 million a year on cybersecurity and plans to ramp that up to $1 billion in a few years. The federal government is devoting $19 billion for cybersecurity in the fiscal 2017 budget, up 35% from 2016.While banks and retailers with troves of credit-card data have been high-profile targets, a recent Deloitte study found that 40% of manufacturing companies had a cyberattack in the last 12 months. Thirty-eight percent of those attacks resulted in cyberbreaches that caused over $1 million in damages.For now, the private sector is limited to playing defense. It's illegal for companies or individuals to launch a cyberattack or respond with a counterattack under current U.S. laws, according to James Lewis, a senior vice president and program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. International laws have similar restrictions, meaning only governments can launch offensive strikes.Cilluffo said companies should get more leeway to respond to attacks. But even if it were legal for them to play offense, attacks wouldn't necessarily go down in frequency. Previous attempts to fight back have backfired.In 2006, Israeli firm Blue Security responded to spam emails by flooding the spammers with emails of its own. The spammers then directed so much traffic at the company that users were blocked from its site, eventually forcing Blue Security to shut down.Lewis said that one of the big four banks, likely Wells Fargo (WFC) or JPMorgan, was hit by a distributed denial-of-service attack from Iran several years ago and decided to retaliate, before the legality of countermeasures was clear. Instead of silencing Iran, the hackers ""launched overwhelming attacks"" against the bank, prompting it to abandon its own counterstrike.(Wells Fargo said it doesn't comment on specific cybersecurity issues, and JPMorgan didn't respond to a request for comment.)""There is a limited role for companies when it comes to offense, because the risk to the company is just too great,"" Lewis said. ""Companies aren't in the business of fighting wars. They are in the business of making money.""U.S. Cyber Command is the military arm responsible for protecting the Pentagon's networks, with the added responsibility to help defend critical civilian infrastructure like the U.S. financial system and power grid as well as communication and transportation networks.Cyber Command also has acknowledged launching attacks on the Islamic State. Some experts are calling for a strong response to recent cyberattacks from other U.S. adversaries.""We are being taken to the cleaners again and again,"" said Stewart Baker, a partner in the Washington office of Steptoe & Johnson and former assistant secretary for policy at DHS. ""We've been very patient up until now. Our retaliation has been modest and less than proportional.""As a candidate, Donald Trump also talked tough. He pledged in October to beef up the U.S. military's offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, saying ""the United States must possess unquestioned capacity to launch crippling counter-cyberattacks.""But while Trump said cyberattacks from states like China, Russia and North Korea ""constitute one of our most critical national-security concerns,"" he seems unlikely to respond to Russian attacks on the DNC.On Fox News Sunday recently, the president-elect said the intelligence community's assessment that Moscow is behind election interference was ""ridiculous,"" adding that ""it's just another excuse. I don't believe it.""The credible threat that the U.S. would indeed respond is key to preventing attacks.Last year, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told MSNBC that cyberattacks will get worse ""until such times as we create both the substance and psychology of deterrence.""That role falls to the U.S. government.""We need the government to do things that only the government can do,"" said Nate Fick, CEO of cybersecurity firm Endgame and a former Marine infantry officer, in an interview.And deterrence doesn't just come from a U.S. response in cyberspace or a ""doomsday"" counterattack.""We should consider a cyberattack to not be materially different than any other kind of attack,"" he added. ""And if you think about it that way, then you can actually bring to bear all the elements of power: diplomatic, economic, informational, military. Only if you do that can deterrence work.""If Russian agents had been caught physically breaking into the Democratic National Committee, they would've been tried and imprisoned. Russia's ambassador to the U.S. would've been rebuked or kicked out. Economic sanctions would've followed.Instead, Russia launched cyberattacks precisely because those levers of U.S. power aren't used in such situations, so ""they know they can get away with it,"" Fick said.Some non-cyber tools are already in use, and there are signs they are working.The U.S. saw a decrease in internet Protocol address thefts from the Chinese after the Obama administration threatened economic sanctions, according to Ari Schwartz, managing director of cybersecurity services at the law firm Venable and former cybersecurity senior director on the White House National Security Council.He believes sanctions are the most consistent way to deal with cyberthreats from foreign actors for the long term, even if they are a slower approach to deterrence.""If we respond in the same way, we are legitimizing their action,"" he told IBD. ""We could have a response today that would work. But if it angers a lot of people or throws up new questions about norms or highlights some tool we have ... those would be a detriment.""Fick also said hacking back is ""really stupid"" because companies can't match the resources of a nation-state that chooses to keep escalating attacks.The federal government, while not extending its cyber shield across industry, is deepening its partnerships.Earlier this year, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center began sharing information, including classified threat reports, with certain U.S. companies to help secure their supply chains, according to Bloomberg. The program is aimed at the telecom, banking and energy sectors, alerting them to risks of hacking and other crimes that might exploit information-theft vulnerabilities in suppliers and contractors.Industry also provides the government with the tools it needs in cyberwarfare. Endgame CEO Fick even said the government shouldn't develop its own security products and instead should purchase best-in-breed products, just as the world's biggest companies do.On its website, FireEye said it ""supports nearly every department in the United States government with our services and product offerings."" Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk also have federal government customers.And Raytheon is the prime contractor for the Homeland Security Department system that's responsible for cybersecurity for more than 100 federal civilian agencies and provides support for the Pentagon's networks.Jack Harrington, vice president for Raytheon's cybersecurity business, notes that 85% of U.S. assets on the internet are in the commercial sector.""Clearly, when cyberwar comes it's coming over commercial pipelines with companies in the loop as well as government networks,"" he told IBD.A political consideration also looms over a broader Pentagon role in cybersecurity.Barring an unprecedented, catastrophic cyberattack and clearer policy guidance from the White House, most Americans probably wouldn't support a bigger military role in civilian cyberdefense, says Tony Cole, global government chief technology officer at FireEye.""We have so many organizations in the U.S. focused on civil liberties,"" Cole said. ""And those organizations are very vocal and very concerned that if we allow the DOD to do that without proper controls, then we would have a kind of military state on the internet, something no one wants.""

178,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD) and other defense stocks enjoyed a furious rally last week after the presidential election. Donald Trump had vowed to beef up military spending on the campaign trail, while lower corporate tax rates could also be a boon.Defense shares are holding steady or pulling back modestly in lighter volume. But that could offer new buying opportunities for investors. Keep in mind that new defense spending may not materialize. And if Pentagon spending does increase, that doesn't mean all defense firms, or stocks, will be winners.Lockheed Martin fell 7 cents to 263.28 on the stock market today after falling 1% to 263.35 Wednesday. Lockheed reversed from an all-time intraday high of 269.74 Tuesday.The defense giant, maker of the F-35 stealth fighter jet, closed at 267.24 on Monday, just above a 267.03 buy point in a cup-without-handle base. Such patterns can work, but the odds are less than cup bases with a handle. Handles offer an opportunity to shake out weak holders, so when the stock clears the pivot, big institutions have to bid up prices to get holders to part with their shares.Lockheed could be forming a handle, but that would need a few more days to develop. Until then, the 267.03 entry point holds.L3 Communications (LLL), like Lockheed, raced up to hit a buy point on Monday, though it didn't close above that 154.18 level. L3 fell 0.3% to 149.97 Thursday, its third straight modest decline. Like Lockheed, it could be working on a handle, but it's not ready yet.The maker of military communications and surveillance gear plunged 7.4% on Oct. 27 after its latest earnings report. Shares continued to slide to a low of 132.38 on Nov. 3, below the 200-day line. But L3 raced straight back up, spiking 12% last week.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have been huge winners since the presidential election. They too are pulling back. But bank stock charts still look great.Raytheon fell 0.8% to 144.96, its third straight modest loss. It's still in buy range from a 143.49 entry point.Raytheon broke out on Nov. 9, after the presidential election, hitting a record 152.58 intraday before settling at a 7.5% gain to 146.71.Northrop Grumman dipped 0.3% to 244.66 Thursday after modest losses in the prior two sessions.Northrop broke past a 224.22 buy point on Oct. 27, following its earnings report. Shares then traded in a tight range before exploding following Trump's win, pushing the stock out of buy range. After a stock is more than 5% extended from the pivot, investors should avoid chasing it. But Northrop could pull back into range, which extends up to 235.43.General Dynamics edged down 0.1% to 165.63, its third straight modest decline. It's still slightly extended from buy range.General Dynamics gapped higher on Nov. 9, blasting above a 157.07 pivot from a short consolidation. The chase zone reaches to 164.92, so keep an eye on further pullbacks.Boeing (BA) fell 0.8% to 145.33, moving further into buying range after dipping barely into a proper entry zone on Wednesday. Boeing has a 139.55 buy point in a flat base, in range up to 146.53. Boeing cleared the entry point on Oct. 26 following Q3 earnings.Boeing remains focused mostly on civilian aircraft, but it's still a big Pentagon contractor.Here is a weekly chart:RELATED:Raytheon Launched Into Buy Range On Trump Win, Defense Stocks RallyLockheed, Northrop Price Targets HikedTrump Wants To Beef Up Military, But Funding Could Be The Enemy

180,RTN,"Defense contractors and investors are celebrating Donald Trump's plan to boost weapons spending, but Pentagon budgeting experts say he's counting on savings that won't come true -- the old Washington saw of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse.""It's a fantasy,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of the president-elect's campaign pledge to finance a more robust military partly by slashing bureaucracy and duplication at the Pentagon. Eaglen has briefed Trump's advisers.""I tried several times to disabuse them of the notion that this could ever pay for even a fraction of Trump's buildup costs,"" she said.As a candidate, Trump called for defense initiatives that analysts such as Eaglen say would add $55 billion to $80 billion annually to a spending request that totals $583 billion this year. Trump envisions a Navy with dozens more ships than the service has sought and an Army as big as the one President George W. Bush sent into Iraq and Afghanistan for full-scale invasions.Encouraged by those prospects, the S&P Aerospace & Defense index climbed 3.9% on Wednesday, outperforming the broader S&P 500, to the highest level since 1989. It was led by Raytheon (RTN), L-3 Communications Holdings (LLL), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Dynamics (GD). The index climbed an additional 2% Thursday.Fulfilling campaign promises is only part of the defense spending challenge facing the new president.There's an immediate issue: delivering on Trump's pledge to remove caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act that would constrain Pentagon spending over the next four years. President Barack Obama, backed by Democratic lawmakers, has resisted eliminating the defense caps unless those on domestic spending are eased as well.Howard Rubel, a defense analyst with Jefferies Inc., said in a note that ""the election appears to embolden fiscal conservatives and military hawks. The prospects for eliminating"" the caps ""jumps substantially. The problem is that domestic safety net-type spending may suffer"" and ""addressing the deficit may be an afterthought.""The caps, which have been temporarily modified three times, are due to return in fiscal 2018, the first budget of the new administration. Through 2021, the caps would force about $106.6 billion in Pentagon cuts if no agreement is reached and the automatic cuts known as sequestration kick in, including about $33 billion in fiscal 2018.Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is Trump's top defense adviser and is said to be a leading candidate for defense secretary, told Defense News last month that ""it is painful for me as a budget"" hawk ""to acknowledge that we can't stay at a sequester-like level. We are just not going to be able to do that.""Trump also faces pending weapons decisions such as whether to increase purchases of Lockheed's F-35, the Pentagon's costliest weapons system, to 70 in the fiscal 2018 budget from the 63 requested this year.And then there are long-term funding questions that require advanced planning, including how to cope with what the military calls a ""bow wave"" of spending after 2021. That includes the planned modernization of all three legs of the air-land-sea triad of nuclear arms, which Trump has endorsed.Trump's broad aspirations are clear. In April he said his ""administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.""Among his promises were to increase the Army to 540,000 soldiers from about 475,000 today, reversing Obama's downsizing that would reduce the force to 450,000 in the next fiscal year. Trump also has vowed to ""build a Navy approaching 350 surface ships and submarines,"" up from about 272 today and the service's goal of 308 ships.For now, at least, the familiar -- and elusive -- Washington refrain of cutting ""waste, fraud and abuse,"" as President Ronald Reagan put it in the 1980s, remains the centerpiece of Trump's financing plan.His campaign website site used a variation on the Reagan theme, saying he would ""pay for this necessary rebuilding of our national defense by conducting a full audit of the Pentagon, eliminating incorrect payments, reducing duplicative bureaucracy, collecting unpaid taxes, and ending unwanted and unauthorized federal programs.""Eaglen, who has worked for Republican lawmakers and served in the Pentagon under Bush, said those are goals that should always be pursued but ""cannot yield $55 to $60 billion per year in new money to reinvest -- period.""""Some of Trump's ideas for a larger Navy, etc. will take a lot more money up front than any reform agenda"" can generate, Michael O'Hanlon, a defense and foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an e-mail. ""Unambiguously, what he wants to do will take more money,"" said O'Hanlon, author of ""The $650 Billion Bargain: The Case For Modest Growth in America's Defense Budget.""Other passages in the Trump campaign statement ""seem to indicate he would raise revenues or cut other parts of government to pay for defense,"" Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an e-mail. ""That is much more realistic, but the devil is in the details and no details are provided.""But ""the idea that auditing the Pentagon is going to uncover billions of dollars of waste is a myth,"" he said.Dov Zakheim, who was Pentagon comptroller under Bush, said that while an audit ""will not save money per se,"" it can focus attention on needless bureaucracy.""Some 70,000 positions have been added since 1990,"" Zakheim said. ""Has DoD become more efficient as a result? I don't think so.""

182,RTN,"Raytheon (RTN) shares soared into buy range Wednesday as defense contractors took flight on the wings of Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election but sales to foreign countries could take a hit.On the campaign trail, Trump said he would boost military spending to make sure older equipment is replaced, increase the number of troops in the military and called for removing the sequester, but he hasn't gone into detail on how he will accomplish his goal.Raytheon shares jumped 7.5% to 146.71 on the stock market today, surpassing its buy point of 143.49.Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares climbed 5.4% to 242.30, propelled out of buy range.Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares soared 6% to 253.46, consolidating in a flat base with a buy point of 267.03.During the campaign, Trump declared the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obsolete and told allies that America wouldn't foot the bill for their defense any longer, sending shares of U.K.'s BAE Systems higher on the London exchange. He also promised to take an ""America first"" attitude, implicating isolationist policies could weaken arms sales to allies.""We might see a lot of European or Asian partners procuring from other sources,"" said Richard Pettibone, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International.IBD'S TAKE: While Raytheon has moved into buy range with the election of Trump, it's only the 15th-ranked stock in IBD's Aerospace/Defense Group. Atop the list is Heico (HEIA), which makes jet engine parts. Partners will stay put on Lockheed's F-35 program but Lockheed's F-16 could lose its front-runner status as India looks to buy more jets. Lockheed offered attractive incentives to New Delhi, like tech transfers and in August the company said it would move its F-16 manufacturing to India.""But with an isolationist policy, you're not going to give them more tech transfers,"" Pettibone said.Instead India could order more jets from France's Dassault, Sweden's Saab or offerings from Russian firms.RELATED: Despite Closer Russia Ties, Turkey Orders More F-35s; China Debuts J-20Pentagon Finalizes $6 Billion Lockheed Contract For 57 F-35s

183,RTN,"One could say that the microwave oven was invented by accident. After all, Percy Spencer wasn't trying to cook anything 70 years ago. That's when he felt a strange sensation and noticed that the snack bar he was carrying in his pocket had warmed and partially melted.Yet it was no accident that Spencer, whose ingenuity had made him a top engineer at defense contractor Raytheon (RTN), was the one standing in front of a high-frequency magnetron that day.Perhaps a better-educated man would have shrugged it off.Spencer had not been the first to notice that radar equipment could have such strange effects. But this grade-school dropout, whose intellectual wonder had already carried him so far, was the first to turn this minor workplace mishap into one of the modern world's most practical and pervasive timesaving inventions.By the time he discovered microwave cooking, Spencer (1894-1970) had accomplished quite a bit.His contribution to radar — the weapon that helped win World War II — might well have turned the Battle of the Atlantic.Aiming To Win WWIIBy September 1940, a year into their war against Germany, the British had shared a great deal of military technology with the U.S., hoping to gain America's industrial assistance in production.Among the devices shared was the cavity magnetron, a tube that generates microwaves. It had the potential to make the Allies' radar vastly more powerful than that of Nazi Germany — enough to help a British or American plane detect just a U-boat's periscope at great distances.But it could take a skilled engineer days to produce just one of these sensitive instruments to precise specifications.It fell to Spencer, by then a world-class expert in radar-tube design, to solve the problem. He devised a new manufacturing process by which Raytheon could produce an astounding 2,600 units per day.He also improved the device's design; his diagrams and descriptions can be found in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office archives.The resulting mass production of compact and powerful radar systems spelled the end of Hitler's ability to terrorize Allied shipping.It also gave the U.S. fleet an enormous advantage over the Japanese — and won Spencer the Navy's highest civilian honor.Later, Spencer's involvement in war production would lead him to revolutionize home food preparation — all because he stood too close to one of the machines at work one day in 1945.A grandson, Rod Spencer, explained that Spencer typically brought a Mr. Peanut bar to work.""The reason he had it in his pocket was that he loved squirrels and chipmunks,"" Rod told IBD. ""He would feed them at lunch.""After the melting of his candy bar, Spencer began to experiment.First, he produced the world's first batch of microwave popcorn.He then tried to microwave an egg, which exploded in the face of one of his curious co-workers.Finally, he arranged a setup in which the microwaves could be trapped in a metal box, and from this box the microwave oven was born. He applied for a patent that same year, one of hundreds that he filed in his lifetime, assigning ownership to Raytheon.In his patent application of Oct. 8, 1945, he noted that his invention would ""provide an efficient method of employing electromagnetic energy for the cooking of foodstuffs ... by employing wave lengths falling in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum.""This wordy formula describes what hundreds of millions of people do each day when they reheat leftovers or make popcorn.""The new device will cook a sirloin steak in one minute, a plump Thanksgiving turkey in little more than half an hour,"" noted a 1958 profile of Spencer for Readers' Digest. ""Used for some time in restaurants, Pullman diners and ocean liners, radar ranges are now being produced for the home.""Spencer's eureka moment was surely exciting in 1945, but it changed the world much more slowly than the magnetron.The early versions of the microwave — marketed by Raytheon as the Radarange — were not to be found in home kitchens.They cost thousands of dollars (tens of thousands in today's money), weighed nearly half a ton and required a plumbing hookup for cooling.The first commercial microwave appeared in 1947, but it wasn't until 1967 that a countertop version was introduced by Amana, then a subsidiary of Raytheon.According to the Labor Department, it sold for the relative bargain price of $495 ($3,700 today).By 1986, prices had fallen much further, and a quarter of U.S. households had a microwave.Today, nine in 10 American homes have one. The microwave is a necessity in 2015 — an enormous timesaver that makes the saving of leftovers more practical.Ready To EatMany commercially available food products are designed specifically for microwave preparation.The cheapest versions of the device retail online for as little as $47, although commercial versions are available for much more.Percy Lebaron Spencer was born in Howland, Maine, 30 miles up the Penobscot River from Bangor.He was orphaned early. His father died when he was 6 months old, and his mother left him in the care of his aunt and uncle.Percy's interest in how things worked might have begun with his uncle, a mechanic who specialized in early caterpillar treads — the metal tracks used to move heavy machinery (and, later, tanks). Again, the boy suffered a loss; he was just seven when his uncle died.For all of the prestige that he would find as an engineer and inventor — he would ultimately become a senior vice president at Raytheon — Spencer was a self-taught and self-made man. He quit school at age 12 to support himself and his aunt by working at a spool mill.His engineering career began in 1910, when he heard that a paper mill was going to be electrified. Lacking formal training as an electrician, he studied how electricity worked. His efforts were good enough to get him hired, with two others, to wire the facility.Following the story of the Titanic's sinking in 1912, Spencer acquired an interest in the operation of the wireless telegraph, a relatively new device whose presence on the ship was responsible for the survival of 700 passengers.Tuned InHe took that fascination as an 18-year-old to the Navy, which trained him as a radio operator.After his discharge at the end of World War I in 1918, Spencer joined American Appliance, a startup seeking to be a pioneer in electric home appliances. The firm's name was changed to Raytheon — now a defense contractor in Waltham, Mass., with 60,000 employees and annual sales of $23 billion.In 2015, the idea of a master engineer with so little formal education seems counterintuitive.But such a thing was more common in Spencer's day, says James Carafano, a defense expert at the Heritage Foundation.He offers an analogy to the modern-day phenomenon of prodigies who train themselves in programming and computer science.""You could do that back then because there was so much industrial activity in the U.S. and such a great atmosphere to nurture people like him,"" said Carafano, noting that Spencer surrounded himself with the materials of industry and other people who shared his interest. ""It's a lot like what you see today in cyber — you don't need a college degree; all you need is a computer.""The 1958 Readers Digest profile of Spencer even quoted an unnamed Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist describing the inventor's lack of education as an advantage.""The educated scientist knows many things won't work,"" the scientist told writer Don Murray. ""Percy doesn't know what can't be done. Like Edison, he will cut and fit and try and throw away and try again.""Despite his profound scientific expertise and presence in the boardroom of Raytheon, Spencer had a blue-collar mien about him, says grandson Rod, who describes with fondness how Spencer would take him during the summer to poach lobsters from a coastal power plant's heat exchange.""He was my gramps,"" said the younger Spencer. ""He taught me how to work metal, how to work wood and how to cuss.""

194,RTN,"Raytheon (RTN) jumped to a new high Monday as investors bid up defense stocks following the attacks by Islamic extremists in Paris. French President Francois Hollande said Monday his country is at war and called for a coalition including the U.S. and Russia to defeat the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for Friday's attacks that killed at least 129 people. However, President Obama said the U.S. has no plans to expand its military campaign against the militant group.Yet defense stocks rose, with guided-missile producer Raytheon jumping 4% to a new high in heavy volume.

The annual dividend of $6.60 a share yields 3.1% at the current share price, well above the S&P 500 average of 2.1%.Northrop Grumman last raised its quarterly dividend in May, a 14% increase to 80 cents a share, or $3.20 annually. The stock's annualized yield is currently 1.8%.Raytheon in March hiked its quarterly dividend more than 10% to 67 cents a share. The annual payout of $2.68 a share works out to an annualized yield of 2.3%.

The action indicated a continued shift in stock sector strategy among institutional players as interest rates look set to rise a little more by the end of the year.Gold mining, metal ore and coal shares rebounded some. In the government bond markets, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield held firm at 1.765%, virtually flat vs. Monday, according to real-time data provided by Tradeweb. That's up from a low of 1.37% seen in early July.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%, while the S&P 500 sank 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrials eased 0.3%. Small caps got hurt more as the Russell 2000 dropped more than 0.8%. The S&P SmallCap 600 fell 1%.Sherwin-Williams (SHW) gapped down more than 10% to 247.59 as volume ballooned to nearly 6 million shares, easily the heaviest turnover so far this year.

On July 21, shares, gapped down hard on second-quarter results, falling more than 7% from the proper entry and triggering a sell signal. The stock also undercut the 50-day moving average, a sign of weakness.Air conditioning, wood product and building product companies also led the market's downside.

As seen on its IBD chart, the relative strength line (painted in blue) has climbed sharply in recent weeks, meaning that it's outpacing the S&P 500. The aircraft giant is slated to post Q3 results on Wednesday; the Street sees earnings rising 6% to $2.62 a share despite an 8.5% dip in revenue to $23.64 billion.General Dynamics (GD) rose nearly 0.8% to 152.59 in fast turnover to climb back barely above its 50-day moving average.

However, CEO Tim Cook noted in a news release that Apple's service business revenue saw a 24% jump to an all-time record.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted that the company returned $9.3 billion to shareholders through cash dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly cash payout of 57 cents a share, payable Nov. 10 to holders of record on Nov. 7. The quarterly payout was unchanged, leaving the annualized yield as of Tuesday's closing price at 1.9% vs. 2.09% for the S&P 500 as of Monday's closing price.Apple has recently triggered a second buy point at 116.28, 10 cents above a recent new handle on a long cup pattern.

Revenue at the aeronautics unit climbed 6.8% to $4.19 billion on higher F-35 sales, and mission systems revenue jumped 55% on the $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year.Outlook: Full-year sales of $46.5 billion, vs. consensus for $46.36 billion, up from its July outlook of $45 billion-$46.2 billion and sees full year EPS of $12.10, above consensus of $11.77, up from its prior outlook of $11.15-$11.45. Lockheed sees 2017 sales up 7% vs. 2016, better than consensus of 2.8%.F-35: Lockheed's upbeat outlook rests on getting contracts for the next two batches of F-35 production, known as lots 9 and 10, and has been paying out of pocket for months while contracts are negotiated with the Pentagon to keep up the production schedule.To help cut costs, the Pentagon has been adamant that lots 9 and 10 should be negotiated together under one $14 billion contract that includes 140 jets. But the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Pentagon may award a contract for just lot 9, which includes more than 63 planes, as talks over pricing have dragged on well past expectations.Stock: Shares jumped 7.4% to finish at 249.26 on the stock market today, gapping above its 200-day and 50-day moving averages, as Lockheed also raised its dividend 10% to $1.82 and added $3 billion to its share buyback program.IBD'S TAKE: While Lockheed tries to secure funding at home for the F-35, its F-16 is likely the top choice for India's next fighter jet competition.Aerospace giant Boeing (BA) will announce quarterly earnings results Wednesday along with Airbus (EADSY) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).

Raytheon ended down less than 0.1% at 137.28.IBD'S TAKE: The Pentagon is also investing in updating its aging intercontinental ballistic missile and Long-Range Standoff nuclear missile with Boeing, Lockheed and Northrop Grumman all chasing the lucrative contracts.On Saturday, a North Korean mid-range missile exploded almost immediately after lifting off. While a temporary setback, the regime has been able to advance its missile technology despite international sanctions and is expected to conduct another missile test soon.In July, South Korea and Washington agreed to deploy the THAAD system by late 2017 as Pyongyang becomes increasingly aggressive. So far, North Korea has tested at least 21 ballistic missiles and staged two nuclear tests this year.Meanwhile, Germany might be having second thoughts over its own missile defense system, according to a Reuters report, as the cost for the Medium Extended Air Defense System system would reach $9 billion to $10 billion, billions of dollars over the original $4.5 billion estimate.The proposal submitted by MBDA -- a joint venture of Airbus (EADSY), BAE Systems and Leonardo Finmeccanica -- and Lockheed beat out Raytheon's Patriot system for the contract from Berlin last year.But a source told Reuters that some German officials broached the possibility of reconsidering a deal with Raytheon.U.S.-listed shares of Airbus added less than 0.1% to 14.47.RELATED: Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing Aren't Done Fighting For Air SupremacyNorthrop, Raytheon, L3 Seen Leading Defense Stocks As Budgets Rise
"
202,RTN,"Analysts are bullish on top defense stocks Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raython (RTN), L3 Communications (LLL) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as military spending is expected to ramp up on growing tensions in Syria, Ukraine and the South China Sea.In a note Thursday, Baird analyst Peter Arment wrote that the U.S. defense budget will keep rising and contractor backlogs will get a boost from both domestic and foreign military sales.Weapons spending by the Pentagon was up 16% in fiscal year 2016 and Arment expects spending to rise at least 5% in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and will ""remain a tailwind for contractor backlogs.""Raytheon was started with an outperform rating and 170 price target by Baird. Arment wrote that the company ""was highly levered to key areas such as missile defense and prevision weaponry."" But Raytheon's sales are more dependent than peers on international sales, and lower oil prices could put pressure on weapons sales from the Middle East.Northrop, which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, was started with an outperform rating and a 260 price target as production on the stealth fighter ramps up and development of the B-21 bomber continues. But like Raytheon, Northrop also faces uncertainty from foreign buyers.Raytheon shares rose 1.12 to 138.25 on the stock market today and is consolidating in a flat base as it tries to retake its 50-day line. Northrop shares rose 1.73 to 214.21, finding resistance at the 50-day line over the last several sessions. It's also forming a base.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing, Lockheed, and others are vying for helicopter, missile and trainer jet deals worth billions of dollars with the Pentagon. Baird included Raytheon and Northrop in its list of top defense picks, along with L3 Communications, which makes intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems.Baird rated L3 outperform and gave it a 184 price target, saying much of its sales are tied to a growing budget for classified programs.Lockheed was also initiated with an outperform rating and a 285 price target. But the prime contractor on the F-35 didn't make the top picks list, and Arment warned that pension issues could weigh on the stock.L3 shares, which broke out of a cup base in May, edged up 2.09 to 152.54 Thursday, nearing profit-taking sell territory for those who bought at the May breakout. Lockheed dipped 1.88 to 234.72, hitting a five-month low and threatening to undercut its 200-day moving average for the first time since February.RELATED:Boeing, Lockheed Fighter Sales To Mideast OK'd After Israel Aid DealGermany Buys Lockheed C-130 As Airbus A400 Delays Continue Boeing, Lockheed Fighter Sales To Mideast OK'd After Israel Aid Deal

231,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) will report second-quarter results Tuesday, and costs for its F-35 program as well as demand for its missile-defense systems and munitions will likely come into focus.Analysts see Lockheed's earnings falling 7% to $3.09 per share as revenue slips 3.5% to $12.47 billion.Lockheed is ramping up production of the F-35 as more orders roll in. Deliveries from the ninth production batch began in Q1 and continued into Q2.The outlook for F-35 deliveries in the full year may be fuzzy, however, as Lockheed sees 66 while the Pentagon's contract management agency projects 57.A contract for the 10th production batch was signed earlier this year, with deliveries slated to begin next year. On July 7, Lockheed was awarded a $5.6 billion deal to continue work on the 11th batch, while the Pentagon works on a final contract expected by the end of the year. Those deliveries are seen in 2019-2020.Meanwhile, acquisition costs for the the advanced fighter will increase by $27.5 billion, to $406.5 billion, according to a Pentagon report submitted to Congress recently, as the Air Force cuts the number of F-35A models procured yearly to 60 from 80, reducing efficiencies gained from larger buys.But the F-35's Joint Program office said prices negotiated with Lockheed and engine maker United Technologies (UTX) are below the report's estimates, so Lockheed may try to refute the idea of costs heading back up.The subject is particularly sensitive because President Trump has been critical of the program's costs and suggested buying more Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornets instead.Air- and missile-defense systems will likely be another hot topic, and Lockheed could give some color on increased foreign demand from allies in the Middle East and Europe.Lockheed saw interest from Saudi Arabia for its  Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system during President Trump's visit to the kingdom last quarter.And earlier this month, a THAAD system based in Alaska also intercepted a test intermediate-range ballistic missile for the first time.Lockheed's munitions, such as the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile, have also been a growth driver, on demand from overseas allies as well as U.S. forces that need to restock inventories amid the air campaign against ISIS.Boeing will report Q2 results July 26 as will major F-35 subcontractor Northrop Grumman (NOC). Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled for July 27.RELATED: U.S. Missile Sales To Allies Continue Amid Growing Global TensionsHow A Small Drone Nearly Collided With An F-22 Raptor

232,RTN,"Turkey reportedly agreed to buy Russia's formidable S-400 air-defense system for $2.5 billion, amid ongoing tensions between the NATO member and its allies.XTurkey will receive its first two S-400 missile batteries within the next year, and another two batteries will be built in Turkey, sources told Bloomberg.The deal with Russia is another sign that Turkey's relationship with NATO is strained over U.S. support for Kurdish rebels in Syria and European Union concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's crackdown on dissidents following a failed coup.Not only did Turkey turn down a Western air-defense option, but the S-400 represents a unique threat to the U.S. because of its ability to detect incoming aircraft from longer ranges. Its radar can spot a fourth-generation fighter — like Lockheed's F-16 or Boeing's (BA) F-15 and F/A-18 — before the fighter's radar can pick up the air-defense system.Turkey was also looking at the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), which is jointly built by Lockheed Martin (Lockheed) as well as German and Italian defense companies.Turkey has been in need of an air-defense system since 2015, when key NATO members removed two Raytheon (RTN) Patriot systems the alliance deployed in 2013 after determining Syria no longer posed a threat to Turkey.Turkey first considered developing a homegrown system, but that would've required a decade to build. Ankara then looked at buying a system from a Chinese company, but that deal fell through under pressure from NATO allies over the company's dealings in Iran.Lockheed shares edged up 0.2% to 286.86 on the stock market today. Shares of Raytheon fell 0.5% to 166.13.RELATED: Lockheed Sees Strong Missile Defense Demand Abroad, Including From NATOLockheed's THAAD Successful Against Medium Range MissileU.S. Missile Sales To Allies Continue Amid Growing Global Tensions

Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT), which makes the PAC-3 missiles for the system, retreated 0.5% to 281.05, but still in buy range after clearing out of a cup base with a 270 buy point.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) are also in buy range. Both Northrop and General Dynamics fell 0.5% and 0.85%, respectively.Raytheon's Patriot air-defense system has been in demand globally. Raytheon received a big order from Saudi Arabia in 2015 and South Korea and Japan plan to upgrade their Patriot systems.Poland's deal comes as Trump visited Warsaw ahead of the G-20 summit in Germany starting Friday. On Thursday Trump finally endorsed Article 5 of the NATO treaty, ensuring that the U.S. would come to the aid of any alliance member who comes under attack. He didn't do so in an earlier European trip, sparking worries about the White House's commitment.Trump also pushed for NATO countries to spend more on defense and praised Poland for spending the targeted 2% of its GDP on its military.RELATED: These 4 Defense Stocks Are In Buy Range After North Korea ICBM Test This Is The Big Winner In The U.S. Missile, Torpedo Sale To Taiwan

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December.

"
240,RTN,"At the height of its 'season' Enron was an energy, commodity and pulp and paper services company based in Houston, TX. Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!
"
241,RTN,"Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......

242,RTN,"At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting..... The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....
"
243,RTN,"So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......

244,RTN,"A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.

245,RTN,"As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.
"
246,RTN,"Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....

Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting..... The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....So now 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P are coming in slightly better than expected....analysts are now calling for a 4.8% decline in profits - better than the original 7% decline they had prepared us for - this because 70% have beaten the estimate while only 40% are beating the top line.....(disconnect) .....Now 9 of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 moved lower yesterday. Energy stocks fell the most on the back of weaker oil, industrials the only sector to rise thanks to BA and UTX......More earnings to come today.. MCD, CAT, and MMM all report prior to the open.....some have already reported and they have been positive.....SWK, Alaska Air, LLY, LUV, DOW, AEP, RTN, UA.. - all showing bottom line beats....and pre-market trading has most of these names moving higher.... After the bell look for Alphabet (Goog), AMZN, MSFT and T..... Eco data today includes - Inti Jobless Claims of 265k, Cont Claims of 2.18 mil, Existing Home Sales of 5.39 mil, and M/M of +1.5% - Kansas City Fed to show lower activity at -9.....European markets are all slightly higher as they await the ECB rate news....No one expects that Draghi will change rates but will in fact leave the door open to further easing.....

270,RTN,"Exposure to emerging markets that don't include China and the Middle East could pose big risks to aircraft manufacturers Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY), as both companies face the prospect of fewer orders somewhere down the road.RBC Capital Markets analysts Steven Cahall and Robert Stallard estimate that 17% of Boeing's backlog is exposed to non-Chinese or Middle East emerging markets, including airlines based in Indonesia, Africa and Turkey. This figure excludes additional exposure via leasing firms or in the form of orders from undisclosed customers.RBC calculates that 36% of Airbus' backlog is exposed to non-Chinese or Middle East emerging markets, including airlines based in Indonesia, Columbia, Malaysia and Turkey. This figure also excludes additional exposure via leasing companies or orders from undisclosed customers.The analysts note that fallout from China's economic slowdown ""continues to ripple around the globe,"" with a ""particularly negative impact"" in emerging markets that benefited from the China boom.The ""double whammy"" of negative economic developments and foreign exchange pressures increases the chance that both Boeing and Airbus ""will see an increase in deferrals and cancellations from emerging market airlines,"" Cahall and Stallard wrote in a report.This in turn ""calls into question"" the two plane manufacturers' plans for further rate increases, they added.The impact might be awhile coming, however. RBC notes that ""even if we start to see deferrals picking up into the year end, we see limited if any impact"" on the 2016 delivery outlook for both Boeing and Airbus.Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported Thursday that Boeing's net orders for the 747 jumbo jet ""have fallen to zero"" after Nippon Cargo Airlines dumped its $1.5 billion order for four freighters.Boeing's stock price closed down 1% on the stock market today after finishing the previous two sessions in positive territory.

The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 7.6 million barrels but domestic production rose to 9.397 million barrels per day up from 9.338 million barrels in the prior week. The EIA also cut its 2018 U.S. crude output forecast by 1% to 9.9 million bpd. OPEC expects demand for its oil next year to fall by 60,000 bpd to 32.2 million bpd as non-OPEC supply is seen climbing by 1.14 million bpd to 58.96 million bpd. OPEC compliance to its production cut deal fell to 78%, the lowest rate this year, according to an International Energy Agency report.

299,RTN,"American taxpayers could soon find out if they got their money's worth from the costliest fighter jets in the U.S. arsenal, as new air-defense systems render the legacy fleet too vulnerable to lead the charge in contested airspace.XRussia's S-400 system, which is deployed in Syria and spreading to other U.S. adversaries, poses a particular threat to ""fourth generation"" aircraft like the F-16, F-15 and F/A-18. Analysts and military officials believe that Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-2 bomber could be the only aircraft effective against the S-400 due to their stealth capabilities.""Fourth gen will continue to have a role in some of these other areas we are looking,"" said Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris — the Air Force's deputy chief of staff for strategic plans, programs and requirements — after a Senate hearing in March. ""But, again, as the world grows and these threats proliferate in Syria and Iran and other locations, they are going to push fourth gen out quicker than planned.""The accelerated threat assessment comes as President Trump looks to add at least 100 combat aircraft to the U.S. fleet. He hasn't specified which models will be in the mix but has been critical of the F-35's $400 billion acquisition price tag, hinting it could be pitted against Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet and saying in February that he was ""looking seriously at a big order.""The implications for the defense industry extend beyond Lockheed's F-35, which several U.S. allies are buying in addition to the 2,443 the Pentagon is procuring for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.Boeing is trying to maintain a foothold in the combat aircraft market after losing the B-21 bomber contract to Northrop, and wants to keep its Super Hornet in production despite international demand for more advanced fighters. And last year, Congress asked the Air Force to assess the costs of restarting Lockheed's F-22 program, which was canceled in 2009 less than halfway through its production run due to spiraling costs.For now, the still-limited availability of fifth-generation fighters like the F-22 and F-35 means the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet will continue to be older planes. The Air Force said earlier this month that it will extend the service life of the F-16 by 50% to 12,000 flight hours as the service hopes to keep the plane flying until the 2040s. And Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein recently sounded ambivalent about retiring the F-15 next decade as planned.IBD'S TAKE: The Aerospace/Defense industry group ranked No. 63 Monday among the 197 industries tracked by IBD. While that is down from earlier this year, top defense stocks like Lockheed Martin, Northrop and Raytheon are in buy zones.While U.S. airspace dominance has gone unquestioned for decades, the S-400's introduction has helped tip the scales, and growing tensions with Russia and its allies are making the skies above the Middle East more dangerous.After the U.S. launched Raytheon (RTN) Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase April 6 in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by President Bashar Assad's forces, the Kremlin vowed to deploy more air defenses to Syria ""very soon,"" according to Russia's Interfax.And on Monday, Russia threatened to target U.S.-led coalition aircraft and drones in Syria after a Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Su-22 that had bombed positions near a U.S.-backed militia combating the Islamic State.""All flying objects, including planes and drones of the international coalition, detected west of the Euphrates, will be followed by Russian air defense systems as targets,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.Before the Tomahawk strike, the U.S. had avoided Assad's military. But with the U.S. mission in Syria possibly expanding, American pilots may find themselves intentionally or unintentionally in the S-400's cross hairs.Russia already has one of its S-400 systems in western Syria near Turkey, but it's possible another could be among those deployed to beef up Syrian defenses. Meanwhile, Syrian forces have moved most of their fixed-wing aircraft to Russia's Khmeimim airbase, where the S-400 is also deployed, for protection against another U.S. strike.Russia claims the system can track 300 targets simultaneously and has an operational range of up to 250 nautical miles. China finalized an order for the S-400 in 2015 with delivery expected next year, and an even more advanced S-500 is in the works. Moscow may be exaggerating the S-400's details. But what's widely accepted is that it represents a unique threat to the U.S. because of its ability to detect incoming aircraft from longer ranges.The S-400's radar can spot a fourth-generation fighter before the fighter's radar can pick up the air-defense system, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS. A stealth fighter, however, would only be detectable at close range.The F-22 has 360-degree stealth, while the infrared signature of the F-35's engine makes it more vulnerable from the back, Bobbi noted. Still, he thinks the F-35 ""would lead the parade"" if and when it's deployed to Syria.Even before this month's Tomahawk missile strikes, the shift in the threat landscape was already becoming clear.""We think the only thing that can operate in and through that environment is going to be fifth generation,"" Harris told reporters after the March Senate hearing.F-22s are currently flying in Syria, where they flew their first-ever combat missions in 2014 as the U.S. began hitting Islamic State targets. The Air Force said earlier this year that F-35s will deploy to the Middle East in a few years but have demonstrated their readiness to deploy with recent exercises in Europe and Asia.For more on top business trends and how to make more money in the stock market, follow IBD on Facebook.Maintaining a military edge comes at a cost. The Trump administration has vowed to boost Pentagon spending but is also scrutinizing individual programs.Earlier this year, Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35's costs as well as options for upgrading F/A-18 Super Hornets. The basic F-35A model costs about $95 million each under the latest production contract, but versions for the Navy and Marines are more expensive. The current Super Hornet version costs $52 million to $61 million, depending on the model.By the time F-22 production ended, the per-plane cost was about $140 million, though total procurement topped $60 billion to get 187 planes in operation. Advocates periodically have called for making more, even though Lockheed has shut down the production line. A 2011 RAND study put the cost of building 75 more F-22s at $13.7 billion to $17.4 billion in 2008 dollars. The Air Force has maintained that a restart would be too expensive and would take away resources from the F-35 and other programs.To be sure, fifth-generation fighters aren't invincible — and aren't invisible.""Even fifth generation would be challenged to penetrate in certain ranges against these very capable air-missile-defense systems,"" said Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and a retired Air Force colonel, noting China has developed its own ""very advanced"" HQ-9 air-defense system.But he said the S-400 wouldn't create ""no-go zones"" for the U.S. and allies.And a trade-off of stealth fighters is that maintaining a low-observable radar profile means they can't carry as many missiles and bombs under their wings. As a result, fourth-generation fighters can bring more firepower, and there are ways to reduce their detectability too.Boeing has proposed a stealthier version of the Super Hornet, which would have a special radar-evading coating and wouldn't have fuel tanks under the wings, Dan Gillian, Boeing's F/A-18 and EA-18 program manager, said at an industry conference earlier this month.He added that the advanced Super Hornet would be ""complementary"" to the F-35 with its long-range infrared search-and-track system and deeper magazine that holds more munitions than the Navy's F-35C variant can.Fourth-generation fighters won't be obsolete and should continue playing a key role in combat as part of a one-two punch with their stealthier counterparts.Lockheed's website describes the F-35 as the ""quarterback"" of a joint strike force that can ""share what it sees with other aircraft to expand situational awareness across the entire network of aircraft.""Also, pitting a plane against an air-defense system or other threat in a head-to-head competition is the ""wrong way to think,"" said Gunzinger.Instead, the focus should be on how fifth- and fourth-generation fighters — along with jamming aircraft like Boeing's EA-18G Growler, cyber operations and unmanned systems — can work together to take down a threat, he added.""It's a family of systems,"" said the Air Force's Harris. ""It's going to be our fifth generation that goes into a threat environment like that and kick down the door. And then maybe after those threats have been suppressed, allow fourth generation back into the fight.""RELATED:As F-35 Raises Its Profile, How Do You Stop Russian Intel Gathering?F-35s Are Back From Europe: Here's What The Air Force Said Lockheed F-35s Doing 'Exceedingly Well' In South Korea As North ThreatensBoeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?

302,RTN,"The Trump administration's ""$110 billion arms deal"" with Saudi Arabia announced last month is far from done — as in, the arrangement largely isn't really even a deal yet.And it seems to have echoes of the blaring announcements that President Trump has made in months past, in which companies' already-existing plans to create jobs get recast as massive breakthroughs.But after days of few specifics, at least now we know what the likes of Lockheed Martin (LMT), Boeing (BA) and Raytheon (RTN) could get from any actual agreement.Among the big-ticket items on Saudi Arabia's long wish list, Lockheed could be set to gain $13.5 billion on the potential sale of seven Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile systems, with delivery of the THAAD systems set for between 2023-2026, according to a White House document obtained by Defense News.Raytheon could get $6.65 billion for ""enhancements"" to Saudi Arabia's Patriot anti-missile system. Raytheon, along with Boeing, could also be in line for $4.46 billion for 104,000 air-to-ground munitions.Other potential sales outlined by the White House document include $5.8 billion to Lockheed for three new KC-130J and 20 C-130J aircraft, with deliveries beginning in 2022. Boeing could also get $6.25 billion in an eight-year ""sustainment deal"" for Saudi Arabia's F-15s.Shares of Lockheed closed down 0.2% on the stock market today, Boeing rose less than 0.1%, and Raytheon added 0.3%. All three stocks are still in buy range.But those weapons and figures, Defense News said Thursday, amount to potential sales, or ""memos of intent,"" that were offered to the kingdom during Trump's visit. Any actual arms sale has to get the OK from the State Department and then Congress.Much of the arrangement announced last month is made up of similar ""intended sales"" of things that the U.S. believes the Saudis will eventually want, the Brookings Institution notes. All of the deals that have been revealed so far, Brookings said, started during President Obama's tenure.RELATED:Why The Air Force Is Less Upbeat Than Boeing On Tanker DeliveryAir Force Sees Another Boeing Tanker Delay Ahead Of Key Review

323,RTN,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) second-quarter results are seen falling when it announces Tuesday, but shares have been on the rise recently as the defense contractor's newest fighter jet nears combat readiness.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Lockheed's Q2 earnings to fall 3.3% to $2.67 per share and revenue is seen down 2.6% to $11.01 billion.Investors and analysts are waiting for Lockheed's F-35 next-generation fighter jet to finally be cleared for combat. The plane is well over budget and behind schedule. Lockheed won the contract in 2001 and expected to have it ready by 2010.The Marine Corps must carry out an operational readiness inspection on the F-35B version before declaring it combat ready. How well the plane does in testing and after becoming combat approved could affect its chances for a massive bulk procurement that could impact Lockheed's earnings down the road.The Pentagon is planning to ask Congress for a ""block buy"" order for up to 500 planes that could top $40 billion vs. current orders for small batches. Defense chiefs are looking for a three-year order starting in fiscal 2018.The block buy is key to addressing the program's cost, which lawmakers are looking to slash. The Defense Department plans to spend $400 billion for 2,443 of the new planes to replace aging F-16s, A-10s, Boeing (BA) F/A-18s and AV-8Bs.But the total number is now in doubt. Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Joseph Dunford, who has been tapped as the next Joint Chiefs chairman, told the Senate Armed Services Committee recently that the F-35 buying plan is under review.Meanwhile, Lockheed looks to build on its position as the top defense contractor. The company is reportedly the front-runner to buy the Sikorsky helicopter business from United Technologies (UTX).Lockheed also has been expanding its reach beyond aircraft and is building up its cybersecurity business. Washington has placed a focus on fighting cyberwarfare, and earlier this year the Pentagon opened an office in Silicon Valley.

335,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees strong demand abroad, including from NATO allies, for its missile defense systems and Patriot interceptor missiles.With the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system now deployed in South Korea and Guam, Lockheed could see more orders, said CEO Marillyn Hewson at Bernstein's Annual Strategic Decisions Conference Wednesday.Saudi Arabia showed interest in the system during President Trump's visit to the kingdom earlier this month, she said, potentially joining the United Arab Emirates as an intentional THAAD customer.Lockheed is also seeing demand for its Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile domestically and in the Asia-Pacific region.Meanwhile, Hewson isn't worried about Europe's shift to buying locally, noting that Lockheed's Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) could see more demand from NATO after Germany picked the system in 2015 to replace its Raytheon (RTN) Patriot system.Poland and Turkey have also asked for briefs about MEADS, which was designed by an American-German-Italian partnership.""We are not seeing any throttle back from buying Lockheed or U.S. systems from Europe,"" she said. ""As NATO countries commit to getting 2% of GDP spending in defense, we will continue to see interest in Lockheed products and capabilities.""Tenser relations between the U.S. and its European allies potentially could hurt prospects for American defense contractors abroad.Last week, Trump blasted NATO countries for not spending enough on defense, saying it was ""not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States.""Lockheed shares rose 0.4% to 281.13 on the stock market today. Raytheon rose 0.7% to 164.01. Both stocks are still in buy range.Hewson's bullishness on missile-defense programs came a day after the Pentagon successfully tested Boeing's (BA) Ground-Based Midcourse Defense anti-missile system for use against possible North Korean missiles aimed at the U.S.Boeing shares rose 0.4% to 187.63, also still in buying territory.Still, the THAAD deployment has been controversial in South Korea, whose new president just ordered a probe after claiming that his defense ministry didn't tell him that four more launchers were brought into the country. The initial two THAAD launchers were deployed in March, before he was elected.China also opposes the THAAD deployment in South Korea, over fears its radar capabilities could be used to aid in an attack.Despite the outcry, North Korea's continued missile tests bolster THAAD backers. Pyongyang has launched 12 missiles so far this year alone, including one Monday that flew 280 miles before landing in the Sea of Japan.RELATED: Lockheed Sees More F-35, Missile Defense Orders From Abroad

336,RTN,"Stock futures rose solidly Monday morning, suggesting a positive start to the week after a volatile, split market over the last several sessions. Techs were leading the way, but the Dow Jones industrial average may open at a record high.A U.S. Boeing (BA) F/A-18E Super Hornet on Sunday shot down a Syrian government bomber, a day ahead of the Paris Air Show. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) starts the week under heavy pressure even as Facebook, Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) find key support. Markets are still digesting Amazon's $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods Market (WFM), which may yet get a rival bid.Boeing and Apple are both members of the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing is now the top-performing Dow stock in 2017, up 26%. Apple has fallen to third, up 23%, with McDonald's (MCD) now second.Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.35% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.65%.Stocks also were gaining overseas. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.6% and China's Shanghai composite 0.7%. In Europe, the major averages rose as Brexit talks were set to begin and after new French President Macron's centrist party decisively won parliamentary elections. The U.K.'s FTSE climbed 0.55%, Germany's Dax 0.85% and France's CAC-40 0.9%.X The Pentagon said Sunday that a U.S.-flown Boeing F/A-18E brought down a Syrian regime SU-22 bomber jet that was attacking anti-regime, American-allied fighters. It's the first time the U.S. has shot down a Syrian jet during its civil war.That comes a day ahead of the start of the Paris Air Show, where Boeing, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other makers of civilian and military aircraft will show off their wares and announce big orders. Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter is expected to display high-G maneuvers and fancy flying to wow that crowd.IBD'S TAKE: For more chart analysis of Facebook, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet, check out IBD's latest Stocks To Watch column.It's an important time for defense spending. European leaders are stepping up defense spending amid pressure from President Trump to live up to NATO commitments. Meanwhile, Trump has hinted at giving a new contract for more F/A-18 fighters, which are cheaper than the cutting-edge F-35.Boeing's Paris Air Show is likely to focus on orders for its new 737 Max 10 stretch passenger jet as well as any buzz about a new, midrange airliner to compete with Airbus (EADSY) and its A321neo jet.Boeing announced a SpiceJet order early Monday for 40 new 737 Max 10 planes, including 20 new orders and 20 converted from 737 Max 8 orders.Boeing shares are at record levels, now slightly extended from an 185.81 flat base entry after spending several weeks in buying zone. Boeing shares edged higher in premarket trading on the stock market today.Lockheed Martin is in buy range from 270 entry initially cleared on March 17 but only decisively cleared a month ago. Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are all in buy zones as well.Apple has now flashed several sell signals over the past several sessions. Apple shares fell 4.5% last week in the heaviest weekly volume in two months and the heaviest weekly volume in a down week in 13 months. Apple is now 9% below its mid-March record high and is starting to lose sight of its 50-day moving average.Apple was up about 1% in premarket trade.Meanwhile, Alphabet, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet have all found support at the 50-day moving average. Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock briefly undercut that level on June 9, but has held above that level since then and never closed below that level. Facebook dropped below the 50-day several times over the prior six sessions, but always closed higher. Alphabet tested but never dropped below that key support line.The rebounds, which generally came on higher volume, offer a chance for follow-on buys or an initial positive. Keep in mind that the uptrend is under pressure, so investors should be cautious about many any purchase.As for Netflix (NFLX), the fourth member of the ""FANG"" internet group, that stock is hovering below its 50-day line, though it's showing a little better action than Apple.Whole Foods shot up 29% to 42.68 on Friday, above Amazon's 42-a-share offer. Some investors and analysts see a higher bid as possible, with pure-play grocers Kroger (KR) and private-equity backed Albertsons cited as possible suitors. But Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) also suggested. Wal-Mart is the No. 1 grocer seller in the U.S., with Target also a big player.No doubt many grocery sellers' top executives and boards were mulling their next moves over the weekend.Shares of Kroger and other grocery sellers were big losers last week, amid concerns about the impact of an Amazon-Whole Foods deal and Kroger's big profit warning.RELATED:Why Lockheed's F-35 Could Stun Crowds At The Paris Air ShowParis Air Show Preview: This Will Be 'The Big Thing'Paris Air Show 2017: Latest Defense And Aerospace News And DealsThat's No Moon: Boeing, Apple Could Build This Disrupter In Space

James Syring said in a statement.The anti-missile system, launched from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base, successfully intercepted a target intercontinental ballistic missile fired from the Marshall Islands late Tuesday afternoon.""The GMD program remains on track to evolve and modernize this crucial national defense asset in the face of an evolving threat environment, with system upgrades and future technology,"" Norm Tew, Boeing's program director, said in a statement.Boeing is the prime contractor and key subcontractors include Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN), and Orbital ATK (OA).

338,RTN,"Janus Henderson Forty Fund (JACAX) is about as hot as Kevin Durant was in the NBA Finals. That is, very!Thirty-two of the fund's 40 stocks had double-digit percentage gains so far this year going into June 14, according to Morningstar Inc. Three of those — electric car maker Tesla (TSLA), video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and railroad CSX (CSX) — were up more than 50% for the year. As a result, going into Wednesday the fund's 19.38% year-to-date gain topped 90% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged 14.77%, and the S&P 500's 10.03% gain.The $751 million fund got more good news on Friday. Its No. 8 holding Amazon (AMZN) was up nearly 3% in the afternoon while the broad market measured by the S&P 500 was down roughly 1%. The Amazon boost reflected the market's thumbs-up vote in favor of the internet giant's takeover of Whole Foods Market (WFM), which was announced in the morning. That put Amazon up 32% for the year. Investors appeared to believe that Amazon will be able to sweeten up Whole Foods' revenues and earnings.Thomson Reuters ranked the deal as Amazon's biggest of all time and the 11th biggest global retail deal ever.Already, the fund was outperforming 81% and 99% of its direct rivals over the past one and three years respectively. Lead manager Douglas Rao has been at the helm since June 1, 2013. Nick Schommer has been a manager since Jan. 12, 2016.The fund is growth oriented. And it is concentrated. True to its name, the fund limits its portfolio to its 40 best ideas. And, yes, that concentration can make the fund more volatile than its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.For example, in the fourth quarter the fund lost 1.47% vs. a 0.27% loss for the Russell bogey and a 3.82% gain by the S&P 500. The fund was hurt in part by the market's rotation away from the secular growth stocks it likes, toward companies with potential for improving cyclical prospects, the managers explain in their recent semiannual report. Cyclicals in energy, materials and industrials, for instance, benefited from the Trump Bump — a surge in bets on companies that could gain from increased spending on U.S. infrastructure.The fund's top performers have trended higher through the market's indecisive seesaw between cyclical and secular growth stocks in recent months.Look again at the fund's top performers. As IBD's Gillian Rich reported Tuesday, Tesla was upgraded to a buy at Berenberg and had its price target raised to 464 from 193. Despite efforts by BMW, Kia and General Motors (GM), analyst Alexander Haissl said no other automakers are currently building electric vehicles for the mass market that can compete with Tesla's offerings. The Model 3 is expected to go into production this year. Haissl also said the company's free-cash-flow potential is superior.Tesla is in IBD's Automobile Manufacturers industry group, which ranks No. 2 among 197 groups. Tesla closed at record highs in six of the eight trading sessions through Wednesday. Trading around 380, the stock is extended, outside its buy range for investors looking for optimal entry points.Also, some yellow caution flags are flapping around the stock's earnings. After posting a third-quarter profit, the company resumed losses the next two quarters, and the narrowing of the losses from year-earlier periods has slowed. And recent earnings-estimate revisions have been downward.Activision is also extended, trading in the high 50s. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Last month, Activision's first-quarter sales and earnings topped estimates. The company's Q2 revenue forecast topped expectations, but its EPS outlook was below analysts' views.CSX runs rail systems in 23 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces. Its services include intermodal and rail-to-truck transload processes. Unlike those of Tesla and Activision, shares of CSX have slipped back into a buy range above their 50.41 entry.EPS grew 21% and 38% the past two quarters after four quarters of declines. Energy shipments and a stronger economy have boosted the rail firm's revenue.IBD'S TAKE: CSX ranks No. 1 in IBD's Transportation-Rail industry group. It has a 25.8% annual pretax margin. See how its additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' data at IBD's Stock Checkup.Among other holdings, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is another member of the IBD 50. Trading around 468, it has slipped back within a buy range from a 453.06 entry on a long cup base.EPS grew between 22% and 36% in each of the past four quarters. The drugmaker's Eylea macular degeneration treatment has been driving its growth. But that's not the only piston in Regeneron's engine. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges recently wrote to clients that Dupixent, an eczema treatment marketed by Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY), could easily outperform Wall Street models for the second quarter and for 2017 overall, IBD's Allison Gatlin has reported.Aerospace and defense stock General Dynamics (GD) is trading around 200, so it is still within buy range of a 194.10 buy point. EPS grew 7%, 9%, 9% and 19% the past four quarters.The company is positioned to benefit from President Trump's budget proposal, which would boost defense spending by 9.5% in fiscal 2018. And the company was one of several defense contractors — the others were Raytheon (RTN), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) — that signed memorandums of understanding with Saudi Arabia as part of last month's U.S.-Saudi Arabia arms deal.A merger between Janus Capital Group and U.K.-based Henderson Group closed May 30, creating Janus Henderson Group (JHG). Shareholders in what had been Janus funds should watch to see if the combined entity creates economies of scale that it can pass along in the form of lower mutual fund fees.Shareholders should also keep their eyes peeled for any manager departures from their funds. In some cases at other companies, veteran managers with ownership stakes cash out or leave. Some don't want to deal with culture clashes or fallout from corporate integration. Others are pushed out due to performance or cost cutting.The Janus-Henderson merger makes sense from a distribution viewpoint, since each asset manager has larger footprints in different geographic areas, according to Morningstar Inc.Both firms pared their fund lineups in the run-up to the merger. Janus merged two of its funds into other funds it ran (including Janus Twenty into Janus Henderson Forty) and one into a Henderson portfolio. It also closed one fund. Henderson made comparable moves. In addition, Janus Henderson is in the process of merging what had been two other Janus funds.RELATED:Janus Forty Managers Win With Bets On Proven Champs, Up-And-Comers And Calculated RisksHow To Turn A Glass Of Wine Into A $173,000 Bump In Your IRA

339,RTN,"X Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) were among firms that promised tech transfers and local development as part of $150 billion in deals with Saudi Arabia announced during President Trump's visit over the weekend.Technology transfers and local production could boost the kingdom's industrial know-how as it diversifies away from oil and potentially reduces its dependence on U.S.-made products, despite Trump's ""America first"" policy promise. However, some of the deals were negotiated under the Obama administration, and many aren't finalized yet, with more negotiations needed.Lockheed said in a release that Saudi Arabia wants to buy more than $28 billion in ""integrated air and missile defense, combat ship, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs.""A letter of intent was singed with Saudi tech firm Taqnia to form a joint venture to support the completion of 150 S-70 Black Hawk helicopters.Lockheed has been eager to offer technology transfers and joint-venture opportunities to boost its market share overseas.

341,RTN,"So by the sounds of it, so many expected yesterday to be the day it all would change! A number of high profile 'tech' names reported earnings and the results were 'less than stellar' - not horrible, but just a bit disappointing......Commodities continued to weaken.........The chatter was all doom and gloom, THIS was going to be the catalyst for the market to correct. OMG! What would this all say about China? It's as if the whole world is dependent upon this one country.....It's the herd mentality playing out.....
"
342,RTN,"Apple (AAPL) - reported another great quarter - yet somehow so many seemed to find something wrong with the report or the $48 billion they earned or the 47 million units they sold or the $49 billion they are expected to earn in the current quarter..whatever.....That is what traders do - they react and pounce.....Investors do not...they do the analysis, they strategize and they lay out the plan - then they take advantage of the opportunity created by the short-term disruption....... and take advantage is what they did....buyers yesterday will be patting themselves on the back today as Apple begins the climb back. Look for it to struggle a bit at $127.80 - but after that - it's off to the races yet again......Just sayin.....
"
343,RTN,"Then we get the likes of some high profile market strategists - (Dennis Gartman) seeing 'the makings of a protracted bear market' - as he, like so many others, jumps on the commodity breakdown bandwagon......Gold, Copper, Oil, Wheat, Soybeans, all collapsing. Is it because of the strong dollar or because of weakening global demand? Are those concepts mutually exclusive? No.....they go hand in hand..... Hey look! Commodities and the Dollar have an inverse relationship....when one goes up the other goes down - commodities are priced in dollars, foreign buyers will use dollars to buy commodities, so when the value of the dollar rises they have LESS buying power - putting pressure on demand, conversely when the dollar weakens - then they have more buying power which should naturally produce more demand....so before we all go and make ourselves crazy that there is a global slowdown and the end of the world is coming (again) - consider the natural inverse relationship between the dollar commodities.

A number of high profile 'tech' names reported earnings and the results were 'less than stellar' - not horrible, but just a bit disappointing......Commodities continued to weaken.........The chatter was all doom and gloom, THIS was going to be the catalyst for the market to correct. OMG! What would this all say about China? It's as if the whole world is dependent upon this one country.....It's the herd mentality playing out.....Apple (AAPL) - reported another great quarter - yet somehow so many seemed to find something wrong with the report or the $48 billion they earned or the 47 million units they sold or the $49 billion they are expected to earn in the current quarter..whatever.....That is what traders do - they react and pounce.....Investors do not...they do the analysis, they strategize and they lay out the plan - then they take advantage of the opportunity created by the short-term disruption....... and take advantage is what they did....buyers yesterday will be patting themselves on the back today as Apple begins the climb back. Look for it to struggle a bit at $127.80 - but after that - it's off to the races yet again......Just sayin.....Then we get the likes of some high profile market strategists - (Dennis Gartman) seeing 'the makings of a protracted bear market' - as he, like so many others, jumps on the commodity breakdown bandwagon......Gold, Copper, Oil, Wheat, Soybeans, all collapsing. Is it because of the strong dollar or because of weakening global demand? Are those concepts mutually exclusive? No.....they go hand in hand..... Hey look! Commodities and the Dollar have an inverse relationship....when one goes up the other goes down - commodities are priced in dollars, foreign buyers will use dollars to buy commodities, so when the value of the dollar rises they have LESS buying power - putting pressure on demand, conversely when the dollar weakens - then they have more buying power which should naturally produce more demand....so before we all go and make ourselves crazy that there is a global slowdown and the end of the world is coming (again) - consider the natural inverse relationship between the dollar commodities.

"
361,RTN,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 wowed crowds at the Farnborough Airshow in the U.K. last month, streaking across the sky, hovering in midair and even flying backward. Weeks later, the Air Force declared its version of the F-35 combat ready. Despite ongoing concerns about its development, the stealth fighter continues to reach key milestones, and production will hit full speed in a few years.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, has locked down the other key piece of the Pentagon's combat aircraft upgrade cycle, winning the B-21 contract last year to build replacements for Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.With the $400 billion F-35 and $80 billion B-21 contracts in hand, Lockheed and Northrop would appear to have established air superiority. But there are hundreds of billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars still up for grabs, and demand overseas for high-tech missiles is on the rise, meaning Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing can make more money and boost their shares as the new weapons stay in service for decades.""The general view at the moment is that investors prefer the longer horizon of a defense portfolio,"" said Howard Rubel, Jefferies managing director in equity research. ""If you look at the viability of Northrop or Raytheon today, there is enough turmoil that defense will continue to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy.""And Lockheed's expected organic growth of 4% through 2018 tops the 2.8% pace for the overall defense sector, Goldman Sachs said Wednesday, citing the F-35 program's size. Growth at Northrop, Raytheon and Flir Systems (FLIR), however, could outpace Lockheed's, Goldman added.Lockheed shares fell 1.65% Friday and are up 12.6% so far this year. Northrop dipped 0.7% but has seen a 12% climb in 2016. Raytheon has run 13% higher, while Boeing has lost 8.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed shares have eased below buy range, Northrop is 5.5% below an entry point, while Raytheon is above buying territory. While Boeing has been a drag on the Aerospace/Defense group, the pure-play defense stocks have helped lift the industry group to No. 66 out of the 197 IBD tracks, and they also have been boosting their dividends.Boeing, however, is entering a transition period in its defense unit, which lost the B-21 bid with partner Lockheed. As production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet eventually winds down, Boeing -- whose 100-year history includes icons like the B-17 Flying Fortress and the P-51 Mustang -- faces the prospect of no longer making fighters or bombers.In July, Boeing's top defense executive said that the aerospace giant would shift its focus from new fighter jets to maintenance services on existing aircraft, new helicopters, satellites, space programs, and selling more military versions of its passenger jets. But Boeing said that decision wasn't based on one contract loss.""No one competition is going to drive that. It's a matter of managing the investment portfolio that we have with the opportunity and campaigns that we want to go after and win,"" Steve Nordlund, Boeing's vice president for strategy for defense, space and security, said in an interview.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon and other defense contractors are turning their sights to U.S. nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Late last month, the Air Force released requests for proposals for a Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system, and a Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.The GBSD's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years (though an independent Pentagon cost assessment found that estimate is too low). The LRSO's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded next year.Boeing officials were bullish in a recent interview with IBD that they would win the award for the GBSD, based on past work in the field.""We are confident the Air Force can rely on us, given our proven commitment,"" said Rich Choppa, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing's defense unit. ""We are just as committed to developing a new system as we were back in 1958 when we developed the Minuteman system that stood the test of time.""Other potential prime contractors for the Minuteman upgrade include Lockheed and Northrop. Some 37 other contractors are bidding on subcontractor work.The issue of ""helicopter money"" isn't limited to central banks. But unlike the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, the Pentagon isn't contemplating a massive dump of cash from hovering helicopters. Instead, the Pentagon is preparing a massive dump of cash onto makers of helicopters.While less sexy than fighter jets and supersonic missiles, the U.S. military's fleet of helicopters is also due for an upgrade. The Army is looking to replace its Black Hawk helicopters as heavy use in Afghanistan and Iraq have worn them out faster than expected. Textron's (TXT) Bell division is competing against a Boeing-Sikorsky team.The Army is also looking at replacements for its Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook as well as its Bell OH-58 Kiowa. Providing helicopters to take the places of all four aircraft will be worth an estimated $100 billion. The Pentagon is expected to seek official proposals in 2019, followed by a contract award in 2020.""We feel very strong about our military helicopter position in the market place and the capabilities we would provide customers,"" Boeing's Nordlund said.Lockheed has spent heavily in helicopters, acquiring Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year for $9 billion and is looking to recoup its investment.Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop are all competing for another major Pentagon contract: the Air Force's $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer jet, which will be used to train F-22 and F-35 pilots and has potential for massive overseas sales to international customers like the U.K., Italy and others who are buying the F-35.Raytheon is on an industry team that includes Finmeccanica and CAE. Lockheed has partnered with Korea Aerospace Industries. Boeing and Saab are bidding together, and Northrop is leading a coalition that includes BAE Systems and L-3 Communications (LLL). The competition is expected to be fierce, and a contract award is expected late next year.On Lockheed's Q2 conference call, CEO Marillyn Hewson called its upgraded T-50A, which completed its first test flight in South Korea in June, ""a very good offering. It's an excellent solution. It's low risk.""Boeing has kept its design under wraps, only releasing concept art of the nose of a jet, though more details are expected next month. Pictures of a Northrop prototype in Mojave, Calif., leaked out earlier this week and appeared to share some similarities with the Air Force's current trainer jet, the T-38, which is also made by Northrop.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.The program has been scaled back from its original inception, which envisioned a drone that would perform strike and surveillance missions.The Navy is still working on the requirements for the tanker drone, but stealth won't be on that list, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker told reporters earlier this month. The service plans to issue a formal request for proposals in the second half of next year and award a contract in 2018.Derrick Maple, unmanned systems analyst at IHS Markit, estimates that development, production and support costs could reach $6 billion.As missiles become more advanced, foreign governments are increasingly looking to them to boost defenses amid deepening global tensions.Last year, Raytheon booked a $2 billion order from Saudi Arabia for its Patriot missile and air defense system. South Korea and Japan are also paying Raytheon to upgrade their Patriot systems as the missile threat from North Korea looms. And by year's end, the Polish government is expected to finalize a Patriot deal that is estimated at $5.5 billion amid rising friction with Russia.Raytheon is also working with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems on revamping the Iron Dome defense system for its bid for the U.S. Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 as protection against missiles and drones, among other threats.Raytheon isn't alone in the missile-defense market. Lockheed's THAAD system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. Lockheed and partner MBDA, a European defense giant, are bidding on a $4.5 billion German missile-defense deal that could be wrapped up later this year.And while U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has greatly diminished over the last decade, the war against ISIS is boosting demand for munitions. Berenberg analysts said earlier this year that they expect sales of Lockheed's Hellfire missiles and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to climb 7%-8% this year on ""restocking activities in the U.S. and export demand.""Geopolitical strains should continue spurring more spending. In addition to the Islamic State in the Middle East, Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Russia flexing its muscles in Eastern Europe, disputes with China in the East China Sea are leading Japan to develop a land-to-sea missile system of its own. Top U.S. defense contractors may get involved.""The thing with these top-tier contractors, they have a lot of capabilities they can apply to various product areas that they want to invest in,"" Jefferies analyst Rubel said.RELATED:Lockheed F-35 'On A Path Toward Failing To Deliver' Full CapabilityNavy To Modernize Boeing Super Hornets To Fly With Lockheed F-35Boeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries'

363,RTN,"The Air Force has said its version of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 is ready to be sent into battle, but the Pentagon's top weapons tester warned full combat capabilities are ""at a substantial risk"" of missing deadlines.""In fact the program is actually not on a path toward success but instead on a path toward failing to deliver"" the aircraft's full capabilities, ""for which the Department is paying almost $400 billion by the scheduled end"" of its development in 2018, Michael Gilmore, the Defense Department's director of operational testing, said in an Aug. 9 memo obtained by Bloomberg News.The Air Force declared initial combat capability on Aug. 2 but the fighter won't have its full war-fighting complement, including the ability to fire its 25 mm Gatling gun, until its 3F software upgrade next year.And the fighter is expected to reach full operational capability in the 2021-2022 time frame. But the memo puts these timelines in doubt as issues with software and other systems continue.The program ""is running out of time and money to complete the planned flight testing and implement the required fixes and modifications,"" the memo said according to the Bloomberg report. ""Flight testing is making progress but has fallen far behind the planned rate.""Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the F-35 program office, told Bloomberg in an e-mail that ""there were absolutely no surprises"" in the memo and ""all of the issues mentioned are well-known.""Lockheed shares fell 0.65% to 248.12 on the stock market today. The stock fell as low as 244.80 in the morning, briefly undercutting the 245.47 buy point that Lockheed cleared at the end of June. Lockheed slid 1.75% on Tuesday, closing below its 50-day moving average for the first time in six months.Despite the developmental issues, the F-35 program will drive long-term growth for Lockheed. On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said the F-35 will allow Lockheed's revenue to grow faster than the overall industry though its programs outside the fighter won't be substantial growth drivers.Goldman said only Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35, Raytheon (RTN) and FLIR Systems (FLIR) will grow faster than Lockheed.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed, Northrop and other defense giants have come out of bases and moved into or near buy range.

366,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) stock fell below its 50-day line Tuesday, continuing a week-long slide as its Leidos exchange price finalized, and as several defense stocks faced key technical tests.Lockheed shares fell 1.75% to 249.75 on the stock market today, dropping below the 50-day moving average after finding support at that level over the past six months. Shares are still above a 245.47 buy point from a base-on-base pattern cleared at the end of June, but Tuesday's heavy-volume slide through the 50-day line raises concerns.The defense contractor closed its $4.6 billion deal to sell its IT business to Leidos (LDOS), making Leidos the largest IT provider for the federal government. The deal was announced in January, but the companies faced regulatory issues.Leidos shares dipped 0.7% to 40.08 Tuesday.However, Lockheed has been making gains in its aerospace and missile sectors.Earlier this month, the Air Force declared its version of Lockheed's F-35 fighter ready for combat. The service eventually plans to procure 1,763 F-35As. In July 2015, the F-35B variant was declared combat-ready by the Marines and was set for deployment to Japan in 2017. The Navy's version, the F-35C, is expected to be combat-ready between 2018 and 2019.Lockheed and rivals Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Boeing (BA) are among potential contractors for the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile system to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman missiles.Northrop shares were down 1.7% to 214.50. The stock has been trading up and down from its 50-day line in recent weeks, but fell Tuesday to its lowest level since June 28. Northrop is below a 218.94 buy point after breaking out of a flat base in June.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed, Northrop and other defense giants have come out of bases and moved into or near buy range. Learn how to read the different types of bases and other chart patterns at IBD University. In October, Northrop won a contract to build new strategic bombers to replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, beating a Boeing-Lockheed team. The bomber deal is estimated to be worth $50 billion-$80 billion.Boeing hasn't fared as well as its peers in the aerospace and defense sector, as slowing demand for commercial planes has weighed on the stock.But Boeing is busy on the defense side, not just with the missile deal, but also by submitting a bid for the Air Force's new $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer program to replace the Air Force's 500 Northrop T-38 jets. Northrop, Lockheed and Raytheon (RTN) are also submitting bids.Boeing is also eyeing rotor contracts as the Army looks to replace its Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook, and Bell OH-58 Kiowa helicopters.Boeing shares fell 0.6% to 134.14 Tuesday, well off their February 2015 peak but modestly above the 50-day and 200-day lines.Raytheon broke out of a flat base in April and has been trading above its buy range since late July. Shares were off 1% to 141.18 but are near highs and holding above their 50-day line.General Dynamics (GD), once considered a laggard in the group, hit a new high of 153.80 on Aug. 15.

368,RTN,"Fortunate flukes play a vital role in product development. How inventors stumble into bright ideas:
"
369,RTN," Make do. Some of Americans' favorite food came about because chefs lacked basic ingredients and had to improvise. ""The most popular creation stories for the Caesar salad, nachos and the Cobb salad all follow this path,"" said Josh Chetwynd, author of ""How the Hot Dog Found Its Bun.""
"
370,RTN,"The entrepreneurial lesson?
"
371,RTN,"When you're lacking assets you think you need, ""it's often the best time to innovate,"" he told IBD.
"
372,RTN," Spot opportunity. Some creators simply paid attention to what others overlooked.
"
373,RTN,"""This book is a reminder over and over again of the famed Louis Pasteur quote: 'In the field of observation, chance favors only the prepared mind,'"" Chetwynd said.
"
374,RTN,"Take the microwave's inventor.
"
375,RTN,"Raytheon (RTN) employees were in the radar business, and most didn't think much about how those magnetron tubes warmed things — such as a candy bar in staffer Percy Spencer's pocket.
"
376,RTN,"""Unlike all the people before him, Spencer recognized that there could be something special here and started doing tests,"" Chetwynd said.
"
377,RTN," Keep trying. Ralph Wiley had the lowly job of washing lab glassware at Dow Chemical (DOW). When one beaker wouldn't come clean, the 20-something worker kept trying to find a chemical that would break down the residue.
"
378,RTN,"His persistent tinkering led to a job as a research scientist, and that substance he couldn't clear away — once greenish and smelly — was refined into a wrapping for World War II supply shipments, and later the popular dish-covering Saran Wrap.
"
379,RTN," Change courses. ""If you're only looking for one result and are unwilling to be creative and intuitive, you may very well miss out on a great alternative development,"" Chetwynd said.
"
380,RTN,"That was the case with door-to-door aluminum cookware salesman Edwin Cox. He was looking for something to give away, to get his foot in housewives' doors.
"
381,RTN,"Back in 1917, coal-fired stoves blackened pan bottoms, so Cox soaked steel wool in suds until he got a foamy scrubber.
"
382,RTN,"As housewives clamored for more, Cox realized he should forget selling pans and focus on manufacturing his S.O.S Pads.
"
383,RTN," Find purpose. The inventor of the graham cracker had a dubious intention. ""This popular treat was created by a guy named Sylvester Graham for the express purpose of limiting people's sex drives,"" Chetwynd said.
"
384,RTN,"The preacher, medical guru and vegetarian felt certain food — sugar, oil and white flour — made people excitable, so he created the blander cracker in 1829 as part of his clean living regime.
"
385,RTN,"Graham would die in 1851 at the age of 57, but his cracker would be refined and live on in campfire s'mores. The lesson? ""Even the craziest of inspirations can ultimately be turned into something good,"" Chetwynd said.
"
386,RTN," Showcase it. Credit for how the hot dog got its bun is typically traced back to two entrepreneurs:
"

"
390,RTN,"""At the 1904 World's Fair in his hometown of St. Louis, Feuchtwanger was a popular concessionaire who did really well with his hot-dog-plus-bun combination,"" Chetwynd said.Fortunate flukes play a vital role in product development. How inventors stumble into bright ideas: Make do. Some of Americans' favorite food came about because chefs lacked basic ingredients and had to improvise. ""The most popular creation stories for the Caesar salad, nachos and the Cobb salad all follow this path,"" said Josh Chetwynd, author of ""How the Hot Dog Found Its Bun.""The entrepreneurial lesson?When you're lacking assets you think you need, ""it's often the best time to innovate,"" he told IBD. Spot opportunity. Some creators simply paid attention to what others overlooked.""This book is a reminder over and over again of the famed Louis Pasteur quote: 'In the field of observation, chance favors only the prepared mind,'"" Chetwynd said.Take the microwave's inventor.Raytheon (RTN) employees were in the radar business, and most didn't think much about how those magnetron tubes warmed things — such as a candy bar in staffer Percy Spencer's pocket.""Unlike all the people before him, Spencer recognized that there could be something special here and started doing tests,"" Chetwynd said. Keep trying. Ralph Wiley had the lowly job of washing lab glassware at Dow Chemical (DOW). When one beaker wouldn't come clean, the 20-something worker kept trying to find a chemical that would break down the residue.His persistent tinkering led to a job as a research scientist, and that substance he couldn't clear away — once greenish and smelly — was refined into a wrapping for World War II supply shipments, and later the popular dish-covering Saran Wrap. Change courses. ""If you're only looking for one result and are unwilling to be creative and intuitive, you may very well miss out on a great alternative development,"" Chetwynd said.That was the case with door-to-door aluminum cookware salesman Edwin Cox. He was looking for something to give away, to get his foot in housewives' doors.Back in 1917, coal-fired stoves blackened pan bottoms, so Cox soaked steel wool in suds until he got a foamy scrubber.As housewives clamored for more, Cox realized he should forget selling pans and focus on manufacturing his S.O.S Pads. Find purpose. The inventor of the graham cracker had a dubious intention. ""This popular treat was created by a guy named Sylvester Graham for the express purpose of limiting people's sex drives,"" Chetwynd said.The preacher, medical guru and vegetarian felt certain food — sugar, oil and white flour — made people excitable, so he created the blander cracker in 1829 as part of his clean living regime.Graham would die in 1851 at the age of 57, but his cracker would be refined and live on in campfire s'mores. The lesson? ""Even the craziest of inspirations can ultimately be turned into something good,"" Chetwynd said. Showcase it. Credit for how the hot dog got its bun is typically traced back to two entrepreneurs:Coney Island's Charles Feltman put bread and hot dogs together as a portable hot sandwich for his customers in 1871.A dozen years later, St. Louis meat purveyor Anton Feuchtwanger tried buns as a tidy wrap for his red hot sausages.Feuchtwanger would ultimately take a bigger bite of food fame.""At the 1904 World's Fair in his hometown of St. Louis, Feuchtwanger was a popular concessionaire who did really well with his hot-dog-plus-bun combination,"" Chetwynd said.

413,RTN,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported second-quarter earnings and revenue gains Wednesday that were stronger than expected, and the company raised its full-year 2016 earnings guidance.But it also recorded a drop in technology service sales that impacted its profit margin, driving its share price down early Wednesday.Earnings rose 4% to $2.85 a share, beating analyst consensus by 32 cents a share.

414,RTN,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) all beat forecasts, while McDonald's (MCD) and Ford Motor (F) indicated some weakness in U.S. demand. Tech M&A stepped up, including a Verizon (VZ) deal to buy Yahoo's (YHOO) core assets. The U.S. economy is growing a lot slower than expected, and oil prices are nearing $40 a barrel.The Nasdaq composite rose 1.2% to its best levels since early December, fueled by strong earnings from Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7%, also snapping a four-week uptrend, as weaker oil prices and earnings reports hit the energy sector. The Federal Reserve's statement that the ""near-term economic risks"" have ""diminished"" seemed to have little impact on investors.The iPhone maker earned $1.42 a share, down 23% year over year, on sales of $42.4 billion, down 15%. It was Apple's second straight declines in earnings, revenue and iPhone sales -- but they were still better than expected. Apple's current-quarter revenue target is $46.5 billion at the midpoint, off 10% but above Wall Street consensus of $45.71 billion.

EPS jumped 94% to 97 cents, shattering consensus for 82 cents. It was the fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. Facebook stock rose 2.4% to 123.94, hitting a record high and still within range of a 121.18 buy point.Twitter (TWTR) reported Q2 EPS that topped views. But revenue fell short, and Q3 revenue guidance also missed estimates. Twitter stock fell 9.4% but closed the week above its 50-day line.Bouncing back from a Q1 miss, Alphabet reported Q2 EPS and revenue that blew past expectations. The Google parent's earnings minus items rose 20% to $8.42 a share. Total revenue climbed 21% to $21.5 billion. Despite Google's size, it's still delivering growth, says Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker's Q2 earnings per share and revenue rose, but EPS growth was weakest in five quarters, sales growth was the slimmest in three quarters, and Ford cited ""downside risk to global growth."" Offering further evidence of slowing, auto parts maker Lear (LEA) missed on sales and warned on 2016 revenue, while Gentherm (THRM) earnings missed. Volkswagen (VLKAY) Q2 sales edged up 1.7%, but its net profit plunged 57% vs. a year early as it struggled to recover from an emissions test cheating scandal involving diesel-engine models.Ford stock fell 8.5%.The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged after its two-day policy meeting, as expected. Policymakers said ""near-term economic risks ... have diminished,"" suggesting a baby step to raising rates, and some analysts said it opened the door, slightly, to a September rate increase. But after the Fed meeting and weak GDP data, investors pushed back their expectations for the next hike beyond the next 12 months.The U.S. economy rose at a 1.2% annual rate in Q2, less than half of what Wall Street expected, after Q1's downwardly revised 0.8% pace. Consumer spending was very strong, climbing 4.2%.But residential investment fell, even as separate reports show new- and existing-home sales hitting multiyear highs. Business investment contracted for a third straight quarter. With oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel, corporate spending may remain weak going forward.U.S. crude oil futures tumbled 5.9% to $41.60 a barrel, hitting three-month lows as the crude tumbled 13.9% for July. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains.

Both topped views. The maker of driver-assistance systems said that its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) is ending. That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared.

Raytheon (RTN) beat views and raised profit guidance. General Dynamics (GD) topped on earnings and raised EPS guidance, but Q2 revenue missed.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38. Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. U.S. same-store sales rose just 1.8%. Management said they were ""not immune"" to consumer unease -- be it over finances, the election or, in general, ""an unsettled world"" -- that may have hurt other restaurants during the quarter.Shares fell 8.3% to 117.60 for the week, tumbling through their 50-day and 200-day moving averages -- and a 124.18 buy point.Stifel Nicolaus downgraded a large number of restaurant stocks, while Jefferies predicted a U.S. recession would hit the sector.

Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance.

The ships had already been approved by the State Department in 2015 but the deal wasn't completed under President Obama.X A flurry of deals across the defense and energy sectors are expected during Trump's first presidential visit abroad.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, which costs roughly $1 billion, is expected to be part of a massive $100 billion defense package as well as software for command and control capabilities and satellite communications systems, also from Lockheed.Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner reportedly helped push the THAAD deal though by calling Lockheed's CEO Marillyn Hewson and asking her to lower the price for the Saudis, according to the New York Times.And a formal agreement for more Pac-3 Patriot missiles from Lockheed is expected as it has already been approved by Congress.Raytheon (RTN) is another big defense winner as Trump is expected to lift the Obama administration's hold on a $1 billion sale of  Penetrator Warheads and Paveway laser-guided bombs.An order for 115 M1A2 General Dynamics (GD) tanks is expected to be finalized during the visit as well.Lockheed shares rose 2% to 272.76 on the stock market today, retaking a 270 buy point. Raytheon climbed 1.5%, still in buying territory. General Dynamics advanced 1.7%, also retaking its own 194.10 entry. Northrop Grumman (NOC) rallied 1.2% to 249.84, closing above a 249.53 entry for the first time, though volume is low.On the energy side, General Electric (GE), Schlumberger (SLB), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) are expected to announce deals with Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state run oil company, according to an earlier Bloomberg report.Senior executives from Boeing (BA), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and 42 other companies are expected in Riyadh.

421,RTN,"More than $100 billion in arms deals to Saudi Arabia, including a Lockheed Martin (LMT) air-defense system, could be announced later this week as President Trump visits the kingdom in his first foreign trip since taking office.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, which costs roughly $1 billion, is expected to be part of the package, as well as software for command and control capabilities and satellite communications systems, also from Lockheed.Littoral Combat Ships are also expected to be in the mix. Lockheed makes one version, and a partnership between Australia's Austal and General Dynamics (GD) makes another.A $11.5 billion deal for four ships was approved by the State Department in 2015, but isn't yet in the final contract stage, according to Reuters sources.Many of the weapons had been part of an arms deal negotiated during the Obama administration but had yet to get the green light.For example, Obama had stopped the $1 billion sale last year of Raytheon (RTN) Penetrator Warheads and Paveway laser-guided bombs due to concerns that the weapons would be used in Yemen.But Trump has been more supportive of arms sales to allies in the Middle East as the threat from Iran grows. On Thursday, the State Department approved the sale of Lockheed's Patriot PAC-3 missiles and Raytheon's GEM-T missiles to the United Arab Emirates. And in March, the State Department submitted a notice to Congress allowing sales of Lockheed F-16s to Bahrain.Lockheed shares edged up 0.4% to 272.36 on the stock market today. Lockheed is in buy range, above its 270 entry point. Raytheon shares were up 1% to 160.09, still above their entry point of 157.69. General Dynamics dipped 0.2% to 195.15, but remaining in buy range.Arms sales to Mideast allies have to be measured against Israel's capabilities, so that it retains weapons superiority in the region.In September, the Obama White House approved sales of Boeing (BA) and Lockheed fighter jets to Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait, after the U.S. agreed to a $38 billion military aid package for Israel.Trump leaves for Saudi Arabia on May 19 and will also visit the Vatican, Israel and Brussels.RELATED: Lockheed Sees More F-35, Missile Defense Orders From Abroad

422,RTN,"President Trump's budget proposal would significantly hike research funds to develop a sixth-generation fighter that follows Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. But overall, there were few major changes in weapons procurement compared to the Obama administration's plans.The budget proposal, which also includes big tax cuts and substantial long-term curbs on Medicaid and food stamps, is seen as dead on arrival in Congress, but it still represents an opening offer from the Oval Office.The Pentagon's budget would grow to $574.5 billion in fiscal 2018, which starts in October, up 9.5% from what Congress appropriated this fiscal year. On top of that is $65 billion for the war-fighting fund, or the Overseas Contingency Operations account.Some of the increase in the Defense Department's baseline budget comes from Trump's plan to grow Army personnel by 26,000 active-duty troops. But the $115 billion for weapons procurement would largely be unchanged vs. what the Obama administration had planned for fiscal 2018.Quantities of big-ticket items like the F-35, Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet and Boeing KC-46 tanker are the same, as well as the number of destroyers, submarines and other Navy ships.But the budget request is asking for $295 million for the Next-Generation Air Dominance Program, which would replace Boeing Super Hornets in the Navy and develop a follow-on to the F-35 in the Air Force. That's a massive increase from the prior projection of $13 million.Some $187 million also would be added to research for Lockheed's F-22, amounting to total funds of $610 million.The fiscal 2018 proposal also calls for $434 million in R&D funds for Air Force One, the aircraft that carries the president, but that amounts to a roughly $192 million reduction from the $626 million estimate for fiscal 2018.In the weeks after his election, Trump called the new Boeing Air Force One too expensive, and he has vowed to bring competition to the fighter-jet business and cut costs for the F-35, which he has said was ""way, way behind schedule and many billions of dollars above budget.""Research and development for Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber would get a boost to $2 billion from $1.3 billion last year.Tens of thousand of missiles, bombs and related gear from Lockheed, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing are also in the budget plan, as the Pentagon seeks to replenish munitions stockpiles that have come down during the bombing campaign on ISIS targets.Lockheed Martin closed up 0.5% at 278.36 on the stock market today, holding above a 270 buy point. Boeing dipped 0.1% to 183.49, just below a 185.81 entry. Northrop rose 0.5% to 250.65, back above a 249.53 buy point. Raytheon edged up 0.2%, and General Dynamics (GD) climbed 0.8% to 199.32, with still in buy range.RELATED:5 Big Ways That Trump's Budget Doesn't Add UpHere's The Catch With The U.S.-Saudi Defense, Oil DealsSyria Attacks Light Up Dow Stock, Defense Names

424,RTN,"Stocks racked up commendable gains in light trade Monday, hauling both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average further above their 50-day moving averages.The session opened boosted by Saturday's announcement of more than $300 billion in long-term deals between U.S. manufacturers and Saudi Arabia, a set of bargains timed to correspond with President Trump's first trip to Saudi Arabia. The news lifted defense plays led by Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN), as well as National Oilwell Varco (NOV) and others.  Boeing and Lockheed Martin ended up nearly 2%.Ford (F) held its early gain, ending Monday up more than 2% after announcing it had replaced Chief Executive Mark Fields with Jim Hackett, the former CEO of Steelcase (SCS) who has headed Ford's Smart Mobility experimental operations unit. Fields held the CEO seat for three years. Ford shares have been in a 34-month decline.The Nasdaq composite led, up 0.8%, as more than 10% of the Nasdaq 100 stocks climbed more than 2%.  Autodesk (ADSK) led the Nasdaq 100, up more than 3% to a new high and adding to the 15% gain posted last week. Fiber optic telecom stocks posted the session's best gain among industries, boosted by a handful of analyst reports. Acacia Communications (ACIA), Applied OptoElectronics (AAOI) and Finisar (FNSR) each gained more than 10%.Makers of medical software also scored high, skewed higher by a 23% gain by the thinly traded Polarityte (COOL).  Group leader Veeva Systems (VEEV) is extended. But peer Cerner (CERN) is trading just below a 66.37 buy point in a four-weeks tight pattern.The Dow Jones industrial average scaled up 0.5%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) led the index, rebounding 2% as it looked to salvage support at its 40-week moving average after diving 7% in gale-force volume last week.Losses among blue chips were generally modest, Pfizer's (PFE) fell hardest among the Dow industrials, down 1%.The S&P 500 scored a 0.6% gain. Jack Daniels distiller Brown Forman (BFB) ran atop the list with an 8% gain, clearing its prior high from August 2015.Chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) sped 4% higher and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) jumped 3%, both taking new highs.Defense consultant Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) spiked 6%, possibly aided by Saturday's announcement of more than $300 billion in U.S-Saudi defense deals, but also because it reported first-quarter earnings and revenue above expectations, and hosted its full year revenue guidance past consensus targets.  The gap up gain lifted shares just above a 37.79 buy point in a flat base.RELATED:Dow Jones Industrial Average and Dow Stocks: News & AnalysisTop Housing Stocks Near Buy Points: Investing Action Plan

426,RTN,"President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia will be a busy one for the oil sector as General Electric (GE), Schlumberger (SLB), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) are expected to announce deals with Saudi Arabia's state run oil company, according to a Bloomberg report.Saudi Aramco is expected to sign the deals on Saturday. The report also said deals were expected with KBR Inc. (KBR), Jacobs Engineering (JEC), Nabors Industries (NBR), Weatherford International (WFT), McDermott International (MDR) and Rowan Companies (RDC).GE shares fell 2.25% to 27.41 on the stock market today, a fresh 15-month low Schlumberger dipped 0.5%, Baker Hughes fell 0.1% and Halliburton fell 0.9%, with crude oil futures up 0.8%. (General Electric is merging oil and gas assets with Baker Hughes.)Last month, Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said he was worried about global underinvestment but said that investments in the Middle East and Russia ""will remain resilient"" though activity won't really start to accelerate until 2018.The flurry of deals come as Aramco looks put nearly 5% of its company up for sale in an initial public offering next year. Lower oil prices have put a damper on the IPO, and the kingdom is looking at alternative means of revenue outside oil and gas to fund the government.Defense giants could also be big winners during Trump's visit, as more than $100 billion in arms sales are expected, including a Lockheed Martin (LMT) air-defense system and laser guided bombs from Raytheon (RTN).Lockheed shares fell 0.9% to 269.24, dropping just below a 270.10 buy point.

427,RTN,"Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is meeting with tech leaders in Silicon Valley after a gathering with Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other defense contractors last week in Washington D.C.There was no word on the executives with whom Prince Salman will be speaking, but the official Saudi Press Agency said talks with Apple (AAPL) have been ongoing, as the company looks forward to its entry into the Saudi market. Two weeks ago, Saudi Arabia announced a $3.5 billion investment in the ride sharing app Uber, which is based in San Francisco.Apple shares climbed 0.2% to 95.10 in the stock market today.Prince Salman has been pushing technology and diversifying Saudi Arabia's economy away from its overwhelming focus on oil and gas, as part of the new Saudi Vision 2030 economic plan.The kingdom has been spending more on defense as well -- with expenditures up 50% in 2015 vs. 2014 to $9.3 billion, according to a report by IHS -- due to growing threats in the region, including Syria, ISIS and rebels in Yemen.Prince Salman met with executives from Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon (RTN) to talk about expanding production facilities in Saudi Arabia.Boeing shares were up 2.3% to 132.75 at the close Monday. Lockheed shares rose 0.5% to 238.64. Raytheon shares edged up to 134.80.Prince Salman is expected to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon when he visits New York City on Tuesday.
"
428,RTN,"A Donald Trump presidency could weigh on ties with key U.S. allies, but Northrop Grumman (NOC) still expects strong international sales regardless of the outcome of the presidential election.At the Citi Industrials conference in Boston on Wednesday, Northrop CFO Ken Bedingfield said there is ""certainly some concern out there in terms of the relationships that have been long-standing partner countries, allied nations"" in response to a question about a how a Trump presidency could affect U.S. foreign relations.He added that ""one particular region probably has more fear of a Trump presidency than others in the globe,"" but one of the strengths of Northrop's portfolio is its diversification among Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.Northrop didn't respond to requests to clarify which region Bedingfield was referring to.The presumptive GOP presidential nominee has said the U.S. should leave NATO unless other members don't contribute more, and he raised questions about spending money to help defend ""wealthier"" Asian countries like Japan and South Korea.Trump also told the New York Times that he would likely stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates if they didn't send ground troops to fight the Islamic State, arguing that the U.S. isn't getting reimbursed for helping protect the Gulf.But Bedingfield still sees strong sales overseas for U.S. military products, as ""there is a recognition that the world is a dangerous place, and the U.S. and its allies need to inter-operate together."" He also stressed the strong relationships the defense contractor has with partner countries around the globe.The Asia-Pacific region may provide the strongest growth, with demand from South Korea, Japan and Australia, he said. In November, the State Department approved a potential sale of three Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk drones to Japan.Vietnam has also been on an arms-buying spree amid tensions over China’s expansion in the South China Sea.And now that the last U.S. embargo from the Vietnam War has been lifted, the country could be interested in the F/A-18 Super Hornet, which is built by Boeing (BA), with Northrop as a major supplier.Other potential winners from lifting the arms embargo include Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN).Northrop shares ended trading up 0.2% to 217.24 in the stock market today. Boeing shares edged up 0.3% to 130.16, Lockheed slid 0.1% to 239.45, and Raytheon tacked on 0.2% to 135.98.Defense companies have focused on boosting international sales to combat U.S. budget constraints. Meanwhile, as threats from China, Russia, Syria and ISIS grow, foreign allies are spending more money on defense.Global arms sales were up over 10% in 2015 vs. 2014, according to IHS. Saudi Arabia weapon sales were up 50% to $9.3 billion. Spending by counties near the South China Sea have risen by 71% since 2009.

431,RTN,"Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) could be big winners in Vietnam, as the U.S. fully lifts its arms embargo against its one-time enemy 41 years after the close of the Vietnam War. The country has been on an arms-buying spree amid tensions over China’s expansion in the South China Sea, and it is looking to reduce its reliance on Russian weapons in favor of U.S. and European alternatives. Vietnam is the world’s No. 8 arms importer, with sales jumping nearly 700% since 2005, Reuters reported, citing data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.Vietnam's military needs maritime patrol aircraft, such as used P-3Cs from Lockheed, as well as aerial refueling tankers like Boeing's new KC-46 -- which is facing cost overruns and development delays -- or Airbus' (EADSY) A330 MRTT, said Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS.Other requirements include fighter jets, such as Lockheed's F-16 or Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet. Vietnam could also be interested in helicopters from Boeing and Lockheed’s Sikorsky division, in addition to precision-guidance munitions from Raytheon and Boeing.Hanoi is likewise interested in the littoral combat ship (LCS) but first needs to put its air capabilities in order, Bobbi said. The ship is smaller than most U.S. Navy vessels and is designed for missions close to shore. Lockheed and General Dynamics (GD) make separate versions of the LCS.All that represents a tall order for Vietnam, but Bobbi said the country's dynamic, high-growth economy should allow the military to pay for a major upgrade.""The question of affordability is not as big a deal in respect to Vietnam vs. other countries, again because of their strong growth,"" he said.Hanoi could make its first orders before the end of the year. While President Obama signed an order lifting the arms embargo, the White House must notify Congress of sales of certain weapons. Even then, Bobbi sees few opponents in Congress to approving such deals.The announcement came as Obama starts a three-day visit to Vietnam, with the move seen as the latest U.S. effort to try to contain China's advances in the South China Sea. But Obama denied China was a factor.“The decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other considerations,” Obama said at a press conference in Hanoi. ""We’re going to continue to engage in the case-by-case evaluation of these sales. But what we do not have is a ban that is based on an ideological division between our two sides.""Meanwhile, demand from Asia more generally could help offset a slowdown in orders from Middle Eastern customers as oil prices remain depressed. U.S. defense contractors have targeted foreign sales after the Pentagon began reducing troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Lockheed wants foreign sales to account for 25% to 30% of total sales in coming years.On the commercial side, Boeing finalized an $11.3 billion order from VietJet Air on Monday. The carrier ordered 100 of Boeing's 737 Max 200 single-aisle airplanes, the largest order for a Vietnamese passenger carrier and one that will double VietJet’s fleet to over 200 planes. Deliveries are scheduled between 2019 and 2023.Obama also announced an agreement between General Electric's (GE) (GE) wind-energy unit and Vietnam to develop 1,000 megawatts of electricity.Boeing shares rose 0.15% on the stock market today. Lockheed dipped 0.2%, Raytheon edged 0.4% lower, General Dynamics lost 1.6%, and GE eased 0.2%.

433,RTN,"Raytheon (RTN), founded in 1922 in the shadow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been in the forefront of technology, especially defense technology, from its beginning.It invented the technology that made radio a mass product. It produced radar that helped win World War II.Among its latest products is the Zumwalt-class destroyer, a stealthy — that means it's hard to see on radar — ship that can fire missiles.Though the Zumwalt program has had problems and has been scaled back, it shows Raytheon's devotion to the most advanced defense systems.Each destroyer is 600 feet long, cruises at 30 knots and costs $3.45 billion each, $7 billion if R&D is figured in.Raytheon is in a wide spectrum of defense activities, ranging from cybersecurity and intelligence to space and missile systems.It recently delivered its 3,000th Tomahawk Block IV cruise missile to the U.S. Navy.The Aerospace/Defense industry group is ranked No. 10 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. That's up from No. 30 just eight weeks ago.It includes other strong dividend-paying names such as Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Dynamics (GD) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).Earnings growth has slowed, but is remarkably stable. The three-year earnings stability factor is 2 on a scale of zero (most stable) to 99 (most volatile).In the last report, EPS dropped 1% to $1.60 a share. Analysts are forecasting a 16% decline in the next report. They expect a 7% decline in 2013, but an 8% increase in 2014.The company pays a $2.20 annual dividend, which translates to a 2.4% yield.

436,RTN,"Raytheon (RTN) boosted its earnings outlook Thursday, joining rivals Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), and said it sees strong demand from international customers, especially those in the Middle East.Raytheon now sees full-year EPS of $6.93-$7.13, up from a prior outlook of $6.80-$7.00. The midpoint is in line with analyst estimates for $7.03.In Q1, earnings from continuing operations fell 20.1% to $1.43 per share, but topped the $1.38 that analysts were expecting. Revenue climbed 8.9% to $5.76 billion, above views for $5.46 billion. Bookings rose 38.7% to $6.2 billion.Raytheon shares closed down 1.8% in the stock market today. Lockheed dipped 0.4%, and Northrop lost 0.7%.""Demand from our global customers continues to be strong, with particular strength in bookings from domestic as well as the Middle East and North Africa region,"" said Raytheon CEO Thomas Kennedy in the earnings release.Integrated defense systems division sales rose 2% to $1.34 billion on higher international sales of Patriot systems.Missile systems unit sales climbed 17% to $1.72 billion on higher sales of its Paveway laser-guided bombs and Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles.The Air Force has dropped over 20,000 missiles and bombs in its fight against ISIS. In November, the State Department also approved the sale of 13,000 Boeing (BA) and Raytheon bombs to Saudi Arabia for $1.29 billion. Qatar and Saudi Arabia also got approval to buy more Patriot air-defense systems and Patriot missiles from Raytheon and Lockheed. 
"
437,RTN,"Boeing’s (BA) earnings are expected to fall when it reports first-quarter results Wednesday, as it loses market share to European rival Airbus (EADSY).Analysts see the aerospace giant's earnings falling 7.1% to $1.83 per share and revenue down 3.2% to $21.44 billion.Earlier this month, Boeing reported a 4.3% drop in Q1 commercial deliveries to 176 planes on lower demand for its larger 767 and 747 jets. On the defense side, Boeing said deliveries rose to 50 from 42 in the year-ago quarter. Total deliveries were flat at 226.Airbus has been flying ahead of Boeing in orders. In 2015, Airbus racked up 1,080 in net orders, while Boeing booked 768 in net orders.Airbus also ended 2015 with a backlog of 6,787 aircraft with a total value of $996.3 billion at list prices, beating Boeing for the second straight year. Boeing’s year-end backlog was 5,795 commercial jets, but it didn’t give a list-price value.In March, Boeing said it would cut 4,000 jobs in its commercial unit by the middle of the year and 550 jobs in its test and evaluation division in an effort to cut costs.Boeing shares have struggled this year and have found resistance at their 200-day line.Investors should be on the lookout for comments on pricing for its commercial jets as low fuel prices allow airlines to fly older planes and seek discounts on new ones.Lower oil prices are also affecting demand from oil-dependent economies, such as Russia and the Middle East. Russia’s Aeroflot and the U.A.E.’s Etihad could defer some wide-body orders, analysts from Canaccord Genuity said in March.On the defense side, Boeing may provide an update on its KC-46 tanker program for the Air Force. Earlier this month, problems were found when the tanker was trying to transfer fuel to a C-17, possibly delaying the start of production on the KC-46, according to the Air Force.The aircraft, based on the 767’s airframe, has been a major headache for Boeing, which already has assumed over $800 million in after-tax charges on the plane due to higher-than-estimated engineering and manufacturing costs.Meanwhile, international sales to the Mideast have climbed amid conflicts in Yemen and Syria. The State Department approved in November the sale of 13,000 Boeing and Raytheon (RTN) bombs to Saudi Arabia for $1.29 billion.The Pentagon and State Department also have approved orders of 36 Boeing F-15s to Qatar and 24 Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to Kuwait. Final approval from the White House is expected, though the Obama administration had been concerned that the deals didn’t fit into its defense strategy in the region.

438,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year guidance Tuesday as revenue from F-35 production and its newly acquired Sikorsky unit powered first-quarter results.The defense contractor now sees 2016 earnings per share of $11.50-$11.80, up from a prior outlook of $11.45-$11.75 issued in January. But the midpoint is still under analyst estimates for $11.80.Lockheed also boosted its revenue forecast to $49.6 billion-$51.1 billion from a prior outlook of $49.5 billion-$51 billion. Analysts expect $50.3 billion.For Q1, earnings fell 5.8% to $2.58 per share, including a 21-cent per-share reduction due to workforce cuts at its aeronautics and information systems units. Analysts were expecting $2.59 per share.Revenue jumped 15.7% to $11.7 billion above views for $11.34 billion, getting a boost from its Sikorsky acquisition.Sales at Lockheed's aeronautics unit climbed 21% to $3.8 billion on higher net sales for the F-35 and increased deliveries of the C-130 transport aircraft.Sales at the missile and fire control segment rose 4% to $1.4 billion on increased deliveries of its Hellfire missiles. Space systems net sales fell 4% to $2.1 billion.Shares closed up up 2.6% at 232.16 in the stock market today, climbing above a 228.01 buy point from a flat base.The $400 billion F-35 program will come under scrutiny Tuesday as the Senate Armed Services Committee hears from top Pentagon officials.Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall said in prepared testimony that software problems have improved, requiring the F-35's computer to be rebooted less frequently, according to Bloomberg.He and F-35 program manager Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan also said the development phase is making progress toward completion around Sept. 30, 2017, allowing full-rate production to begin.But the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, Michael Gilmore, warned in his testimony that the development phase would likely extend into 2018 due to the program's delays.Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Boeing (BA) results are on tap for Wednesday.

In a February SEC filing, Lockheed said that the business ""may underperform relative to our expectations” and that demand for helicopters and other products from the unit could be “adversely affected by global economic conditions, including oil and gas trends that are outside of its control.”At Lockheed's annual media day in March, CEO Marillyn Hewson said that the company is taking a more cautious tone on international sales to the Middle East and others dependent on oil prices. In the Q4 earnings conference call, Hewson said that plunging oil prices haven’t affected weapon sales to the Middle East and that countries heavily dependent on oil exports are cutting back in other areas.Lockheed may also give an update on the progress of getting a deal with the Pentagon on lots nine and ten for the F-35.On Friday, a Lockheed spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company would lay off ""less than 200"" workers in its IT division. The cuts come after the company said in November that it would lay off 500 employees as it divests the unit as part of its deal with Leidos (LDOS) to focus on its aircraft and weapons units.Lockheed shares rose fractionally on the stock market Friday, up 0.3% to 226.81. The stock has been moving sideways for the past two weeks, less than 1% below a 228.01 buy point in a consolidation going back to late November.Northrop Grumman results are on tap for Wednesday. The Global Hawk maker’s EPS is seen climbing 3.3% to $2.49, but revenue is expected to dip 0.5% to $5.93 billion. Congress is pushing the Pentagon to buy even more of Northrop’s B-21 bombers. Northrop Grumman shares broke to a new high in weak volume late last month but remain in buy range.General Dynamics will also announce results Wednesday. Analysts see EPS edged up 0.9% to $1.26 and revenue down 1.2% to $7.69 billion. General Dynamics stock rose fractionally Friday but has been trading below its 200-day line since early December.Raytheon rounds out the week on Thursday.  Analysts expect the maker of the Tomahawk cruise missile to report a 23% drop in EPS to $1.38 but revenue is seen climbing 3.2% to $5.46 billion. Shares are trading about 3% below their Dec. 17 peak of 129.99.

441,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) kicks off a busy week of defense earnings Tuesday as tensions rise in the Middle East and Asia.Analysts see an 8% increase in earnings to $2.79 per share, and revenue is seen rising 8.4% to $1.24 billion as F-35 production continues to ramp up.Deliveries from the ninth F-35 production lot began in Q1, after a $6.1 billion contract for 57 planes was signed in November. An $8.2 billion contract for the 10th batch, which covers 90 F-35s, was signed in February, though deliveries aren't expected until next year. Lockheed is planning to transition to full-rate production in 2019.Meanwhile, North Korea's recent missile tests are speeding up deployment of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea, highlighting the growing demand for air-defense systems.In the Middle East, the $5 billion sale of 19 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain was recently cleared as U.S. allies in the region face intensifying friction with Iran. Lockheed has set a goal to expand its foreign sales to 30% of total revenue in the next few years and the Trump administration has been supportive of sales to allies.Shares of Lockheed are back in buy range after clearing a 270 entry several times since late February. Shares rose 1.2% to 276.33 in the stock market today.Raytheon (RTN) reports Thursday. Analysts expect a 12.6% jump in EPS to $1.62 and a 1.2% increase in revenue to $5.83 billion.The Tomahawk maker's stock saw a bump after its cruise missiles were launched at a Syrian air base earlier this month. Each Tomahawk cruise missile costs over $1.5 million.Raytheon's Patriot air-defense system has also been in demand. After land big orders from Saudi Arabia in 2015, South Korea and Japan plan to upgrade their Patriot systems, and a contract topping $7 billion is expected soon from Poland.Shares are also back in buy range after clearing a 152.68 buy point initially last month. Rathyeon rose 1.3% to 156.02 on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed and Raytheon retook their buy points of 270 and 152.68 respectively, but did so in light volume. So look for a decisive move when earnings come out. Northrop is near its 249.53 buy point. To find other leaders near a buy point check out Leaderboard. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reports Wednesday, and EPS is expected to fall 3.6% to $2.92 but sales are seen up 2.3%.Northrop is a major subcontractor on the F-35 and also benefits from Lockheed's increased production. It makes the center fuselage, fire control radar, and the communications and navigation system, while also helping develop the mission system and mission planning software.Northrop is also building the secretive B-21 stealth bomber, which development dollars are flowing to that project though the company and the Pentagon have been reluctant to disclose specific cost figures on that program.Northrop Grumman advanced 1.1% to 24.14, just below a 249.53 buy point. Northrop hit 250 intraday.General Dynamics (GD) is on tap for Wednesday, and EPS is seen dipping less than 0.1% to $2.32 while revenue stays essentially flat at $7.71 billion.Shares have been gaining support at their 10-week average, a good entry point. Shares rose 1.5% to 191.81, making them slightly extended from an 181.19 buy point cleared in January.RELATED: Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of TruthSouth Korea To Deploy Lockheed's THAAD Missile Defense System Early

442,RTN,"Raytheon (RTN) said Thursday that heightened military operations in Syria are lifting the demand outlook for munitions, while more countries in Europe look to acquire its Patriot air-defense system.Shares of Raytheon got a boost after its Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched at a Syrian air base earlier this month. Each Tomahawk cruise missile costs over $1.5 million.When asked during a conference call about prospects for a no-fly zone in Syria, Chairman and CEO Thomas Kennedy said the ""tempo in Syria is pretty up right now,"" and the company is ""seeing significant demand signals to provide solutions and keep up with replenishment requirements.""Meanwhile, Poland is in contract negotiations with the U.S. government for Raytheon's Patriot system, and the deal, once closed, will net the company more than $4 billion.Also during the call, an analyst suggested that Romania is one of two other European countries considering the Patriot. Kennedy acknowledged that other countries in Europe are interested but declined to name them, saying only, ""We are obviously working with the U.S. government to expedite those as fast as possible.""On Tuesday, Lockheed Martin (LMT) said it expects more missile defense orders from allies abroad.Shares of Raytheon were up 0.6% at 156.26 on the stock market today, paring gains and dipping back below its 157.69 buy point after clearing that threshold earlier in the day. Northrop Grumman (NOC) was up 0.1% at 248.40, also retreating from an entry point. General Dynamics (GD) added 0.1% to 195.03, still in a buy range, while Lockheed edged up 0.3%, also still in buy range.Raytheon's Q1 earnings from continuing operations jumped 21% to $1.173 a share, well above analyst views for $1.61 billion. Revenue rose 3.4% to $6 billion, also beating Wall Street views for $5.83 billion.Missile sales were up 2% to $1.76 billion. Sales of integrated defense systems, which include the Patriot, rose 5% to $1.4 billion, led by an early-warning radar. Sales of space and airborne systems climbed 8% to $1.6 billion, led by electronic warfare systems. Backlog at the end of the quarter was up 5.5% to $36.1 billion.Raytheon also lifted its guidance and now sees full-year EPS of $7.25 to $7.40, up from an earlier outlook of $7.20 to $7.35 but still largely below consensus of $7.40. It also expects full-year sales of $24.9 billion to $25.4 billion, up from a prior guidance of $24.8 billion to $25.3 billion and with the new midpoint above Wall Street views for $25.09 billion.While Raytheon's international bookings were up 14% in Q1, and international programs made up 41% of the backlog, it's also pursuing U.S. contracts and plans to compete for the Pentagon's Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) — an intercontinental ballistic missile program to replace Boeing's (BA) aging Minuteman missiles.Kennedy said Raytheon hasn't yet decided which contractor it will team up with for GBSD, which has an estimated cost of $62 billion over 30 years. The Air Force is expected to award preliminary contracts to bidders this year then narrow down to one prime contractor in 2020. Boeing, Lockheed and Northrop are also in the running for the GBSD program.RELATED: Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics Hit Buy Points On Strong EarningsHow Boeing's Air Force Tanker Woes Are Helping Its Commercial PlanesLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

443,RTN,"Acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo Ahn and U.S. Vice President Michael Pence said Monday that Seoul will deploy Lockheed Martin's (LMT) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ahead of schedule as tensions with North Korea ramp up.The announcement follows key developments over the weekend related to the communist regime's missile program. A test of what some officials believe was a medium-range missile failed, but an earlier military parade in Pyongyang appeared to show off new types of long-range missiles.""North Korea would do well not to test his resolve,"" Pence said of President Trump in a joint news conference during the vice president's visit to South Korea, ""or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region.""THAAD's deployment, which is controversial in South Korea and is opposed by China and Russia, was originally scheduled for later this year. But components started to arrive in March following prior missile tests in North Korea. Neither Pence nor Hwang gave a specific timeline Monday for its accelerated deployment.The decision to deploy THAAD was made last year under President Obama and South Korea's then-President Park Geun-hye, who has since resigned and was formally indicted Monday over an influence-peddling scandal.Meanwhile, Japan is looking to update its missile defense system. It has money earmarked to upgrade its PAC-3 Patriot batteries, made by Mitsubishi and Raytheon (RTN), and also is considering the THAAD system.Lockheed shares rose 0.7% to 269.88 on the stock market today, just below a 270 buy point. Raytheon shares edged up 1% to 153.24. Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares were up 1.2% to 243.10. Boeing (BA) shares climbed 1.9% to 179.02, rebounding from their 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been on the rise since President Trump took office on promises to expand the military's budget. Many top stocks are forming bases and bouncing in and out of buy range. But the policy in Seoul on North Korea could be reversed under a new administration. A presidential election to replace Park will be held by May 9.The South Korean Democratic Party's Moon Jae-in is leading the polls, and the former human rights lawyer has taken a less hawkish stance on Pyongyang.RELATED: Lockheed Stock Hits Buy Point After Trump Reverses This Obama MoveBoeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?
"
444,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) expects more international orders for its F-35 fighter aircraft and the company's missile-defense system, as global tensions spur demand for U.S. military hardware.But the defense giant's stock retreated to its buy point following Lockheed's first-quarter sales miss and weak earnings guidance.During Lockheed's conference call Tuesday, CEO Marillyn Hewson said that 50% of F-35 orders over the next five years will be from international customers as Lockheed sees interest from countries outside the current program of record.Partner countries on the F-35 include the U.K., Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Turkey, Australia and Israel, among others. Last year, Lockheed said it was in talks with Spain, Belgium and Switzerland about selling them the F-35.Meanwhile, North Korea's recent missile tests are speeding up deployment of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea, and the company expects interest in THAAD from Middle Eastern customers.Raytheon's (RTN) Patriot air-defense system has also been in demand in the Mideast and Asia. After the company landed big orders from Saudi Arabia in 2015, South Korea and Japan now plan to upgrade their Patriot systems, and a contract topping $7 billion is expected soon from Poland. Lockheed makes the PAC-3 missile for the Patriot system.Lockheed has set a goal to expand its foreign sales to 30% of total revenue in the next few years, and the Trump administration has been supportive of sales to allies. A $5 billion sale of 19 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain was recently cleared, as U.S. allies in the region face intensifying friction with Iran.Hewson said Tuesday that Lockheed is continuing to look at opportunities to sell the F-16 abroad, especially to India, which could be a bigger buy than the Bahrain order. Shares of Lockheed fell 2.2% to 270.02 on the stock market today, trading just above and below a 270 buy point for much of the session, on mixed quarterly results and weak guidance.Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major F-35 subcontractor and reports Wednesday, lost 0.4% to 248.13, just below a 249.53 buy pointutx. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the F-35's engines and also reports Wednesday, rose 0.5%.Lockheed reported adjusted EPS of $3, with revenue up 6.7% to $11.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.79 on revenue of $11.23 billion. Aeronautics sales, which include the F-35, jumped 8% to $4.1 billion. Rotary and Mission Systems sales, which include Sikorsky, edged up 2% to $3.1 billion. Missile sales rose to $1.49 billion while Space division sales climbed 12% to $2.36 billion.The company now sees full-year EPS of $12.15 to $12.45, below the Wall Street consensus for $12.64 and down from an earlier outlook of $12.25-$12.55, and sees sales of $49.5 billion-$50.7 billion, with the midpoint slightly below consensus for $50.18 billion and up from an earlier outlook of $49.4 billion-$50.6 billion.In addition to foreign orders, Lockheed expects to reach a deal with the Pentagon for an 11th batch of F-35s, with a finalized contract expected in Q3.Lockheed started deliveries from the ninth F-35 production lot in Q1, after a $6.1 billion contract for 57 planes was signed in November. An $8.2 billion contract for the 10th batch, which covers 90 F-35s, was signed in February, though deliveries aren't expected until next year. The company is planning to transition to full-rate production in 2019.But as Lockheed looks to ramp up production, there are questions as to whether it will be able to meet its delivery goal of 66 jets this year. The Pentagon's Defense Contract Management Agency told Bloomberg that Lockheed will likely only deliver 57 F-35s this year, as it's failed to meet its contract requirements since 2014. But Lockheed insists that it will meet its target of 66.Lockheed is also working to push costs of the F-35A, the basic model ordered by the Air Force and most international partners, to under $80 million per plane in 2019 or 2020, down from $95 million currently. But Tanner said the lower cost won't negatively impact profit margins.But testing delays with the F-35 could add over $1 billion to the cost of the stealth fighter as well as postpone the Navy's timeline for declaring its version of the jet combat ready next year, according to a Government Accountability Office report out Monday. But the Pentagon offered lower estimates for cost growth and denied that there will be any impact on the Navy's or international partners' schedules to declare their variants combat ready.Lockheed is still bullish on its Sikorsky division, even though it didn't deliver a single commercial helicopter in Q1. Still, the company expects to finish the year delivering over 180 helicopters, in line with 2016 deliveries.In addition to Northrop, Boeing (BA) and General Dynamics (GD) will report Wednesday, and Raytheon is scheduled for Thursday.RELATED: Dow's Boeing Nears Buy Point Ahead Of Q1 Results, But Revenue To DropLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

445,RTN,"Dow Jones industrial component Boeing (BA) is expected to report bigger profits, but revenue is seen falling for a third straight quarter when the aerospace giant reports Q1 results Wednesday.Earnings are seen climbing 11.5% to $1.94 while revenue slips 5.9% to $21.3 billion, marking the fourth top-line drop in the last six quarters.While announcements for new orders grab headlines and point to demand, it's actual deliveries that put money in the coffers each quarter. Earlier this month, Boeing reported Q1 commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176 a year ago. Deliveries of 737s dropped to 113 from 121 in 2016, and 777 deliveries dipped to 21 from 23. But the 787 Dreamliner saw an increase of two to 32.Shares rose 0.8% to 183.51 on the stock market today. Boeing is closing in on a 185.81 entry from a flat base and has been finding support at its 50-day line recently. But the stock had already broken out in January and October, and investors should be cautious about late-stage bases.Boeing already announced 198 net orders for Q1, vs. 121 in the year ago quarter, roughly around the 218 Q1 average from 2012-2016, Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert wrote in a client note.The aerospace giant's ""stock is not as correlated with order activity as it has been, so we do not believe near-term order activity (or lack of) will be significant for the stock,"" Herbert wrote.Still, Boeing has lost the order race to rival Airbus (EADSY) for the last four years and has cut over 1,300 engineering jobs since January 2016.On Friday, Boeing laid off ""hundreds"" of engineering employees at its Washington state factory after offering a round of voluntary layoffs in January, and more engineering cuts could be coming depending on the ""business environment"" and voluntary attrition.Boeing could give an update on a possible new clean-sheet design for a twin-aisle midrange jet to grab market share back from rival Airbus and its A321neo jet.On the defense side, Herbert sees revenue down 8% but believes sentiment on the stock has ""improved since the election and the initial negative headlines around pricing on Air Force One,"" which President Trump had earlier blasted for being too expensive.Meanwhile, Trump has been critical of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 over its high cost and said in February he was ""looking seriously at a big order"" of Boeing's Super Hornets.Boeing is pushing to build an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet to be more competitive vs. more advanced fifth generation fighters like the F-35.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) also report on Wednesday, and Raytheon's (RTN) results are slated for Thursday.RELATED: Lockheed Sees More F-35, Missile Defense Orders From AbroadDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

447,RTN,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings.

Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated.

Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range.

Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day.

On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance.

448,RTN," Boeing (BA) will finally be able to sell fighter jets to Qatar and Kuwait as the White House is near signing off on the long-awaited deals, according to a Reuters report.The Pentagon and State Department have already approved the orders of 36 F-15s to Qatar and 24 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to Kuwait. The deals are valued at $4 billion and $3 billion, respectively, sources told Reuters.Boeing shares closed up 0.5% in midday trading in the stock market today.The deals had been held up, as the Obama administration was concerned they didn't fit into its defense strategy in the region, and Israel was worried  about the weapons falling into the wrong hands.The sales would help extend production of the fourth-generation jets. Right now, the F-15 line is expected to end in 2019 after completing an order for Saudi Arabia. Production on the Super Hornet is slated to end by 2018.Defense spending in the Gulf has increased as tensions with Iran have heated up. The U.S. also has used weapons sales to the region to help alleviate some fears among allies after the Iranian nuclear deal.Last year, Saudi Arabia went on a buying spree, picking up Patriot air-defense systems from Raytheon (RTN) and Sikorsky MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters.The UAE is reportedly in the market for a fighter jet but is waiting for the Pentagon to approve sales of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.Lockheed shares dipped 0.3% Tuesday, and Raytheon lost less than 0.1%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

452,RTN,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) CEO is taking a more cautious tone on international sales to the Middle East and others dependent on oil prices.""We're starting to see some pressure on the budgets of countries that rely on oil revenues for a significant portion of their income,"" Marillyn Hewson said in opening remarks at Lockheed's media day Tuesday. ""And a sustained strong U.S. dollar could further pressure international sales.""Hewson said plunging oil prices could push orders and budget decisions out further or countries could not buy as many systems as planned.That tone contrasts with her more bullish one in January. In the fourth-quarter earnings conference call, Hewson said that plunging oil prices haven’t affected weapon sales to the Middle East and that countries heavily dependent on oil exports are cutting back in other areas.On Tuesday, she said most countries are ""looking beyond today"" for a time when oil prices increase and the company has seen an uptick in munition sales.""Saudi Arabia and UAE government leaders made it clear that regional security and terrorism are at the top of their concerns,"" she added.Last April, Saudi Arabia signed a $2 billion deal for Raytheon’s (RTN) Patriot system amid rising tensions with Iran and Yemen, even as the kingdom's defense spending fell 6.8% in 2015 vs. 2014 to $46.3 billion.Earlier this month, Canaccord Genuity warned that lower oil prices are also affecting oil-dependent economies' demand for commercial jets and that UAE’s Etihad could defer some wide-body orders. But Qatar Airways may exercise an option for three more Airbus (EADSY) A380s and Oman Air is mulling another jet order.Despite cheap oil, Lockheed is still investing in the region and is looking at Blackhawk helicopter production opportunities in Saudi Arabia for its newly acquired Sikorsky division.Hewson said Lockheed hasn't changed its target of 25% of sales from foreign customers ""over the next few years"" and confirmed reports that Poland and Turkey are interested in the company's Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS). Germany picked that missile defense system over the Patriot system in June.Lockheed shares closed up 0.2% to 217.05 in the stock market today. Raytheon shares were up 0.8% to 122.72.

He also considered A330s with revamped engines but thought the larger and lighter A350 was the better long-term option.The 13 jets have a list price of $4 billion but airline typically get discounts for large orders.Oman Air also has Boeing (BA) 787s and single-aisle jets in its fleet.Airbus shares closed down 1.9% in the stock market today. Boeing shares rose less than 0.1%. Boeing is trying to retake its 50-day moving average.

He told the MarketWatch that he wants to have an ""operational breakeven"" by the end of next year.Oil revenue accounts for nearly 80% of Oman's revenue according to reports and the government has been tightening its spending as oil prices fall.Gregorowitsch also said that lower oil prices have hit business travel.Earlier this month Canaccord Genuity warned that lower oil prices are also affecting demand from oil-dependent economies, such as Russia and the Middle East. Russia’s Aeroflot and the UAE’s Etihad could defer some wide-body orders.But on Wednesday Qatar Airways said it may exercise an option for three more A380s if oil stays at or below $60 per barrel. The carrier already has 10 A380s on order.Amid the prolonged slump in oil prices, airlines are able to keep flying less-efficient planes economically and hold off on acquiring new, more fuel-efficient models.

456,RTN,"The fight against the Islamic State and other tensions in the Middle East are taking a backseat to lower oil prices as defense spending in the region is seen flattening.Defense spending in the Middle East is expected to stay at roughly $170 billion for the next two years, according to a report from Craig Caffrey, principal analyst at IHS Jane’s, on Sunday.Defense spending had been on the uptick between 2012 and 2014. Even as oil prices sank in 2015, Saudi Arabia placed a $2 billion order for the Patriot air-defense system from Raytheon (RTN).But now oil prices are down nearly 70% from June 2014. On Monday, Brent crude settled up 5.1% at $34.69 a barrel. U.S. crude jumped 6.2% to $31.48.Last year saw the region's first defense budget cuts in a decade, Bloomberg cited the Jane's report as saying.""We saw the first marginal cuts in 2015, but those cuts are now expected to deepen in 2016 as states are forced into pursuing fiscal consolidation with more vigor,"" Caffrey was quoted as saying.Saudi Arabia's defense spending fell 6.8% in 2015 vs. 2014 to $46.3 billion, even as it fought rebels in Yemen. Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the drop in oil wouldn't affect the nation's military readiness.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's main rival, Iran, raised its defense budget by 29% last year. Tunisia and Israel had the other fastest-growing defense budgets in the region.Last month, Lockheed Martin (LMT) started building Israel’s first F-35 “Adir” fighter jet. Israel plans to buy 33 F-35A jets to replace its F-15s and F-16s.Still, heightened regional tensions should continue to prop up defense budgets, Caffrey reportedly said. ""As the Gulf States take a more active role in regional security, we will likely see upward pressure on defense budgets in the medium to long term.""U.S. defense contractors are banking on Middle Eastern sales. Boeing (BA) opened an office in Qatar in 2011, and Lockheed opened an office there last year as it tries to boost foreign revenue.And as recently as last month, they remained upbeat on the Mideast. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said that plunging oil prices hadn’t affected weapon sales to the Middle East and that countries heavily dependent on oil exports are cutting back in other areas.Also, Raytheon said overseas sales accounted for 31% of total sales last year and that the company hasn’t seen a decline in orders from oil-dependent customers.Raytheon shares climbed 1% to 124.76 in the stock market today. Lockheed shares rose 0.8%. Boeing shares jumped 2.2%.Meanwhile, China has doubled its arms exports in the last five years, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, although the U.S. and Russia still remain the world's top weapons exporters.

Raytheon also makes the Patriot ground-based air defense system.Raytheon surged 3% before paring its gain by half, but closed above its 50-day moving average and a 152.68 flat-base buy point.

465,RTN,"The capabilities in Boeing's (BA) bid for the Air Force's trainer jet program are ""more robust"" than Lockheed Martin's (LMT) offering, an analyst says, but affordability will likely play a ""heavy hand"" in the Pentagon's decision.The race between the two top contractors is too close to call, as both ""aircraft meet, if not exceed the bid specifications, with the capabilities of the Boeing aircraft somewhat more robust than those of (Lockheed's) T-50A,"" Moody's analyst Jonathan Root said in a note to clients late Wednesday.""We believe (Boeing's) all-digital cockpit has great flexibility from a trainer standpoint. It can pull up cockpits from the Raptor and F-35,"" Root said in an interview with Investor's Business Daily.Root said it was unclear if Lockheed's offering had a digital cockpit or if its cockpit has the flexibility to fully become another plane like the F-22 or F-35.Lockheed's operational T-50A, along with Boeing and partner Saab's clean sheet T-X bid, are the clear front-runners in the contest that saw early leader Northrop Grumman (NOC) drop out and Raytheon (RTN) end its bid with Italy's Leonardo earlier this year. Leonardo has since decided to enter a bid on its own, and Sierra Nevada along with Turkish Aerospace Industries are submitting their ""Freedom Trainer"" option.Boeing shares ticked up 0.2% to 177.37 at the close on the stock market today. Lockheed was up marginally to 267.11. Raytheon ticked up 0.5% to 150.75. Northrop shares ticked up 0.2% to 236.67.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been flying high after President Trump vowed to expand military spending, and Boeing could get another boost from Trump's proposed border tax.While Boeing might have new capabilities on its side, Lockheed's offering has been flying successfully in South Korea since 2002, and last month Lockheed executives told reporters that the T-50A could be delivered to the Air Force in 2022, two years ahead of schedule.But Boeing is expected to push hard for its clean sheet design as it looks to stay in the defense airframe business after losing contests for the F-35 and the B-21 bomber.""They are two very viable contestants and both will do the job. It's going to come down to these two issues — affordability and the desire to have a more diversified vendor base,"" Root said.The contract, estimated at $16 billion for the initial 350 aircraft, will be awarded later this year.RELATED: Air Force Will Seek Proposals For Low-Cost Attack Plane ExperimentBoeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?

466,RTN,"Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) has racked up more than $2 billion in extra costs on the KC-46 tanker for the Air Force, but the aerospace giant has learned key lessons from the military program's headaches and integrated them into its commercial aircraft business.The tanker, which is based on a modified 767 airframe, is now in production but ran into delays for development of its refueling boom, wing-mounted air refueling pods, and wiring. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company has used those lessons to help deliver the 737 Max ahead of schedule and under budget as well as get the 787-10 into flight testing a month early.""For the first time, we're building a military product, highly modified, in our commercial product line, and we see huge cost advantages to bringing that capability in line in our production models,"" Muilenburg said during the company's conference call. ""But around the edges of that, things like systems installation, wiring installation, the details that go into concurrently designing and building and how to do that most efficiently.""Lessons from the KC-46, which saw $120 million in extra costs in Q1, come as Boeing considers building a brand-new midrange plane dubbed the 797. Boeing has been under pressure to develop a new twin-aisle jet to grab market share back from Airbus and its A321neo jet.As a stopgap measure before the midrange jet launches, Boeing plans to extend its largest 737 Max to limit further losses to Airbus. The so-called 737 Max 10 could be unveiled at the Paris Air Show in June, sources told Reuters.Muilenburg didn't say Boeing's experience with the KC-46 would feed directly into the 797 and 737 Max 10 and declined to offer any details about them, such as the price tag, despite reports of carriers wanting a new plane at around $70 million-$75 million. But he did say Boeing is having productive conversations about the business case for each option.""Our primary focus is engaging with customers and understanding their future needs,"" Muilenburg said.Boeing shares were down 1% to 181.71 on the stock market today, pulling back further from a 185.81 buy point, as Q1 revenue missed forecasts. Rival Airbus (EADSY) dipped 0.6% despite securing a $6 billion deal for 20 A350-900 widebody jets from China Southern Airlines.Boeing's core EPS jumped 16% to $2.01, beating analyst views for $1.95. Revenue fell 7% to $21 billion, under views for $21.35 billion. Commercial revenue dipped 1% to $14.3 billion, as commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176 a year ago. Defense revenue declined 18% to $6.5 billion.Total company backlog was $480 billion, up from $473 billion at the start of the quarter. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million a year ago.Boeing raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $9.20-$9.40, with the midpoint still below Wall Street views for $9.35, from an earlier outlook of $9.10-$9.30, due to a lower-than-expected tax rate.Muilenburg reiterated the company's stance on supporting tax reform and simplifying the tax code hours after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that President Trump's tax cut, with a 15% corporate tax rate, will be ""the biggest in history.""Muilenburg, who seems to have the president's ear on key issues, said Boeing has seen regulation improvements from the streamlining of defense contracting to improvements in the time it takes to get approval for foreign sales.On the defense side, Boeing has been pushing to build an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet to stay relevant in the defense air frame space as sales of its F-15 wind down and is in the race against Lockheed Martin (LMT) for the Air Force's T-X trainer contract.On Tuesday, Lockheed reported mixed Q1 results, and the F-35 maker lowered its full-year earnings outlook but slightly raised its revenue view. Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled to report Thursday.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD), which both topped earnings estimates Wednesday, were little changed and up 0.9%, respectively. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes jet engines, climbed 1.2% on strong Q1 results.Lockheed shares edged up 0.1% to 270.33 after falling 2.2% to 270.02 on Tuesday.

469,RTN,"These are turning out to be prosperous times for long-time Pentagon supplier Northrop Grumman.Northrop (NOC) can restart work on its new, potentially lucrative long-range strike bomber, after Boeing’s (BA) protest of the contract’s award was denied last week.Production is increasing for several key programs of which the aerospace giant has been a part, thus ensuring that it has business for several years to come.And while rising tensions with China and Russia may be bad news for international relations, they ultimately could boost demand for other Northrop offerings.""Northrop is a well-balanced company that’s tightly managed and focuses on its niche offerings and (is) not diversified too far outside that,"" said Richard Pettibone, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International.In October, Northrop beat out a team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT) to develop the long-range strike bomber, the last major airframe contract expected to be issued by the Pentagon for the next decade.  The Air Force hopes to get funding for 80 to 100 of the new planes.If it passes, the production contract would be worth $50 billion to $80 billion. The planes would replace the Boeing B-52 bombers, which last year entered their seventh decade of service.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said that Northrop’s development bid was the ""best value"" for the nation. Mark Bobbi, a defense analyst at consultancy IHS, said, ""(Northrop) has the best chance of executing on this bomber program than any company in the world""; he estimates that the contract will add $300 million-$400 million to Northrop’s top line this year.There's always a caveat with defense contracts, though. Northrop has yet to win a production deal. And there’s always the chance that the bomber program will be cancelled, particularly if the cost exceeds forecasts of $564 million per aircraft. A previous bomber program was cancelled suddenly in 2009.Due to the deal’s secretive nature, details as to exactly why Northrop won development of the bomber won’t be released to the public. Bobbi speculates that Northrop won because of its legacy with the B-2 stealth bomber and its track record with the E-2D Hawkeye radar aircraft for the Navy. There's also the perception that Northrop's integration, subsystems and supply chain are better than its competitors’.Along with the strike bomber and the Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft -- another key contract -- Northrop is a supplier for Lockheed’s F-35 next-generation fighter jets. The ramp-up in production of the F-35 and the extension of Northrop’s F/A-18 Super Hornet combat jet for the Navy and Marine Corps will also help Northrop’s top line this year.On top of all that, the Air Force is expected to make a decision next year about the $10 billion T-X trainer jet program with contract proposals to replace its 500 T-38 jets due in the fourth quarter. Northrop, Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon (RTN) all have thrown their hats into the ring. But Pettibone said that it’s unlikely Northrop would win the contract as the Pentagon is expected to consider the industrial base when offering the contract and would want to spread the work out.Still, the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) drone is up for grabs, and the Navy awarded four preliminary design contracts in 2014 to Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin and Northrop. A front runner has yet to emerge on the program.Further, Northrop specializes in next-generation radar, expected to be a priority for the services going forward.Northrop is part of IBD’s Aerospace/Defense group along with peers Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon. It also makes sensors and radar, missile and navigation systems.The company’s total backlog at the end of 2015 was $35.9 billion vs. $38.2 billion at the end of 2014. It got $5.8 billion in new awards in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, the company sees full-year EPS of $9.90-$10.20 on sales of $23.5 billion-$24 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of $10.49 on sales of $24.47 billion.Northrop says that it sells products and services to customers in 25 nations. But international sales are only roughly 15% of Northrop’s total revenue, as the U.S. services continue to be its main customer. In the 2017 budget request, the Defense Department asked for $582.7 billion in military funding, with $523.9 billion in base budget funding and $58.8 billion in overseas contingency operations funding. The main military request is up 0.4% from the 2016 budget of $580.3 billion.The U.S. defense budget is likely to stay at current levels no matter who wins the 2016 presidential election, Chris Higgins of Morningstar told IBD. He says that the election outcome should have “marginal effects” on defense spending.The risk of sequestration has also been mitigated, and there is little appetite to cut defense anymore, Pettibone says, as hot spots around the world erupt.The fight against terrorism, particularly the Islamic State, isn't as much an advantage to Northrop as it is to Raytheon and Lockheed, since Northrop deals less in precision missile-guidance sales.But Bobbi says that rising tensions with Russia and China will help the company as countries raise their defense budgets. He said that Eastern European nations have raised their defense budgets by a combined 20% in the past year. International sales had been a focal point for defense contractors after domestic sales were curbed during sequestration.Still there are risks for Northrop. For one, there are fewer U.S. contract awards to go around, so the defense industry could be heading towards another round of consolidation like that seen in the 1990s when when Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta, Northrop bought Grumman, and Boeing purchased McDonnell Douglas.Analysts say that a smaller industrial base could actually cut costs, as the current fragmented defense sector creates inefficiencies. But the Pentagon is pushing for more power to block defense mergers and preserve competition. It is asking Congress for a stronger hand when it comes to industry dealmaking.""I think the Defense Department would resist that with its entire essence,"" Bobbi said of the prospect of Boeing buying Northrop. ""You take out another prime contractor and put it under the wing of one that doesn’t have a stellar track record.""Pettibone, however, cautions to ""never say never"" about consolidation. Still, he sees further mergers as unlikely unless government regulators are content with having only two major players left, Boeing and Lockheed.""Northrop will continue to be a constant and conservative player in the defense industry,"" Pettibone said. ""Management has planned for this environment and has the company going in eyes wide open to capitalize on the defense market going forward.""

But the unemployment rate fell to 4.5%, the lowest since April 2007. Economists had expected it to hold steady at 4.7%, and it suggested the job market continues improving.Wall Street also wasn't much bothered by news Thursday that U.S. warships attacked a Syrian air base in retaliation for a chemical gas attack. The aerospace and defense industry climbed nearly 1%. Raytheon (RTN), maker of the Tomahawk cruise missiles that struck Syria, was up 1.7% and back above its 50-day moving average.Boeing (BA) is forming a solid flat base with a buy point at 185.81 and deserves a look.

554,RTN,"As the multibillion-dollar market for military and commercial drones gains traction, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) are just two firms that could benefit from the State Department's newly announced policy on expanding drone exports to allies.On Tuesday, the Obama administration established new standards for the global export of the unmanned devices that include strict sale conditions and ""end-use assurances"" from recipient nations.The new policy, which prohibits the use of American drones for ""unlawful surveillance,"" opens the door to U.S. drone and arms manufacturers looking to make sales abroad.According to Reuters, the U.S. has sold armed drones to the U.K., while unarmed U.S. military drones have been sold to countries like France and Italy. The State Department will now review requests for armed drones from Italy and Turkey.Lockheed could notably stand to gain from increased drone exports: the General Atomics' Predator and Reaper drones use Lockheed missiles.The State Department's decision could also boost makers of drone components.""Additional sales of Reapers to international users would benefit Raytheon, maker of the MTS-B multispectral targeting sensor, and L-3 Communications (LLL), which provides satellite communications components and training simulators,"" said Guggenheim Partners' Roman Schweizer in a note. ""Honeywell (HON) supplies turboprop engines and guidance components.""Lockheed shares were down 0.2% on the stock market today. L-3 dipped 0.4%, Honeywell rose 0.5%, and Raytheon eased 0.6%.Northrup Grumman (NOC), which makes the Global Hawk drone, and General Atomics, a privately held spinoff of General Dynamics (GD), were part of a growing chorus that reportedly had been pushing the U.S. government for more lenient export rules prior to Tuesday's announcement.Meanwhile, the FAA's proposed regulations for flying commercial drones in U.S. airspace have come under fire.Under draft rules, drones would not able to fly over people and must weigh less than 55 pounds, among other restrictions, preventing retailers like Amazon (AMZN) from making commercial drone deliveries.

557,RTN,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) has worked out some mechanical issues on the F-35 and racked up more orders, but there are still problems with the stealth jet that could weigh on quarterly earnings.The defense giant reports Tuesday, kicking off a busy week for aerospace companies and Pentagon contractors. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a nearly 40% jump in Lockheed's fourth-quarter EPS to $2.85 per share. Sales are seen rising 3% to $11.9 billion.During the last quarter, the $400 billion F-35 program got a boost when the Pentagon ordered an eighth batch of fighter jets for $4 billion. The contract also includes additional cost savings. In October, the U.K. announced an agreement in principle to order four more F-35s, bringing the total order up to 14. Israel also has plans to buy more F-35s.United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division said it would supply a seventh batch of F125 engines for the F-35, also with some cost savings.And more orders could come as production costs fall. Operational costs should also fall 15%, Rear Adm. Randy Mahr, the Pentagon's F-35 deputy program manager, told Reuters last year.But developmental problems persist. After an engine fire that temporarily grounded the F-35 fleet last summer, other issues continue to plague the program.Due to delays in software development, the F-35B model won't be able to fire its 25mm cannon by the Marine Corps' July target to declare the jet ready for combat use.Software issues don't stop with the gun. Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's director of combat testing, told Congress recently there were ""serious deficiencies with hardware and software used to develop data files"" in the plane's computers. The files help identify enemy radar and ""are essential.""But the plane remains in demand around the world. And while the Pentagon and militaries abroad have scaled back budgets, the rise of the Islamic State, unrest in Syria and an aggressive Russia could mean more spending on high-tech weaponry like the F-35.General Dynamics (GD) is slated to announce Q4 results Wednesday. The defense contractor is seen posting a 21% rise in EPS to $2.13 but revenue is seen declining 0.8% to $8.04 billion.Northrup Grumman (NOC) is scheduled to announce results Thursday. The maker of the B-2 Spirit strategic bomber and the Global Hawk drone is expected to report a 6.1% increase in EPS to $2.25 but a 2.7% drop in revenue to $5.99 billion.Last week Northrop CEO Wes Bush said that he was happy with the government's approval of some drone exports but is still concerned that U.S. companies are losing market share over the ban on exporting large drones.Raytheon (RTN) is also slated to announce results Thursday. Analysts expect it to report a 23.3% jump in earnings per share and sales are seen rising 3.4% to $6.07 billion.The Aerospace/Defense group is ranked No. 59 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks, up from 104 eight weeks ago.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

621,RTN,"It's one thing for the boss to feel strongly about operating ethically. It's not always easy to spread that concept across an organization.Here are ways you can educate employees so they make doing the right thing a priority, too.• Aim high. Defense contractor Raytheon's (RTN) commitment to put ethics first starts with the board and top leaders, says Jay Stephens, Raytheon's general counsel. They set the tone and push it down through the company so the rest of the firm's people buy into the idea.""It needs to flow all the way through the organization,"" Stephens told IBD.• Keep learning. Raytheon regularly educates its 70,000 employees about ethics. It's not a once-a-year program so the firm can check off a box, says Patti Ellis, Raytheon's vice president for business ethics and compliance. Employees gather to watch vignettes such as an employee struggling with a conflict-of-interest issue regarding placing business with a former co-worker. Then they discuss the best way to handle it.• Do the basics. Firms should always put a hotline or help line in place, says Paul Fiorelli, co-director of Xavier University's Cintas Institute for Business Ethics. That way employees can report wrongdoing without fear of repercussions. A code of ethics is also crucial. Make sure people know what it is and how it applies to their jobs.""Training programs used to be strictly compliance-related. Now some of the best emphasize corporate culture,"" Fiorelli said.• Be repetitive. It might sound boring, but keep driving home to your people the significance of integrity. Fiorelli calls it ""developing an ethical muscle memory.""""It's saying, 'This is the way we do things here. There may be cheaper ways, but we're going to do it the right way,'"" he said.• Discuss. Communication plays a huge part in spreading management's view of ethics throughout the firm, Stephens says. When people talk to each other, they build trust so employees feel more comfortable taking advice from bosses.""We're trying to develop a culture of integrity and respect so people will raise issues — not hide them — and then work to resolve those issues,"" Stephens said.• Keep it real. Raytheon sends out four ethics-based video series a year by email to each employee. Each has short episodes featuring a dilemma that might come up often. It's aimed at provoking thought among workers. ""It gets people talking,"" Ellis said. ""They see that if the company is willing to tee this up, it's OK to talk about this.""• Examine your risk. Target ethics training toward the areas where issues are likeliest to crop up, Fiorelli says. If you get a lot of sales from overseas, train employees on foreign corruption laws.Public companies need to tell people how insider trading rules affect them. Do the right thing even if you don't legally have to do that.""That builds a buffer in case something goes wrong,"" Fiorelli said.• Welcome bad news. Don't shoot the messenger. If you do, people won't report problems and you'll never be able to solve them.Instead, urge them to report everything, positive or negative, Fiorelli says.• Step back. Ellis, who won the Ethics Resource Center's award in January for developing ethics education programs, spreads the word at Raytheon that it's OK for people to pause if they need to consider what to do in an ethical dilemma. The firm doesn't want people rushing into a decision that might turn out badly, just so they can meet a deadline. ""If you're not sure, stop and think about it,"" Ellis said.
