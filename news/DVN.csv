0,DVN,"For the past two years, shale exploration and production companies have focused on growing the flow of oil, but now the focus may be shifting toward the flow of cash.XConcho Resources (CXO), Apache (APA), EOG Resources (EOG) and a slew of other U.S. shale producers report third-quarter results this week. While U.S. crude prices have climbed to $54 a barrel they have struggled to stay above $50 ever since prices collapsed in 2014, and producers' spending vs. cash flow will likely be a key metric for investors.The outlook for capital expenditures is dimming, as companies focus more on financial returns and operating within their cash flows vs. expanding production, oilfield service provider Schlumberger (SLB) said earlier this month.""In North America land (operations) where companies added capex, production growth is falling short of expectations,"" CEO Paul Kibsgaard said on the earnings call with analysts. ""This has led to moderating investment appetite.""Early reports from shale companies echoed this sense of caution. On Friday, Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) reported Q3 results that fell short of Wall Street estimates and reaffirmed its total 2017 program spending forecast of $845 million.""We remain committed to delivering positive free cash flow in 2017 and beyond, while continuing to focus on improving our corporate returns and increasing our return of capital to shareholders through prudent capital allocation,"" Chairman and CEO Dan Dinges said in a statement.Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said he will be looking for a focus on wellhead profitability in the shale earnings reports and expects companies to be less aggressive about production.""Before it was a rush to raise production now it's a rush to produce profitability,"" he said. ""It could be positive if companies said they were going pull back and focus on cash.""Among U.S. oil giants, however, the spending picture is mixed. Chevron (CVX)  said Friday it would spend less money than expected this year, while Exxon Mobil (XOM) said it would spend more next year to increase drilling in U.S. shale plays. That could be a reflection of the uncertainty that continues to permeate oil markets, which increasingly look to the U.S. oil patch as the swing producer.""I think there's still one more big surge coming from U.S., which will knock prices down,"" Ian Taylor, CEO of Vitol Group, said at the Oil & Money conference in London last month.He expects Brent crude to fall to $45 per barrel in 2018 as U.S. shale production increases vs. $60 today.Shares of EOG Resources, a bellwether of the industry that is known as the ""Apple (AAPL) of oil"" for its tech advances, were up 1.1% at 99.53 on the stock market today, climbing further into buying range after breaking out from a 98.47 cup-with-handle base on Friday.U.S. crude futures closed up 0.5% to $54.15 a barrel on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Concho Resources, Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Devon Energy (DVN) kick off the busy earnings week, reporting results after the market closes Tuesday. Concho's earnings are seen falling 19% to 26 cents per share but revenue is expected to jump 44% to $622 million.Anadarko is expected to report a loss of 56 cents per share up from a loss of 89 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen rising 23% to $2.32 billion. Last month, Anadarko announced a $2.5 billion share buyback plan.Devon's EPS is expected to soar 333% to 39 cents from 9 cents a year ago but revenue is expected to fall 25% to $3.16 billion.Laredo Petroleum (LPI) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) are scheduled to report Wednesday. Analysts expect Laredo's EPS to rise 8.3% to 13 cents with revenue up 14.4% to $183 million.Pioneer's EPS is seen jumping 123% to 29 cents as revenue climbs 8.3%b to $1.3 billion.In Q2, Pioneer lowed its outlook of how many higher-value oil barrels it would produce in 2017. But at the Oil & Money conference, Pioneer said it plans to quadruple production over the next decade thanks to increasing output from Texas.CEO Timothy Dove said that the company's break even is $20 per barrel, giving it more room to expand and more cushion if oil prices fall.Apache and EOG Resources are due Thursday.Analysts see Apache reporting a loss of 2 cents per share vs. a 3-cents-per-share loss in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is expected to dip 2.1% to $1.41 billion.EOG is seen swinging to a profit of 10 cents per share vs. a loss of 40 cents per share a year ago. Revenue is  expected to climb  22% to $2.58 billion.Sanchez Energy (SN) rounds up the week Friday. Analysts see it reporting a loss of 19 cents per share vs. a profit of 14 cents a year ago, but revenue is expected to climb  53% to $179 million. RELATED: Exxon To Boost Spending, Add Rigs To Permian; Chevron Cuts Capex ViewSchlumberger: Oil Patch Now Focused On Cash Flow Vs.

But more companies are applying data analytics to oil exploration and production.Pioneer Natural Resources said Thursday that it isn't using AI yet, though it's been using predictive analytics.AI would help ""narrow the outcomes on these wells,"" meaning Pioneer could always drill in the sweet spot and avoid duds, Chris Cheatwood, the company's executive vice president for business development and geoscience, told analysts on a conference call.Pioneer expects AI to be the future, and as it looks to produce 1 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day by 2026, it won't need to hire a lot more people, he added.The company and Oak Ridge National Laboratory are also working together to look at advanced materials and coatings, smart parts and sensors, advanced material design, and additive manufacturing, according to a March statement from the lab.Shares of Pioneer fell 3% to 165.63 on the stock market today as a sell-off in oil prices overshadowed its strong quarterly report late Wednesday. Pioneer hit a nine-month low intraday.U.S. crude sank 4.8% to a five-month low of $45.52 a barrel, back to where prices were before OPEC began its production cuts.The shale producer swung to an adjusted profit of 25 cents per share in Q1, beating analyst views by 8 cents. Revenue jumped to $1.47 billion, also above views. Total production costs eased to $6.31 per BOE from $6.42 in Q4, but costs for Permian horizontal wells climbed 19% sequentially to $2.33 per BOE, and Permian vertical costs rose 2.5% to $14.36. Eagle Ford costs dipped 1.5% sequentially to $10.71.Production rose 3% vs. Q4 to 249,000 BOE per day, and management sees Q2 output of 254,000-259,000 BOE a day. While some analysts questioned if that guidance was light, Pioneer said its planned addition of wells is weighted toward the latter part of Q2 and the latter part of the year.Despite the uptick in Permian-area costs, Pioneer doesn't see cost inflation affecting its bottom line this year, noting it has long-term contracts for sand used in fracking and has access to cheap water, though it sees water use in the Permian doubling in 2017 vs. 2014 levels. Labor costs are up 2%-3%.Also late Wednesday, Continental Resources (CLR) reported adjusted EPS of 2 cents vs. a loss of 41 cents a year ago, in line with Wall Street views. Revenue was $685.43 million, above views for $642.83 million. Production expenses rose 5% vs. Q4 to $3.78 per BOE but were little changed vs. a year ago.On Thursday, CEO Harold Hamm told analysts during a conference call that service costs are only seeing a slight uptick in a few areas and have stabilized.Continental sees Q2 production of 220,000-225,000 BOE per day, up from 213,755 in Q1. Fracking crews in the Bakken formation will rise to nine by midyear from seven now.Despite the recent dive in crude prices, Hamm noted ""signs pointing toward better prices very quickly"" but added that fracking crews could be withdrawn promptly, depending on market conditions.Shale companies can extract oil profitably at lower prices due to new technologies and techniques that have improved efficiencies. Continental expects to be cash-flow neutral with U.S. crude at $50-$55 a barrel. Last quarter, it said a price of $55 was the threshold, and in 2015, it was $60.Shares tumbled 5.1% to 40, hitting their lowest levels sine May 2016.Also Wednesday, Concho Resources (CXO) reported EPS that crushed Wall Street views but its revenue fell short.Concho sees full-year production up 21%-25% vs. a prior outlook for growth of 20%-24%. Oil and natural gas production expense per barrel of oil equivalent is now $5.50-$6.00, down from a prior outlook of $5.75-$6.25.Shares dropped 1.3% to 127.11.On Tuesday, Diamondback Energy (FANG) reported Q1 results above views as production rose 61%. Devon Energy (DVN) also reported a profit and announced $1 billion in asset sales primarily in the Barnett Shale basin.RELATED: This Chart On U.S. Oil Production Shows Why OPEC Is Trapped

Average costs per BOE rose to $9.31 from $8.48 in Q4. Devon Energy also reported a profit and announced $1 billion in asset sales primarily in the Barnett Shale basin.Diamondback shares climbed 2% Wednesday, and Devon fell 1.75%.The earnings reports come as U.S. crude inventories start to decline. The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that stockpiles fell by 930,000 barrels last week while gasoline stockpiles rose by 200,000 barrels. Analysts were expecting a crude decrease of 2.3 million barrels and a gasoline increase of 1.3 million.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said crude inventories plunged by 4.2 million barrels as gasoline stockpiles fell by 1.9 million barrels.Meanwhile, U.S. crude production continues to climb, rising to 9.29 million barrels a day last week from 9.27 million, according to EIA.U.S. crude futures rose 0.3% to settle at $47.82 a barrel, after dropping Tuesday to their lowest levels since late November.But the International Energy Agency recently questioned the ability of increased U.S. shale production to offset a decline in conventional oil projects as demand rises.The agency expects liquids production from U.S. shale plays to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices. But conventional resources sanctioned for development last year fell 30% to 4.7 billion barrels, and overall exploration spending will be down for a third straight year to less than half of 2014 levels, with offshore projects especially hit.RELATED:BP Beats, Sees Stronger Cash Flow; ConocoPhillips Reports Surprise Loss

13,DVN,"X Stocks pulled off a positive finish Friday, leaving the major indexes lower for the week, but with the Dow industrials and S&P 500 reclaiming key levels of support.An afternoon rally snapped after news reports said federal investigators had identified a current White House official as a person of significant interest in the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Another report attributed to President Trump potentially damaging statements regarding the firing of FBI Director James Comey.Despite the mild pullback, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each ended 0.7% higher. That left the S&P 500 above the 50-day line, and the Dow even with the 50-day moving average and down about a half-percent for the week.The Nasdaq, which has remained above its 50-day line, took a 0.5% gain Friday and chalked up a 0.6% decline for the week. The small-cap Russell 2000 was 0.5% higher Friday.Autodesk (ADSK), McKesson (MCK), Caterpillar (CAT) and Deere (DE) were heroes for the day, hauling their respective industry groups to the session's top performances.Losses were comparatively mild among blue chips. Cisco Systems (CSCO) took the low rung on the Dow with a 0.5% decline.Energy stocks also played a leading role as oil prices added 2%, leaving West Texas Intermediate at $50.33 a barrel, up more than 5% for the week and 15% above an early May low. Near the top of the S&P 500, Helmerich & Payne (HP) rose 5%, Devon Energy (DVN) and Murphy Oil (MUR) each rolled 3% to 5% gains.Among techs, Autodesk was the clear leader, soaring 15% as a pair of analyst upgrades followed strong first-quarter results reported late Thursday.On the IBD 50, China-based issues were the clear leaders.Momo (MOMO) leapt 5% to end the week with a 9% gain and at a new high.

14,DVN,"X EOG Resources (EOG), the so-called ""Apple (AAPL) of oil,"" matched Q1 earnings views late Monday and beat revenue forecasts, while the shale producer touted record performance from its new Permian Basin wells.While dozens of shale companies have reported or are about to report, EOG's reputation for innovation makes it stand out, especially as U.S. oil prices have fallen back below $50 a barrel. To generate bigger profits at that level, producers have to find ways to extract oil as efficiently as possible.Houston-based EOG swung to a per-share profit of 15 cents, matching estimates, as revenue soared 93% to $2.61 billion, topping forecasts for $2.41 billion.Crude production climbed 18% year over year to 315,700 barrels of oil per day. Average completed well costs were down 6% vs. 2016 averages in the Eagle Ford, Delaware and Bakken formations. Service and equipment prices rose ""in certain areas"" but were were offset by ""continued advances in drilling and completion tools and techniques, benefits from extended lateral lengths and new contracts at lower prices.""""EOG's Whirling Wind wells shattered industry records in the Permian Basin,"" said Chairman and CEO Bill Thomas in a statement, noting they set new records for 30-day initial production from Permian Basin horizontal oil wells.  ""Our advanced technology and proprietary techniques are leading to break-through well performance across our diverse portfolio of premium plays.""Management sees Q2 crude production rising to 322,200-332,400 barrels a day, up 20%-24% annually or 2%-5% vs. Q1.EOG stock slipped 0.7% late. Shares closed up 0.9% at 91.69 on the stock market today as U.S. crude prices settled 0.5% higher at $46.43 a barrel.In addition to being dubbed the ""Apple of oil,"" EOG now even uses Apple technology, with its iSteer smartphone app that helps workers drill bit in the sweet spot, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.EOG has already touted its advantage from new innovation. In November, management said 75% of its cost savings were from efficiencies vs. discounts received from service providers, though some analysts have said the real number is likely a half to a third.Executives may detail additional technological advances. EOG will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. ET Tuesday.Meanwhile, other shale producers are looking into technologies normally associated with Silicon Valley, Last week, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said its looking into using artificial intelligence to help ensure it always drills for oil in the best places and is working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to test advanced materials and coatings.Also after the close Monday, Oasis Petroleum (OAS) reported its adjusted Q1 loss narrowed to 5 cents a share, beating by 2 cents, as revenue soared 119% to $285.1 million, above consensus for $252.1 million. Total production jumped 25.6% to 63,192 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day. Lease operating expenses were $7.71 per BOE, up from $7.60 in Q4 and $6.78 a year earlier.Oasis shares rallied 2% after hours.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) and Sanchez Energy (SN) will release results Tuesday.So far, shale firms aren't seeing much cost inflation, despite surging activity in the Permian Basin. Pioneer said it has long-term contracts in place for sand used in fracking and has access to cheap water.Continental Resources (CLR) said last week that service costs are only seeing a slight uptick in a few areas and have stabilized.

15,DVN,"Diamondback Energy (FANG), Concho Resources (CXO), Continental Resources (CLR) and other U.S. exploration and production companies will report earnings this week, likely providing more information on capital spending, production outlooks and oilfield service costs.Senior Robert W. Baird oil and gas analyst Daniel Katzenberg said he expects some increases in production outlooks for the year and said any increases in output without a corresponding bump in capital spending would be major a confidence boost for investors.Liquids production from U.S. shale plays is expected to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency.The number of oil rigs in operation has swelled for 15 straight weeks, according to Baker Hughes data, suggesting continued U.S. production gains in the near future.Even oil majors like Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (CVX) have turned their investment focus to expanding their holdings in the Permian Basin while curtailing spending in other areas.But the IEA worries that U.S. production won't be enough to offset the decline in investment in conventional drilling as demand for crude grows.But questions remain about service costs. Katzenberg doesn't think cost inflation will be an issue for E&Ps until WTI crude hits $60 per barrel.He said the average estimate is for a 20% increase this year, but he's only forecasting a 10% increase as improvements in drilling will offset some of the cost increases.IBD'S TAKE: Q1 reports from U.S. E&P companies will shed some light on how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts given by service providers during the crude price bust.""However, given investor trepidation, updated cost commentary, and its impact on 2017 plans, remains the biggest risk to the group over the earnings period, in our opinion,"" Katzenberg  wrote in note dated April 20.Diamondback Energy, Devon Energy (DVN) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are scheduled to release first-quarter results Tuesday. Continental, Laredo Petroleum (LPI), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), and Concho Resources (CXO) are on tap for Wednesday. Parsley Energy (PE) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) will announce results Thursday.Analysts expect Parsley and Occidental to report profits, with revenue up 191.2% and 27.3% respectively.International oil majors BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) will also report this week.RELATED: Exxon, Chevron Signal Stalling Investment As Oil Prices Lose Momentum

17,DVN,"Oil and gas producer Marathon Oil (MRO) on Tuesday said it would buy up more land in the oil-and-gas-rich Permian Basin, just weeks after another deal there, joining Dow Jones industrial average energy giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) in expanding in the low-cost play.Under the terms of the deal, Marathon would buy roughly 21,000 net surface acres from Black Mountain Oil & Gas and others for $700 million. Most of that space lies in the Permian's Northern Delaware basin of New Mexico.The purchase, set to close in the second quarter, would give Marathon more than 90,000 acres in the Permian. It comes despite recent weakness in the price of crude.""While we expect to pursue additional trades and grassroots leasing, this bolt-on achieves the scale necessary for efficient long-term development in the basin,"" CEO Lee Tillman said in a statement.Shares of Marathon fell 2.8% to 15.05 on the stock market today, trending below their 200-day line as U.S. crude futures fell 1.4% to $48.24 a barrel. Dow stocks Exxon Mobil dipped 0.2% and Chevron added 0.35%.IBD'S TAKE: For more information about how investors are navigating the industry, read this Industry Snapshot. On March 9, Marathon said it agreed to pay $1.1 billion for 70,000 net surface acres in the Permian, as energy giants make more aggressive moves in the area.Exxon Mobil in January said it would scoop up assets in the Permian, which is located in west Texas and New Mexico, and Chevron has said it would spend more to pull resources out of the region.Meanwhile, shale companies are continuing to pour money into the Permian.In February, Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it would buy up more land there. Parsely Energy (PE) in January and February said it would acquire more acreage in the region, and last year, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) bought land in the Permian from Devon Energy (DVN).RELATED:Oil Rigs Hit Highest Since September 2015; More Mixed Signals From SaudisOil Prices Snap 7-Day Losing Streak As Supplies Drop, IEA Urges Markets To 'Hold Nerve'

Gasoline stocks climbed by 2.8 million barrels vs. analysts expectations for a 752,000-barrel drop. Production was flat at 8.98 million barrels per day.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares dipped 0.4% to close at 83.16 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) edged up 5 cents to 112.57. Continental Resources (CLR) fell 1.4% to 46.32. EOG Resources (EOG) dipped 0.5% to 100.75.Diamondback Energy hosted its fourth-quarter earnings call Wednesday after reporting Q4 results late Tuesday.As drilling activity continues to ramp back up, the shale producer assumes a 10%-15% increase in service costs this year. But Chief Executive Travis Stice said service prices haven't yet increased in the first quarter, and if oil stays between $50 and $55 per barrel, cost increases would be ""muted.""Diamondback shares jumped 3.9% to 111.84.And when the increases do happen, Stice said they will be on the completion side of operations, especially pressure pumping, vs. the drilling side.In a survey last month, Barclays found that 80% of U.S. exploration and production companies expect an increase in oilfield service prices this year but more than half only expect an increase of up to 10%.But Halliburton (HAL) recently warned oilfield service prices would increase by more than 10% this year.Stice said that Diamondback is insulated from some of the cost increases, as half its total cost savings seen since the downturn started are permanent efficiency gains.Late Tuesday, the company reported Q4 earnings that jumped 58% to 90 cents per share with revenue up 62% to $185 million, both beating Wall Street views. Production rose 38% year-over-year to 51,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Looking ahead, Diamondback raised its full year production outlook to 69,000-76,000 barrels per day from 64,000-73,000.

21,DVN,"The Dow Jones industrial average and other major indexes hit record highs as President Trump made more noises about tax reform, while Fed chief Janet Yellen took a slightly hawkish stance. Apple (AAPL) rose to an all-time best while fellow Dow stock Verizon Communications (VZ) returned to unlimited wireless plans. Kraft Heinz (KHC) is pursuing a mammoth deal for Unilever (UN). NetEase (NTES), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and NetApp (NTAP) rallied on earnings, while General Motors (GM) may sell its European unit Opel.The Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite rose 1.8% for the week, with the S&P 500 added 1.5%, all hitting new highs during the week. Apple was a key contributor to all the major indexes. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's somewhat hawkish tone didn't worry investors, but gave bond yields and bank stocks a boost.""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise,"" Fed chief Janet Yellen told Congress, a shift from her 2016 tone emphasizing downside risks to the economy. Yellen, along with other Fed officials speaking during the week, raised the odds of a near-term hike slightly. Markets don't expect a March move but see a 50-50 move by May and a strong likelihood by June.  Yellen warned against repealing financial regulations passed after the credit crisis.Meanwhile, retail sales and inflation data were stronger than expected, while small-business optimism hit a fresh 12-year high and the Philly Fed manufacturing index shot up to its strongest reading since 1984.RELATED:Worries over intensified wireless competition pressured phone company stocks after Verizon Communications (VZ) reintroduced unlimited data plans nearly six years after removing them. Verizon sought an edge over T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) by offering high-definition video as part of unlimited data. T-Mobile quickly changed its offer to include HD video. Sprint cut its unlimited price to $50 a month or $90 for two users, including HD video. AT&T (T) opened unlimited wireless beyond DirecTV and U-verse customers. Analysts say industry consolidation could ease competition. Merger talks are expected to heat up when a government spectrum auctions ends, perhaps by late March.RELATED:T-Mobile (TMUS) on Feb. 14 reported Q4 profit and revenue that edged views. For 2017, it forecast branded postpaid subscriber additions of 2.9 million, below estimates. Analysts called the guidance conservative, though in any event T-Mobile will likely lead industry subscriber growth for the fourth year in a row in 2017. For the first time, T-Mobile provided free cash flow guidance. It forecast three-year FCF annual growth of 45% to 48%, or about $4.5 billion by 2019.Softbank is willing to give up control of its majority-owned Sprint to achieve a merger with T-Mobile, Reuters reported Friday. Sprint rose 3.3% on Friday and T-Mobile 5.5%, with AT&T and Verizon rising modestly that day.RELATED:Apple, the top Dow industrials stock in 2017, hit a record high of 136.27 on news reports related to its cash-return plans and the upcoming iPhone 8.

CFO Luca Maestri said Apple would look to boost dividends and buybacks if the U.S. cuts corporate tax rates, as expected under President Trump.RELATED:Kraft Heinz (KHC) signaled it will continue to pursue the European consumer and food products giant even though Unilever (UN) said the offer undervalued the company and sees no reason for further talks. A combination would be one of the largest of all time and create a global food giant. Kraft Heinz, which has been slashing costs to boost profit, shot up 10.6% Friday to a record high. Unilever leapt 15.3% to 48.79, also setting a record best. Snacks giant Mondelez (MDLZ) fell. Consumer products firms such as Kimberly-Clark (KMB) rallied.RELATED:President Trump on Wednesday met with CEOs from Target (TGT), Gap (GPS), AutoZone (AZO) and other retailers, saying he would cut regulations and encouraging them to expand in the U.S. Trump also said a ""massive"" tax plan was coming ""in the not-too-distant future."" Target, afterward, warned that a GOP plan for a border adjustment tax as part of corporate tax reform would force them to ""raise prices for American families on everyday essentials."" That subject came up during the meeting, although it was unclear how much of a focus it was.RELATED:Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) gobbled up shares of Apple (AAPL) in Q4, quadrupling its holdings, according to a regulatory filing.

Appaloosa cut its stake in the iPhone maker but hiked its stake in Southwest (LUV). George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Delta, but dropped United. Activist investor Trian Fund Management built up a $3.5 billion position in Procter & Gamble (PG).RELATED:The Chinese mobile gaming giant late Wednesday reported Q4 earnings per American depositary receipt of $4.40 minus items on revenue of $1.74 billion, both well above the analyst consensus.

NetEase licenses many games from Activision Blizzard (ATVI), including ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Overwatch."" NetEase stock leapt 14% on Thursday to a record high after edging past a buy point earlier in the week.RELATED: In its fiscal Q2 ended Jan. 28, Cisco earned 57 cents per share minus items, flat from a year earlier but topping views by a penny. Revenue fell 2% to $11.58 billion, the fifth straight decline, but that beat expectations of $11.55 billion. Cisco's deferred revenue from software and subscriptions jumped 51% to $4 billion in fiscal Q2, a sign that its shift to software and services from its core business of selling network switches and routers is gaining momentum. Cisco shares rose 7%, hitting their best levels since November 2007.RELATED:Chip gear maker Applied Materials (AMAT) earned 67 cents a share ex items in its fiscal Q1, up 158% year over year, on sales of $3.28 billion, up 45%. Analysts expected 66 cents and $3.27 billion. It was Applied Materials' fourth straight quarter of accelerating sales and EPS growth. For fiscal Q2, Applied Materials sees strong earnings and sales growth that are above Wall Street models. Applied Materials shares rose 1%, near 16-year highs.RELATED:Data storage systems provider NetApp reported earnings and guidance that topped views.

Devon Energy (DVN) also reported Q4 results above expectations.RELATED:Peugeot's parent, PSA Group, said it was in talks with General Motors (GM) about potentially acquiring the U.S. automaker's Opel division, which also includes the British Vauxhall brand. The deal would give PSA Group a 16% market share in Europe, second only to Volkswagen (VLKAY). GM has had trouble turning a profit at the unit and had a tentative deal in 2009 to sell it to Canada's Magna.RELATED:One big health insurance merger, between Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), is dead, while the other, between Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), broke out into a wrestling match. Federal judges blocked both deals earlier this year. Cigna sued Anthem for $13 billion in damages on top of a $1.85 billion breakup fee. But a judge blocked Cigna from ending the merger after Anthem countersued, arguing that Cigna has tried to sabotage the deal.Humana, which gets a $1 billion payment from Aetna for its trouble, moved on by announcing a stock buyback and saying it will exit the ObamaCare exchanges. Aetna's CEO said the ObamaCare exchanges are in a death spiral. And Molina Health (MOH) signaled it would likely exit the ObamaCare exchanges next year.UnitedHealth (UNH) tumbled 3.7% Friday on news that the Justice Department has joined a whistleblower suit accusing the health insurer of overcharging Medicare Advantage by hundreds of millions of dollars, possibly billions of dollars. Other health insurers, including Aetna and Humana also retreated Friday.RELATED:DOJ Accuses UnitedHealth Of Overcharging Medicare AdvantageSnap (SNAP), in an updated SEC filing, says it's looking to 200 million shares at a price range of 14 to 16 a share, raising roughly $3 billion. That would give it a valuation of $19.5 billion to $22.2 billion, below earlier reports that the Snapchat parent would seek $25 billion. Snapchat enjoys rapid revenue growth, but Facebook (FB) is successfully imitating Snapchat features, especially on its Instagram app.RELATED:U.S. Steel (X) flirted with a buy point during the week while Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Nucor (NUE) and aluminum maker Alcoa (AA) jumped on reports that China is considering sweeping production cuts to combat smog. Reuters reported that China could slash steel capacity by at least half and aluminum capacity by 30% in certain months.Cement and aggregates firms, like steel companies, are expected to benefit from President Trump's infrastructure push, as well as a multibillion-dollar wall on the border, but that won't help 2017 results much. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) on Tuesday missed fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates and gave a subdued 2017 outlook.RELATED:Las-Vegas-centric MGM Resorts International (MGM) turned profitable in Q4, reversing a year-earlier loss, but missed estimates, while revenue was in line.

24,DVN,"For a lot of investors, 2016 ended with OK — but not spectacular — returns. The S&P 500 finished an often tumultuous year with a 12.48% gain through Dec. 29, including dividends. That beat its three-year average annual gain of 9.18%, but fell short of its five-year average yearly return of 14.67%, according to Morningstar Inc.Mutual fund industry bigwigs generally expect more gains in 2017. But it won't be as easy as it was in 2016, they caution.Rich Weiss, a senior portfolio manager on a team that oversees 20 American Century target-date, target-risk and asset-allocation funds, warns that the rally from early November through mid-December may have left less room for the market to rise in 2017. In December, many of his team's funds were taking year-end profits.Still, the Federal Reserve's hike in its key interest rate and upward moves in oil and gold prices last week as well as U.S. consumer confidence are harbingers of reflation — rising inflation, nominal growth and wages, said Richard Turnill, asset management mammoth BlackRock's (BLK) global chief investment strategist in a Tuesday commentary.The chief beneficiaries of reflation should be value stocks, especially U.S. regional banks, some health care stocks and companies able to expand their dividends, Turnill wrote.""We see earnings growth and further rotation into big sectors such as financials underpinning a U.S. stock market advance in 2017, but we are cautious in the near term after large inflows and new record highs,"" he wrote.Turnill also likes European and Japanese stocks going forward, in part because of weak currencies ""though we are wary of political, policy and trade risks in the eurozone,"" he said.In addition, he wrote, ""We favor emerging market equities, given structural reforms, improving profitability and low valuations.""Darrell Riley, a vice president in T. Rowe Price's asset allocation group, expects the stock market to gain ground again in 2017, but less than it advanced last year. ""A 6% total return is realistic,"" he said. ""Two percent from revenue growth, 1% from margin expansion, 1% from buybacks and 2% more from dividends.""Best Stock Mutual Funds Of 2016Riley cites factors that could fuel continued gains. ""The market is embracing a relatively positive outlook, with proposals by Trump for tax cuts and fiscal stimulus,"" he said. ""The market is already pricing in some elements of that view, expecting higher growth rates and a stronger dollar.""Click Here To See Top Performing Stock Mutual Funds In Q4Still, a stronger dollar is likely to slow business for large-cap multinationals that depend on exports, Weiss says. That could help small-cap stocks continue to outperform in 2017, says David Wagner, lead manager of $9.4 billion T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value Fund (PRSVX).Small-cap value funds were the top-performing group among U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in 2016, with a 26.49% return. Small-cap blend portfolios were close behind, averaging a 21.18% advance.Click Here To See Top Performing Bond Mutual Funds In 2016Late in 2016, Wagner had 20% of his shareholders' money at work in community banks. That was his largest industry-group allocation. ""Banks have gone through a tremendous down period as a result of the financial crisis,"" he said. ""The regulatory backlash has also been a tremendous headwind.""But a Trump presidency and a Republican Congress are expected to be friendlier to banks than a Clinton administration would have been.

Energy funds were second best, sparking ahead 30%.Health care was the only sector to lose ground, sliding 10%.In fixed income, high-yield bond funds led the way with a 13% total return. Emerging-market debt funds were next, notching a 10% return.Overall, the year consisted of two phases. ""It was a tale of two markets: pre- and postelection,"" Weiss said. ""Before the election, the market was winding down, it was sluggish. Market leadership indicated we were heading into an economic slowdown, with defensive sectors leading.""But once investors began to expect Trump and Republican victories — starting shortly before the election — ""there was a rebound in the market, with renewed energy and optimism,"" Weiss said.Investors began to anticipate the benefits of tax cuts, less business regulation and repatriation of corporate cash held abroad. ""That all coincided with a strengthening in oil prices,"" Weiss said, buoyed by an OPEC deal to cut production and stabilization of Chinese economic growth.But don't expect the economy or the markets to trend upward without interruptions in 2017. ""We will see volatility amid risk,"" Aymeric Forest, head of global income for the multi-asset team of global asset manager Schroders. Forest cites geopolitical risks globally.In the U.S., ""the new administration, like every new administration, will make mistakes,"" said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.And eventually — maybe as early as 2017 — rising interest rates might could slow economic activity, Weiss says.Forest added, ""It will be important for investors to remain flexible to take advantage of opportunities, and they should take a multi-asset approach, especially in their search for income.""RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewHot Stocks That Made Craig Hodges A Top Fund ManagerSix Steps To Take Now With Your Personal Financial Action Plan

26,DVN,"Techs were in rally mode near midday Tuesday, bouncing back after some volatile action. Action was quieter in the NYSE indexes as Wall Street digested better-than-expected October retail sales data.After having some trouble at its 50-day  moving average in recent days, the Nasdaq composite gapped just above the line, rising 0.8%. The S&P 500 gained 0.3%, and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly lower than Monday's levels in the stock market today.Early gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included China-based JD.com (JD). Shares soared 13% on strong earnings. Other big gainers included NetEase (NTES), helped by news of a $1 billion share buyback, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Gains ranged from 3% to 6%.Microsoft (MSFT) and Chevron (CVX) outperformed in the Dow, rising about 2% each.

27,DVN,"U.S. shale producers were the big winners of OPEC's decision Wednesday to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day, but the deal won't immediately fix high debt loads, lack of skilled workers and other issues that shale producers need to resolve before ramping up production.West Texas Intermediate futures rose 3.3% to $51.06 a barrel on Thursday, the highest close since Oct. 19, after jumping 9% the day before. Brent futures rose as high as $54.53, the highest since July 2015.""There were casualties on capital spending  and future capital spending, so even though the war is over and welcomed by everyone, thinking the U.S. producers are going to ramp up production to where they were even a year ago is ill-conceived,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.Domestic crude production has edged up to the highest level in nearly six months, but Flynn thinks it will take a least a year before output really heats up in the U.S.""Companies are going to need more capital from banks, and it will be more difficult to borrow money because they have been burned in the past.""During the downturn, shale firms relied on bank loans or debt and stock sales to keep the lights on and rigs running.ConocoPhillips (COP) has said it would use cash from higher oil prices to first reduce debt before expanding operations. In May, EOG Resources (EOG) said it would first fund capital expenditures with cash flow, reduce net debt with property sales, and then complete drilled but uncompleted wells before starting to drill new wells.But Flynn said Conoco, Occidental Petroleum (OXY)and Oasis Petroleum (OAS) have a lot of capital and should be winners in the shale patch.Finding skilled workers and functioning equipment will be another major hurdle for the industry as rigs were retired or put in storage, and thousands of employees found other jobs after being laid off during the bust.Meanwhile, the latest surge in oil prices still isn't enough for many producers to jump back into the fray.Jason Wangler, managing director Wunderlich, told IBD oil would have to reach $60 per barrel before ""you'll see an absolute rush"" of producers ramping up activity. ""But $50 is a lot better than $40,"" and he expects U.S. shale companies' capital spending to be up 20% to 25% in 2017 vs. 2016.Last month, EOG said the U.S. shale industry needs oil prices of $60 a barrel to ramp up drilling.But Conoco, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN) will be able to boost activity at $50 per barrel, according to research company Wood Mackenzie in a Financial Times article.And costs are going up. Oil field service providers plan to roll back discounts offered during the depths of the price crash. In October, Halliburton (HAL) indicated that it was willing to increase its prices even if it means losing some customers.Still, technological advances have helped Continental Resources (CLR) reduce drilling time in the Bakken, and EOG has found a way to use cheap natural gas in fracking. But an estimated 80% of cost savings during the downturn came from service providers slashing costs.Shares of Continental Resources dipped 0.8% to close at 57.55 on the stock market today, but that's after surging 23% on Wednesday, breaking out of a cup with handle base. Occidental dipped  slightly to 71.27, Oasis ticked up 3 cents to 15. EOG climbed 2.2% to 104.75, above buy range, after jumping 11% Wednesday on the OPEC news. Halliburton added 0.3% to 53.24. Conoco lost 0.6% to 48.22 while Pioneer shares fell 0.8% to 189.57. Devon finished the day down 1% to 47.85.IBD'S TAKE: OPEC's announcement send shale stocks are soaring, see which shale plays are now buys.While rig counts have been rising in the Permian and Colorado's DJ Niobrara basin, Flynn said most of the recent rigs were added to replace rigs in decline or to hold leases.U.S. producers also could be hesitant to ramp up activity as the OPEC deal is contingent on Russia and other nonmembers scaling back output.The certainty of the deal was already in question Wednesday as Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak cautioned that Russia will ""gradually"" reduce due to technical issues.

""So now I think it's more of a function of can companies walk us through how much better the scenario is today?""Wangler expects guidance on activity and production levels and commentary on whether $50 a barrel will be enough for companies to really start ramping up activity.West Texas intermediate oil has been hovering around $50 a barrel for several weeks after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cap production. Rig counts, especially in the Permian basin, have risen, though the latest week saw the first dip in more than four months, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data.U.S. oil has retreated from $50 earlier this year and lately has had trouble breaking out higher. Some companies and analysts have said the industry needs a price closer to $60 or more to see a major comeback.Just holding around $50 may be a challenge.

37,DVN,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) warned Friday that it could make the biggest reserves revision since its 1999 merger, if crude prices don't climb higher, as it faces investigations into how it values its assets.The oil major said 3.6 billion barrels of reserves in the Canadian oil sands and another 1 billion barrels in other North American plays could be taken off the books because they aren't profitable at current prices.Exxon noted that such a ""de-booking"" wouldn't affect the actual operation of related projects or change guidance on future production volumes.But the reserves warning comes as Exxon is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Attorney General for not writing down assets, which have lost value during oil's two-year downturn, according to reports last month.While crude prices have recovered recently, momentum has stalled in recent weeks. U.S. futures have hit a ceiling at about $50 per barrel, well below their pre-bust level above $100.Exxon shares dropped 2.5% to close at 84.78 on the stock market today, undercutting their 50-day and 200-day lines.IBD'S TAKE: Oil markets are expected to rebalance next year, but oil majors face another potential crisis as the rise of electric vehicles could make another contraction happen sooner than expected.Meanwhile, Exxon said Q3 earnings dropped 38% to 63 cents per share, but beat analyst views by 5 cents, as revenue fell 12.9% to $58.68 billion, under views for $61.34 billion.Capital spending dropped 45% and oil production dipped 5.1%, with natural gas production up 0.8%.

39,DVN,"Oil prices are likely to remain volatile for the rest of the year, but some analysts believe U.S. crude will finally rise above $50 per barrel in 2017.Since the spring, West Texas Intermediate has topped the $50 mark repeatedly only to drop back below that level soon after. The price surged last week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to curb production, raising hopes for a more sustained price rally.Despite some doubts about whether the OPEC deal will hold, oil prices crept higher Monday, with WTI settling up 1.2% to $48.81, the highest in three months, and Brent up 1.4% to $50.89.Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst at Edward Jones, said via email that his company expects to see oil prices staying in the mid-to-high 40s before rising above the $50 ceiling next year. But he doesn't see shale companies increasing spending until oil is solidly in the mid-50s, and even then the ramp-up will be modest as firms remain conservative.For now, Youngberg is bullish on EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) for their ""flexibility both financially and operationally"" and Devon Energy (DVN), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Apache (APA) for their ""attractive acreage.""EOG shares closed down 0.6% to 96.11 on the stock market today. Pioneer edged down 0.1%. Devon added 0.2%. Marathon rose 1.1%. Apache climbed 0.1%.IBD's TAKE: The Permian Basin in Texas is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot.The U.S. Energy Information Administration said last month — before OPEC announced its plan to cut output — that it sees U.S. oil averaging below $45 a barrel this quarter and in Q1 2017, before topping $50 later in the year.Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody's analytics said the OPEC agreement put a floor on prices of $45 per barrel and while the cartel hasn't yet committed to the production cuts decided last week, he said it was clear that Saudi Arabia is struggling with low oil prices as it trims government workers' salaries and depletes its foreign reserves.""For some places, the point is that we think that current prices are sufficient to have a modest increase in investment, especially if companies are hedging oil prices and as prices continue to creep up,"" Lafakis said.U.S. shale companies have taken advantage of the rise in oil prices to lock in price risk for next year by hedging.""Hedging makes sense given uncertainty in markets, but many companies hedge on a regular basis and may just be taking advantage of the rise last week,"" Youngberg said. ""It may not be a bearish take, just a good opportunity to hedge given the recent flat price environment with oil stuck in the low to mid-40s.""RELATED: U.S. Oil Drilling To Jump Next Year As OPEC Looks To Scale BackU.S. Oil Rig Counts Rise Again On Permian, Williston Gains

45,DVN,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Tesoro (TSO) CEO said at an industry conference Monday that he supports the U.S. oil export ban being lifted and doesn't see a threat to the industry from hybrid cars.In the opening remarks at the annual Energy Information Administration conference, Gregory Goff said he supports free-market policies, noting that the end of the crude export ban is actually in the best interest for his industry, which had fought to keep the ban as it made U.S. oil cheaper.""From our standpoint, as a principle-based company, we believe a healthy free market economy is the way to address things,"" Goff said. ""Based upon that, we felt was in the best interest to lift the ban to allow the economy to move forward. Crude oil is sold and priced around the world and is very transparent.""The crude export ban, a relic from the 1970s that attempted to protect Americans from price spikes from Middle Eastern countries, was lifted last year. The ban's removal was good news for U.S. producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and Devon Energy (DVN), as it opened up additional markets.But refiners like Valero Energy (VLO) and their allies in Congress were some of the biggest advocates for keeping the ban.IBD'S TAKE: Amid the slump in oil prices and U.S. output, domestic producers like Continental are developing new ways to extract oil more efficiently and quickly.Tesoro shares rose 1.8% to 74 in the stock market today. Devon Energy climbed 0.2% and Valero 1.6%, but Continental sank 2.9%.Meanwhile, Goff said that ""no one has objections"" to advances in renewable energy as long as a strong business case could be made, but he called out the Obama administration for supporting overreaching regulations. Goff also said hybrid cars aren't a threat but a change, despite the impact that such vehicles have on gasoline consumption.Hybrids like the Toyota (TM) Prius and electric cars like the Tesla Motors (TSLA) Model S are becoming more affordable, but Goff questions the affordability of hybrids currently, saying it was important for alternative forms of transport to be developed in a free market economy.Tesla Motors rose 3.7%, retaking its 50-day moving average. Toyota climbed 3.5%, also retaking its 50-day line.

It expects 2016 oil production from core assets of 516,000-540,000 barrels a day, down from an average of 560,000 for 2015.Devon shares tumbled 4.4% Wednesday.Also late Tuesday, Laredo Petroleum (LPI) said it sees full-year production of  41,800-42,900 barrels of oil a day down 4.2%-6.7%  year over year. Shares ended up 5.85% Wednesday.Shares of Continental Resources (CLR), which will announce results next week, climbed 5.9%.

57,DVN,"The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell for the 14th time in 15 weeks, as top shale firms hold off on completing wells.Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday that the rig count fell by 13 to 400 in the past week, the lowest level since December 2009 and down from a peak of 1,609 in October 2014.The number of natural gas rigs ticked up to 102 from 101, despite prices hitting a 17-year low during the week.Crude prices rallied for most of Friday as pipeline issues in Iraq and Nigeria are expected to keep 800,000 barrels temporarily off the market. But they reversed lower, with Brent futures closing down 0.5% at $35.10 a barrel and U.S. oil down 0.9% at $32.78.The oil bust and the collapse in drilling activity have hit oilfield service providers especially hard, with the pain continuing as prices stay lower for longer.On Thursday, Halliburton (HAL) said it would cut its workforce by another 8%, roughly 5,000 jobs. Since 2014, the company has slashed 22,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce. Halliburton also has been divesting assets to get European regulators to approve its acquisition of Baker Hughes.Rival Schlumberger (SLB) has laid off 34,000 workers, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014, including 10,000 cuts in in the past quarter.Baker Hughes shares closed up 2.3% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 0.95%. Schlumberger edged up 0.2%.The new round of  layoffs come as U.S. shale drillers stop completion activities in the massive Bakken shale formation.Late Wednesday, Continental Resources (CLR) said it stopped fracking operations in the Bakken. It already had planned to defer most completions in the North Dakota play in 2016.It has four operated drilling rigs in the North Dakota Bakken, with plans to maintain that level through the year, but said it has no stimulation crews deployed there.Also late Wednesday, Whiting Petroleum (WLL) said it will stop completing wells and cut its 2016 capital spending budget by 80% from 2015 to $500 million.Shale companies hope that by leaving wells drilled but not completed, they can bring back production quickly once oil prices rise. Fracking a well normally accounts for two-thirds of a well’s total production costs.While oil companies are trying to save money by operating fewer rigs and slashing budgets, their debt ratings are in jeopardy as lower revenue and investment will likely hurt companies for the next four years.Late Thursday, Moody's put Chevron (CVX) on review for a downgrade on expected negative free cash flow and changed Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) debt rating outlook to negative, as lower capital reinvestment will likely haunt the oil major for the rest of the decade.The ratings agency also downgraded ConocoPhillips’ (COP), Marathon Oil’s (MRO), Devon Energy’s (DVN) and Apache’s (APA) senior unsecured ratings with a negative outlooks late Thursday. It also cut ratings on EOG Resources (EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY), but sees a stable outlook.Image provided by Shutterstock.

58,DVN,"Stocks rebounded in early afternoon trading Thursday amid strong earnings reports and a rebound in oil prices.The Nasdaq was up 0.9%, the S&P 500 climbed 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5%. Volume was running higher on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq compared with the same time Wednesday.Oil was up 3%, climbing above $33 a barrel, after Russia's energy minister reportedly said Saudi Arabia proposed that oil-producing countries cut output by 5% to bolster plunging crude prices.The reports boosted oil stocks such as Devon Energy (DVN), which jumped 9%, and oil and gas transporter Kinder Morgan (KMI), which rose more than 8%. Yet both stocks remain battered, down more than 60% off their 52-week highs.Elsewhere in the stock market today, social media giant Facebook (FB) and athleticwear maker Under Armour (UA) soared after their quarterly earnings reports.Under Armour rocketed 20% after reporting that Q4 profit rose a better-than-expected 20% from the same period last year on a 31% gain in sales. Chief Financial Officer Brad Dickerson also dismissed concerns about a possible decline in market share. Volume was huge as the stock retook its downward-sloping 50-week line.Facebook soared more than 15%, leading the IBD 50. The stock rebounded above its 50-day line and approached a new high after the company reported that Q4 profit jumped 46% to 79 cents a share. Revenue rose 52% to $5.84 billion. Both figures easily beat Wall Street estimates. Facebook also reported an increase in the number of daily active users.On the downside, biotech stock Celgene (CELG) dropped 4%, falling further below its downward-trending 200-day and 50-day lines, on a disappointing quarterly earnings report.Hawaiian Holdings (HA), which provides passenger and cargo service between Hawaii and the U.S. mainland,  dropped more than 2% in heavy volume. The stock is working on a cup-type base with a possible buy point at 40.23. But its drop below the 50-day line Thursday was a setback.

175,DVN,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY).

187,DVN,"The popular Super Bowl commercial laid out a tongue-in-cheek crisis in the future of AI. Amazon.com's (AMZN) digital assistant Alexa loses her voice. What to do in a world dependent on artificial intelligence in business and at home?X Enter a series of stand-ins, including actor Anthony Hopkins, who goes into creepy Hannibal Lecter mode and unnerves the people he's supposed to help. Thankfully, Alexa recovers her digital voice and restores order. AI proves its value.Corporate America is on the cusp of a plunge into this future of AI in business. And giant technology companies — which stand to benefit by both harnessing their own artificial intelligence applications and helping other companies make the leap — are immersed in it now.Artificial intelligence innovations are well along at Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Alexa, found on Amazon's Echo devices, is just one example. Digital aides like Google's aptly named Assistant on its Home smart speaker and Apple's Siri on its Home Pod can help with shopping, entertainment, school work and other tasks.Tech companies also are busy at work on deploying AI in self-driving cars. And companies ranging from giant IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) to a wave of startups are competing for talent and technology so they can cash in as AI spreads to non-tech enterprises.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportOutside Silicon Valley, companies are dipping a tentative toe into AI. Surveys show that most companies plan to evaluate how artificial intelligence can make them better, whether in making sales forecasts, automating tasks now done manually, improving existing products or enabling new ones. Budgets could more than triple in the next few years.""There's a lot of interest and experimentation; companies are still in the proof-of-concept, project phase,"" said Nicholas McQuire, vice president of enterprise research at CCS Insight. ""We'll see more deployment in about one or two years.""Artificial intelligence software programs — essentially computer algorithms — analyze huge amounts of data to identify patterns and predict outcomes.Companies are developing AI software that could save lives through early cancer detection. Other projects might someday thwart a cyberattack.Banking, retail and health care are among the sectors pushing into AI with pilot projects. Conversational ""chat bots"" are popping up on company websites, answering questions and improving customer service.Walmart Stores (WMT) harnesses AI to optimize inventories and supply chains by predicting future demand and reordering stock. Monsanto (MON) uses artificial intelligence to identify the most promising molecules in bioengineering. John Deere (DE) expects AI to reduce chemical spraying volumes in farming.

In health care, AI could predict diabetes and other diseases before they develop and identify the most promising treatments. A new algorithm from Google can help predict heart disease via retinal scans.In e-commerce, marketers expect AI tools to personalize website content to spotlight products or services that each online shopper is most likely to buy and to target ads more effectively. The telecom, oil and gas, media, entertainment and agriculture industries also are expected to embrace AI in their business.""A lot of companies see AI as transformational, but maybe not quite yet,"" said Jeff Cotrupe, an analyst at Frost & Sullivan.Industry disruptions and AI-based business models are off in the future.""The enterprise has been a bit slow,"" said Aditya Kaul, research director at Tractica. ""Many companies are still in the early stages of understanding what is AI, what problems can be solved, what is possible.""IDC forecasts that worldwide spending on AI hardware, software and services will jump to $58 billion by 2021, up from just $12 billion in 2017.""AI is not a budget line-item at this stage,"" said CCS's McQuire.JPMorgan estimates that AI will account for 1.8% of global enterprise IT budgets by 2021. Though still small next to, say, the 8% spent on cybersecurity, that would be up from a scant 0.3% in 2016.An AI spending boom would boost growth at enterprise software firms, cloud computing providers and IT service providers such as Microsoft, IBM, Accenture (ACN), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle.""The AI killer app has emerged: cost savings,"" Brent Bracelin, a KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent note to clients. Aside from customer service, he says many time-consuming, back-office tasks  such as human resources, finance and accounting will be automated with AI.One key to the future of AI will be to make it easier for companies to forge ahead with artificial intelligence projects, say analysts. Salesforce.com, AT&T (T) and Google are among those seeking a faster track for AI in business.AT&T, with an open-source software project, aims to make developing AI predictive tools as easy as building a website.  Working with IT consulting firm Tech Mahindra, AT&T has launched an open-source artificial intelligence software project with the Linux Foundation.""There is some confusion that doing AI is very expensive if you look at the R&D budgets of Google and Amazon,"" said Kaul. ""But you don't need billions of dollars to get AI projects started. There is open source software — it's a big trend within AI — that helps companies build their own solutions.""Salesforce.com has a mantra to help customers build AI tools ""with clicks not code."" That means companies don't need their own programmers to write algorithms that can find patterns or make inferences from sales data.Salesforce has a line of tools it calls Einstein that use a company's historical lead and account data to predict which deals are more likely to close.""What companies need is the ability to apply AI to their business. There's not a lot of off-the-shelf AI, like Salesforce's Einstein,"" said CCS Insight's McQuire. ""But technology is advancing quickly. We're going to see a lot more technology that helps companies automate the creation of custom AI models, which will speed up the market.""McQuire says nearly 60% of companies surveyed by CCS Insight are testing or studying AI. One problem is that high-tech companies are willing to pay much higher salaries for AI specialists, which increases their expenses.If they lack in-house expertise, McQuire says many companies are turning to cloud computing vendors — Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google — to get a head start.Cloud computing vendors aim to provide AI-as-a-service. Companies can run artificial intelligence apps on powerful computers rented by the hour to crunch massive quantities of data.""All the public clouds are fighting over who has the best AI platform,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a report.Google is focused on providing cloud customers with tool kits for ""machine learning,"" one type of AI. Google's AI tools enable cloud customers such as a hospital radiology department to focus computer vision algorithms so they can spot lung cancer.Many midsize or large companies lack internal technology staffers who can build AI-powered apps. That gives information technology services firms such as Accenture and IBM an opening as companies look to develop custom AI apps, says Bhavan Suri, analyst at William Blair. IBM, which has focused its Watson AI platform on health care, is moving into new markets such as digital marketing.Wall Street analysts anticipate that AI tools will be integrated with existing big data, business intelligence and industry-specific enterprise software. Kaul says many industries are still in the early stages of digitizing records handled as paperwork. Once that data is available, AI tools can go to work to help deploy AI in business.""Although Google, Facebook (FB), Baidu (BIDU), Apple, Microsoft and Amazon may have taken early advantage of their large data sets and established platforms, enterprise  software vendors like SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce are gradually embedding AI into their offerings,"" said the JPMorgan report.Software companies pushing into AI include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Tableau Software (DATA), Zendesk (ZEN), Coupa Software (COUP), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), HubSpot (HUBS), Splunk (SPLK) and Workday (WDAY).The fact that most non-tech companies need a helping hand getting into artificial intelligence also provides an opportunity for startups pushing into the enterprise market. Among them: Sentient Technologies, DataRobot, Clarifai, Algorithmia, Affectiva and SpaceKnow.At this early stage of AI in business, corporate America is using what's called ""machine learning"" for the most part as opposed to more complex ""deep learning."" With ML, algorithms are trained to create predictive models or identify patterns. ML helps predict what a particular customer is likely to buy or detects insurance claims fraud.Tech companies use machine learning to personalize web content and other tasks. But they also are plowing ahead in applying deep learning, which mimics neural networks in the human brain, for classifying images and other purposes. Self-driving cars will require deep learning to map their surroundings and detect hazards.Technology giants are in an AI arms race. They're funding or acquiring startups and paying super-salaries to hire AI computer scientists.Amazon isn't stopping at Alexa-powered digital assistants. Its Amazon Go retail stores use computer vision and AI to do away with cashiers.Apple uses artificial intelligence software for facial recognition in the new iPhone X. And Apple is developing AI health care mobile apps.For Facebook users, AI lurks behind the scenes, playing a central role in what advertisements or news they see. And at Netflix (NFLX), programming recommendations are getting better as software algorithms are trained to identify movie matches.What sets the tech giants apart is commitment. For them, the future of AI is now.Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai makes a point to show this. On earnings calls and tech conferences, he now calls Google an ""AI first"" company.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Is It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?No. 1-Ranked Stock With 118% Growth Breaks Out With Earnings DueBirth Of An Industry: Early Investing  Hot Spots In Artificial IntelligenceIt's An AI Arms Race: What China Has To Offer Vis-A-Vis U.S.

193,DVN,"Oil prices rose on Monday to their highest levels since mid-2015 amid political unrest in Saudi Arabia, but there is more than just palace intrigue boosting prices.XU.S. crude jumped 3.1% to settle at $57.35 a barrel, the highest since July 2015. Among oil majors with holdings in Saudi Arabia, Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.6% on the stock market today, Chevron (CVX) gained 1.8%, after falling out of buy range last week, BP (BP) rallied 2.1% and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) advanced 2.2%. BP and Shell are extended out of buy range.Even before the weekend's purge of top officials in Riyadh, prices had been trending higher. Here are five reasons why oil prices have been and may continue to be on the uptick:In an unprecedented move, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman ordered the arrests of several high-profile members of the royal family including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the head of the Saudi Arabian National Guard.Salman has signaled support for OPEC's deal with Russia and other nonmembers to curb production and prop up prices. Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said in a note Monday that he expects Salman to continue to constrain production.But Salman's power consolidation also comes with some risks, especially as he seeks foreign investment to help fuel economic reforms.""The arrest of prince al-Waleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia's richest businessman with a net worth of nearly $19 billion, could well dampen international interest in investing in the crown prince's much-heralded Vision 2030 to make the non-oil private sector the new motor of the economy,"" David Ottaway, Middle East Fellow at the Wilson Center, wrote in a note.Ramped-up regional tensions are adding upward pressure on prices, and Salman's stronger hand may also be factor on this front too, as he has been more hawkish on foreign policy.This weekend, Saudi Arabia claimed to have shot down a missile from Houthi rebels in Yemen near Riyadh. The kingdom is fighting a proxy war with Iran against the rebels in Yemen. Tehran is believed to have supplied the rebels with the missile, but Iran denies the allegations.The attack could be considered ""an act of war against the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" the Saudi-led military coalition said in a statement Monday.Analysts don't expect the power consolidation and increased tensions with Iran to affect the likely extension of the oil output deal. Last year, OPEC, Russia and other top producers agreed to curb production to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the market to stabilize prices.Salman has been supportive of the deal as the country needs higher oil prices to hype up Saudi Aramco's initial public offering and Russian President Vladimir Putin has also shown signs of supporting an extension.The current production deal expires in March, but analysts expect an update at OPEC's biannual meeting at the end of this month.After looking for ways to expand production, shale producers are shifting their focus to cash-flow discipline and not working unprofitable plays, even as oil prices climb higher.Devon Energy (DVN), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), EOG Resources (EOG) and other shale exploration and production companies showed spending discipline in their third-quarter results out last week.Meanwhile, U.S. rig counts have been falling and on Friday saw the biggest drop since May 2016, according to Baker Hughes (BHGE) data.Global demand for crude is rising, and the International Energy Agency said last month that global supply and demand will balance next year as demand growth rises 1.4% in 2018.Gasoline demand from China remains especially robust thanks to a 17% increase in SUV sales. And in the U.S., trucks and SUVs remain popular.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

""Combined with our consistent operational proficiency and innovative technology, this gives us great confidence in the long-term sustainability of our unique premium growth and high-return model.""Devon Energy (DVN) was also active in the Bone Spring play during Q3, and Concho Resources (CXO) has acreage there too.

240,DVN,"Investors with an interest in Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States stocks have likely encountered both Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report) and Apache (APA  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Devon Energy is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Apache has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that DVN likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than APA has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.DVN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 24.99, while APA has a forward P/E of 27.87.

This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. APA currently has a PEG ratio of 3.98.Another notable valuation metric for DVN is its P/B ratio of 1.74. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, APA has a P/B of 2.09.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DVN's Value grade of B and APA's Value grade of C.DVN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than APA, so it seems like value investors will conclude that DVN is the superior option right now.

On Jun 29, 2018, the company completed its previous $3-billion share repurchase authorization.

This was its fifth-sharpest daily decline this year, according to Reuter’s data.Japanese and South Korea stock markets both ended down more than -2.0%, while the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 was -0.7% weaker when I looked in.For the remainder of this 4-day U.S. trading week, here are Reuters in London’s five big world market themes. These are likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders.I list them in order of importance to global equity markets.(1) Second Half of 2018 BeginsIt has been the worst first-half of a year for global stocks since 2010 as a mix of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in Europe wiped a trillion dollars off MSCI’s 47-country world index.But let us put that behind us — Monday is the first trading day of the second 2018 half.What lies ahead?What is certain is that the U.S. Fed will raise interest rates again, at least once, possibly twice. The ECB will end its bond-buying at the end of December. The Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and some big emerging market central banks will also raise interest rates.The question is whether more misery lies in store for assets such as Chinese stocks, which have entered bear-market territory. The yuan’s fate will be key to other emerging markets after losses of 5-8 percent on stocks and bonds.So who will emerge the winner?At this point it is the FAANG U.S. tech stocks, which collectively are up almost 40 percent.Whether the gains continue may depend on trade politics and Fed policy — a more aggressive Fed could ensure 10-year yields rise above 3 percent again and stay there.(2) Big Friday U.S. Non-Farm Payroll Print HappensJune’s U.S. unemployment data, due Friday, will be closely watched for further signs of a tightening labor market.Unemployment data for May boosted markets, with the rate falling to an 18-year low, pointing to strength in the U.S. economy, and helping send stocks up around 1 percent that day.Non-farm payrolls surged by 223,000 jobs during that month, as warm weather bolstered hiring at construction sites. June’s data is expected to show a 200,000 increase, according to a Reuters poll.The closely watched hourly wages in May rose 0.3 percent, topping economists’ estimates. The same figure is expected in June.(3) U.S.-China Trade War Shifts Up a GearThe Sino-U.S. trade conflict is about to shift into a higher gear, with additional tariffs on Chinese imports kicking in on July 6.Respective market moves indicate the United States has won Round One of the tariff war — the yuan just clocked up its worst month on record while China’s stock market suffered its deepest monthly slide since January 2016.This week, the yuan will take center-stage as investors wonder what action, if any, Beijing might take to stem the currency’s slide. Chinese policymakers are known for their readiness to intervene in the economy and financial markets and economy at any opportunity but they seem less interventionist this time.This could, of course, show commitment to a long-promised liberalization process. More likely though, authorities are signaling their readiness to use yuan weakness as a response to U.S. import tariffs.The risk is that an extended sell-off feeds off itself, sparking capital outflows. Without an easing in trade tensions it’s hard to see the yuan moves reversing, unless manufacturing and service sector surveys next week provide some relief.(4) Fallout from Presidential Elections in MexicoThe polls showed former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be the next president, garnering over half of the votes.This is the third bid for the key job by AMLO, as the leftist Lopez Obrador is commonly known; his popularity has grown hand in hand with Mexicans’ anger at the failure of traditional parties to end record levels of violence and corruption.His history of protest politics has unnerved investors though and while throughout this campaign AMLO has courted Wall Street, he has still pledged to review a 2013 opening of the oil industry to private producers.The vote comes at a delicate point for Mexico, which is at odds with the United States over migration and trade, while talks on reworking the NAFTA trade agreement are deadlocked. The new president will have to steer his country through these issues.The peso sank to a 1 1/2-year low in June, though its weakness has mostly been blamed on a global emerging market sell-off. AMLO’s election win looks already priced in.(5) EU Migration Deal Gets ClosedAn EU deal to share out refugees on a voluntary basis and create “controlled centers” to process asylum requests has thrown a lifeline to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose coalition government has been teetering on the brink of collapse.Bavaria’s Christian Social Union met on Sunday to decide whether that deal addressed its concerns. They will meet again on Monday night. If not, it could make good on a promise to unilaterally introduce tougher immigration controls, potentially shattering its alliance with Merkel’s Christian Democrats and toppling her three-month-old government.But hopes a political crisis has been averted sent the euro and stock markets rallying on Friday. The gains could extend should the CSU give the agreement the thumbs-up.Italian debt has been the other beneficiary from the migrant deal. Investors, possibly, have interpreted the compromise by Rome’s anti-establishment government with EU peers as boding well for similarly contentious talks on Italian budget policies later this year.Top Zacks #1 Rank Stocks—NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report): This chip stock is stacking up to $143B in market capitalization. The Value score is F and the Growth score is A. You can call it either way, based on that.Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report): This is one of the biggest U.S. producers of natural gas. We haven’t seen a natural gas producer on this list for some time. It must be because WTI oil prices are rising above $70.

With a Zacks VGM score of B, this one may be worth picking up during the trade war sell-off, at some point.Key Global Macro Data—There is a load of ISM manufacturing monthly updates, out on Monday, across all global regions.The big macro fundamental prints come out of the USA. Look for non-farm payroll — on Friday — and the average hourly earnings data.On Monday, the China Caixin Manufacturing PMI came out at 51.0, versus a prior 51.1. No change is predictable. But no change in the face of a US China Trade War is notable.The India manufacturing PMI went up to 53.1 from a prior reading of 51.2.The German manufacturing PMI was 55.9 versus a prior reading of 55.9. Europe is also holding up well, in the face of the trade war rhetoric.The Eurozone manufacturing PMI was 54.9 versus a prior reading of 55.5.Eurozone unemployment gets updated.

This is still weak evidence here.On Thursday, the US ADP employment survey comes out. Last month at +178K is supposed to get to +205K. That won’t move the tape.US initial claims come out. Last week, it was 227K. That is quite low, still.The US ISM non-manufacturing index comes out. The prior was quite high at 58.6.On Friday, U.S. average hourly earnings hit the tape. This can drive up consumer price inflation, which spooks the Fed. The prior reading was +0.3%.U.S. non-farm payrolls should get to +210K, and the unemployment rate should be 3.8%.

243,DVN,"Oasis Petroleum, Inc. (OAS  -  Free Report) recently inked two separate deals to offload some of its non-operating assets in the Williston Basin, in a bid to upgrade its portfolio. The transaction is valued at $283 million. However, details of the buyers have been kept under wraps. The divested non-core assets comprise 65,000 acres in North Dakota and Montana, having an estimated production capacity of 4,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d).The proceeds from this transaction will enable the company to pay for the acquisition of Permian acreage from San Antonio-based Forge Energy. In an attempt to diversify its holdings away from North Dakota, Oasis Petroleum acquired around 22,000 acres in the prolific Delaware Basin earlier this year. The deal has undoubtedly opened the gateway for Oasis Petroleum in the Delaware Basin, which is the most profitable area for oil explorers of late due to low production cost.Oasis Petroleum paid a huge premium for this $946-million acquisition deal, funded through cash and stock. In order to finance the deal, the company had resorted to issuing new stocks and also planned to jettison its non-core Williston assets to raise cash. In fact, it had announced its plans to sell around 200,000 acres, accounting for 8000-10,000 Boe/d, for approximately $500 million. The latest agreements highlight the company’s progress toward its target. Oasis Petroleum remains committed to evaluate and vend the additional non-pivotal acreage in order to streamline portfolio and strengthen its position in the prolific Delaware Basin.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHouston, TX-based Oasis Petroleum is an independent explorer engaged in the acquisition, and development of oil and natural gas resources.

244,DVN,"Parsley Energy, Inc. (PE  -  Free Report) appears to be a solid bet based on strong fundamentals, robust financials along with healthy share price performance. Shares of Parsley have gained 15.8% in the past two years, vis-à-vis the stocks in this industry that have collectively lost 5%.If you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio. Analysts are also displaying bullish sentiments on the stock, as is apparent from the upward revisions in earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.70 for fiscal 2018 and $2.50 for fiscal 2019 has been revised upward by 11 cents and 12 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days.Currently, the industry to which Parsley belongs ranks within the top 15% (37 of 255) of all the Zacks industries. Further, the stock boasts a VGM Score of A and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 26.9%, which raises optimism among investors.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock an attractive buy.  Key Growth CatalystsParsley’s strategic acreage position in the low-cost Permian Basin is the foremost driving force. An extensive inventory of premium drilling locations both in the Midland and Delaware sides of the Permian Basin has been aiding in top-tier production growth since several years. The company remains committed to exploring significant growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions. Last year, it closed the $2.8-billion deal with Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC, which added 71,000 net acres to Parsley’s acreage in the Midland Basin, providing a major boost to the company’s overall acreage in the Permian Basin that now stands close to 220,000 acres.Owing to significant resource potential and prime acreage holdings, the company’s last quarterly output recorded a year-over-year and sequential increase of 66.5% and 16.3%, respectively. Notably, during the last reported quarter, the Permian pure play player placed on production 20 and 21 gross operated horizontal wells in Midland and Delaware, respectively. Oil production in Delaware increased more than 50% sequentially on the back of strong well results. Notably, Parsley’s revenue CAGR (2015-2017) was 267% owing to solid output growth that came in at 24,792 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d) in 2017 compared with 8,031 Mboe/d in 2015.In fact, Parsley Energy's quarterly oil volume has grown at the rate of 16% CAGR since 2014. This year, the company expects to generate organic oil production growth of around 50% from the 2017 level. Parsley Energy's liquids-heavy portfolio makes earnings highly sensitive to oil prices. With the macro environment expected to remain favorable and Parsley's robust operating cash margin of nearly 80%, its cash flow and balance sheet are likely to be strengthened further.The company’s aggressive cost-control strategies have boosted its cash flow and balance sheet. In the last reported quarter, the company’s lease operating cost came in at $3.43 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) compared with $3.57 per BOE a year ago. As it is, the Midland-based upstream company displays healthy balance sheet with a manageable debt-to-capital ratio of around 26%, which is lower than most peers, providing it with enough financial flexibility to tap strategic growth opportunities. Parsley also fares well in the cash-flow parameter, which is a key metric to gauge the financial health of a company. The company’s cash flow in 2017 totaled 694 million in 2017, representing a CAGR (3 years) of 100.8%.Banking on the aforementioned positives, the company is poised to carry on its momentum going forward.Looking for Other Promising Upstream Stocks?

245,DVN,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large weekly draw on the back of strong refinery runs. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.8% (or $1.15) to $66.22 per barrel yesterday.The federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks. In fact, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, the commodity continues to remain under pressure from reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela. As of now, all eyes are on the oil producers’ meeting set for Jun 22 in Vienna, which will decide what happens next regarding their supply curb policy.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 5.9 million barrels for the week ending Jun 15, following a decrease of 4.1 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.7 million barrels.Record refinery throughput led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10.9 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 43 of the last 63 weeks and are down more than 80 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 426.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 16% below the year-ago figure and 2% under the five-year average.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – fell 1.3 million barrels to 32.6 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.2 days in the previous week to 24.5 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were up for the fourth time in five weeks as demand weakened. The 3.3 million barrels gain – defying the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 240 million barrels. Following last week’s addition, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product inched closer to the year-earlier level and is 6% over the five-year range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 2.7 million barrels last week, again contrary to analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 117.4 million barrels, current supplies are 23% below the year-ago level and 14% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1% from the prior week to 96.7% - the highest in 2018.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

246,DVN,"Will crude prices continue to rally? The consensus decision from tomorrow’s 174th OPEC meet in Vienna, Austria, will probably answer this million-dollar question.  Most of the analysts opine that Saudi Arabia and Russia will consider increasing oil production as the global crude supply may shrink due to disruptions in Iran and Venezuela. The bottleneck in Permian pipelines is going to mar U.S. oil output and might also propel Saudis to pump more oil.However, few analysts believe that the leading crude exporters could fail to reach an agreement as some OPEC members are not willing to put relaxation on the existing production curb accord.Irrespective of the two probable outcomes, the long-term crude market fundamentals are likely to remain strong. In other words, even if the cartel members opt for more production, the energy market will not witness oil oversupply. Hence, the probability of a fall in crude prices is less.  OPEC Gets Ready for Vienna MeetOn Jun 22, OPEC and non-OPEC players will decide on the relaxation or the extension of the existing production cut deal — first signed in 2016. For 18 months, the members of the cartel and few non-members, including Russia, managed to eradicate roughly 1.8 million barrels of crude volumes from the market on a daily basis.  Following strong compliance with the production curb deal, the crude exporters successfully mitigated the supply glut concern. This led to the partial recovery of WTI oil price, which fell drastically to less than $27 per barrel in February 2016 from more than $100 in mid-2014.  Possible OutcomesRelax Output-Curb DealMany analysts are convinced that the cartel and non-members will opt to ease the existing limit on crude volume. In fact, Saudi Arabia is striving to convince other oil exporters to produce more of the commodity. Russia is also willing to put a relaxation on the existing accord for the second half of 2018.  On May 8, President Trump nixed the Iran nuclear deal, putting a lot on the line. This could possibly lower the country’s crude export. Also, Venezuela, touted to be among the biggest oil producers in Latin America, has been witnessing a steep decline in crude production. In 2017, Venezuela reported the lowest oil production in a decade. Following the disruptions in global crude supply, Brent crude crossed the $80 psychological mark in May after three and half years.  Eventually, to stop crude prices from surging further and offset oil supply worries, Saudi Arabia and Russia are considering increasing oil output.Failure to Reach AgreementMost of the crude exporters in the cartel, like Iran and Iraq, are losing their capability to pump more oil. Instead, they are inclining toward expensive crude for maximizing revenues. Countries like Angola, Algeria, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela are also witnessing lower crude production volumes.  On the flip side, only a few OPEC members like UAE, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia can boost oil output. Hence, it is quite natural that Iran, Iraq and Venezuela will not agree with these countries on relaxation of the existing output cut accord.Different opinions among the cartel members can make it hard for the leading crude exporters to finalize an agreement. In fact, Bijan Zanganeh — oil minister of Iran — announced that ""Every decision in OPEC needs unanimity, and I don't believe in this meeting we can reach agreement."" Crude Market Fundamentals Will Stay StrongPer analysts of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report), Saudi-led OPEC and Russia will collectively boost daily global oil supply by 300,000-800,000 barrels. In this backdrop, the oil exporters are not going to breach the existing accord, considering that OPEC members have been producing 800,000 barrels of less oil volumes than the existing quota, per media reports.      Additionally, the global demand for crude is likely to grow 1.4 million barrels per day through 2018, claimed the International Energy Agency.  Oil Stocks to BuyThe global crude demand picture looks encouraging. Also, Saudis and Russia are not expected to flood the oil market, while Iran and Venezuela are likely to disrupt the worldwide crude supply.Overall, favorable demand and supply fundamentals will continue to back the rally in oil prices. Given that the fate of upstream energy players is positively correlated with the price of the commodity, picking oil stocks seems to be a smart option at this moment. However, selecting profitable stocks may be a daunting task.This is where our VGM Score comes in handy. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth, and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

247,DVN,"It can be very difficult to find companies that are both flying under the radar, and still might have potential for gains. Many times, stocks are off investors’ radar screens for a reason, though there are some hidden gems that could be worth uncovering by those with a high-risk tolerance.   One way to find these underappreciated stocks is by looking at companies that haven’t seen their share prices move higher lately but have observed analysts raising earnings estimates for their stock. This trend could signal that investors haven’t quite embraced the rising estimate story yet, but that the potential for a big move higher is definitely there.One such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain, but has been overlooked by investors lately, is Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report).

248,DVN,"On Jun 16, Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share has been revised upward from $1.39 to $1.64 over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings rose to $3.05 from $2.47. Moreover, we expect the company to record earnings growth of 160.3% and 86.3% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.    Devon has a strong footprint in oil-rich U.S. resources comprising Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin (the sub-basin of Permian), Rockies and the STACK play. Moreover, the company has exposure to Eastern Alberta’s heavy oil projects. Apart from oil, Devon’s strong exposure to prolific natural gas fields like Barnett Shale will secure the company’s long-term production growth.In fact, from the U.S. resources, the company is expecting oil production to grow from 114 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/D) in 2017 to more than 175 MBbls/D through 2020. A major portion of the output growth is likely to be backed by Delaware and STACK plays. Devon is also planning to lower cash cost per barrel of oil equivalent by 15% from 2017 to 2020.   The overall production growth and strong cost-saving initiatives are likely to help Devon to witness compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 25% in cash flow through 2020. This will lead to $2.5 billion in cumulative free cashflow generation over the same time frame, assuming that West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil will continue to trade over $60 per barrel.  All these positive developments indicate the company’s impressive pricing chart. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 31.9%, outperforming the 14.5% cumulative rise of the stocks belonging to the industry.  Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the energy space are Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC  -  Free Report), Eclipse Resources Corp. (ECR  -  Free Report) and Wildhorse Resource Development Corp. (WRD  -  Free Report).

Total revenues were up 7.3% from the year-ago figure of $3,551 million.This year-over-year improvement in total revenues was primarily due to strong contribution from its Marketing and midstream businesses.Highlights of the ReleaseIn the first quarter of 2018, total production touched 544,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day.  The actual production was within the expected range of 530,000-554,000 Boe per day.

252,DVN,"Investors in Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 1, 2018 $31 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Devon Energy shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Devon Energy is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the  Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry that ranks in the Top 29% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 36 cents per share to 28 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Devon Energy right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

253,DVN,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles registered a fall of 1.4 million barrels as exports jumped to a new record. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels. Importantly, the positive data sets have added to the strong sentiment in the oil market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 0.3% (or 18 cents) to $71.49 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since November 2014.Over the past month, the commodity has been supported by speculation that the United States could renew sanctions on OPEC-member Iran. True to predictions, U.S. President Donald Trump recently withdrew from a nuclear deal with the cartel’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about a cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from the current levels and a supply shortage in an already tight oil market.Energy Stocks on a RollThe bullish oil market sentiment has encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – more than 7% over the past month.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 4.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) and National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels for the week ending May 11, following a decrease of 2.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.3 million barrels.Soaring exports in the wake of widening Brent premium to WTI led to the draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. This was partly offset by record high domestic production, which restricted the decline below expectations.In particular, U.S. output rose by 20,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.72 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 40 of the last 58 weeks and are down nearly 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 432.4 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – edged up by 53,000 barrels to 37.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 26.0 days in the previous week to 26.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were down a second week in a row as imports dropped, while demand remained strong with the onset of the summer driving season. The 3.8 million barrels decline – outpacing the polled number of 2 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 232 million barrels. Following last week’s draw, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 3.6% below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) inched down 92,000 barrels last week, unable to match up with analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to lower imports and strong demand. At 114.9 million barrels, current supplies are 21.7% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up 0.7% from the prior week to 91.1%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

In the fourth quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 36.67%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderDevon Energy’s strong production can be attributed to contribution from its domestic-resource plays and its shifting focus toward high margin production regions.

257,DVN,"TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) made full utilization of its financial strength to acquire several assets in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) region from the Cobalt International Energy’s bankruptcy auction sale. TOTAL made an offer of $300 million to acquire 20% interest in the North Platte discovery, 20% stake in Anchor discovery and operation rights in 13 offshore exploration blocks.The U.S. Bankruptcy Court has approved the above transfer of rights to TOTAL on Apr 5, 2018.

258,DVN,"Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) decided to reduce its current workforce by 9% or 300 workers with an objective to streamline its operations, improve returns and boost margins, per a media report. The layoffs will begin in the next few weeks and impact all areas of the company’s operations, including its headquarters.Devon Energy expects the decision to cut down its existing workforce to result in savings within $150-$200 million in 2020.In 2016, Devon Energy announced plans to reduce its workforce by nearly 1,000 to cope with the low commodity price environment.

259,DVN,"Over the last three years, the energy market has experienced intense price volatility. However, it seems that following an extended period of relative weakness, energy stocks are finally on their way to recovery. With crude now firmly back over $60, the panic that swept over the market are all but gone. The incredible turnaround has stoked high expectations from the energy sector going into the first quarter of 2018.Posting its third quarterly gain in a row, oil prices ended March 2018 up nearly 8% year to date. The commodity got off to a strong start this year with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbing 7.1% in January. Though the benchmark tumbled 4.8% in February in the wake of a broad stock market selloff, it staged a rebound in March, with the contract up 5.6% for the month.The first quarter of the year saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014 despite record high domestic production. Crude was supported by a variety of catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curbs from OPEC and its allies.What’s encouraging is that the quarterly price appreciation extends an upbeat tone in crude trade into 2018 following the futures contracts’ back-to-back yearly increases. To be precise, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.94 per barrel.A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $50 per barrel mark.Gains Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q4 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index. The October-December period turned out to be a rather good one with earnings for the sector recording a massive 153.7% jump from the same period last year – the most among all 16 broad Zacks sectors by a long way – on 23.6% higher revenues.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q1 earnings season as well, which is on track to be the fourth successive quarter of positive earnings growth for the Oil/Energy sector. This is not surprising, considering that crude prices improved considerably from the year-ago period. In fact, the strongest growth in Q1 is again set to come from Oil/Energy. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the bottom line for energy companies is expected to expand at a highly impressive rate of 60.2% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 15.6%.Not all Stocks Will Outperform EstimatesSure, investing in companies that positively surprises estimates can fetch handsome returns for investors. This is because a stock generally surges upon earnings beat.But, the flip side, not all energy companies will deliver positive earnings surprises despite the promising backdrop. And when a stock negatively surprises and its scrip plummets subsequently, it can destroy a trade, set back an entire portfolio, and make a trader lose his confidence. Few things can decimate a stock like a negative earnings surprise.Utilizing Zacks' Earnings ESP system can greatly increase your odds of finding these potential underperformers before they report. And excluding these stocks from one’s portfolio can actually increase return by minimizing losses. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Apart from Earnings ESP, we have relied on our proprietary Zacks Rank and Style Score systems to help you avoid a few oil and gas companies this earnings season. Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) along with a VGM Score of D or lower are best avoided.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.As per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of 1, 2 or 3 to beat estimates.

261,DVN,"Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for DVN broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 17.1% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for DVN stock.If that wasn’t enough, DVN isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 5 estimates have been reduced, while two have moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for DVN.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Devon's Q4 Earnings Lag Estimates, Expands ReservesDevon Energy Corp. reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents by 36.7%.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 35 cents per share, down from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 41 cents. The difference between operating and GAAP figures in the reported quarter was due to a gain from tax reforms and restructuring, while asset impairment charges and deferred tax asset valuation allowance offset the gains.RevenuesDevon’s quarterly revenues of $3,983 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,499 million by 13.8%. Total revenues were up 41.8% from the year-ago figure of $2,808 million.These year-over-year improvements in total revenues were primarily due to strong contribution from its Upstream business, and Marketing and midstream businesses.Highlights of the ReleaseIn the fourth quarter of 2017, total production touched 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day.  The actual production was lower than the expected range of 551,000-571,000 Boe per day. In the quarter, net production in the United States was limited to nearly 9,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the timing of well tie-ins associated with non-operated activity in the STACK.Devon’s midstream business generated operating profits of $272 million, expanding 35% year to date. This growth was driven entirely by Devon’s strategic investment in EnLink Midstream.The company, through its successful drilling initiatives has expanded its 2017 proved reserves by 5% to 2.2 billion Boe. Liquid reserves in 2017 increased to 1.2 billion Boe, driven by a 32% increase in U.S. oil reserves.Realized PricesRealized oil prices in the quarter were $42.21 per barrel, up 20.9% from $34.90 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. Realized prices for natural gas were up 11.2% to $2.48 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) from $2.23 per Mcf in the prior-year quarter.Total realized prices, including cash settlements, were $27.78 per Boe, up 19.9% year over year due to higher prices of commodities.Financial HealthAs of Dec 31, the company generated cash and cash equivalents of $2,673 million, up from $1,959 million as of Dec 31, 2016.

264,DVN,"In an attempt to boost its stake in the U.S. shale assets, Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) is reportedly teaming with the private equity firm, Blackstone Group, to place a $10 billion bid for the joint takeover of BHP Billiton Limited’s (BHP  -  Free Report) American shale operations.The Anglo-Dutch oil giant and Blackstone are just one of the several bidders for BHP Billiton’s U.S. assets, before a deal is struck later this year. Notably, private equity players have been ramping up their investments in the U.S. shale assets for the last few years, as the industry downturn has reduced the capital spending of the energy companies. Recently, Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) also offloaded its Barnett shale assets in Texas to a private equity player for $553 million. Partnering with the deep-pocketed private equity player provides Shell with an additional boost.  If Shell succeeds to win the bid, it will be the largest takeover for the energy supermajor since the $50 billion BG Group buyout in 2016. It will help to drive the company’s production growth and cash flow generation.  The company began its drilling operations in Permian in 2012 and intends to ramp up its exploration momentum in the low cost-high margin Permian Basin to drive earnings and growth. Meanwhile, in a bid to streamline its portfolio, BHP Billiton had been contemplating to exit the U.S. onshore shale business since last year amid pressure from the activist investor, Elliott Management Corporation, a hedge fund firm. BHP Billiton holds acreage across four U.S. shale plays including the prolific Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, along with Fayetteville and Haynesville plays. The shale plays have failed to generate strong returns and is therefore a relatively less capital efficient holding in its portfolio.We also notice that BHP Billiton has reduced capital and exploration expenses on its onshore U.S. assets, shifting its focus toward brighter prospects. For instance, in fiscal 2017, exploration and capital expenses plunged 32% year over year to $5.2 billion.Importantly, the company intends to swap its onshore assets with offshore ones to pull out the American shale plays. Notably, last month BHP Billiton nixed the sale of some of its oldest fields offshore Australia, jointly held by the world’s largest miner and oil supermajor, ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report). The companies have now decided to retain the ownership and operation of such assets to take advantage of the recovering commodity market.Zacks Rank Headquartered in Netherlands, Shell is one of the largest integrated energy companies engaged in production, refining, distribution and marketing of oil and natural gas.

267,DVN,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% delivering positive earnings surprises and 73.8% beating revenue estimates.Near about half of the S&P listed energy companies have released their first-quarter results. These include Halliburton Company, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes, Hess Corporation, Valero Energy Corporation, Range Resources Corporation, Phillips 66, National Oilwell Varco, Helmerich & Payne, Inc., EQT Corporation, ExxonMobil Corporation, Cabot oil & Gas Corporation, Chevron Corporation and ConocoPhillips.Two biggies — ExxonMobil and Chevron — reported their results on Apr 27. While Chevron delivered earnings beat on higher oil prices and volumes, ExxonMobil missed estimates amid output and refinery throughput decline, along with lower margins at chemicals business.Bullish Results & ExpectationsIn the last reported quarter, earnings for the energy sector saw the strongest growth, recording a massive 136.6% year-over-year gain on 23.6% higher revenues.Also, for the first quarter of 2018, we expect the energy sector to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 70.8% from first-quarter 2017, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 15.4% from the year-ago levels.Q1 Oil and Gas Price Report CardOil: The first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. Crude was supported by various catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s first-quarter results.It goes without saying that all oil-producing companies are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices, as they will be able to extract more value for their products. However, the recent oil price rally has made the commodity costlier for refiners, leading to higher input cost for them.Natural gas: However, price of natural gas dropped about 7.4% in the January-March period. Along with the sequential fall, natural gas prices also remained unfavorable compared with the corresponding period of 2017. Commodity futures were $2.73 per MMBtu at the end of the quarter, down more than 14% from the Mar 31, 2017 settlement of $3.19 per MMBtu.Energy Stocks Reporting Q1 Earnings on May 1Let’s find out what’s in store for the below-mentioned five energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers on May 1.Headquartered in Midland, TX, Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) is an upstream energy player focused mainly on the lucrative Permian Basin. The company is expected to release results after the closing bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In the last reported quarter, Concho delivered an impressive 43.48% positive earnings surprise on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. As far as earnings beat is concerned, the company has an excellent history. Over the trailing four quarters, it surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 48.89%.It looks like Concho is all set to keep its earnings streak alive in the first quarter, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.86% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for daily production is currently pegged at 218.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE), higher than 181.4 MBOE reported in the year-ago quarter and 211.1 MBOE in the prior quarter. Moreover, analysts also envision higher price realizations that will further buoy its top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average oil price is expected to jump 20.2% and 11.3% from the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.Next up, we have Oklahoma-based independent energy producer Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), which is slated to release numbers after the closing bell.  In the fourth quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 36.67% amid higher impairment charges. Nonetheless, the company surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters.However, our proven model does not show that Devon Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter as it has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Weather-related issues are expected to affect first-quarter production of the firm. The company estimates total production from its assets in the first quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 530,000-554,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day, compared with 548,000 Boe achieved in fourth-quarter 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is $3,852 million for the first quarter, exhibiting a sequential decline of 3.33%.Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), — an oil and gas producer with operations focused in the Gulf of Mexico — is set to unveil results after the closing bell.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter, with the positive earnings surprise being 18.3%. Moreover, it has topped earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 15.9%.However, our proven model does not show conclusively that the company will be able to beat estimates in the to-be-reported quarter, as it carries an Earnings ESP of -0.76% and Zacks Rank #3.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $2.70 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), implying a year-over-year decline from $2.93 per Mcf, the estimate for gas production is pegged at 35.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf), reflecting an improvement from 29.4 Bcf in the year-ago quarter.Next in line we have Noble Energy Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report), slated to release results before the opening bell. The independent oil and gas producer mainly operates in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent and Gulf of Mexico regions.In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 700%. The company boasts an excellent track record of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 246.16%.However, our model indicates that Noble Energy’s earnings streak might come to a halt this time around, as the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. While the company carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter’s total sales volume stands at 361 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), indicating a decline on both yearly and sequential basis. However, estimates for first-quarter total revenues increased 21.54% to $1.2 billion from the same period last year.Lastly, we have independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), slated to release results before the opening bell.  In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.37% on higher refining margin. As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a good history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports.However, this time around, our model does not predict earnings beat for the stock, as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. While Marathon Petroleum’s retail and midstream segment bodes well, a more conservative refining outlook is likely to affect the company’s bottom line. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the refining segment’s bottom line stands at a loss of $112 million. This is also wider than the year-ago operating loss of $70 million.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

270,DVN,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged gains.On the news front, upstream energy biggies Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report) came up with their respective earnings reports, while natural gas operator EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report) announced plans to separate its midstream business into a new publicly traded company.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.3% to close at $63.55 per barrel, while natural gas prices increased 3.9% to $2.657 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Occidental, Williams, Marathon Report Strong Q4)The U.S. oil benchmark scored its second consecutive weekly bump. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise drop.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 35 of the last 46 weeks and are down more than 110 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 420.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18.9% below the year-ago period.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved higher last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The improvement was primarily on account of strength in the commodity’s production amid the upcoming conclusion to the winter heating season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Concho Resources reported strong fourth-quarter results on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. The independent energy explorer came out with net earnings per share of 66 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The bottom line also improved significantly from the prior-year quarter adjusted income of 20 cents per share.Concho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 28% year over year to 211 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (exceeding the high-end of the company’s guidance range), of which 61.6% was liquids. Overall, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company fetched $40.18 per barrel compared with $34.70 a year ago. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Concho Resources has provided a preliminary guidance for 2018. The company expects its total production to grow 16-20%, with crude oil growth about 20%. The upstream player forecasts its output to grow at 20% CAGR over the 2017-2020 timeframe. Capital expenditures for 2018 are estimated to be around $2 billion. (Read more Concho's Q4 Earnings Top on Price, Output Gains)2.    Devon Energy reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents by 36.7%. The underperformance primarily stemmed from an accounting change and lower-than-expected production volumes, partly offset by higher realized prices.In the fourth quarter of 2017, total production touched 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day. The actual production was lower than the expected range of 551,000-571,000 Boe per day. Meanwhile, realized oil prices in the quarter were $42.21 per barrel, up 20.9% from $34.90 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. Realized prices for natural gas were up 11.2% to $2.48 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) from $2.23 per Mcf in the prior-year quarter.Devon estimates total production from its assets in the first quarter of 2018 in the range of 530,000-554,000 Boe per day.

It will form an independent publicly traded company (NewCo), whose operations will focus on the midstream businesses of EQT. The deal is devised to be tax-free for the company's shareholders, who will retain their EQT shares and receive a pro-rata share of the NewCo.The spin-off is expected to enable the company to concentrate on its upstream assets, and exploration and production business. The deal will leave EQT with 680,000 core Marcellus acres and 65,000 Ohio Utica acres.With the shale production to ramp up in the coming quarters, this move can help the company benefit largely through efficient allocation of capital, compared with the previous company set-up that constrained the company's returns in the recent years. Additionally, $2.3-$2.8 billion of free cash flow over the 2019-2023 timeframe is expected to trickle down from the move, which forecasts 10-15% annual production growth. (Read more Will EQT's Spin-Off of Midstream Businesses Prove Beneficial?)4.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 33 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago adjusted loss of 6 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil realizations, and lower cost.The production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 362,251 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (68% liquids), essentially flat from last year. The company aims to grow production by 7-13% in the next year. The average realized crude oil price during the fourth quarter was $58.36 per barrel, representing an increase of 23.1% from the year-ago realization of $47.39.Apache’s fourth quarter lease operating expenses totaled $334 million, down 10.9% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, total costs and expenses fell 16.4% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $1,308 million. (Read more: Apache Posts Q4 Earnings Beat on Oil Price, Cost Cuts)5.    U.S. gas exporter Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter results on robust production volumes and strong pricing. The company’s net income per share came in at 54 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents and the comparable 2016 period profit of 48 cents.During the quarter, the company shipped 70 cargoes from Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana. Total volumes lifted in the reported quarter were 252 trillion British thermal units.Overall costs and expenses soared 190% to $1,305 million from the same quarter last year. The increase is mainly attributed to the higher cost of sales which jumped to $980 million compared with $229 million in the prior-year quarter, while operating and maintenance expenses rose 87.7% year-over-year to $137 million.Cheniere Energy raised its EBITDA guidance for full-year 2018 following the better-than-expected profit. The upbeat forecast reflects higher-than-anticipated realized margins on marketing volumes. The adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $2,000 million and $2,200 million, compared to the prior guidance of anything between $1,900 million and $2,100 million.Meanwhile, distributable cash flow is likely to be between $200 million and $400 million, in line with the previous prediction.

291,DVN,"Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Feb 7.In the preceding period, the Canadian energy giant reported better-than-expected results on pricing and production gains along with reduced expenses.Moreover, the company also displays a good history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. Suncor surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 30.24%.Suncor Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Suncor Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Suncor Energy Inc. Quote Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents for the current-quarter earnings has been revised upward by 11 cents over the last 30 days. It reflects about 106.9% growth from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $6,660 million for the quarter compared with $6,099 million in the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlaySuncor is expected to realize the benefits of higher volumes from its major project Oil Sands operations. Holding one of the largest positions in the oil sands with the potential of greater long-term returns, the company has a competitive edge over its peers. Last month, the company provided fourth-quarter update, wherein it stated that its production volumes at Oil Sands  was 447,000 barrels per day (Bbl/d) including 6,000 Bbl/d from Fort Hills project, reflecting 3.1% rise from the year-ago quarter.However, the company’s production at Syncrude fell to 174,000 Bbl/d in the fourth quarter, which reflects a decline of around 7% amid operational challenges. Further, the company’s international and offshore exploration and production assets’ volumes also reduced to 115,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE/d) as against 118,100 BOE/d a year ago.As such, Suncor’s total upstream production in the quarter came in at 736,000 BOE/d, reflecting a marginal decline from the $738,500 BOE/d recorded in the prior-year quarter.  The production also decreased from third-quarter 2017 level of 739,900 BOE/d.However, the lower volumes are likely to be offset from higher price realizations, driving the company’s overall revenues. Prices of oil at the end of the fourth quarter were $60.46 per barrel, up about 12.5% and 19.6% year-over year and sequentially, respectively. Improving energy landscape is attributed to tightening supplies, brighter demand outlook and OPEC-deal extension talks.Further, the company’s refinery utilization came at 94% versus 93% in fourth-quarter 2016. Also the crude throughput in the quarter was 433,000 Bbl/d as against 427,300 Bbl/d in the year-ago quarter. Refined product demand and distillate sales also grew in the quarter compared to the year-ago period.We believe that that higher commodity prices and better refining and marketing operations year over year will counter the slightly weaker production volumes in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Suncor will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 60 cents.Zacks Rank: Suncor carries a Zacks Rank #2.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Though a Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Suncor, here are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter.TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.32% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 8.NuStar Energy L.P. (NS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +14.29% and a Zacks Rank #3. The partnership is expected to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 8.Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank of 1. The company is expected to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 20.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

293,DVN,"As part of its cost-containment initiatives, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to divest Eagle Ford Shale holdings to a unit of Venado Oil & Gas LLC for $765 million. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is set for completion during the first quarter of 2018.The divested assets will include around 74,500 acres which produced 15,656 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter of 2017. The assets accounted for just 5% of the total year-to-date equivalent production and 4% proved reserves. The company will record a one-time charge of around $270-$280 million on the Eagle Ford sale in the fourth quarter. In a separate transaction, the company also offloaded remaining East Texas properties to an undisclosed buyer.This year, various energy firms including Carrizo Oil and Gas Inc (CRZO  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) and Sanchez Energy Corporation among others have offloaded their non-core assets in Eagle Ford to shore up their financials and focus on promising regions.Amid the industry downturn, Cabot like all other upstream players reduced its spending and adopted various other cost-cut initiatives to improve its financials. Driven by its operational efficiencies, Cabot was able to reduce its year-to-date unit operating costs by around 19% — an impressive achievement amid the low price scenario. The company has managed to generate positive free cash flow for the sixth consecutive quarter and is likely to achieve more of the same in the near-to-medium term.Cash proceeds from this transaction will further strengthen the balance sheet of the company boosting its free cash flow generation. Cabot’s execution success, disciplined capital allocation and improving well economics will further enhance its outlook, driving the shareholder value by share buyback programs and dividend growth.Further, the streamlining of the portfolio is in sync with the company‘s aim to increase its focus on Marcellus shale which generates solid returns. Though The Eagle Ford and Marcellus Shale assets complement each other, of late decline rate of return from the Eagle Ford holdings prompted the company to divest it. Increased focus on the Marcellus shale will enable the company to deliver double-digit growth per debt-adjusted share from the region. In this regard, the company also updated its capex guidance for 2018. It intends to spend around $900-$1,000 million in the next year, with $750-$850 million attributed toward the Marcellus shale.Zacks Rank and Key PickHeadquartered in Houston, TX, Cabot is an independent oil and gas exploration company with producing properties mainly in the continental United States. The company presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

294,DVN,"In a bid to divest its non-core holdings to delever its balance sheet further, upstream oil company, Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (CRZO  -  Free Report) is set to offload a portion of its Eagle Ford portfolio to an undisclosed buyer in an all-cash transaction worth $245 million.The divested assets include around 25,000 acres or nearly a quarter of the land it owns in the Eagle Ford shale play. These assets — located in the not-so promising down-dip area of the volatile oil window — produced approximately 3,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter of 2017. Production from the assets contributed to less than 10% of Carrizo’s total output from the Eagle Ford shale.Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and necessary regulatory approvals, the deal is set for completion by the end of January 2018. Following the closure, Carrizo will hold nearly 78,500 acres in the Eagle Ford play, with majority of the inventory located in the up-dip area of the volatile oil window.The divestment is in line with the company's strategy, announced earlier this year, to sell its non-core assets.  In the past few months, Carrizo has made various non-core divestitures in Marcellus, Utica, DJ Basin and Eagle Ford. These divestments will help the company generate proceeds of $530 million, helping it to improve its leverage metrics. It is to be noted that as of Sep 30, 2017, the company had long-term debt of $1,701 million with debt/capitalization ratio of 81.5%.This year, various energy firms including Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) and Sanchez Energy Corporation (SN  -  Free Report) among others have offloaded their non-core assets in Eagle Ford to shore up their financials and focus on promising regions.Per Carrizo, sale of the non-core assets will enable high-return production growth. Further, the divestiture program of these assets has left Carrizo with core oil and gas resources that include 78,500 net acres in Eagle Ford Shale along with 43,600 net acres in the Delaware Basin. Streamlining of the portfolio is in sync with the company‘s aim to increase its focus on core areas. In this regard, Carrizo acquired Delaware Basin assets for $648 million this year to increase its core position in one of the highest-return plays in North America.Headquartered in Houston, Carrizo is an independent oil and natural gas explorer engaged in exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties, predominantly in the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas and Permian Basin of West Texas.Carrizo’s strong growth profile on the back of its exposure to these highly attractive basins bode well for the company. However, the massive debt burden of the company remains a concern. Further, the share performance of the company has been unimpressive in both absolute and relative terms. Year to date, shares of Carrizo have lost more than 47% compared with the industry’s decline of 22%.  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3(Hold).A better-ranked player in the same industry is Northern Oil and Gas Inc.

295,DVN,"On Nov 14, 2017, we issued an updated research report on Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report). The company is currently focused on making the most of its high-margin production zones and resorting to cost-saving initiatives, in order to boost performance. Additionally, divestment of non-core assets is a key factor.Owning to stellar production from domestic oil plays, the company is well poised to deliver a significant increase in the domestic output in 2018 from 2017 levels. However, the highly competitive nature of the oil and gas industry continues to be a headwind.Devon Energy's third-quarter earnings surpassed estimates by 17.9%, on the back of increased productionand cost-cutting initiatives. The company registered positive earnings surprise in last four quarters, reflecting an average surprise of 13.77%.In the third quarter, the company's lease-operating expenses (LOE) reflected a $10-million sequential decline. Additionally, it resulted in savings of over $1.4 billion in annualized operating and G&A expenses. The company expects cost savings to be sustainable in 2017, owing to higher production rates from the company’s U.S. resource plays and relatively flat LOE costs.Devon Energy’s “2020 Vision” is expected to introduce advance technology to produce higher volumes from wells and generate peer-leading returns on invested capital for shareholders.Devon Energy’s divestments of non-core assets worth $3.2 billion in 2016 and subsequent repayment of debt helped to lower annual interest burden by $120 million. The company has sold $420 million of assets year to date and is on schedule to achieve divestiture target of $1 billion non-core assets in the next 12–18 months.However, operations of oil and gas companies are often disrupted natural calamities and technical hindrances. Devon Energy’s operations in the south Texas Eagle Ford region were dampened due to storm related curtailment in the recent months. The company’s domestic production declined 15,000 barrels per day, of which 65% was oil.The competitive oil and gas industry can act as a hindrance to Devon Energy’s prospects.

Combining the results of the 272 S&P 500 members with the index’s 228 members yet to report, we expect total earnings to be up 5.4% year over year on 5.5% higher revenues.Amid this positive backdrop let us focus on Zacks Oil and Energy Sector this earnings season. Earnings from this sector are expected to be up 148.2% from the same period last year on 19.7% higher revenues.

Oil prices also improved on a year-over-year basis.Few oil and gas companies had to cope with the impact of hurricanes that disrupted operation during the quarter.

299,DVN,"Activist investors are calling for a paradigm shift in compensation methods to leaders in the energy sector. The current model awards shale drillers as per growth in production. This has increased production vastly and hence CEOs' pay has also been excessive.However, the boost in production didn’t help in improving financials. Therefore, investors didn’t gain anything. This fired up investors to demand a change in the pattern of compensating executives. Investors want CEO pays to be linked to returns.Previous Methods V/S New Practice of CompensationPer the earlier norm, the executives received large compensation when they made large investments in new wells. This sparked a new age of shale gas that made the United States a global energy powerhouse and encouraged higher oil and gas drilling. In fact, the current crude output in the country amounts to a robust 9.6 million barrels a day — the highest since July 2015.Per this practice, the 10 biggest U.S. shale producers paid their chief executives $2.2 billion over the past decade despite shareholder returns of 1.7%. These companies include Apache Corp (APA  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corp (DVN  -  Free Report). Both these companies hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On the other hand, the integrated companies like ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and others paid their executives cumulatively a total of $600 million during the same period and achieved a stronger 3.5% return.The performance of the broader oil industry can also be gauged by the returns it has delivered in comparison to the S&P 500 index. The industry’s performance did not reach any closer to the index’s return of 7.4% in the last 10 years. The difference became more prominent this year, with shares of shale producers down over 20% and the index gained about 14%.Companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corp (COG  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) are an exception. These companies have more investor-friendly policies. Even executive compensation is calculated in a manner keeping in mind long-term benefits. Shares for executives are to be vested after three years rather than immediately. These companies also benefited due to their practices as their shares have outperformed peers. Since 2012, EOG Resources’ share price increased 96%.Gradually, other companies have started or are planning to follow suit. One such company having transformed its practice is Range Resources plc (RRC  -  Free Report). The company decided to switch policies after its shares dropped about 70% since 2012, per Reuters analysis.This comparison of prices between companies following different policies is evidence enough to establish the rationality of the more relevant strategy.On the other hand, companies not agreeing to follow suit are facing the heat. EQT Corp (EQT  -  Free Report) is one such company, which is being asked to explain the logic behind the payment of $130 million to its executive. In September, the company has agreed to eliminate that bonus and focus on efficiency and cost, not production.Even as investors get more aware, they are allocating their money to companies that compensate leaders for returns.Change is Not EasyDespite low returns, the companies will continue to increase production as they would need cash flow to pay debt and other expenses. Executives will continue with their old habits till they are paid per the production increase. Shale executives receive higher pay. For example, Noble Energy Inc’s (NBL) executive was paid $10.1 million in 2016, up 40% from 2015. SandRidge Energy Inc CEO was also awarded $18.8 million in the year the company exited bankruptcy protection.Winners & LosersIf the change is implicated, it would put an end to spending on new wells, disturbing a shale boom that has placed U.S. motorists and consumers advantageously. However, it will benefit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers who are aggressively trying to control global crude surplus. Flourishing U.S. shale production has mainly upset OPEC output cuts expected at lifting prices. Consecutively, low oil prices have damaged shareholder returns.ConclusionIf more companies changed policies, production will decline,leading to increase in shareholder returns. These will have widespread impacts on the shale sector as well as international oil markets.If there is a change in the payment structure, shareholders will benefit from higher cash flows and less funds would be directed to drilling. The surplus funds would be distributed in the form of dividends rather than financing new shale wells. This is likely to result in higher share prices and better return on capital. But that would also mean more reserved oil production.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

300,DVN,"Noble Energy (NBL  -  Free Report) updated outlook for the third quarter of 2017 owing to solid production from itsorganic and inorganic assets.Details of the UpdateOn the production side, the total oil volumes for the third quarter have been raised to 126-130 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d), reflecting 4% increase from prior expectation. The company’s natural gas volumes are anticipated have been raised to 965-990 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, while natural gas liquids (NGLs) are expected between 63 and 65 MBbl/d for the quarter.On the sales end, volumes for the third quarter have been raised to range between 352-358 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), reflecting 3% rise from the previous expectation.However, the company has maintained original capital expectation of $625-$725 million for the quarter.Reason for Update?The company updated outlook on the back of several favorable factors. Better-than-expected rise in DJ Basin volumes due to robust performance in Wells Ranch and East Pony have led to an increased oil production. Along with this, its first central gathering facility came online in July andhasbeen connected to the Advantage Pipeline taking crude volumes to Crane County, TX.Robust performance in Eagle Ford due to increase in South Gates Ranch activityas well as inAlba field reflect an overall increase in the company’s production volumes.Factor to Drive Peer PerformanceThe Houston, TX-based company has been engaged in making the most of its well placed organic and inorganic assets. As such it has been gravitating toward expansion techniques for exploring and producing more crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) globally. The company has a diversified basket of short and long-term projects, both onshore and offshore, in domestic and international locations.With robust productions from its existing assets, the company is well poised to benefit and further aid the company to achieve better results. Noble Energy is also currently benefiting from a number of asset divestments that are driving overall production. Consequently,it is important for peers like Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report) and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) to undertake initiatives and strategies that will aid their production volumes further, as Noble Energy.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

303,DVN,"Reflecting the resumption of activities post hurricane Harvey, the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another large build, while product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply. In fact, market players welcomed the faster-than-normal return to normalized operations in South Texas region following the storm’s landfall nearly a month ago.The commodity was also supported by tensions in the Middle East over President Donald Trump's comments on Iran's nuclear deal and talks of an extension to the output cut agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers beyond March next year.Eventually, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.9% (or 93 cents) to settle at $50.41 per barrel Thursday – the highest level since May 24.Energy Stocks GainThe bullish data sets encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – almost 0.7% Wednesday. Some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 yesterday were oil and oil-related companies like Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report), Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) and Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 15, following an increase of 5.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.4 million barrels.Volume ramp-up from the import and production facilities shuttered in the wake of hurricane Harvey led to the big stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer.Despite the substantial climb in oil storage for a third straight week, current supplies – at 472.8 million barrels – are still marginally below the year-ago period. However, stocks are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 703,000 barrels to 59.8 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 29.4 days in the previous week to 30.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.2 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were down for the third week running as Gulf Coast refineries sidelined by Harvey continue to ramp up throughput. The 2.1 million barrels draw – above the polled number of 800,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 216.2 million barrels. Following last week’s slide, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 4% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 5.7 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for one million barrels decrease in supply level. The largest weekly fall since 2011 could be again be attributed to recovering refinery post storm-induced outages. At 138.9 million barrels, current supplies are 15.8% below the year-ago level but are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 5.5% from the prior week to 83.2%. While refinery runs rebounded from the previous week’s nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% - the highest since 2005. With more units returning to activity over the coming weeks, we expect utilization and throughput to continue to rise.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Lonestar Resources US Inc.

304,DVN,"We updated our research report on Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) on Aug 18. This oil and natural gas exploration & production company’s second-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the back of improving cost structure and commodity prices.Devon has been able to generate positive results through cost-cutting initiatives. The steps resulted in savings of more than $1.4 billion in annualized Operating and General and Administrative expenses. The company expects these savings to be sustainable in 2017 owing to higher production rates from the company’s U.S. resource plays and relatively flat Lease Operating Expenses.Devon continues to monetize its non-core assets and use the proceeds to lower its debt levels. Debt reduction in 2016 had lowered its annual forward financing costs by $120 million. The company aims to monetize assets worth $1 billion over the next 12-18 months. Devon has already sold $340 million of assets and achieved one-third of its divestiture target.During 2017, the company plans to invest $1.9-$2.2 billion in Exploration & Production activities. Consistent investments in resource-rich assets are helping it boost total production. Devon now expects 2017 total U.S. daily oil production to improve in the range of 18-23% from the 2016 level. Rapidly expanding higher margin production is expected to drive production level higher in 2018.However, Devon operates in a highly competitive oil and gas industry. Some of the competitors in this industry are financially stronger than it with more resources at their disposal. This might limit Devon’s capacity to apply for new drilling rights or acquire properties.In addition, certain properties in which Devon has a stake are being operated by third parties. As a result, the company has limited control over these operations or the fate of their future development. These limitations as well as Devon’s dependence on the operator and other working interest owners over these properties could result in unexpected future costs and adversely affect its financialsDevon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NBL  -  Free Report) and WPX Energy Inc.

Its focus on higher oil production, cost savings, divestment of non-core assets and systematic investment are likely to drive its operations.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

305,DVN,"We updated our research report on Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) on Aug 17. This oil and natural gas exploration & production company reported a loss in the second quarter, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Despite the company’s disappointing performance in the second quarter, its premium shale properties, including the Delaware and Denver-Julesburg basins, and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico are expected to be the primary production drivers in the future.In addition to domestic assets, Anadarko’s international assets are also yielding positive results. During the second quarter, the company increased sales volume by 25% year over year, driven by oil volumes from the TEN project offshore Ghana. New discovery and existing Columbian assets will boost the performance of the company.Anadarko Petroleum has been systematically selling its non-core properties since 2004. The company exceeded its monetization target of assets worth $4 billion in 2016. It monetized asset worth nearly $3.5 billion in the first half of 2017. The company will utilize the proceeds to repay debts and strengthen its balance sheet.Anadarko operates in a highly competitive oil and gas business space.  Some of its peers like major integrated oil companies, state-owned foreign oil companies and independent producers of oil and natural gas have greater and more diverse resources.Oil and gas companies need to explore and find economic reserves to stay competitive in this space. Increase in dry hole expenses is a cause of concern for the company. Dry hole expenses in the first six months of 2017 were $843 million compared with $6 million in the year-ago period. This will adversely impact the margins of the company.Anadarko Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

306,DVN,"The Q2 earnings season has come to a close for all S&P 500 Oil/Energy companies. The sector contributed the most to year-over-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 index.After thorough research, we can say that the sector is poised to keep churning profits in the coming quarters as well. Hence, it is an ideal time for investors to scoop up more energy stocks.Oil/Energy Outperforms Other SectorsWe have divided the S&P 500 Index into 16 Zacks Sectors. As per the latest Earnings Outlook, among all the sectors, Oil/Energy has witnessed the highest year-over-year earnings growth. The Oil/Energy companies have recorded 252.7% earnings growth on the back of 16.8% revenue rise. The other sectors significantly lag Oil/Energy. Most importantly, the Energy sector alone is responsible for 2.3% year-over-year earnings improvement during second-quarter 2017 for the S&P 500 Index.What Drove Energy in Q2?The oil and gas pricing scenario in second-quarter 2017 was substantially better than the year-ago period.Hopes of OPEC’s production cut deal extension was the prime factor driving the year-over-year hike in prices during April and almost the entire of May. Market anticipations proved somewhat correct as OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018 in the Vienna meeting.Natural gas also made a modest recovery in Q2 after the commodity hit its lowest annual average price in 2016 in almost 20 years.  Energy Will Continue to Generate More ProfitDuring second quarter of this year, Oil/Energy sector has recorded profits as high as $8.1 billion, which surged from $2.3 billion from the April-to-June quarter of 2016. We are also expecting the sector to earn profits of $9.2 billion, $9.8 billion, $11.8 billion and $13 billion during 3Q17, 4Q17, 1Q18 and 2Q18, respectively.Also, for full-year 2017, Energy sector will witness earnings of $36.1 billion, which is considerably higher than $9.6 billion during 2016. The upward trend will likely follow in the coming years as reflected that the Energy sector will generate profit of $49.1 billion and $59.3 billion during 2018 and 2019 respectively.Major shale players in the U.S. – that include Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) – have been focusing on lowering capital spending for exploration activities following persistently weak oil and gas prices as compared to mid-2014 level. With lower investment from the U.S. shale companies and constant efforts by the OPEC players to combat low oil, the crude glut problem will likely get resolved in the near future.Time to Buy Oil/ Energy StocksThe expectation of improved oil prices is favorable for energy companies. The exploration and production firms will be able to sell the commodities at higher prices in the near future that will again push them to restart producing more crude and natural gas. With higher exploration and production activities, there will be more demand for oil field services companies to efficiently set up oil and gas wells.Also, increased output level could increase the demand for midstream energy infrastructure assets like pipelines and storage facilities for transporting and storing the commodities.Our ChoicesPicking the prospective energy stocks from the stock universe can be a daunting task. To simplify the task, we have selected stocks using our proprietary stock screener.We have picked stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Moreover, all these stocks have beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter.Based in Fort Worth, TX, Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and gas company, engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties primarily in the southwestern, Appalachian and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S.The stock’s diversified asset portfolio is spread between low-risk/long reserve-life Appalachian assets and large-volume/rapid-payout Gulf Coast properties.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and posted a positive earnings surprise of 250.00% for the second quarter. Also, for 2017 and 2018, we are expecting year-over-year earnings growth of 117.7% and 89%, respectively, for Range Resources.

Further, total revenue jumped 199.3% from $138 million in the year-ago quarter.  The year-over-year increase in total revenue was due to higher realized average prices and production volumes.Oil and NGL sales of $249 million accounted for 86% of the company’s second-quarter total product revenues of $289 million.WPX Energy, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  WPX Energy, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | WPX Energy, Inc.

The company also has 185,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas hedged at a weighted average price of $2.98 per MMBtu.Financial Update WPX Energy had $8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with $496 million at the end of 2016. Long-term debt as of Jun 30, 2017 was $2,601 million, up marginally from 2016 end levels of $2,575 million. Net cash from operating activities in the first half of 2017 was $142 million compared with $89 million in the same period a year ago. Capital expenditure in the first half was $542 million compared with $291 million in the year-ago period. GuidanceWPX Energy has raised its capital budget of 2017 to $990–$1070 million from $905–$985 million. More than half of the capital is targeted for development in the Delaware Basin.The company raised its 2017 total production to 105–116 thousand barrel of oil equivalents per day (MBoe/d) from 103–113 MBoe/d.  Moreover, it raised its 2017 oil production to 57–60 thousand barrels per day (Mbbl/d) from 52–56 Mbbl/d. The company raised its 2017 oil volumes growth expectation to 40% from 30% from 2016 levels.Our ViewWPX Energy's second-quarter performance was better than expected due to strong production from its oil assets and recovery in the commodity prices from the year-ago level. However, a sequential drop in the realized prices of the commodities was noticed, reflecting the ongoing uncertainty in the oil and energy markets.The company continues to work on its strategy of increasing oil production, which is evident from the rising liquid mix in total production. Production from the Delaware Basin increased substantially during the second quarter with the help of assets the company acquired during the first quarter.We believe WPX Energy's exposure in the Delaware, Williston and San Juan basins will enable it to achieve its new goal of 40% higher oil generation in 2017 from 2016 levels.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

310,DVN,"We are in the thick of the Q2 earnings season, with results from 286 S&P 500 companies that account for almost 68.8% of the index’s total membership. According to the latest Earnings Trend, overall earnings for these companies are up 11.3% from the year-ago comparable period on 6.1% higher revenues. While 74.5% companies delivered positive earnings surprises, 69.2% beat revenue estimates.The overall financial performance so far this earnings cycle reflects optimism. True to predictions, the sector has witnessed positive growth. The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming earnings season. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared with the second quarter of 2016, wherein energy companies reported unusually low bottom-line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 249%, the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors, the top line is likely to display a growth of 16.5% from the second quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Aug 1Let’s see what’s in store for these three energy companies that are expected to report Q2 results on Aug 1.  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), one of the leading upstream energy players, is expected to report financial results, after market closes.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of 15 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a loss of 83 cents.Our model does not indicate that EOG Resources is likely to beat on earnings. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat on earnings.EOG Resources currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% Earnings ESP complicates our surprise prediction. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.   As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. EOG Resources, Inc.
