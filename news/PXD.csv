2,PXD,"EOG Resources (EOG) weathered a massive oil price drop a few years ago thanks to smart investments across multiple basins, first-mover advantage and loads of data.Now, the shale exploration and production company is one of the top performers in its sector as oil prices rebound.Ninety percent of EOG's production comes from its U.S. shale operations. But EOG has spread its resources throughout the Bakken Shale basin in the north-central U.S. and southern Canada, as well as the Eagle Ford and Permian basins in the Texas and New Mexico area. That diversity has been one key to EOG's success.""They have attractive portions across multiple basins,"" said Brian Youngberg, analyst at Edward Jones. ""Some of the other premier players, like Pioneer Natural (PXD), are more focused geographically. But EOG has a handful of positions they got into early, at a low cost.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEOG produced the equivalent of 609,000 barrels of oil a day last year on average for a total of 222 million barrels. It has an estimated 2.527 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved reserves. EOG grew in both categories during 2017 after a downturn the previous two years.The company is part of IBD's Oil & Gas-U. S. Exploration and Production group, which also features top names like Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE). The company has a 95 Composite Rating from IBD. That means it is outperforming 95% of all stocks in key fundamental and technical criteria.A recent IBD Stock of the Day, EOG is building a base on base with a 128.13 buy point.Managing data is key for tech companies in Silicon Valley to take advantage of trends. EOG brought the power of data to the shale fields, earning it the nickname the ""Apple of Oil"" by analysts.Dave Meats, a senior analyst at Morningstar, says EOG's larger size gives it access to more data than smaller players in the space. EOG has access to its own data on previously drilled wells. It also has data on wells drilled by other companies where it has a small stake.EOG used analytical data from thousands of wells. They find everything from the optimal length to drill during each fracking stage, to which rock type is more productive.""The company does have a technical edge,"" Meats said. ""Not so much (in that) it can do things other companies can't, but that it can lead the way in achieving technical benefits before some of its peers.""Last year, EOG said it had developed 20 mobile apps of its own over two years that allow workers to stay connected day and night. It also has collected data from 5,000 horizontal wells in almost every major unconventional play in the U.S.Further, proprietary data is helping the company cut costs. Meats said the company isn't reliant on expensive analytics packages from Schlumberger (SLB) and other service providers.On top of that, data helped EOG take advantage of being one of the first movers into newer, fringe areas in a potential shale play. It analyzed the success and failure of other wells in the area.""They were kind of early on the Eagle Ford and Bakken,"" Youngberg said. ""They just saw things years ago under the leadership they had and were able to build big positions.""With acreage in some of the most prolific basins in the U.S., the company's broad geographic offerings give it the ability to be more flexible with spending if issues arise.""Some companies are very nimble like EOG. They will move capital here or there a little bit if it makes sense to,"" Youngberg said.Companies that shifted their assets to exclusively focus on the Permian now see production backing up, bottlenecked by limited pipeline capacity that likely will remain constrained through 2019. But both Youngberg and Meats don't expect the Permian bottleneck to affect EOG.When times are tough, company management isn't afraid to make the tough call to put the brakes on spending, analysts say.""They pulled back spending more than others did at a time when oil prices fell back,"" Youngberg said. ""They are willing to go defense when they have to, when oil falls, then switch back into offense pretty quickly.""Unlike its peers, EOG reduced production during the downturn three years ago, when other companies tried to keep production flat or grow slightly.Over the past year, Wall Street's appetite for increases in production at all costs has slowed. Now investors are looking for companies to focus on returning cash to shareholders rather than drilling to keep production up.In its first-quarter report, the company reiterated its 2018 oil production growth target of 16%-20%. It also backed its forecast for a full-year exploration-and-development budget of $5.4 billion-$5.8 billion, after raising it by $1 billion the previous quarter.The company plans to increase its dividend growth rate. And it has small overseas operations in Canada, China, the U.K., Trinidad and Tobago. But EOG is unlikely to commit a lot of capital to any mergers or acquisitions. Instead, management is focused on boosting organic operations.EOG's second-quarter earnings are seen soaring 1,400% to $1.20 per share, up from eight cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen rising 45.8% to $3.79 billion.The company isn't immune to all headwinds, however. Meats says he's bearish on long-term oil prices despite supply constraints out of Libya, Venezuela and Iran currently boosting crude futures.He only expects a supply crunch in the short term and believes oil prices will stay around $55 per barrel in the long term.""EOG is a high-quality company with good asset quality,"" Meats said. ""But I think like every other shale company, the potential for lower oil prices weighs on validation.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry NewsWhy The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under Water

4,PXD,"When Occidental Petroleum (OXY) packed up its Los Angeles, Calif., headquarters and shipped out to Houston in 2014, few investors had heard of the Permian Basin. At the time, Occidental was the largest oil producer in Texas. It was the largest producer of natural gas in California.By 2017, the almost century-old company was the third-largest oil play in Texas. That put it just behind EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). It is also among the largest holders of acreage and producers of oil in the Permian Basin. That is the west Texas redoubt that Bloomberg has said is on track to ""become the world's largest oil patch over the next decade.""Occidental shares slipped 2.4% in weak trade Monday, edging just below the stock's 50-day moving average. The move technically put the stock back into a buy range above a 78.18 buy point in a cup base. Investors probably don't want to enter a stock that high in the buy range. But a rebound off the 50-day line could produce a follow-on buying opportunity.Many Permian producers face a musical chairs-type shake out, as production outpaces the available capacity of pipelines to transport the oil to market. But Occidental owns its own gathering systems within the basin, the pipelines that take oil and gas from the wellhead to larger pipelines or to separation facilities.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlso, Occidental has locked down contracts giving them capacity of 470,000 barrels per day out of the Permian, according to a CNBC interview with chief executive Vicki Hollub in May. At that time, that was roughly double the company's output within the basin, she said.In mid-June, capacity bottlenecks trimmed prices for oil coming out of the Permian to about $10 below West Texas Intermediate crude priced at Cushing, Okla., the transaction location for the WTI benchmark. The International Energy Agency believes take-away capacity from the Permian fields will ""become insufficient by midyear, with a deficit possibly reaching as much as 290,000 barrels a day during the first half of 2019.""In addition, Occidental is expanding the loading capacity of its Ingleside oil export terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas. It is adding loading arms and dredging the terminal to a depth of 66 feet, allowing it to load VLCC tankers — the largest class of oil tanker afloat — with oil headed for markets in Europe and Asia. Crude exports out of Corpus Christi are expected to reach 1 million barrels per day by 2020.In 2013, just before its move to Texas, Occidental began exiting locations in the Bakken shale of Montana and North Dakota. It spun off its operations in California, and divested four international operations. As a result, production decreased 40% — just as the global oil glut was swinging into gear. Earnings per share dropped by 98%, to 12 cents, in 2015, followed by a $1-per-share loss the following year.Earnings recovered to 89 cents per share last year. They are projected to rebound to $4.61 for 2018, with a 673% jump projected by the consensus estimate for the second quarter.Occidental operates in three segments: oil and gas, chemicals and midstream and marketing. In 2017, the oil and gas unit produced about 63% of revenue. Chemicals were another 35%. The oil unit generated 55% of total earnings. Chemicals were 41%.The strength of diversification was apparent in the segment numbers. For 2017, Occidental's operations outside the U.S. accounted for more than 100% of profit, because domestic operations and oil exploration efforts both lost money.An increasing number of analysts are questioning how much longer the Permian basin can continue to increase its total output, and at what point the Permian's localized glut might began to spread.Hollub said she expects additional pipeline capacity will be built, easing the take-away restrictions. More crucial, she told CNBC, are labor shortages plaguing the industry.She said companies attempting to ramp activity much above current levels are in for a struggle, and face rising costs.""We're really at the activity level we want to be,"" she said, pointing to Occidental's current output from the field. ""If you are a company that is not trying to ramp up significantly, you have a significant advantage.""Occidental has delivered uninterrupted quarterly dividends since 1975, with annual increases each year since 2002. The current annual rate is $3.08 per share, which yields about 3.7% on an annualized basis.RELATED: Dow Giant Triggers Sell Signal As China Trade War Boosts RivalIBD Stock Of The Day: This China Internet Gives Back All Its GainsPermian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersTop Shale Oil Names See Profits Soar As Crude Passes $70Divergence In The Stock Market Is A Worrisome Sign

On Monday, Plains All American Pipeline (PAA) CEO Greg Armstrong said the company has $1.5 billion in projects that use a lot of steel that could be impacted by the tariffs.And chemical giant DowDuPont (DWDP) told Bloomberg that it's considering a major investment in Canada or Argentina instead of the U.S. Gulf Coast because steel tariffs would make domestic construction more costly. Exxon Mobil (XOM), however, said Wednesday it plans to invest $20 billion in Gulf Coast refining projects.Perry, who touted the Trump administration's efforts to ease oil and gas regulations in his opening remarks, later told the press that he thinks the tariffs are an ongoing debate.""I'm not going to speak for the president today, but not sure he's made up his mind with clarity about where he wants to go with this,"" he said.Perry said Trump wants to send a signal to countries that use subsidies that hit U.S. manufacturing jobs, adding that he agrees with Trump that ""we need to be better negotiators, look for better deals for the United States.""DowDuPont shares slipped 1.5% on the stock market today and Exxon sank 3.2% amid a broad market sell-off.

8,PXD,"HOUSTON —  Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) CEO Timothy Dove said the success of the Permian Basin is a unique phenomenon that can't be replicated anywhere else.X Pioneer has been involved in the Barnett and Eagle Ford plays in Texas, but the Permian, with its 90,000 square miles and deep shale reservoirs, is ""demonstratively"" different from any other play in the U.S.While the industry debates whether U.S. shale's success can be exported to other potential shale plays around the world, like Argentina's Vaca Muerta formation, Dove thinks the success of the Permian and shale in general are distinctly American.""There are a lot of areas around the world that would love to have the opportunity to develop a shale basin but they don't have the infrastructure, land ownership opportunities, and service companies allowing them to do so,"" Dove said Tuesday at CERAWeek 2018, a top gathering of energy industry and policy leaders. ""We have the golden goose right before us.""Dove continued, saying the Permian is in the ""imagination of everyone in the oil business, including OPEC.""During a dinner meeting with OPEC and shale executives that he attended Monday night, Dove said OPEC believes shale has an important role to play in meeting new demand growth.But he also warned that President Trump's proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would have a ""negative impact"" on Pioneer's returns.Pioneer shares closed down 1% at 169.96 on the stock market today.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

21,PXD,"Energy ministers from around the world and executives from Schlumberger (SLB), BP (BP), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and others will be attending CERAWeek by IHS Markit in Houston March 5 to 9.X The industry's top players face a changing landscape, with the U.S. poised to become the world's top oil producer, perhaps as soon as this year, electric vehicle technology threatening demand, and OPEC looking to wind down its effort to prop up crude prices.Here are five things to watch:Last year, OPEC and non-OPEC members like Russia agreed to extend their production deal to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the global markets until the end of 2018.Compliance with the deal is at record highs, but Russia has been pushing for an exit strategy from the agreement likely to be decided at the next OPEC meeting this summer.Still, analysts believe that a longer-term deal could be in the works for the two to keep a hold of a majority of the oil market in the face of rising U.S. production.While U.S. shale producers and OPEC are largely seen as rivals on global energy markets, OPEC is looking at forging relationships in the U.S., with OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo scheduled to speak Monday at a dinner Monday night with top shale executives, as he did last year.The role of the shale sector on the world stage is also in question. While Saudi Arabia has stepped back from its traditional role as swing producer, it's not clear that shale can step in to take over.U.S. producers face their own limitations, said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, such as an inability to work collectively, steep output decline rates of shale wells, and labor shortages.Some U.S. firms recently have taken a measured tone on future drilling activity. EOG Resources (EOG) said that it will take drilling slowly, and Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it wasn't a ""drill, baby, drill"" company, while Parsley Energy (PE) said it was expecting a ""steady activity pace.""The industry is divided about future oil supplies and demand. BP projected a drop in oil demand by 2040, but its U.S. rival Exxon Mobil (XOM) and OPEC don't agree, Flynn said.""It's going to be interesting to see all these energy minds and find out where they come in on which side of the equation. This is the biggest question facing the oil in some time.""Flynn said BP is making assumptions that there will be some breakthroughs in electric car battery technology, infrastructure and other improvements.

Instead, it will probably take about a decade for AI's use to be fully optimized, Ozden predicted.But he agrees with ConocoPhillips (COP) Chief Technology Officer Gregory Leveille that there will be autonomous drilling en masse before autonomous cars are on the roads en masse.""I believe so because of the complexity of having a car in a metropolitan environment with a number of moving things around it,"" Ozden said.

27,PXD,"Workday (WDAY), Halliburton (HAL), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and RSP Permian (RSPP) just finished handles to their cup bases. And they are all first-stage bases. Halliburton blasted past its buy point Monday, while Workday edged past its entry point in low volume.X First- and second-stage bases are more likely to succeed and rise sharply than late-stage bases. Mutual funds and other big institutions are more apt to want to add to holdings for stocks in early-stage bases, while cashing in profits on late-stage bases after a long run.With the S&P 500 index rising for 14 of the last 15 months — the S&P 500's sole loss a drop of less than one point in March 2017 — many recent breakouts have tended to be third-, fourth-, fifth- or even sixth-stage bases.So investors should take a look when first-stage bases like Workday develop. Halliburton, Pioneer Natural Resources and RSP Permian are all oil plays coming out of long consolidations, with Halliburton reporting strong earnings Monday morning. One note of caution: The relative strength line — which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index — is not in great shape for any of these stocks. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.)Workday's cup-with-handle base started in late November. The stock sold off sharply at the end of that month and early December, especially after the software maker reported earnings that easily beat views, but had details that disappointed investors. Shares began recovering but didn't retake their 50-day line until Jan. 4. With its new handle, Workday is now less than 1% below a 114.98 buy point.Workday's RS line is well off its late November peak, and really hasn't made much progress since early June.Workday rose 1% to 115.30 on the stock market today, moving past the buy point. But trading volume was well below normal, while the relatively small price move means that the RS line was unable to rise above even the very short-term peak around the handle.IBD'S TAKE: So early-stage bases are preferable. Learn more about how to count bases to profit in long, bull markets.Halliburton is in a cup-with-handle base going all the way back to January 2017. The buy point is 53.79.Oil companies struggled in 2017, especially oilfield services firms like Halliburton that saw their customers slashing spending. But with crude prices at a three-year high, the energy sector has rebounded.Halliburton earnings topped Q4 views early Monday. Shares  surged 6.4% to 56.40 on the stock market today, blasting above that 53.79 entry into buy range in heavy volume.That follows rival Schlumberger (SLB), which topped earnings views Friday and predicted rising industry spending this year. Schlumberger cleared its own cup-with-handle base on Monday, soaring 4.4%.Thanks to the strong price move, Halliburton's RS line moved above its recent handle peak in a breakout. The RS line is at a multi-month high, but well off its January 2017 peak.Pioneer Natural Resources has an 11-month cup-with-handle base with a 187.64 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 183.17. A breakout could see the RS line clear short- or mid-term highs, providing some confirmation.Pioneer Natural Resources advanced 1.7% to 186.30 on Monday, closing in on that entry.RSP Permian's base goes back a year with a 42.85 entry. The stock ended last week at 41.32.RSP Permian shares jumped 3.5% to 42.76 on Monday, closing at session highs and just pennies below the entry point.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: These 11 Stocks Could Break Out SoonWhy These 3 Winners Are Triggering This Sell Signal, But Not These TwoIs This Hot Chip Name Ready To Break Out From Early-Stage Base?Bullish Chart Patterns: Do You Know The Basics Of A Cup With Handle?Why This Government Shutdown May Hurt Economy, Stocks More Than UsualIf General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE Stock?

31,PXD,"EOG Resources (EOG) easily beat quarterly estimates late Thursday and announced two new oil plays that together could hold 750 million barrels of oil equivalent.XEstimates: Per-share profit of 10 cents, swinging from a loss of 40 cents per share a year ago. Revenue is expected to climb 22% to $2.58 billion.Results: EPS of 19 cents on revenue of $2.64 billion. Crude oil production grew 16% to 327,900 barrels of oil per day, though Hurricane Harvey impacted volumes by 15,000 bopd.Outlook: EOG expects to complete 505 net wells in 2017, up from a prior outlook of 480 net wells and is  targeting 20% U.S. crude oil growth. The company also expects to fund capital expenditures and its dividend with discretionary cash flow.The company expanded its premium locations the Delaware Basin's First Bone Spring play in New Mexico and the Woodford Oil Window in Oklahoma's SCOOP play. EOG considers premium inventory wells that have a minimum 30% rate of return at $40 per barrel oil prices.EOG estimates the First Bone Spring play has 540 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) net resource potential and 540 remaining net premium wells. The Woodford Oil Window play has an estimated 210 million BOE net resource potential and 260 net premium wells.So far this year, EOG has added 2,000 net premium locations, which is four times the number of wells the company expects to complete in 2017.""We have amassed an enormous, high-quality portfolio of assets by capturing sweet-spot acreage in the best oil plays in the U.S.,"" Chairman and CEO Bill Thomas in a statement. ""Combined with our consistent operational proficiency and innovative technology, this gives us great confidence in the long-term sustainability of our unique premium growth and high-return model.""Devon Energy (DVN) was also active in the Bone Spring play during Q3, and Concho Resources (CXO) has acreage there too. Continental Resources (CLR), who is scheduled to report Q3 results Tuesday, has Woodford Oil Window assets as well.Stock: EOG rallied 1% late. Shares closed 0.65% higher at 102.95 on the stock market today, still in a buy zone after clearing a 98.47 buy point on Friday. But if the after-hours gain carries over to regular trading Friday, the stock will be extended above the buy range.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.EOG earned the nickname the ""Apple of oil"" for its for reputation as a leading technological innovator, allowing it to weather historically low oil prices by finding ways to pump more cheaply.The company has its own proprietary smartphone apps that allow employees to make real-time decisions on the use of different bits and other drilling techniques while out in the field.Earlier Thursday, Apache (APA) reported Q3 EPS of 4 cents on revenue of $1.58 million. Analysts expected EPS of 5 cents and revenue of $1.42 billion.Several shale companies have already reported this week, including Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Laredo Petroleum (LPI), Concho Resources, Devon Energy and Anadarko Petroleum (APC).In general, they have been focused on cash-flow discipline instead of boosting production, though Pioneer and Laredo increased their capital spending forecasts for this year.RELATED:Pioneer Natural Resources Crushes Earnings Views; Laredo Q3 MixedShale Earnings: Concho Resources, Devon Energy Beat, Anadarko Misses

Production rose 6% to 276,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which includes a 10% increase in oil production to 162,000 barrels a day.The company sees Q4 production of 292,000-302,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and boosted its 2017 capital budget forecast to $2.75 billion from a prior view of $2.7 billion.Over the summer, Pioneer lowed its outlook of how many higher-value oil barrels it would produce in 2017. But at the Oil & Money conference last month, Pioneer said it plans to quadruple production over the next decade thanks to increasing output from Texas.On Wednesday, Pioneer said this 10-year production plan would help keep its spending within cash flow by 2020 at an oil price of $50 per barrel.Laredo Petroleum (LPI) earned 13 cents a share, missing Zacks views by a penny, as revenue jumped 29% to $205.8 million, easily beating views for $183 million. Production increased 17% to 60,011 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and management sees Q4 production ramping up to 61,000-64,000.Laredo increased its 2017 capital budget to $630 million from the previously anticipated $530 million, due to service cost inflation, additional completion optimization testing and data collection.""The efficiencies driven by these investments, coupled with a disciplined capital program, are expected to result in a double-digit oil production growth rate over the next two years, while operating within cash flow by the end of 2019 and enhancing the Company's return on average capital employed,"" said Chairman and CEO Randy Foutch in a statement.Earlier Wednesday, oil prices reversed lower after government data showed U.S. production surged to near-record highs.The Energy Information Administration said domestic production rose to 9.55 million barrels per day (bpd) last week from 9.5 million in the previous week, closing in on the record high of 9.61 million bpd reached in June 2015. Crude stockpiles fell by 2.4 million barrels from the prior week. Gasoline inventories decreased by 4 million barrels. Analysts were expecting a 1.8 million-barrel decline in crude and 1.5 million-barrel drop in gasoline.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said stockpiles fell by 5.1 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 27, with gasoline stockpiles down by 7.7 million barrels.U.S. crude settled down 0.2% at $54.30 a barrel, and Brent dropped 0.7% to $60.49, after both rose more than 1% earlier.Shares of Pioneer dipped 0.6% in late trading, after closing 2.9% higher at 153.97 on the stock market today. Laredo finished up 2.2% at 12.18.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Prices had some upward momentum earlier in the day on a Reuters survey that showed OPEC production fell by 80,000 barrels per day to 32.78 million, led by a drop in output from the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.The oil group's compliance with a deal to remove 1.8 million barrels of production from global markets was at 92%, up from 86% in September. The rising compliance seems to indicate that OPEC and Russia will support extending the output deal when they meet on Nov. 30.Nigerian output fell by 70,000 bpd last month, according to the survey, while Libya increased production by 70,000 bpd. Both are exempt from the current output deal.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalExxon To Boost Spending, Add Rigs To Permian; Chevron Cuts Capex ViewShale Earnings: Concho Resources, Devon Energy Beat, Anadarko Misses

33,PXD,"For the past two years, shale exploration and production companies have focused on growing the flow of oil, but now the focus may be shifting toward the flow of cash.XConcho Resources (CXO), Apache (APA), EOG Resources (EOG) and a slew of other U.S. shale producers report third-quarter results this week. While U.S. crude prices have climbed to $54 a barrel they have struggled to stay above $50 ever since prices collapsed in 2014, and producers' spending vs. cash flow will likely be a key metric for investors.The outlook for capital expenditures is dimming, as companies focus more on financial returns and operating within their cash flows vs. expanding production, oilfield service provider Schlumberger (SLB) said earlier this month.""In North America land (operations) where companies added capex, production growth is falling short of expectations,"" CEO Paul Kibsgaard said on the earnings call with analysts. ""This has led to moderating investment appetite.""Early reports from shale companies echoed this sense of caution. On Friday, Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) reported Q3 results that fell short of Wall Street estimates and reaffirmed its total 2017 program spending forecast of $845 million.""We remain committed to delivering positive free cash flow in 2017 and beyond, while continuing to focus on improving our corporate returns and increasing our return of capital to shareholders through prudent capital allocation,"" Chairman and CEO Dan Dinges said in a statement.Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said he will be looking for a focus on wellhead profitability in the shale earnings reports and expects companies to be less aggressive about production.""Before it was a rush to raise production now it's a rush to produce profitability,"" he said. ""It could be positive if companies said they were going pull back and focus on cash.""Among U.S. oil giants, however, the spending picture is mixed. Chevron (CVX)  said Friday it would spend less money than expected this year, while Exxon Mobil (XOM) said it would spend more next year to increase drilling in U.S. shale plays. That could be a reflection of the uncertainty that continues to permeate oil markets, which increasingly look to the U.S. oil patch as the swing producer.""I think there's still one more big surge coming from U.S., which will knock prices down,"" Ian Taylor, CEO of Vitol Group, said at the Oil & Money conference in London last month.He expects Brent crude to fall to $45 per barrel in 2018 as U.S. shale production increases vs. $60 today.Shares of EOG Resources, a bellwether of the industry that is known as the ""Apple (AAPL) of oil"" for its tech advances, were up 1.1% at 99.53 on the stock market today, climbing further into buying range after breaking out from a 98.47 cup-with-handle base on Friday.U.S. crude futures closed up 0.5% to $54.15 a barrel on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report.

Revenue is seen rising 23% to $2.32 billion. Last month, Anadarko announced a $2.5 billion share buyback plan.Devon's EPS is expected to soar 333% to 39 cents from 9 cents a year ago but revenue is expected to fall 25% to $3.16 billion.Laredo Petroleum (LPI) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) are scheduled to report Wednesday. Analysts expect Laredo's EPS to rise 8.3% to 13 cents with revenue up 14.4% to $183 million.Pioneer's EPS is seen jumping 123% to 29 cents as revenue climbs 8.3%b to $1.3 billion.In Q2, Pioneer lowed its outlook of how many higher-value oil barrels it would produce in 2017. But at the Oil & Money conference, Pioneer said it plans to quadruple production over the next decade thanks to increasing output from Texas.CEO Timothy Dove said that the company's break even is $20 per barrel, giving it more room to expand and more cushion if oil prices fall.Apache and EOG Resources are due Thursday.Analysts see Apache reporting a loss of 2 cents per share vs. a 3-cents-per-share loss in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is expected to dip 2.1% to $1.41 billion.EOG is seen swinging to a profit of 10 cents per share vs. a loss of 40 cents per share a year ago.

34,PXD,"Thanks to the shale boom, the U.S. is set to boost oil and gas production to unprecedented levels by 2025, but OPEC will take back market power longer term, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday.XThe Paris-based energy watchdog estimated in its annual World Energy Outlook report that domestic output would jump 25% — to 30 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 24 million currently. The U.S. had already topped Russia in 2011 to be the world's No. 1 oil and gas producer, but the IEA's forecast would put the U.S. head and shoulders ahead of any rivals.""A remarkable ability to unlock new resources cost-effectively pushes combined United States oil and gas output to a level 50% higher than any other country has ever managed,"" according to the report.Oil prices fell Tuesday, after the IEA cut its 2017 and 2018 oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day, in the agency's monthly report. Brent fell 1.5% to $62.21 per barrel. U.S. crude was off 1.9% to $55.70.Shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) were down 0.8% on the stock market today, Chevron (CVX) lost 0.3%, BP (BP) eased by 0.7%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) dipped 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Thanks to advances by shale producers like EOG Resources (EOG), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Continental Resources (CLR) and Diamondback Energy (FANG), U.S. shale oil production is expected to grow by 8 million barrels per day from 2010 to 2025, exceeding the growth that Saudi Arabia saw from the 1960s to the 1980s.The IEA estimates that this boom will account for 80% of the growth in the world's oil supply by 2025 and will allow the U.S. to become a net oil exporter by the late 2020s.U.S. shale exploration and production companies weathered a global, two-year industry glut by tightening belts, cutting costs and adopting novel technological advances aimed at increasing production and lowering break-even costs.But shale production should start to decline starting in the middle of next decade, the IEA added, as a slower pace of investment weighs on longer-term output. That should let OPEC boost its market share to 46% by 2040 from about 43% today.Still, there are many other factors at play over the long term. The IEA noted the U.S. shale sector's history of beating expectations; the shift to electric vehicles putting downward pressure on oil demand; and changes in estimates of recoverable shale reserves.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

Apple advanced 4.6%, but closed below a buy point after clearing it on Wednesday. Apple chipmakers struggled.RELATED:This Is Why Apple Is Bullish On Q4 Sales (It's Not The iPhone 8)Tesla (TSLA) reported a smaller-than-expected adjusted loss, while second-quarter revenue more than doubled from the year-ago quarter to reaching $2.79 billion. Tesla received several price-target hikes following its quarterly earnings report that beat views, though analysts expressed concern about the electric car company's ability to execute on its ambitious production schedule for the new Model 3. Analysts also are concerned about Tesla's cash burn. But the stock rose 6.55%, clearing its 50-day moving average.Here's What Analysts Like And Don't Like About Tesla EarningsBefore Ordering A Tesla Model 3 Or Chevy Bolt, Look At This ChartApplied Optoelectronics sees weak revenue for the current quarter, shocker given that the optical stock had raised or beaten guidance several times this year. It cited some slower demand from a large customer, which could be Amazon. Applied Opto, the No. 1 stock in the No. 1-rated Telecom-Fiber Optics group, crashed 34% Friday. Acacia Communications (ACIA) and Infinera (INFN) also had bad news late Thursday. Earlier in the week, Macom Technology Solutions Holdings (MTSI), an optical-related chipmaker, sees weak China demand. However, Oclaro (OCLR) reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter profit and revenue and sees strong demand in the current fiscal year. But Oclaro shares still plunged for the week.RELATED:Applied Optoelectronics Plunges On Weak Guidance; Opticals HitJuly was a rout for U.S. auto sales, marking the biggest monthly decline since August 2010. General Motors (GM) saw sales plunge 15% vs. the expected 9% to 11%. Ford Motor (F) sales declined nearly 8% vs. an expected 5% to 6%. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) sales declined 11% vs. an expected 7%. Industrywide U.S. auto sales rang in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.77 million in July, Autodata reported, marking the third straight month below 17 million. The auto giants pointed to planned fleet sales cutbacks, but their retail sales also retreated. Toyota (TM) saw U.S. sales unexpectedly rise, while Japanese peers Nissan (NSANY) and Honda (HMC) had smaller-than-expected declines.RELATED:U.S. Auto Sales Tumble 7%, Worst Drop In Nearly 7 YearsThe U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, slightly more than expected. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3% while average hourly wages rose a solid 0.3%. The report is more evidence of tighter labor markets, though it likely won't shift the Federal Reserve's policy path in the near future. Meanwhile, ISM surveys signaled still-strong manufacturing growth while some decelerating growth in the service sector.Grubhub (GRUB) and Yelp (Yelp) both topped second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late Thursday. As part of a long-term partnership, Grubhub will pay $287.5 million in cash to acquire Yelp's online food ordering and delivery business, Eat24. The partnership comes as Amazon (AMZN) is getting more aggressive in the food delivery market. Grubhub rose 9.2% on Friday while Yelp shot up nearly 28%.Symantec (SYMC), Qualys (QYLS) and FireEye (FEYE) reported better-than-expected June-quarter results, following computer security peer Proofpoint (PFPT) last week.

FireEye narrowed its Q2 loss to just 4 cents a share as revenue grew 6% to $185.5 million, amid strong demand for its new Helix security platform. Shares fell 6%.Video game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) reported better-than-expected June-quarter results, while mobile and online games publisher Zynga (ZNGA) delivered a mixed report. Activision climbed 4% through Thursday to fresh highs, but retreated 3.1% Friday on its mixed guidance. Take-Two spiked 9.5%, breaking out past a buy point to its own high. Zynga was little changed, in a consolidation at 3-year highs.RELATED:Activision Blizzard Beats Second-Quarter Views, Offers Mixed OutlookVideo Game Publisher Take-Two Rockets On June-Quarter BeatBoeing (BA) announced that it would get into the avionics business, to make controls and electronics for aircraft and spacecraft.

Analysts worried that would hurt suppliers like Rockwell Collins (COL) and Honeywell (HON). Boeing also announced a pricing deal with Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) on supplies for its 787 Dreamliner. Spirit has a similar deal with Airbus (EADSY) for its A350. Spirit Aero, which also announced strong earnings, soared 17.2%.The ObamaCare exchanges are still perilous for insurers' earnings health, but Medicare is a cash cow. Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), which will both complete their exit from the individual insurance markets at year end, both sailed past earnings estimates thanks to momentum in their Medicare Advantage businesses, and their shares vaulted to record highs. Aetna earnings ballooned by 55% and Humana earnings grew 6%, both smashing views. Cigna (CI) and WellCare Health Plans (WCG) also reported strong earnings. But Molina Healthcare (MOH), which saw the exchanges as a big growth opportunity, reported a loss of $4.10 a share in Q2, largely blaming its ObamaCare exchange business. Molina will pull out of the Wisconsin and Utah markets and scale back its presence in Washington state. In its remaining markets, Molina said it will hike premiums at least 30% in 2018. Molina shares tumbled.RELATED:Aetna Trounces Expectations As Big ObamaCare Insurer CrashesVulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), huge suppliers of construction aggregates, both reported earnings below views.

41,PXD,"A mixed finish Wednesday marked what was in many ways a single-handed victory for Apple (AAPL), as it lugged the Dow above the 22,000 mark, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 ended mostly unchanged.XThe iPhone maker thundered ahead 5% in massive trade, paring its initial 6% advance only slightly, and ending the session 1% above a 156.65 buy point in a flat base.The result left the Dow Jones industrial average with a 0.2% gain, and remaining ever-so-slightly above the 22,000 level after seizing that new high-water mark in opening trade. More than half of the Dow's 30 stocks traded lower for the day. Walt Disney (DIS) chalked up the index's worst performance, down nearly 2%, dealing a minor setback to the House of Mouse's effort to scale the right side of three-month cup base ahead of its fiscal third-quarter report scheduled for Aug. 8.The Nasdaq composite surrendered its gains early in the session as undertow from tech names led by Facebook (FB)(down 0.4%), Microsoft (MSFT) (down 0.4%) and Netflix (NFLX) (off 0.9%) outstripped gains from Apple, Illumina (ILMN) and Groupon (GRPN).The S&P 500 added less than 0.1% as it came under pressure from oil-related names led by Range Resources (RRC) (down 12%), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) (down 11%) and Newfield Exploration (NFX) (off 5%). Drug distribution giant Cardinal Health (CAH) also had some say, dropping 8% after topping fiscal fourth-quarter expectations, but guiding Q1 earnings below expectations.Aside from Apple, the day's big earnings winners were Illumina, Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) and Boot Barn Holdings (BOOT).Illumina soared 15% after reporting late Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings slipped much less than expected and revenue growth ratcheted up to 10%.

Its 18% gain launched shares past a 61.52 buy point in a five-month cup-with-handle base.Truck maker Oshkosh (OSK) pared its initial 12% surge to a 5% gain, enough to hold just above a 71.84 buy point in a cup-with-handle base after reporting fiscal third-quarter earnings up 63%, far above analyst targets and the company's best outing in four years.The session also saw winning runs break down for several leading stocks, most notably Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) and Coherent (COHR).Chipmaker Macom sliced off a 25% loss after compounding a weak fiscal Q3 report with below-target Q4 guidance.

44,PXD,"While much has been written about information technology companies investing in artificial intelligence, Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton notes that many non-tech companies are capitalizing on AI technology as well.Clinton has put together a portfolio of 17 publicly traded non-tech companies that are making investments in AI to improve their businesses. In a recent blog post, Clinton notes that he assembled the portfolio as a ""fun exercise"" and a way to draw attention to the sweeping nature of AI advancements. Loup Ventures is an early-stage venture capital firm.Clinton selected the companies from a range of industries including health care, retail, logistics, professional services, finance, transportation, energy, construction and food/agriculture.""In 10 years, every company will have to be an artificial intelligence company or they won't be competitive,"" Clinton said.Among the companies included is IBD 50 stock Idexx Laboratories (IDXX). Idexx makes products for the animal health-care sector. On its last earnings call, the company said that its latest diagnostic products are using machine learning so the instruments always have the ability to learn and train on new data.

45,PXD,"In less than a decade, the U.S. shale oil revolution has brought consumers worldwide billions of dollars in savings, driving down the price of gasoline, fuel oil, air travel, plastics and countless other household budget items. Before a fresh supply of shale oil drove U.S. crude output to records in 2013 and 2014, U.S. benchmark oil often traded above $100 per barrel.…
"
46,PXD,"OPEC is likely to extend its production cuts at the group's biannual meeting Thursday, but questions remain on the duration, size and scope of the reduction, as giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) join shale producers in the rush to pump more oil — and potentially send U.S. output to record highs later this year.In November, OPEC and top non-OPEC producers like Russia agreed to remove 1.8 million barrels of daily output off the market for six months starting in January. Prices rallied but then came back down as U.S. producers ramped up faster than expected and as inventories shrank slower than expected. By March, OPEC had started talking about extending the agreement by six months to the end of the year.OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, along with Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria and Venezuela, who collectively represent more than 80% of OPEC's output, have already said publicly that they support extending the cuts in some form.But Russia and Saudi Arabia have suggested taking the deal even further, saying they support extending the deal to March 2018.""There has been a marked reduction to the inventories, but we're not where we want to be in reaching the five-year average,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at a briefing in Beijing with Russia's Alexander Novak on May 15.On Saturday, al-Falih told Bloomberg that ""everybody"" he has talked to backs a nine-month extension. But on Monday, al-Falih reportedly visited his Iraqi counterpart in Baghdad to convince him to back a nine-month deal instead of a six-month one. Last year, Iraq had pushed to be exempt from the initial cut, saying it needed money to fight the Islamic State. It agreed to participate in the cuts but is considered a major cheater.The International Energy Agency warned last week that merely extending the deal won't be enough to bring markets in balance. Instead, deeper cuts are needed.And analysts at Citigroup have said there is a 60%-70% chance OPEC and its allies will announce an even deeper cut, taking 300,000-500,000 more barrels per day off the market.""An extension is in the bag,"" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. ""I would be shocked if it wasn't extended, and I wouldn't be surprised if OPEC announced an even bigger cut going forward.""On top of that, the scope of the output reductions could be broader, as Russia and Saudi Arabia are also pushing for non-OPEC members Turkmenistan and Egypt to participate in the next round. OPEC members Libya and Nigeria, which were exempt from reductions under the initial round, may participate in the next, while Iran, which was also shielded from cuts, has signaled it will maintain a cap on its output.In a note Monday, Goldman Sachs said a nine-month deal would help ""normalize OECD inventories"" by the start of next year. But the analysts warned that once the deal was over, stockpiles would start rising again.Goldman said that OEPC and its allies should ""gradually ramp up production to grow market share but keep stocks stable and backwardation in place,"" referring to the situation when a commodities' future contract price is below the current spot price.""Low forward prices could curtail shale's growth by reducing the ability to secure future cash flows and attract funding,"" Goldman said.Talk of more-aggressive moves has helped lift crude prices, with U.S. oil topping $50 a barrel again after rising 5% in the past week. Brent is now at a one-month high, above $53 a barrel.But OPEC members whose governments rely heavily on oil revenue need a higher price than that to stay out of red ink. Saudi Arabia's ""fiscal break-even"" price is $83.80 a barrel, according to an IMF report last month. Oman's is $79.20, Libya's is $71.30, and the United Arab Emirates' is $67. Others are in better shape, with Iraq's at $54.30, Iran's at $51.30 and Kuwait's at $49.10Meanwhile, U.S. producers learned during the oil crash how to become leaner and operate within cash flow at lower oil prices. They don't need to support government coffers either and are poised to boost production further if OPEC manages to raise crude prices again.Companies in the Permian Basin have break-even prices of $34 in some areas, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Earlier this month, EOG Resources (EOG) said it could hit its target of an 18% increase in oil production, while operating in its cash flow, if oil averages $47 per barrel this year.And Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said recently that its break-even oil price is just $20 a barrel, and the company could make ""good returns"" at $40 oil. Plus, deep-pocketed heavyweights like Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) plan to focus more spending this year on U.S. shale plays.That leaves OPEC with another dilemma, but one it is unlikely to resolve next week, if ever.""There is of yet no long-term strategy for dealing with shale oil, so any rebalancing will be temporary,"" Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University, said.U.S. production fell in the prior week for the first time since February, according to the Energy Information Administration. But output is on pace to top the April 2015 peak of 9.61 million barrels per day by July, and Flynn has said it could even reach 10 million barrels per day by August.Still, Flynn is more bullish on OPEC's future, noting that it takes time to boost production from unconventional wells due to their steep rate of decline, whereas traditional wells like those in Saudi Arabia can produce at a high rate for several years.""Even now with shale's resurgence, as demand grows in the coming years (OPEC) feels that because of the lack of investment in more traditional projects by oil companies, they will have a leg up in being able to ramp up production to meet demand in the future,"" he said.RELATED:EOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, Data

47,PXD,"Oil futures rallied Monday after the Saudi and Russian energy minsters threw their support behind extending output cuts by another nine months, but markets received another reminder that U.S. producers could undermine the deal as shale companies find ways to turn profits at lower prices.The Energy Information Agency said Monday afternoon that production from seven major U.S. shale plays should jump by 122,000 barrels a day to 5.401 million in June from the prior month. Total U.S. production was 9.31 million barrels a day during the week ended May 5, EIA said last week.U.S. crude futures gave up some earlier gains but still settled 2.1% higher at $48.85 a barrel.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares were up 0.3% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) climbed 0.8%. BP (BP) added 0.9%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) gained 0.6%.The ministers back a plan to extend the current deal to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the market until March 2018. The original deal, struck back in November 2016, originally was to last six months. A decision to extend the deal is expected at the biannual OPEC meeting on May 25.Saudi Arabia and Russia are also pushing for other countries to join the pact including non-OPEC participants Turkmenistan and Egypt, according sources cited by the Wall Street Journal. ""There has been a marked reduction to the inventories, but we're not where we want to be in reaching the five-year average,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at a briefing in Beijing with Russia's Alexander Novak.But an extension of the deal still might not be enough to balance markets.U.S. producers are a major reason for the lack of meaningful declines in stockpiles. Domestic output is on pace to hit a new high in July and possibly even 10 million barrels per day in August, according to analysts.Shale producer Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said recently its break-even oil price is just $20 a barrel, and the company could make ""good returns"" at $40 dollar oil.EOG Resources (EOG) said it could increase production by 18% while operating within cash flow if oil averages $47 per barrel this year.But Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, was upbeat on the prospect of an extension and thinks oil prices will hit $73 a barrel by the end of the year.""But now with rising demand and a commitment by Russia and Saudi Arabia to extend cuts, we could see the recent 5 week drop in U.S. oil inventories continue for the foreseeable future,"" he wrote in his daily Energy Report newsletter.""Add the potential default of Venezuelan bonds and the upcoming Iranian election, and we could see more support as prices get back what they gave back in the month of April. The extension of the cuts may drive global inventories below the five-year average as demand starts to rise.""Goldman analysts said in a note that while the support for an extension helped boost oil prices, ""the rally so far today has remained modest compared to the move that occurred last year when the OPEC cuts were first announced.""The deal still needs two things for it to work, according to Goldman: high compliance and low enough long term prices that will stop U.S. shale producers from putting more rigs to work.Goldman sees long term oil prices at $45-$55 per barrel, but U.S. producers have already said they plan to boost production at those prices.RELATED:

49,PXD,"EOG Resources (EOG) reminded Wall Street how it earned the nickname ""the Apple (AAPL) of oil,"" touting its development of smartphone apps and its massive haul of data to aid drilling.Facebook (FB) and Snapchat (SNAP) aren't the most valuable apps on EOG worker's iPhones. Instead, the company has developed 20 mobile apps of its own in the last two years that allow workers to stay connected day and night.""It's a major game-changer,"" Sandeep Bhakhri, chief information and technology officer, said on EOG's conference call Tuesday. ""We call it having a control a room in your pocket.""EOG has also collected data from 5,000 horizontal wells in almost every major unconventional play in the U.S., with the help of new ""black boxes"" deployed on rigs to help get more insight into data collected, he added.The company has been collecting its own data for nearly 30 years, but in the last two to three years EOG has had access to real-time data that allow it to steer drill bits in the most productive part of the rock.""Data is king and one of our most valuable resources,"" Bhakhri said.Faster access to data means quicker and more precise drilling, cutting time and waste and lowering costs.Late Monday, EOG reported Q1 earnings that met views and revenue that beat. Service and equipment prices rose ""in certain areas"" but were offset by ""continued advances in drilling and completion tools and techniques, benefits from extended lateral lengths and new contracts at lower prices,"" according to a statement.Management also noted its new wells in the Permian Basin ""shattered industry records"" for initial production. ""Our advanced technology and proprietary techniques are leading to breakthrough well performance across our diverse portfolio of premium plays,"" EOG said.EOG shares closed down just 5 cents to 91.64 on the stock market today, as U.S. crude futures retreated 1.2% to $45.88 a barrel. But prices pared losses late after the American Petroleum Institute reported a weekly inventory decline of 5.8 million barrels.EOG isn't the only company that is making the U.S. oil patch look more like Silicon Valley, as producers turn to high-tech solutions to survive the lower-price environment.Last week, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said that using artificial intelligence could help ensure it always drills for oil in the best places.

50,PXD,"X EOG Resources (EOG), the so-called ""Apple (AAPL) of oil,"" matched Q1 earnings views late Monday and beat revenue forecasts, while the shale producer touted record performance from its new Permian Basin wells.While dozens of shale companies have reported or are about to report, EOG's reputation for innovation makes it stand out, especially as U.S. oil prices have fallen back below $50 a barrel. To generate bigger profits at that level, producers have to find ways to extract oil as efficiently as possible.Houston-based EOG swung to a per-share profit of 15 cents, matching estimates, as revenue soared 93% to $2.61 billion, topping forecasts for $2.41 billion.Crude production climbed 18% year over year to 315,700 barrels of oil per day. Average completed well costs were down 6% vs. 2016 averages in the Eagle Ford, Delaware and Bakken formations. Service and equipment prices rose ""in certain areas"" but were were offset by ""continued advances in drilling and completion tools and techniques, benefits from extended lateral lengths and new contracts at lower prices.""""EOG's Whirling Wind wells shattered industry records in the Permian Basin,"" said Chairman and CEO Bill Thomas in a statement, noting they set new records for 30-day initial production from Permian Basin horizontal oil wells.  ""Our advanced technology and proprietary techniques are leading to break-through well performance across our diverse portfolio of premium plays.""Management sees Q2 crude production rising to 322,200-332,400 barrels a day, up 20%-24% annually or 2%-5% vs. Q1.EOG stock slipped 0.7% late. Shares closed up 0.9% at 91.69 on the stock market today as U.S. crude prices settled 0.5% higher at $46.43 a barrel.In addition to being dubbed the ""Apple of oil,"" EOG now even uses Apple technology, with its iSteer smartphone app that helps workers drill bit in the sweet spot, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.EOG has already touted its advantage from new innovation. In November, management said 75% of its cost savings were from efficiencies vs. discounts received from service providers, though some analysts have said the real number is likely a half to a third.Executives may detail additional technological advances. EOG will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. ET Tuesday.Meanwhile, other shale producers are looking into technologies normally associated with Silicon Valley, Last week, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said its looking into using artificial intelligence to help ensure it always drills for oil in the best places and is working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to test advanced materials and coatings.Also after the close Monday, Oasis Petroleum (OAS) reported its adjusted Q1 loss narrowed to 5 cents a share, beating by 2 cents, as revenue soared 119% to $285.1 million, above consensus for $252.1 million. Total production jumped 25.6% to 63,192 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day.

51,PXD,"Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said using artificial intelligence could help ensure it always drills for oil in the best places, as the energy sector embraces technologies that are transforming transportation, e-commerce and finance.While Tesla (TSLA) has been pursuing autonomous driving and Amazon (AMZN) is pushing its Alexa bot as a personal shopper, the oil industry has been slower to go high tech. But more companies are applying data analytics to oil exploration and production.Pioneer Natural Resources said Thursday that it isn't using AI yet, though it's been using predictive analytics.AI would help ""narrow the outcomes on these wells,"" meaning Pioneer could always drill in the sweet spot and avoid duds, Chris Cheatwood, the company's executive vice president for business development and geoscience, told analysts on a conference call.Pioneer expects AI to be the future, and as it looks to produce 1 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day by 2026, it won't need to hire a lot more people, he added.The company and Oak Ridge National Laboratory are also working together to look at advanced materials and coatings, smart parts and sensors, advanced material design, and additive manufacturing, according to a March statement from the lab.Shares of Pioneer fell 3% to 165.63 on the stock market today as a sell-off in oil prices overshadowed its strong quarterly report late Wednesday. Pioneer hit a nine-month low intraday.U.S. crude sank 4.8% to a five-month low of $45.52 a barrel, back to where prices were before OPEC began its production cuts.The shale producer swung to an adjusted profit of 25 cents per share in Q1, beating analyst views by 8 cents. Revenue jumped to $1.47 billion, also above views. Total production costs eased to $6.31 per BOE from $6.42 in Q4, but costs for Permian horizontal wells climbed 19% sequentially to $2.33 per BOE, and Permian vertical costs rose 2.5% to $14.36. Eagle Ford costs dipped 1.5% sequentially to $10.71.Production rose 3% vs. Q4 to 249,000 BOE per day, and management sees Q2 output of 254,000-259,000 BOE a day. While some analysts questioned if that guidance was light, Pioneer said its planned addition of wells is weighted toward the latter part of Q2 and the latter part of the year.Despite the uptick in Permian-area costs, Pioneer doesn't see cost inflation affecting its bottom line this year, noting it has long-term contracts for sand used in fracking and has access to cheap water, though it sees water use in the Permian doubling in 2017 vs. 2014 levels. Labor costs are up 2%-3%.Also late Wednesday, Continental Resources (CLR) reported adjusted EPS of 2 cents vs. a loss of 41 cents a year ago, in line with Wall Street views. Revenue was $685.43 million, above views for $642.83 million. Production expenses rose 5% vs. Q4 to $3.78 per BOE but were little changed vs. a year ago.On Thursday, CEO Harold Hamm told analysts during a conference call that service costs are only seeing a slight uptick in a few areas and have stabilized.Continental sees Q2 production of 220,000-225,000 BOE per day, up from 213,755 in Q1. Fracking crews in the Bakken formation will rise to nine by midyear from seven now.Despite the recent dive in crude prices, Hamm noted ""signs pointing toward better prices very quickly"" but added that fracking crews could be withdrawn promptly, depending on market conditions.Shale companies can extract oil profitably at lower prices due to new technologies and techniques that have improved efficiencies. Continental expects to be cash-flow neutral with U.S. crude at $50-$55 a barrel. Last quarter, it said a price of $55 was the threshold, and in 2015, it was $60.Shares tumbled 5.1% to 40, hitting their lowest levels sine May 2016.Also Wednesday, Concho Resources (CXO) reported EPS that crushed Wall Street views but its revenue fell short.Concho sees full-year production up 21%-25% vs. a prior outlook for growth of 20%-24%. Oil and natural gas production expense per barrel of oil equivalent is now $5.50-$6.00, down from a prior outlook of $5.75-$6.25.Shares dropped 1.3% to 127.11.On Tuesday, Diamondback Energy (FANG) reported Q1 results above views as production rose 61%.

Devon Energy also reported a profit and announced $1 billion in asset sales primarily in the Barnett Shale basin.Diamondback shares climbed 2% Wednesday, and Devon fell 1.75%.The earnings reports come as U.S. crude inventories start to decline. The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that stockpiles fell by 930,000 barrels last week while gasoline stockpiles rose by 200,000 barrels. Analysts were expecting a crude decrease of 2.3 million barrels and a gasoline increase of 1.3 million.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said crude inventories plunged by 4.2 million barrels as gasoline stockpiles fell by 1.9 million barrels.Meanwhile, U.S. crude production continues to climb, rising to 9.29 million barrels a day last week from 9.27 million, according to EIA.U.S. crude futures rose 0.3% to settle at $47.82 a barrel, after dropping Tuesday to their lowest levels since late November.But the International Energy Agency recently questioned the ability of increased U.S. shale production to offset a decline in conventional oil projects as demand rises.The agency expects liquids production from U.S. shale plays to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices. But conventional resources sanctioned for development last year fell 30% to 4.7 billion barrels, and overall exploration spending will be down for a third straight year to less than half of 2014 levels, with offshore projects especially hit.RELATED:BP Beats, Sees Stronger Cash Flow; ConocoPhillips Reports Surprise Loss

53,PXD,"Diamondback Energy (FANG), Concho Resources (CXO), Continental Resources (CLR) and other U.S. exploration and production companies will report earnings this week, likely providing more information on capital spending, production outlooks and oilfield service costs.Senior Robert W. Baird oil and gas analyst Daniel Katzenberg said he expects some increases in production outlooks for the year and said any increases in output without a corresponding bump in capital spending would be major a confidence boost for investors.Liquids production from U.S. shale plays is expected to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency.The number of oil rigs in operation has swelled for 15 straight weeks, according to Baker Hughes data, suggesting continued U.S. production gains in the near future.Even oil majors like Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (CVX) have turned their investment focus to expanding their holdings in the Permian Basin while curtailing spending in other areas.But the IEA worries that U.S. production won't be enough to offset the decline in investment in conventional drilling as demand for crude grows.But questions remain about service costs. Katzenberg doesn't think cost inflation will be an issue for E&Ps until WTI crude hits $60 per barrel.He said the average estimate is for a 20% increase this year, but he's only forecasting a 10% increase as improvements in drilling will offset some of the cost increases.IBD'S TAKE: Q1 reports from U.S. E&P companies will shed some light on how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts given by service providers during the crude price bust.""However, given investor trepidation, updated cost commentary, and its impact on 2017 plans, remains the biggest risk to the group over the earnings period, in our opinion,"" Katzenberg  wrote in note dated April 20.Diamondback Energy, Devon Energy (DVN) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are scheduled to release first-quarter results Tuesday.

62,PXD,"XThe extension of a deal among OPEC and top non-OPEC countries to trim output isn't a foregone conclusion, Saudi Arabia reportedly warned top U.S. shale firms this week, in a sign that the No. 1 crude exporter's strategy to lift prices may be backfiring in the face of surging U.S. producers.In a closed-door meeting with executives from Anadarko Petroleum (APC), ConocoPhillips (COP), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), EOG Resources (EOG) and Newfield Exploration (NFX) on Tuesday, top Saudi officials said U.S. producers should ""not automatically assume OPEC will extend the cuts"" and that OPEC ""would not take the hit for the rise in U.S. shale production,"" an executive at the meeting told Reuters on Thursday.U.S. crude futures fell 2% to settle at $49.28 a barrel, its lowest close since November, after tumbling more than 5% Wednesday. Brent futures fell 1.7% to $52.19.Late last year, OPEC and non-members like Russia agreed to trim output by a collective 1.8 million barrels a day for the first six months of this year. While crude prices surged leading up to and immediately after the deal was reached, they later stayed sideways as U.S. companies rushed to add drilling rigs and crank up production.With the deal's upside fizzling out, OPEC member Iraq had starting talking about an extension when the agreement expires in June. And on Tuesday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih appeared to lay out an initial, albeit tough, negotiating position.He told IHS' CERAWeek energy conference attendees Tuesday that ""conformity by all"" will be a criterion for any extension of the production-cut pact and that his country ""will not bear the burden of free rides"" as Saudi Arabia takes the brunt of the production cuts.Anadarko shares rose 0.9% to 61.94 on the stock market today. Conoco shares were up 1.2%. Occidental edged up 0.7%. Pioneer Natural climbed 1.9%. EOG was up 0.9%. Newfield jumped 1.9%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale producers have ramped up spending and rig counts as oil prices rise and OPEC curbs production. But a debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts. Failure to extend the agreement could send oil prices even lower, as U.S. companies have vowed to unleash a flood of investment this year to pump more oil from low-cost formations like the Permian Basin.On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration raised its 2017 U.S. crude output forecast to 9.2 million barrels per day from a prior outlook of 8.98 million and raised its 2018 outlook to 9.73 million from 9.53 million. Last week, U.S. output hit 9.09 million barrels, the highest in a year and a half.Saudi Arabia's warning to U.S. shale comes despite strong compliance with the terms of the current agreement.Last month, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said he wants compliance on the output deal to rise past 90% to nearly 100%.But the high number is a collective figure and was due in part to Saudi Arabia cutting its output by more than it was expected, offsetting weaker compliance elsewhere.During an interview with CNBC after his speech, Al-Falih said Russia's cuts in February weren't enough but that Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak assured him that March cuts will be better.OPEC's next meeting is scheduled for May 25, and on March 26 a committee formed to monitor compliance with the production deal will meet in Kuwait.RELATED:Does OPEC Have Anything Left In The Tank As U.S. Shale Looms?This Is When Shell Expects Global Peak Oil DemandDow's Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Announce Energy Deals As Oil Undercuts $50

63,PXD,"Oil and gas producer Marathon Oil (MRO) on Tuesday said it would buy up more land in the oil-and-gas-rich Permian Basin, just weeks after another deal there, joining Dow Jones industrial average energy giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) in expanding in the low-cost play.Under the terms of the deal, Marathon would buy roughly 21,000 net surface acres from Black Mountain Oil & Gas and others for $700 million. Most of that space lies in the Permian's Northern Delaware basin of New Mexico.The purchase, set to close in the second quarter, would give Marathon more than 90,000 acres in the Permian. It comes despite recent weakness in the price of crude.""While we expect to pursue additional trades and grassroots leasing, this bolt-on achieves the scale necessary for efficient long-term development in the basin,"" CEO Lee Tillman said in a statement.Shares of Marathon fell 2.8% to 15.05 on the stock market today, trending below their 200-day line as U.S. crude futures fell 1.4% to $48.24 a barrel. Dow stocks Exxon Mobil dipped 0.2% and Chevron added 0.35%.IBD'S TAKE: For more information about how investors are navigating the industry, read this Industry Snapshot. On March 9, Marathon said it agreed to pay $1.1 billion for 70,000 net surface acres in the Permian, as energy giants make more aggressive moves in the area.Exxon Mobil in January said it would scoop up assets in the Permian, which is located in west Texas and New Mexico, and Chevron has said it would spend more to pull resources out of the region.Meanwhile, shale companies are continuing to pour money into the Permian.In February, Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it would buy up more land there. Parsely Energy (PE) in January and February said it would acquire more acreage in the region, and last year, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) bought land in the Permian from Devon Energy (DVN).RELATED:Oil Rigs Hit Highest Since September 2015; More Mixed Signals From SaudisOil Prices Snap 7-Day Losing Streak As Supplies Drop, IEA Urges Markets To 'Hold Nerve'

69,PXD,"Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities Fund's (FIGWX) recent surge since the elections and since the Federal Reserve's December rate hike has given retirement-account and other investors reason to cheer.In the trailing three months going into Thursday, the $300 million fund's 10.45% gain topped 93% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged an 8.66% advance. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, gained 8.33%.For the Nuveen fund, that's way better than the mere 34% of direct rivals it outpaced in the past 12 months with a not-so-shabby 24.20% return.The difference between now and the earlier period? Within their overall investment approach, fund managers Harold Goldstein and David Chalupnik favored stocks likely to get an extra tailwind from the elections and from rising rates. Those had to be stocks that fit their basic approach, which is the pursuit of stocks they think will have faster earnings growth than the market expects.They paid for that by cutting stable and defensive consumer staples stocks by 7% in the fourth quarter and consumer discretionary stocks by 6%, the fund's fourth-quarter commentary notes.The managers pumped up their financials by 7%, mostly the day after the elections. They boosted technology by about 3% and energy by 2%.They began positions in Signature Bank (SBNY), SVB Financial (SIVB), Raymond James (RJF) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).All of those newcomers have very strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the high 80s or 90s. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.In addition to a sterling 96 Comp Rating, SVB Financial is the No. 3-ranked bank in IBD's superregional industry group, thanks to growth metrics like four years in a row of earnings per share (EPS) growth and a 39.7% annual pretax margin.IBD'S TAKE: SVB Financial is ranked No. 3 in the No. 1-rated Banks-Super Regional group. See which superregional bank is No. 1, and how these financials stack up on easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.The bank is headquartered in Silicon Valley, a hotbed of innovation. Its nonbanking businesses include asset management, private wealth management, brokerage and investment services, funds management, and business valuation services.Raymond James is No. 2 in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank-Bankers group. It is propelled by factors like its fourth-quarter 47% EPS growth and eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds.In tech, the fund opened a position in Broadcom (AVGO), a chipmaking company whose EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters. On IBD's Leaderboard, the company makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications and broadband communications.Goldstein and Chalupnik like the semiconductor space's economic sensitivity. And they like Broadcom's role among leaders of consolidation within its industry.In energy, the fund added new positions in Concho Resources (CXO) and Parsley Energy (PE), and added to its stake in Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).""(We) added exposure to several growth-oriented exploration and production firms as a result of the generally improved outlook for oil pricing and supply,"" the managers wrote.In health care, the fund's overall weight stayed basically unchanged in the immediate postelection period. But the fund made individual stock moves.It started a stake in Incyte (INCY), which the managers call a fast-growing young biotech firm with an exciting pipeline of cancer-fighting treatments.To pay for Incyte, the fund used proceeds from the sale of two drugmakers, Allergan (AGN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which it had owned a long time.The managers think Allergan has grown so large that it can no longer grow much faster than its industry. They sold Bristol-Meyers because test results dimmed the outlook for a lung cancer therapy it was developing.The managers summarized their approach this way: ""The portfolio continues to be reasonably balanced from a sector standpoint as well as measured by other factors. The fund's largest overweight is in the area of companies with high growth potential that we believe can perform well somewhat independent of the economic cycle. We are always looking for exceptional growth companies that we believe have solid and/or improving fundamentals, a reasonable valuation and an approaching catalyst.""RELATED:Why This Victory Munder Fund Likes Semiconductor Gear Makers And Non-ObamaCare Health StocksWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

73,PXD,"Crude prices continued to rally Thursday on fresh signs of OPEC production cuts and improving demand, but more U.S. producers are getting ready to take advantage of higher prices.West Texas Intermediate futures rose 1.5% to settle at $53.01 a barrel, but down from intraday highs. Brent crude climbed 1.7% to $56.01.Top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia has reduced deliveries to Asia, as it implements its promised output cuts. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouq said at a conference Thursday that Kuwait has already cut output by more than what it pledged to cut, according to CNBC. His Iraqi counterpart said that country reduced its exports by 170,000 barrels per day and cut them by another 40,000 barrels this week.Meanwhile, China said net crude imports will rise 5% this year as total demand hit a record high amid a jump in car sales.IBD'S TAKE: The pact between OPEC and non-OPEC countries seems to be holding, but a reinvigorated OPEC may not be enough to overcome U.S. shale's long-term disruption.As prices recover from a two-year slump, Hess Corp. (HES) said Thursday it will spend $2.25 billion on exploration and production in 2017, up from $1.9 billion in 2016, and will add four rigs in the Bakken shale formation this year.But the company also said it booked $4.6 billion in charges in Q4 to account for tax valuation adjustments and deferred development of natural gas fields, sending shares down 4.8% on the stock market today.On Tuesday, Parsley Energy (PE) said it plans to spend $750 million-$900 million this year, with 60% headed for the Midland Basin in the Permian formation, vs. its estimated 2016 capital budget of $460 million-$510 million.Parsley also said it expects net production to surge 60% this year to 57,000-63,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and announced a deal to buy 23,000 net leasehold acres in the Permian for $607 million.As oil prices topped $50, other shale companies like Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and RSP Permian (RSPP) have ramped up spending and output forecasts for this year.On Monday, Barclays predicted North American oil companies will boost exploration and production spending by 27% in 2017, with large-cap companies increasing upstream outlays by 58%, with small- and midcap companies spending 43% more.But the net effect of the added spending on drilling activity and output will be more muted as costs go up.Parsley shares rose 1.3% Thursday, Pioneer dipped 0.2%, Diamondback lost 0.3% and RSP Permian was down 2 cents at 43.38.RELATED: Oil Prices Near $50 Floor As Iraqi Exports Raise OPEC Deal Doubts

75,PXD,"The new year means the start of promised output cuts from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, setting up 2017 to be a critical test for the oil group's future as restive members, a resurgent U.S. shale sector, and the prospect of waning demand further erode its once-dominant grasp on oil markets.On the surface, the agreement to reduce production by 1.8 million barrels for six months appeared to return the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to its traditional role of managing the market as it sent prices up more than 20% since expectations began building for a deal in early November.But unless OPEC and non-OPEC countries can craft another deal that boosts oil prices 50% from today's levels, even a reinvigorated OPEC may not be enough to overcome U.S. shale's long-term disruption.""Russian and Saudi companies can make money at $20 per barrel vs. the $40 to $50 shale producers need,"" said Tom O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat. ""But $20 isn't enough to fund their economies. They need oil to be in the $80s to make enough profit so their countries don't go into the red.""U.S. crude prices closed Friday at $53.99 a barrel, with Brent at $57.10.Failure to get there could hasten efforts like the one in top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia to rely less on oil, while increasingly resilient shale companies look to gain territory on the global market. And opportunities may be opening now. To implement the output cut, OPEC members have already told customers in the U.S., Europe and Asia to expect fewer deliveries.U.S. producers are ready to pounce. As prices topped $50, companies like Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and RSP Permian (RSPP) have ramped up spending and output forecasts for this year.
"
76,PXD,"The $50 level for U.S. oil acted as a ceiling in 2016 for prices, but Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, thinks it will be more of a floor in 2017 as OPEC enacts its cuts. While that is less than half of oil's prebust peak, $55 is enough to help about 80% of shale producers, he said, with around 20% needing more.Still, don't expect a ""meteoric rise"" in output, he added, as many firms have capital issues like high debts that will consume additional cash flow initially.The shale sector's pursuit of innovation, which state-run rivals couldn't match during the bust, may accelerate, further cutting break-even costs in places like the Permian Basin, where it is below $40.""When prices were really low you had to stop innovating because you had to just pump to keep the lights on,"" Flynn said. ""But now with prices coming back, you'll see more innovation.""So unless OPEC can get Texas to become a member, its leverage looks to slip further. And some analysts have been doubting OPEC's reputation as a cartel, namely its ability to manage the market — and the latest agreement hasn't changed their views.""I don't think the OPEC output cut represents a return to an effective supply control and price stability,"" said Bob McNally, president of the Rapidan Group energy consulting firm. ""It's just a panicked response to a price bust.""Indeed, OPEC has been unable to do its job of putting a floor and a ceiling on prices for the past 10 years, he noted.Last decade and earlier this decade, crude prices spiked above $100 a barrel as OPEC ran out of spare capacity that could've added enough supply to bring prices back down.That allowed fracking techniques to proliferate across once-unprofitable oilfields, sowing the seeds of OPEC's recent woes. And for much of 2016, OPEC's leaders struggled to lift prices from recession-era lows as prior attempts at a production agreement failed.Now with one in hand, its success is already questionable.Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University, believes Iraq will be the first one to cheat as Baghdad needs oil revenue to continue fighting the Islamic State and lacks control of all its oilfields, some of which are in the semiautonomous Kurdistan region.On Tuesday, Iraq's prime minister accused the Kurdish region of exporting more than what it was allowed.And once one country starts cheating, others may quickly follow. ""There is no mechanism to punish violators,"" Al-Ubaydli said. ""So even if they detected a violation, the only thing they can do is to retaliate by cheating.""The first meeting of a monitoring committee made up of OPEC and non-OPEC members will be held Jan. 13 in Abu Dhabi, but whether it will go beyond monitoring the deal to actually enforcing its terms is unclear. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said this week that they expect a ""relatively high compliance"" rate of 84% on the current deal.Even then, that doesn't account for Iran, which was exempted from the production deal and reportedly has been selling millions of barrels of oil held in floating storage.The pact also highlighted OPEC's inability to do it alone as top nonmembers like Russia had to participate. Moscow agreed to cut production by 300,000 barrels per day, down from December's 11.21 million barrels per day, a post-Soviet Union high.""It's a dicey proposition to rely on Russia to do their bit,"" Al-Ubaydli said. ""It's mission impossible. No way (OPEC can) get anyone from outside to stick to what they are doing, they can't even get their own members to stick to what they are doing.""Political friction could also split the participants. Saudi Arabia has trouble trusting Iran and Russia, as the de facto OPEC leader is in a proxy war against the two in Syria and other parts of the Middle East.OPEC's marriage of convenience with Russia is partly a reflection of the shale revolution, which helped more than double U.S. crude production from 2005 to 2015's peak of 9.6 million barrels a day.That surge shrank OPEC's global market share to less than 40%, a threshold that is key for market control, said Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at Infracap MLP ETF. In 2013, it was 43%. As U.S. production retreated during the bust, OPEC recovered some market share, but the shale companies are coming back.""Now the group is just barely at 40%,"" Hatfield said. ""When they add Russia, they are up to 50% of market share, giving them more power.""OPEC isn't the first oil cartel to see its power wane. The early Pennsylvania cartels in the late 1800s flopped due to cheating and outside supply. That started with the Oil Creek Association formed in 1861, McNally said.The ""Seven Sisters,"" a group of oil giants that are survived today by Exxon Mobil (XOM), BP (BP) and Chevron (CVX), had solid compliance but were weakened by supply growth outside the cartel, with much of their operations ultimately nationalized, McNally said.Now U.S. shale producers like Diamondback Energy, Continental Resources (CLR) and Apache Resources (APA) are subverting OPEC's power.""Shale is always going to be this nagging problem for OPEC,"" said Jim Krane, an energy analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""OPEC is boxed in by shale. If they constrain production too much it gives shale room to increase production.""OPEC's top producer, Saudi Arabia, may not even be looking to restore OPEC to its former glory, playing for a short-term oil gain instead.The kingdom is already working to lower its dependence on oil and needs prices to stay up for the next year to ensure state-run giant Saudi Aramco has a successful early 2018 IPO, which will raise much-needed capital for the kingdom's economic reforms.Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency sees oil demand peaking in 2040, and cracks have started to emerge. In October, Fitch analysts warned that the ""widespread adoption of battery-powered vehicles is a serious threat to the oil industry"" and could lead to an ""investor death spiral.""It would still take 20 years before electric cars would make up even a quarter of the global car fleet, Fitch estimated.""But reduced transport fuel demand could tip the oil market from growth to contraction earlier than anticipated,"" the credit rating agency said.

77,PXD,"After years of calling for it privately, Barnes Hauptfuhrer decided that early 2017 was finally time to go public with his desire to see a makeover of America's hottest natural gas play.Last week, the 62-year-old sent a 10-page open letter to the board of EQT (EQT), urging the gas explorer to merge with either Range Resources (RRC) or Antero Resources (AR). That prompted Range to put out a statement saying it hadn't been contacted by EQT about a potential deal and that it had no plans to hold talks.It was a ""difficult decision"" to go public for the founder of Charlotte, N.C.-based Chapter IV Investors, who prides himself on having spent the past decade working quietly and amicably alongside corporate leaders.""It creates a bit of awkwardness,"" Hauptfuhrer acknowledged in a phone interview Friday. ""Sometimes in life you have to encourage management to think outside of the box about something big.""In this case, that ""something big"" would usher in a new era for the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, where the last decade's gas boom has helped reshape America's energy markets. The region is ""fragmented"" with too many companies and should follow the example of North America's midstream sector, which saw several multibillion-dollar deals last year, he said.The timing's right for consolidation on the production side, Hauptfuhrer said, as energy prices recover from last year's lows and it becomes clearer who the strongest companies are. Hauptfuhrer wants EQT — because of its low debt levels and high market capitalization — to lead the way by either pairing off with Range or Antero.He's calling for an all-equity transaction that would result in a company with a $25 billion enterprise value that could produce twice as much gas as any of its Marcellus and Utica rivals.Such a large-scale merger would be rare in the exploration and production sector, where companies have historically been more likely to buy up acreage or smaller assets, said Vincent Piazza, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.""The basic premise for corporate consolidation in the E&P space may not really hold,"" Piazza said. ""Usually smaller and bolt-on transactions tend to work.""Hauptfuhrer's decision to go public owed, in part, to the fact that EQT will change its leadership this spring. Starting March 31, Steven Schlotterbeck will take over as chief executive of the company.""That unique moment allows them to objectively look at the pros and cons of a potential merger of equals,"" Hauptfuhrer said. ""What we want to see is the company emerge as the 800-pound gorilla.""EQT was down 3.3%, Range fell 4.3% and Antero lost 2.3% by Monday's close. U.S. natural gas futures ended the day down roughly 5%, extending declines after capping the worst weekly loss in a year.Hauptfuhrer started Chapter IV in 2006, with plans to invest up to half of his assets in private equity and the rest in publicly traded companies. After the 2008 crisis, he decided to focus solely on the latter. He likes investing for the long term in about 10 companies. He's owned shares of EQT and Range since 2010 and Antero since 2014.Chapter IV isn't a huge player. The fund has about $250 million under management and had a less than 1% ownership stake in all three of those gas companies as of Dec. 31, he said. Beyond that, it has stakes in Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) — as well as companies in the paper and packaging and construction sectors.Hauptfuhrer expects U.S. gas output to grow by 3% annually for the next decade or two. Gas prices will stay mostly between $2.50 and $3.50 per million British thermal units for the next few years, which he acknowledges is cheap.""We are focused on owning the lowest-cost producers,"" he said. ""If you're the low-cost producer, you can still make money.""Chapter IV's name reflects the fact that Hauptfuhrer's in the fourth phase of his career, he said. He started at Kidder, Peabody during the 1980s, where he specialized in mergers and acquisitions. Then he founded and ran the private-equity group First Union Capital Partners. From there, he became co-head of First Union's — later, Wachovia's — corporate and investment bank. He left that post in 2004.Generally, he likes establishing relationships with management teams and working with them privately. He's talked with the EQT, Range and Antero management teams for years about consolidation, he said. While he knew that going public with his pitch could risk those relationships, he said the response he's heard thus far from other investors and analysts has been mostly good.""We haven't had one person, not one, who hasn't said: 'This makes a lot of sense,' "" Hauptfuhrer said. ""We think we're going down the right path.""Neither EQT nor Antero immediately responded to emailed requests for comment Friday. Range referred to its earlier statement.

79,PXD,"Top U.S. shale stocks re-entered buy range Monday as crude prices spiked following Saturday's agreement between OPEC and top non-OPEC producers to cut output next month, but they erased much of their gains or even traded lower as oil prices pared gains.U.S. crude futures rose 2.6% to $52.83, their best close since July 2015. But oil rose more than 5% intraday.Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) rose as high as 57.81 intraday, clearing a 54.42 buy point, but closed down 2.8% to 52.80 on the stock market today.The stock previously broke out with a 23% pop after OPEC announced its production agreement on Nov. 30, but drifted lower amid doubts that it can actually be implemented.Diamondback Energy (FANG) surged to 113.16 intraday, easily topping its 106.94 entry point, but settled off 1% at 104.99. Diamondback shot up 13% on Nov. 30 that initially put it in buy zone.Concho Resources (CXO) fell 1.1% to 140.84 after initially rising to 147.55, breaking out from its 143.70 buy point. Unlike Continental and Diamondback, Concho never quite made it into buy zone earlier, despite a 12% post-OPEC run-up.Parsley Energy (PE) and Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) held onto fractional gains, but below entry levels reached early Monday.Parsley was up 0.85% at 36.63, still less than a dollar below its 37.30 entry point, after rising as high as 38.18. Pioneer rose 1% to 188.96, back below its 193.49 buy point, pulling back from an intraday high of 195.Diamondback, Parsley, Pioneer and Concho are also big players in the Permian Basin, which has seen a spike in drilling activity as its low-cost reserves allow producers to extract oil profitably, even with prices still well below 2014 highs.RELATED:'NOPEC' Deal Could Send Oil To $60 By January, But Can It Be Enforced?Oil Soars Nearly 5% On Non-OPEC Deal, Saudi SurpriseSaudis Signal 'Shock And Awe' After Russia, Non-OPEC Nations Pledge Output CutsGeneral Electric, IBM Among 4 Megacap Stocks In Buy Range

81,PXD,"U.S. crude production neared a six-month high as supplies fell by 884,000 barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday, more than the 250,000-barrel drop that analysts expected and the 717,000-barrel decline the American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday.But gasoline stockpiles rose by 2.1 million barrels and distillate stocks soared by 5 million barrels.Production of crude edged up to 8.7 million barrels a day last week, the highest since the week ended June 10, from 8.69 million in the prior week.U.S. crude futures jumped 9.3% to $49.44 a barrel on reports that OPEC has finalized a deal to cut production for six months. Brent surged above $50.Higher crude prices should improve revenue for U.S. shale companies and spur them to pump more oil, though additional supplies eventually will weigh on prices. But producers focused on the low-cost Permian Basin should be able to continue profiting even if prices head back down again.Shares of Permian-heavy Diamondback Energy (FANG) jumped 13% to 107.85 on the stock market today, topping a 106.94 buy point. Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) vaulted 10% to 191.04, just short of a 193.49 entry point. SM Energy (SM) soared 25% to 39.86, retaking its 50-day average. Matador Resources (MTDR) popped 17.5%, and RSP Permian (RSPP) jumped 14.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Even a deal as short as six months would have some benefits for oil markets, analysts say.Meanwhile, stocks like Continental Resources (CLR) and Parsley Energy (PE) have entered buying territory on the oil-price surge.

84,PXD,"U.S. shale producers were the big winners of OPEC's decision Wednesday to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day, but the deal won't immediately fix high debt loads, lack of skilled workers and other issues that shale producers need to resolve before ramping up production.West Texas Intermediate futures rose 3.3% to $51.06 a barrel on Thursday, the highest close since Oct. 19, after jumping 9% the day before. Brent futures rose as high as $54.53, the highest since July 2015.""There were casualties on capital spending  and future capital spending, so even though the war is over and welcomed by everyone, thinking the U.S. producers are going to ramp up production to where they were even a year ago is ill-conceived,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.Domestic crude production has edged up to the highest level in nearly six months, but Flynn thinks it will take a least a year before output really heats up in the U.S.""Companies are going to need more capital from banks, and it will be more difficult to borrow money because they have been burned in the past.""During the downturn, shale firms relied on bank loans or debt and stock sales to keep the lights on and rigs running.ConocoPhillips (COP) has said it would use cash from higher oil prices to first reduce debt before expanding operations. In May, EOG Resources (EOG) said it would first fund capital expenditures with cash flow, reduce net debt with property sales, and then complete drilled but uncompleted wells before starting to drill new wells.But Flynn said Conoco, Occidental Petroleum (OXY)and Oasis Petroleum (OAS) have a lot of capital and should be winners in the shale patch.Finding skilled workers and functioning equipment will be another major hurdle for the industry as rigs were retired or put in storage, and thousands of employees found other jobs after being laid off during the bust.Meanwhile, the latest surge in oil prices still isn't enough for many producers to jump back into the fray.Jason Wangler, managing director Wunderlich, told IBD oil would have to reach $60 per barrel before ""you'll see an absolute rush"" of producers ramping up activity. ""But $50 is a lot better than $40,"" and he expects U.S. shale companies' capital spending to be up 20% to 25% in 2017 vs. 2016.Last month, EOG said the U.S. shale industry needs oil prices of $60 a barrel to ramp up drilling.But Conoco, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN) will be able to boost activity at $50 per barrel, according to research company Wood Mackenzie in a Financial Times article.And costs are going up. Oil field service providers plan to roll back discounts offered during the depths of the price crash. In October, Halliburton (HAL) indicated that it was willing to increase its prices even if it means losing some customers.Still, technological advances have helped Continental Resources (CLR) reduce drilling time in the Bakken, and EOG has found a way to use cheap natural gas in fracking. But an estimated 80% of cost savings during the downturn came from service providers slashing costs.Shares of Continental Resources dipped 0.8% to close at 57.55 on the stock market today, but that's after surging 23% on Wednesday, breaking out of a cup with handle base. Occidental dipped  slightly to 71.27, Oasis ticked up 3 cents to 15. EOG climbed 2.2% to 104.75, above buy range, after jumping 11% Wednesday on the OPEC news. Halliburton added 0.3% to 53.24. Conoco lost 0.6% to 48.22 while Pioneer shares fell 0.8% to 189.57. Devon finished the day down 1% to 47.85.IBD'S TAKE: OPEC's announcement send shale stocks are soaring, see which shale plays are now buys.While rig counts have been rising in the Permian and Colorado's DJ Niobrara basin, Flynn said most of the recent rigs were added to replace rigs in decline or to hold leases.U.S. producers also could be hesitant to ramp up activity as the OPEC deal is contingent on Russia and other nonmembers scaling back output.The certainty of the deal was already in question Wednesday as Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak cautioned that Russia will ""gradually"" reduce due to technical issues. OPEC will meet with nonmembers to work out the details on Dec. 9.RELATED: U.S. Crude Production Hits Highest Level In Nearly 6 MonthsDover, Machinery Stocks Soar On Oil Prices, Infrastructure Hopes

""So now I think it's more of a function of can companies walk us through how much better the scenario is today?""Wangler expects guidance on activity and production levels and commentary on whether $50 a barrel will be enough for companies to really start ramping up activity.West Texas intermediate oil has been hovering around $50 a barrel for several weeks after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cap production. Rig counts, especially in the Permian basin, have risen, though the latest week saw the first dip in more than four months, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data.U.S. oil has retreated from $50 earlier this year and lately has had trouble breaking out higher. Some companies and analysts have said the industry needs a price closer to $60 or more to see a major comeback.Just holding around $50 may be a challenge. Oil prices fell 2.1% to $48.70 a barrel on Friday as a divided OPEC failed to agree on specific cuts for members. Without an internal deal, OPEC failed to reach a supply pact with other big producers over the weekend.A top oilfield services provider thinks $50 is enough.

89,PXD,"Leading tech stocks tumbled last week as mutual funds sold shares in the likes of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google. But the manager of $3 billion Franklin DynaTech Fund, an IBD Best Mutual Fund 2016 Award winner, isn't panicking.Judging by DynaTech's (FKDNX) lowly portfolio turnover rate of 31% and comments by lead manager Matthew Moberg on the power driving growth in several key holdings, the fund remains hitched in a big way to the market's leading stocks.DynaTech has an outsized bet on technology, with a 48% weighting as of June 30, according to Franklin Templeton.That sort of megabet on a single sector could make a fund volatile. But this fund's performance is consistent as well as strong. The fund was up 3.15% so far this year as of Oct. 31. The S&P 500 was up 5.87%. DynaTech's return topped 78% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged a 0.91% gain.The fund generated average annual returns of 8.42%, 13.2% and 9.26% the past three, five and 10 years.The fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner for having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard. It was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all large caps and all growth funds.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersMoberg, 45 years old, has been shepherding DynaTech since 2004. He talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in San Mateo, Calif.IBD: Matthew, why does the fund have such a large technology weighting?Moberg: The fund focuses on innovation and growth.Our name, ""DynaTech,"" stands for dynamic technologies. We define dynamic as a force that stimulates change or progress. Innovation is where the bulk of wealth creation occurs. But we view this as a broad mandate. We're able to look for innovation anywhere.And we believe you need active management to invest in innovation. It's a part of the market that is often misunderstood. Some people believe it is too expensive, or too unknown. So that's an area we look through because those misunderstandings mean opportunities get overlooked.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance LeadersIBD: Is your current tech weighting typical for the fund?Moberg: It's been as high as 50%. But sector classifications change. Amazon (AMZN) is now classified as a consumer discretionary stock. Early on, it was tech.Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are holdings. They're still considered information technology companies. But one could argue that they are financials.We look for innovation, which can be found in a lot of places.IBD: Health care was your second largest sector, with a 27% weighting. That's another hotbed of innovation, right?Moberg: It's not a great year for health care because of the election (and some candidates talking about price controls). But, yes, there's a lot of innovation there. You see it in possibly emerging treatments for diseases like hepatitis C, cystic fibrosis, even cancer.IBD: What are some names you like in that space?Moberg: Celgene (CELG) and Incyte (INCY).Click Here To See A List Of Biggest Mutual Funds Ranked By PerformanceIBD: Is the fund's performance consistent because it is diversified? Because it's exposed to other sectors, not just tech and health care? Why else?Moberg: Yes, we are diversified. And consistency is also due to our fundamental research. Sometimes we find stocks that the market doesn't appreciate how quickly they will come to market. The best example is Facebook (FB). They launched their mobile ads in Q2 2012. In the first quarter they only did $13 million in revenue. That was 1.3% of their total revenue. Two years and three months later, mobile was doing $1.659 billion. That's more advertising revenue than CBS' $1.63 billion in the similar quarter.Technology adoption is accelerating. The world is more global. Investors often don't appreciate how fast a new technology rises. So we try to think long-term. Our short-term performance is just a byproduct of how we think long-term.IBD'S TAKE: See how near Facebook and other highly rated stocks are to proper buy points. Visit IBD's Leaderboard.IBD: What part of Facebook's story do you like the most now?Moberg: First, mobile usage. Mobile ads will be more effective than other ads, one could argue. Facebook probably has the best set of mobile applications. And there's a runway for growth there.Second, they're starting to monetize Instagram, where people share pictures. The next step is to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp. Usage on them has been explosive. And there's a good chance that this goes into commerce (rather than remain solely a social activity).Finally, when you're thinking about what they could monetize five or 10 years out, Oculus (which makes a virtual reality headset) is another interesting acquisition. Facebook didn't pay much for it. And they can probably monetize it in five to 10 years. It has a long runway, like Messenger and WhatsApp.IBD: Edwards Lifesciences (EW) seems to be benefiting from a new management fiscal discipline and from a key new product, their transcatheter aortic value replacement (TAVR).Moberg: Yes, right now they're going through a very nice product cycle with TAVR. It had a rough start. But now TAVR is an example of a sensational innovation. It enables patients to avoid the need for open-heart surgery, cracking open your rib cage, making a giant incision. Instead, they put the TAVR in through an artery with a small incision. Patients spend less time in the hospital, go through less pain. And with each iteration, the valve gets smaller and easier to insert.That product cycle will last another five-plus years.They're also working on something for mitral valves, which are harder to reach. We hope and expect them to be the leader in that field as well. If they can do it, it would double their addressable market.IBD: Edwards had disappointing sales in Q3 and its stock plummeted. How has this changed your outlook for the company and stock?Moberg: We remain positive on Edwards Lifesciences. Edwards is still in the early stages of capturing the transcatheter aortic valve replacement opportunity (65% share of a $2.5 billion or so market that is only about one-third penetrated).  Its stock also fails to account for any potential for the transcatheter mitral valve replacement opportunity, and mitral valve disease is twice as prevalent as aortic valve disease.  It has faced missteps in new products before — again the world doesn't work as linearly as we would like — but we believe this is an excellent business.IBD: I'll make a wild guess that you are not one of those investors who finds Amazon's product experiments wasteful.Moberg: They're incredibly innovative. They're continually investing in new things. They've had three big successes. The first was Prime. They get money upfront (from consumers). And it drove up usage of Amazon significantly. The second was letting third parties sell on the website, with fulfillment by Amazon. It required no investment in inventory, and generated higher margins.In addition, they have Amazon Web Services, which is increasingly important. It's one of the fastest growing software-as-a-service companies ever.Amazon continues to invest, find new ideas. They've had quite a few failures along the way, but I understand you need to take risk to succeed. That attitude gives us confidence in their continued growth.IBD: Any concerns about Amazon's miss on Q3 results? Any sign of more weakness to come?Moberg: They have gone through many investment cycles in the past. Step-ups in investments don't always, in fact rarely, work within a quarterly reporting cycle. We understand that.  Over the long term Amazon has had very good returns on invested capital, prefers to grow organically and has a culture of innovation.  We didn't see anything in the quarter that suggests that is no longer the case.IBD: Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) is somewhat new to the portfolio. But it has seven straight quarters of slowing earnings. What's your thesis?Moberg: We like to invest in small positions, see how they do and try to hold on for the long-term. If anything fundamental changes and it's right, we add to it.Pioneer is one of the best positions in oil services. They are one of the lowest priced producers. We think oil will stabilize in the 50 to 60 per barrel range.IBD: Why do you like Chinese online gaming company NetEase (NTES)?Moberg: We believe the gaming space is a secular winner. NetEase has some games that have done well. And the secular trends on gaming are better in China than in the U.S., and it is very strong in the U.S. We will see more virtual reality and different kinds of games and ways for people to spend leisure time playing games.IBD: Do you still like Broadcom (AVGO) as much as you used to?Moberg: We don't believe it is as innovative as it used to be. Most of their accelerating earnings per share is due to consolidation. We prefer companies with innovation, which this was at first.Still, they are doing a great job buying companies, rationalizing costs, raising prices. Their CEO is incredibly well thought of in the (chipmaking) industry. He's executing on strategy extremely well. We're pleased that someone is taking the lead and starting consolidation in that industry.IBD: Nvidia (NVDA) is another relative newcomer to your portfolio. What do you like about their chipmaking?Moberg: They were viewed as a provider of graphics chips inside PCs. Then they expanded, making chips inside game consoles. Now they're broken free of that prison and making central processing units for virtual reality. They're also needed in cars, for autonomous driving. Also in hyperscale servers, they're used as co-processors. CAD-CAM, artificial intelligence — their total addressable market is exploding.We think there's a lot of sustainability to the company and a long trajectory for earnings growth.IBD: You have exposure to the pet care industry. What do you like there?Moberg: It's shocking how well we treat animals now vs. 20 or 30 years ago. Cancer treatment, CT scans — they were unavailable years ago. So we like the secular trend. The company we like most and have owned longer and have the largest position in is Idexx Labs (IDXX). Idexx is a particularly well-positioned business competitively, given its unique ability to single-handedly bundle both outsourced diagnostics and in-practice diagnostic instruments.  Idexx also offers superior information management capabilities regarding animal diagnostic reporting and record-keeping relative to competitors.IBD: What's special about Aspen Technology (AZPN), the software firm?Moberg: They do supply-chain management for process industries. This software is so important that even when companies go bankrupt, they pay their Aspen bill. It is the backbone for many companies.They have tremendous operating margin and profitability. There's some competition, but if you are a serious and large company, you need their technology. And customers are incredibly sticky.IBD: Tell me about your co-manager.Moberg: I am lead manager. The fund was founded in 1968. Rupert Johnson, my co-manager, was the fund's first manager. And as you may know he is also vice chairman of Franklin Resources.IBD: Matthew, people often wonder what portfolio managers do in their off hours. How about you?Moberg: I used to run 25 miles a week. I used to have hobbies. Now I have a 7-, 5- and a 1-year-old. They're my hobbies.And I forgot to mention that I'm an avid reader of history. I was a history major in college. I find that useful in looking at micro trends, adoption rates, periods of major and minor innovation, and pattern recognition of new technologies, as well as macro trends like low interest rates, Federal Reserve actions, periods and government responses.RELATED:Top Mutual Fund Manager Captures Solid Returns Without Messy EmotionsThis Top Mutual Fund Manager Wins With 3 Flavors Of Growth StocksHow Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund Targets Stocks With GiddyapHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The Downturn

90,PXD,"U.S. oil prices finished at the highest level in 15 months Wednesday, lifting shares in the energy sector and setting up buying opportunities for some shale stocks.West Texas Intermediate rose 2.6% to settle at $51.60 a barrel, and Brent futures added 1.9% to end at $52.67.U.S. oil has hit resistance at $50 earlier this year as investors feared prices at that level would induce more production and perpetuate the global supply glut. But markets are upbeat on hopes that OPEC and key non-OPEC oil-producing countries will soon agree to cut output.Also adding to oil's momentum Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported domestic oil stockpiles dropped by 5.2 million barrels last week. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said inventories fell by 3.8 million barrels. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting an increase of 2.7 million barrels.Shares of EOG Resources (EOG) rose 2.1% to end at 95.06 on the stock market today, after testing support at their 50-day average, to present a secondary entry point after a breakout in August.Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) climbed 2.7% to 189.03, also signaling a buying opportunity after an August breakout and rebound off its 50-day line.Concho Resources (CXO) rose 2.1% to 139.47, re-entering buy range after breaking out earlier this month.Meanwhile, integrated oil major BP (BP) edged up 0.2% to 36.05, closing in on a 36.93 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Global peers Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), however, are still making their ways though bases.IBD'S TAKE: As oil prices rise more IPOs are coming from the oil patch. Extraction Oil & Gas became the first exploration and production company to go public in two years and rallied in its trading debut last week.OPEC could formalize an agreement to trim out at its meeting next month. At the Oil & Money conference in London Wednesday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih asked non-OPEC producers to help stabilize the market along with OPEC members.""Market forces are clearly working after a testing period of sub-$30 oil prices ... .

91,PXD,"BP (BP) lowered its capital expenditure outlook for the year and was cautious on 2017, while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) downgraded its spending outlook for next year.BP now sees capex of $16 billion for 2016 vs. a prior guidance of $17 billion-$19 billion. Next year, the oil major sees $15 billion-$17 billion in spending.Shell still expects 2016 capital spending to be $29 billion, down 38.2% vs. 2014 levels. Looking ahead, Shell said capital investment for 2017 is expected to be $25 billion, at the low end of its $25 billion-$30 billion range.The company sees projects started this year adding more than 250,000 barrels of oil per day to production, but anticipates $50-per-barrel oil prices are here to stay.""We're planning next year on $50 a barrel,"" said CFO Simon Henry. ""We're planning the balance sheet for potentially even lower than that, and were building the portfolio to be robust at anything above $50 a barrel.""But oil prices are no longer above $50 a barrel. U.S. crude fell 0.4% to $46.67 a barrel after big drops in the prior two sessions. Brent crude fell 1% to $48.14 a barrel. Gasoline futures soared amid pipeline woes.Oil prices rallied over the summer but have since stalled amid doubts about OPEC's ability to curb production.Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said lower oil prices are still a ""significant challenge across the business, and the outlook remains uncertain.""BP shares fell about 4% to 34.11 on the stock market today, falling below its 50-day moving average Shell shares jumped 4.7% to 52.17.IBD'S TAKE: Cheaper service costs have helped oil majors cut spending, but Halliburton indicated in its Q3 report that discounts charged during the depths of the oil bust could be taken back soon. BP's third-quarter profit rose 35%, but downstream earnings fell 62% on weaker refining margins. Peers Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) also took a hit from lower refining margins.Shell's Q3 earnings climbed 18% as production rose from its acquisition of BG Group.Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Q3 reported an adjusted Q3 loss of 15, worse than the 11-cent per-share loss analysts were expecting. Revenue fell 15.8% to $2.73 billion, but beat analyst estimates.Production from continuing operations fell 12.2% but production in the Permian Basin was up by 5,000 barrels per day.Shares tumbled 6.4% intraday.Exxon was flat and Chevron shares rose 1.2%.After the market close, shale producers Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN) released quarterly results.RELATED:Oil Prices Could Crash To Low $40s If OPEC Deal Fails: GoldmanOil Rig Count Falls For First Time In 17 Weeks On Colorado DrillingExxon, Chevron May Face 'Investor Death Spiral' From Tesla, EVs

Performance has petered off in the second half of 2016.The energy sector's growth picture is expected to improve in Q3, but it remains a big drag this earnings season, Sheraz Mian, research director of Zacks Investment Research, wrote in a Monday note.With the Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) reports now behind us, Q3 results are in for nearly three-quarters of the sector's total market cap in the S&P 500 index, he added.Total earnings for these energy companies are down 58.8% from the same period last year on 15.1% lower revenue, with 77.8% beating EPS estimates and 38.9% beating revenue estimates.""The energy sector's results have come in better than expected, which has helped the aggregate growth picture for the index on the margin, but they nevertheless drag down the overall growth pace,"" Mian added.The energy sector fell four out of five sessions last week and contributed to SPY's 0.7% weekly decline.The SPDR S&P 500 exchange traded fund serves as a proxy for the broad U.S. market and sits 3% below its August high of 219.60.Here's a look at the performance of major exchange traded funds across key asset classes on the stock market today, with Relative Strength Ratings.The RS Rating measures a stock's price performance over the last 12 months vs. all stocks and ETFs, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), +0.1%, RS 53PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), +0.1%, RS 68SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), 0%, RS 53IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +0.2%, RS 53IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), -0.1%, RS 58IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -0.3%, RS 39Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), +0.6%, RS 72SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), -0.1%, RS 53United States Oil (USO), -2.6%, RS 53IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), +0.1%, RS 44PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), +0.4%, RS 53IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), +1.2%, RS 3

94,PXD,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) warned Friday that it could make the biggest reserves revision since its 1999 merger, if crude prices don't climb higher, as it faces investigations into how it values its assets.The oil major said 3.6 billion barrels of reserves in the Canadian oil sands and another 1 billion barrels in other North American plays could be taken off the books because they aren't profitable at current prices.Exxon noted that such a ""de-booking"" wouldn't affect the actual operation of related projects or change guidance on future production volumes.But the reserves warning comes as Exxon is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Attorney General for not writing down assets, which have lost value during oil's two-year downturn, according to reports last month.While crude prices have recovered recently, momentum has stalled in recent weeks. U.S. futures have hit a ceiling at about $50 per barrel, well below their pre-bust level above $100.Exxon shares dropped 2.5% to close at 84.78 on the stock market today, undercutting their 50-day and 200-day lines.IBD'S TAKE: Oil markets are expected to rebalance next year, but oil majors face another potential crisis as the rise of electric vehicles could make another contraction happen sooner than expected.Meanwhile, Exxon said Q3 earnings dropped 38% to 63 cents per share, but beat analyst views by 5 cents, as revenue fell 12.9% to $58.68 billion, under views for $61.34 billion.Capital spending dropped 45% and oil production dipped 5.1%, with natural gas production up 0.8%. Downstream earnings sank 66.7% to $1.2 billion. Upstream profit fell 16% to $620 million as refining margins in the U.S. were 35% lower than a year ago.Late Thursday, Exxon reported a large offshore find near Nigeria that could hold 1.4 billion barrels of oil.Chevron's (CVX) Q3 EPS fell 37.6% to 68 cents, smashing analyst views by 31 cents. But revenue fell 12.1% to $29 billion, slightly under views for $29.05 billion.The U.S. upstream loss narrowed to $212 million vs. $603 million a year ago, and the international upstream profit rose 0.6% to $666 million. Chevron's U.S. downstream profit sank 58% to $523 million and international downstream dove 43.7% to $542 million.Shares jumped 3.9% to 103.82.On Thursday, ConocoPhillips (COP) reported an adjusted net loss of 66 cents, a penny better than analysts expected on revenue of $6.52 billion. The oil company raised its full-year production outlook while lowering its capital spending guidance. Shares finished the trading day up 2.2% to 44.97.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and BP (BP) will announce quarterly results Tuesday along with shale exploration and production companies Devon Energy (DVN) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).

96,PXD,"Extraction Oil & Gas (XOG) became the first exploration and production company to go public in two years and rallied in its trading debut Wednesday after pricing above its expected range late Tuesday.Extraction raised net proceeds of $594.1 million after offering 33.3 million shares, priced at 19 each vs. the 15-18 range forecast. Extraction is based in Denver with operations in the Denver-Julesburg Basin.Its top shareholders include Yorktown Energy partners, a private equity and venture capital firm specializing in the energy markets, as well as asset managers Och-Ziff and BlackRock (BLK), according to an SEC filing.Extraction shares closed up 15% at 21.85 on the stock market today, off intraday highs.Independence Contract Drilling ICD was the last E&P company to go public, back in August 2014. Centennial Resource Production, an independent E&P in the Southern Delaware Basin, filed for a $100 million IPO in July but was then bought out by Silver Run Acquisition Corporation (SRAQ).Meanwhile, oilfield services provider Mammoth Energy Services (TUSK) is looking to raise $128 million, offering 7.75 million shares at a price range of 15-18. It will price Thursday and debut Friday, trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker TUSK.IBD's TAKE: IPOs in the energy sector have been slow since the oil price crash, but there have been plenty of IPO winners this year including Acacia Communications and Twilio. Extraction's IPO tested investors' appetite for energy shares as U.S. oil prices hover near year highs but also at a level that has acted as a ceiling this year. Some analysts have predicted prices will head back down, unless OPEC can hammer out a credible plan to cut production next month.It also competed for dollars with other shale producers like Diamondback Energy (FANG), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Oasis Petroleum (OAS), who have issued new shares and debt to help raise capital as traditional lenders turned squeamish on the sector when oil prices tanked earlier.The other energy-related debut Wednesday is Azure Power (AZRE). The  Indian low-cost solar power producer priced 3.41 million shares at 18, below the expected 21-23 range, and was down 17% at 14.89.RELATED: U.S. Crude Nears $50 As Stockpiles Fall For Fifth Straight WeekTexas Shale Firm Diamondback Energy Spikes To High On Production Outlook

99,PXD,"The stock market finished higher but off session highs with the S&P 500 unable to close above its 50-day moving average, as a duel over cancer drugs sparked major moves in pharmaceuticals Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).The Nasdaq rose 0.7% as biotechs and generic drugs ranked among the day's leaders. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5%, but closed below their 50-day lines after trading above that support level for much of the day.

Russia said it is willing to join other producing countries in limiting output to give oil prices a boost. Exploration, drilling, oilfield services and other related groups were among Monday's top 10.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), an exploration company that operates in Texas, broke out of a base-on-base pattern with a 191.04 buy point. Volume was lackluster, though.In the software sector, Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) broke out of an odd cup-with-handle base, topping the 26.31 buy point intraday. But volume was average also, and shares pulled back to a gain of 2.8% to 26.25. DA Davidson upgraded the publisher of electronics-design software to buy from neutral and raised the target price to 30 from 25.One of the keynote moves in today's market was in Big Pharma. Bristol-Myers was the stock under most selling on Stocks On The Move. Shares plunged 10% in massive volume to a two-year low after rival Merck revealed trial results for its lung-cancer drug Keytruda showing it is twice as effective as chemotherapy. The news sparked Merck's stock to a new high. Merck  rose 1.8% to 63.89 as it attempted to break out past the 64.10 buy point of a base.Acacia Communications (ACIA) flashed a sell signal. One of the darlings of the fiber-optics rally, Acacia tumbled 7.5% in heavy volume after diving 9% on Friday, breaking below its 50-day moving average.  It was the main reason why the fiber-optics industry group was the worst performing Monday, down nearly 2%.Banking stocks were active, and two small-caps are close to buy points. Centerstate Banks (CSFL), based in Davenport, Fla., poked above a 18.37 buy point of a flat base intraday but faded to close at 18.26. Sterling Bancorp (STL), the parent of New York-based Sterling National Bank, has an 18 buy point within sight.

100,PXD,"Oil prices are likely to remain volatile for the rest of the year, but some analysts believe U.S. crude will finally rise above $50 per barrel in 2017.Since the spring, West Texas Intermediate has topped the $50 mark repeatedly only to drop back below that level soon after. The price surged last week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to curb production, raising hopes for a more sustained price rally.Despite some doubts about whether the OPEC deal will hold, oil prices crept higher Monday, with WTI settling up 1.2% to $48.81, the highest in three months, and Brent up 1.4% to $50.89.Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst at Edward Jones, said via email that his company expects to see oil prices staying in the mid-to-high 40s before rising above the $50 ceiling next year. But he doesn't see shale companies increasing spending until oil is solidly in the mid-50s, and even then the ramp-up will be modest as firms remain conservative.For now, Youngberg is bullish on EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) for their ""flexibility both financially and operationally"" and Devon Energy (DVN), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Apache (APA) for their ""attractive acreage.""EOG shares closed down 0.6% to 96.11 on the stock market today. Pioneer edged down 0.1%. Devon added 0.2%. Marathon rose 1.1%. Apache climbed 0.1%.IBD's TAKE: The Permian Basin in Texas is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot.The U.S. Energy Information Administration said last month — before OPEC announced its plan to cut output — that it sees U.S. oil averaging below $45 a barrel this quarter and in Q1 2017, before topping $50 later in the year.Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody's analytics said the OPEC agreement put a floor on prices of $45 per barrel and while the cartel hasn't yet committed to the production cuts decided last week, he said it was clear that Saudi Arabia is struggling with low oil prices as it trims government workers' salaries and depletes its foreign reserves.""For some places, the point is that we think that current prices are sufficient to have a modest increase in investment, especially if companies are hedging oil prices and as prices continue to creep up,"" Lafakis said.U.S. shale companies have taken advantage of the rise in oil prices to lock in price risk for next year by hedging.""Hedging makes sense given uncertainty in markets, but many companies hedge on a regular basis and may just be taking advantage of the rise last week,"" Youngberg said. ""It may not be a bearish take, just a good opportunity to hedge given the recent flat price environment with oil stuck in the low to mid-40s.""RELATED: U.S. Oil Drilling To Jump Next Year As OPEC Looks To Scale BackU.S. Oil Rig Counts Rise Again On Permian, Williston Gains

The base that formed is too deep to be a flat base; flat bases show a decline of no more than 15% from head to toe.As seen in IBD's charts (access them via the ""Research"" section at Investors.com), Apache has now retaken its 50-day moving average, and its RS line -- which tracks performance against the S&P 500 large-cap benchmark -- is rocketing higher, a positive sign.Investors cannot rely on IBD's ratings to determine if energy shares are a good buy now, because the whole industry itself is in turnaround mode. When an industry's decline in the top and bottom lines have troughed, expect the best companies in the group to have middling EPS and SMR ratings at best. Don't expect the IBD Stock Checkup to be wine and roses, either.However, the RS Rating, the RS line and the industry group ranking can be very helpful in determining which ones have a higher chance of becoming new market leaders. In Apache's case, the strong RS line (drawn in blue in IBD's charts), the 74 RS Rating, and a 1.2 up/down volume ratio are all positive factors. Plus, while Apache is expected to get kicked in the shins again with a net loss of 64 cents a share this year, Wall Street sees fortunes turning with a profit of $1.16 a share in 2017.Other stocks in IBD's Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production industry group worth watching include Anadarko, which is clearing a 58.14 early entry within a bottoming base, Parsley Energy (PE) of Austin, Texas (EPS of 11 cents in 2016 expected, then exploding 345% higher to 49 cents in 2017), Mississippi-based Callon Petroleum (CPE) (EPS estimate 23 cents in 2016, 44 cents in 2017), and large cap play EOG Resources (EOG) ($52 billion market cap, EPS estimate of 53 cents in 2017).The U.S. oil and gas industry group currently ranks No. 7 among 197 IBD groups and subgroups in terms of six-month relative price performance.Encana (ECA), part of the international E&P group, is also acting well lately, rising 5% to 10.70, above a 10.53 pivot point within its long bottoming base.RELATED:What Is A Bottoming Base?

114,PXD,"Apache's (APA) Alpine High discovery in the Permian Basin will receive more than a quarter of its $2 billion 2016 capital spending budget, which was raised by $200 million to exploit a play that holds billions of barrels of oil, the company said Wednesday.The mountainous region had previously been dismissed by hydraulic fracturing experts but Apache said it spent the last two years exploring the basin's fracking potential and has drilled 19 wells in the region.The company estimates its acreage in the Barnett and Woodford formations alone holds 75 trillion cubic feet of gas and 3 billion barrels of oil, with ""significant oil potential"" in the Pennsylvanian, Bone Springs and Wolfcamp formations, according to a statement.""While other companies have focused on acquisitions during the downturn, we took a contrarian approach and focused on organic growth opportunities,"" said CEO John Christmann in the statement. ""These efforts have resulted in the identification of an immense resource that we believe will deliver significant value for our shareholders for many years.""He added later that ""Apache clearly has more profitable-growth opportunities than at any other time in the company's 60-year history.""Apache shares jumped 6.7% to 55.13 on the stock market today. The stock had climbed as high as 14% to 58.99 Wednesday, nearing a 59.69 buy point. Shares of Parsley Energy (PE), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Diamondback Energy (FANG), which are also big Permian players, were down 1%, up 2.6% and 1.45% higher, respectively.U.S. crude futures closed up 1.5% to $45.50 a barrel and added to those gains in late trading, following reports that the American Petroleum Institute's inventory survey showed a decrease of 12.1 million barrels last week.The Energy Information Administration raised its U.S. output forecast for the year to 8.77 million barrels a day in 2016, as drilling rigs in operation rise and wells become even more productive. EIA also raised its 2017 production estimate by 200,000 barrels per day to 8.51 million.IBD'S TAKE: The Permian is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil and investors should look at shale oil companies with large assets in the Texas play. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot. But the Alpine High discovery is still in early innings and the play could still fail to live up to its lofty promise. But James Williams, an economist at WTRG, said that historically companies underestimate reserves.So far the Alpine High basin has produced more natural gas than oil, but production costs are so low, some of the natgas wells in the area break even at 10 cents per million British thermal units, Apache said. Natgas futures are currently trading at $2.72.At an industry conference Wednesday, Christmann said that in some parts of Alpine High, the company can ""virtually get gas for free.""Exploration and production companies have been shifting their focus toward investing more in the lucrative Permian. EOG Resources (EOG) said Tuesday it would purchase privately held Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the region.EOG shares dipped 0.5% to 94.32 after spiking 6.7% to a 52-week high Tuesday.Related: Facebook, Lockheed, EOG Price Targets Raised; Conoco UpgradedPermian-Focused Parsely, Laredo Benefit From Low-Cost Shale Center

115,PXD,"The major averages reversed from small opening losses and are mildly higher Wednesday afternoon as energy stocks rallied with oil prices.Oil stocks rebounded sharply following the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Crude oil supplies rose by 1.4 million barrels in the latest week. But gasoline inventories showed a sharp drop of 3.3 million barrels, while U.S. crude production also fell.West Texas Intermediate oil futures jumped 3.5% to $40.89 a barrel. Oil closed below the $40 level on Tuesday for the first time since April 18.The Nasdaq composite, down less than 0.2% in the early going, moved 0.2% higher. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial also are up roughly 0.2%.The Dow transports, down more than 2% on Tuesday, as noted in Tuesday's Big Picture column, gained 0.9%.Spirit Airlines (SAVE), a former big winner, recovered to trade flat in the afternoon, but that followed a 5% tumble Tuesday. The Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based discount airline has been in a slump since April 2015. Reports of locally transmitted cases of the Zika virus in Miami are certainly not helping Spirit, which has big operations in Miami and Latin America.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) was leading the U.S. oil exploration shares in the stock market today, rising 2% to 162.72 in fierce turnover. The large-cap play broke a 19-month downtrend in April this year and has been forming a base since May. The base shows a relatively mild decline of 15%, meaning it qualifies as a flat base. The potential pivot point is 171.98.Last week's positive reversal in heavy volume hinted at a return of institutional demand. Pioneer's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B; a C+ grade or higher suggests that institutions are becoming net accumulators of the stock.Elsewhere in the market, Paycom Software (PAYC) roared nearly 6% higher to 50.05, notching new highs in big volume. Late Tuesday, the payroll and HR software expert posted a 110% leap in Q2 profit to 21 cents a share, smashing the 13 cent Wall Street consensus view. The stock is extended 18% past a 42.70 cup-with-handle entry. Paycom ranks No. 4 in the IBD 50.IBD'S TAKE: The cup with handle is one of the most important chart patterns that investors can learn to time their buys in a great stock for maximum return and minimum loss.

120,PXD,"Saudi Arabia and Russia no longer have the largest oil reserves in the world as that title now belongs to the U.S., thanks to shale-recovery methods, according to a study released by Rystad Energy.The study also found that U.S. producers are focused on their most productive plays as oil prices stay near $50 per barrel. U.S. crude tumbled nearly 5% on Tuesday though.Total global oil reserves are at 2.1 trillion barrels, said the report, which was released Monday. The U.S. has 264 billion barrels of recoverable oil from existing and undiscovered deposits. Russia has 256 billion barrels and Saudi Arabia has 212 billion, according to the Financial Times.Just three years ago, the U.S. wasn't even in the top three, standing behind Russia, Canada and Saudi Arabia.But the rise of hydraulic fracturing or fracking changed all that. For U.S., over half of remaining oil reserves is in unconventional shale oil, with more than 60 billion barrels of it in Texas. Rystad said there could be even more surprises from the U.S. as more reserves are found in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, the Times said.On Tuesday, Brent tumbled 4.3% to $47.96 per barrel, falling back below $50 as worries of a global economic slowdown in the wake of ""Brexit"" continue.

The boost in drilling could flood the market with new oil and push prices lower, according to a report by Morgan Stanley cited by Bloomberg.The analyst found that exploration and production companies added 13 horizontal rigs in the top counties vs. eight rigs for the rest of the play. Pioneer shares fell 1% to $149.60.

The continued decline in U.S. oil output has been joined lately by overseas developments to help lift prices.Militant attacks on Nigerian oil infrastructure and political struggles out of Venezuela have weighed on global supply. Demand from China is near a record high, and it is rising in India.If the trend continues, investors should keep an eye out for oil companies poised to break out into buy range.

125,PXD,"General Electric (GE) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) stocks are each forming a new base, hoping the second time around is a charm after an earlier attempt failed.GE broke out of a cup-with-handle base in March, hitting a new high in early April before retreating. Since then it's been setting up in a first-stage flat base with a 32.15 buy point. The stock is holding above its 200-day moving average but below its 50-day line.Early in the year, fading forecasts for a Fed rate hike pushed the dollar lower, boosting prospects for General Electric exports and overseas operations. But as odds for a Fed action returned in the spring, the dollar strengthened and GE came under pressure. Friday's dismal jobs report appears to have taken a rate hike off the table for June and perhaps much longer.General Electric is in the midst of a major transformation into what it calls a digital industrial company, shedding its image as a stodgy maker of industrial equipment. ""All of our products are becoming data centers,"" GE Digital Chief Executive Bill Ruh told IBD in a recent interview.GE shares closed up 0.6% at 30.12 in the stock market today.Pioneer Natural Resources, an oil and gas exploration company, also formed a cup-with-handle base from late 2015 to early April, with a 145.97 buy point. It failed to gain traction as the energy slump lingered into early 2016. But in late April it began working on a flat base in sync with a nascent oil rebound.The price of West Texas Intermediate crude shot up more than 88% in a four-month run-up from February lows, with U.S. crude flirting with $50 on Monday. Analysts generally agreed that oil supplies are set to begin rebalancing after the glut caused by the U.S. fracking boom and by the Saudis and others pumping oil at high volume levels to retain market share.Pioneer Natural is heavy in the rich Permian Basin that extends from West Texas into New Mexico, which has some of the most efficient and lowest-cost wells in the U.S.Pioneer shares fell 56% from an all-time high at 234.60 in July 2014 to a bottom at 103.50 on Jan. 20 of this year before turning up.

Boyd Gaming hit a record high of 21.42 on April 13, but you could say it's still in a consolidation going back to early November.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) continues to report improved — though not yet strong — results. For Q1 the Irving, Texas-based oil and gas company recorded a 64-cent loss, vs. a 3-cent loss in Q1 2015, better than the expected 78-cent loss. It was the fourth quarter in a row that Pioneer Natural Resources has topped earnings estimates. Revenue fell 21% to $685 million amid the continuing oil industry slump. Analysts expected $737 million.Notably,  Pioneer Natural Resources was producing 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 55% was oil, and production grew by 3% or 7 million barrels a day compared to the prior quarter and was significantly above Pioneer’s Q1 guidance of 211-216 million barrels.Shares climbed 3% late after closing up 0.2%.

128,PXD,"Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said he wouldn’t consider adding drilling rigs until oil prices reach $60 a barrel, and the first rigs could be headed to North Dakota.The price is higher than what others have said would spark more drilling. Pioneer Resources (PXD) said last week it would add five to 10 drilling rigs when oil hits $50 a barrel. Some analysts have put the price at $45-$55. U.S. crude futures rose 1.2% to $44.32 a barrel.But the usually brash Hamm sounded more cautious on a conference call Thursday, saying he wants to see a sustainable price recovery before adding rigs and that drilled but uncompleted wells would first be brought online.""It will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs,"" he said.Continental shares jumped 13.9% on the stock market today, after reporting late Wednesday that its Q1 adjusted per-share loss widened to 41 cents from 9 cents a year ago, missing views by 4 cents. Revenue from crude oil and natgas sales fell 30.7% to $403.6 million, below views of $441.22 million. But Continental boosted its 2016 output guidance.EOG Resources (EOG) said late Thursday that it swung to an adjusted loss of 83 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny, from a year-ago profit of 3 cents a share. Revenue fell 41.6% to $1.35 billion, below forecasts of $1.67 billion.When asked about the Bakken’s prospects in the long term as it competes for capital against newer plays like the Stack and Scoop plays in Oklahoma, Hamm said that assets in the older play would be more valuable in the future. But management said it was looking at the possibility of selling some of its non-core assets.Meanwhile, other oil and gas producers continue to raise production outlooks after first-quarter results.Occidental Petroleum's (OXY) loss, adjusted to account for discontinued operations and non-recurring gains, was 56 cents per share, swinging from a gain of 4 cents a year ago. Analysts were expecting a loss of 40 cents a share. Revenue fell 26.5% to $2.28 billion, below analyst estimates of $2.35 billion.But the company said its Permian production rose 30% year over year while operating costs in the area fell 33%. Total oil and gas operating costs were 23% lower.Occidental also raised its full-year production growth outlook for the year to 4%-6%. Occidental shares climbed 3%.Elsewhere, Apache's (APA) adjusted loss widened to 40 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 89 cents a share. Revenue fell 35% to $1.05 billion, under views for $1.1 billion.Apache shares tacked on 8%. The company drilled and completed 47 gross-operated wells in its North America on shore operations in the first quarter.""Apache's first-quarter performance was characterized by notable achievements in operations, drilling and further cost reductions. Despite a continued decline in our drilling activities, we delivered strong production results in North America Onshore,"" said Chief Executive John Christmann IV. ""Results in the Permian Basin were particularly strong with solid performance from our base production and very good results from maintenance projects and new drilling.""He said drilling and completion costs in key onshore plays were down 45% from 2014.Apache raised its full-year 2016 North American onshore production outlook to 268,000-278,000 barrels per day, up from an earlier outlook of 263,000-273,000 barrels.But Jason Wangler, a managing director at Wunderlich, told Investor's Business Daily earlier that most companies gave low production guidance in the fourth quarter in the hopes of beating it and drilling activity wouldn't start increasing  until oil hits $50-$55 per barrel for a sustained period.Exxon Mobil (XOM) also said Thursday it is teaming up with FuelCell Energy (FCEL) to develop new fuel cells to capture carbon emissions.The companies are working on creating technology that would lessen carbon dioxide emissions from natural gas power plants and other large emitters.""Carbon capture configuration has the added benefit of eliminating approximately 70% of the smog-producing nitrogen oxide generated by the combustion process of these large-scale power plants,"" said FuelCell Chief Executive Chip Bottone.Exxon shares edged up 0.1%. FuelCell rose 5.75%.

129,PXD,"Continental Resources (CLR), Concho Resources (CXO), Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) and Noble Energy (NBL) raised their production targets Wednesday as costs came down further, but a broader rebound in drilling activity isn't likely until oil prices hit $50.Continental now sees full-year average production of 205,000-215,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up from its prior outlook of 200,000, citing strong Q1 performance. But that is still down from 2015 average output of 221,715.""The resilience of our production has allowed us to increase our production guidance for 2016 without increasing capex,"" said CEO Harold Hamm. ""This reflects the quality of our assets and the success of our enhanced completion technology.""Continental also brought online a net 10 wells that had been drilled and completed in 2015, but not actively produced until Q1.Shares rose 2% after hours.Concho sees 2016 production to be flat, up from an earlier outlook for a 5% drop to no change. Carrizo increased the low end of its full-year crude production growth target by 9% to 24,800-25,300 barrels per day, up from a prior outlook of 24,700-25,300 barrels per day. But that is still down from Q1 production of 25,806 barrels per day, up 21%, and 2015 output of 36,719 barrels.“Well-cost expectations in the Eagle Ford are now down to $4.1 million from $4.6 million previously,” said Carrizo CEO Chip Johnson in the earnings release. “This has allowed us to increase our activity in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford Shale without increasing our planned capex for the year.”Noble, meanwhile, raised its 2016 sales volume target to 405,000 barrels a day from a prior outlook of 390,000 barrels, which was essentially flat vs. 2015 after adjusting for the Rosetta acquisition.The company said total well costs fell 35% in Q1 in the Wells Ranch portion of the DJ Basin in Colorado.Jason Wangler, a managing director at Wunderlich, said that most companies gave low production guidance in Q4 in the hopes of beating it.“They kind of put out numbers that if you looked at the forecasts you thought this production is really going to fall off a cliff,"" he said. ""They did this under the belief that they’ll put out a low number to start and hopefully top that and just take one beating instead of four or five in a row.”Other companies haven't signaled an increase drilling activity. Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it wasn’t going to remove a rig it had scheduled for removal. Sanchez Energy (SN) has said it was running two rigs but cut it to one rig in Q2. Pioneer Resources (PXD) said last week it would add five to ten drilling rigs when oil hits $50.Wangler believes that companies won’t increase activity, including finishing drilled but uncompleted (DUCs) wells, until oil hits $50-$55 per barrel.Mark Hanson, an equity analyst at Morningstar agrees. “On the whole prices just haven’t risen to levels that would incentivize E&Ps to ramp up production.”He thinks U.S. crude would have to be at $50 for at least two quarters before companies would even think about boosting production not just seeing a short-term rise from an event like an OPEC meeting or supply disruption due to violence in the Middle East.Meanwhile, shale producers continued to see falling revenue in Q1.Continental’s Q1 adjusted per-share loss widened to 41 cents from 9 cents a year ago. Analysts were expecting a 37-cent per-share loss. Revenue from crude oil and natgas sales fell 30.7% to $403.6 million, below views of $441.22 million.Concho swung to an adjust loss of 5 cents a share, missing views for a break-even quarter, as revenue sank 31% to $283.6 million.Carizzo's adjusted Q1 earnings rose 14.3% to 16 cents per share, above the 13 cents Wall Street analysts were expecting. Revenue fell 11.2% to $132.4 million, under views for $123.4 million.Shares closed down 1.2%  in the stock market today. Oil gave up gains following the Energy Information Administration’s report that crude stockpiles climbed by 2.8 million barrels last week, above views for a 1.7 million barrel increase, though production fell 1.3% to 8.825 million barrels per day.Noble swung to a loss of 53 cents per share in Q1 vs. a year earlier, but it beat analysts’ views of a 57-cent per-share loss. Revenue fell 4.6% to $724 million, falling short of views for $784.5 million.Capital expenditures were $374 million, below the company’s expectation, and it sees full-year capex under its original $1.5 billion estimate.“Significant capital efficiency gains and outstanding operating performance, combined with robust liquidity, position us well in any price scenario,” CEO David Stover said in the earnings release.Noble shares rose 1.1%.Late Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) said that its adjusted Q1 loss deepened to $1.12 a share, but that beat views for a loss of $1.16. Anadarko’s revenue sank 28% to $1.67 billion, below views of $1.81 billion. But sales volumes in the Delaware Basin of west Texas rose by 47%. In the DJ Basin of northeastern Colorado, sales rose 11%.

130,PXD,"Top shale oil producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG) are on tap to report quarterly results this week and could give an update on when drilling might start again after crude prices jumped 20% last month.U.S. oil prices are nearing the break-even level of $45 to $55 per barrel, when some producers could start bringing wells online.Some producers may have even started pumping when oil hit $40 per barrel. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Sanchez Energy (SN), which are active in Texas, already reported results in April. Pioneer boosted its 2016 production growth outlook to 12% from an earlier outlook of 10%, helped in part by increased output from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp zones.Sanchez reported a 25% rise in first-quarter production to 56,500 barrels of oil per day, above its 48,000-52,000 guidance, on better-than-expected results in the Eagle Ford’s western Catarina region. The producer brought 11 new wells online in the area.Late Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) reported that its adjusted Q1 loss deepened to $1.12 a share, beating views for a loss of $1.16, while revenue sank 28% to $1.67 billion, below views of $1.81 billion. But in the Delaware Basin of west Texas, Anadarko grew sales volumes by 47%. In the DJ Basin of northeast Colorado, sales rose 11%.Despite the recent sharp rally in oil prices, some shale companies may wait and see how sustainable the upswing really is. EOG Resources  Chairman Bill Thomas said at an industry conference in March that his company won’t rush to boost output right after oil hits $60 a barrel.Producers also have to wait for capital markets to reopen and for workers and rigs to come back. Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, has said it could take nine months to a year before production ramps up again.Market headwinds also remain. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped out 32.64 million barrels per day in April, near a new high, according to a Reuters survey. Oilfield service provider Baker Hughes (BHI) has said it doesn’t expect activity “to meaningfully increase in 2016,” but U.S. rig counts may stabilize in the second half of  the year.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO)  and Noble Energy (NBL) will announce quarterly results before the market opens Wednesday.Analysts see Carrizo's earnings staying flat at 14 cents a share but revenue is expected to fall 17.2% to $123.44 million.  Noble is seen posting a 57-cent per-share loss vs. a 3-cent per-share profit a year ago. Revenue is expected to rise 3.4% to $784.5 million.Continental Resources reports late Wednesday, and analysts expect its Q1 per-share loss to widen to 37 cents from a 9 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 24.6% to $439.52 million, marking a fifth straight decline. After its Q4 report, Continental said it had suspended fracking in the Bakken Shale formation.Concho Resources (CXO) and Marathon  will announce results after the market closes on Wednesday.Analysts see Concho breaking even vs. an EPS of 36 cents a year ago. They see revenue rising 9.9% to $454.2 million. Marathon's loss is expected to widen to 46 cents a share from a 37 cent a share loss a year ago. Revenue is seen plunging 41% to $903.3 million.EOG Resources will report results late Thursday, with analysts expecting a loss of 84 cents a share vs. EPS of 3 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 28.1% to $1.67 billion.Meanwhile, Apache (APA)  and Occidental Petroleum (OXY)  will issue results early Thursday. Apache is expected to report a 90-cent per-share loss, down from a 37-cent per-share loss a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 39.3% to $1.1 billion. Occidental is expected to swing to a loss  of 40 cents a share vs. EPS of 4 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 24.2% to $2.35 billion.

131,PXD,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- As U.S. oil prices near $45 per barrel, some producers could start bringing wells online, with more than 1 million barrels a day in Texas alone ready to be tapped.Shale companies have held off on completing thousands of wells, choosing to save money and wait for oil prices to rebound. Drilling accounts for 40% of a new well's cost, while completion accounts for 60%, according to Suzanne Minter, manager of oil and gas consulting at Platts Analytics, in prepared remarks to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Tuesday.Producers also have been improving efficiency and slashing costs, which means that they can pump oil profitably at lower prices. The breakeven price is now about $45-$55 per barrel, depending on the play, Minter said, adding that she wouldn't be surprised if some producers start to pump at $40 a barrel.On Tuesday, U.S. crude futures rose 3.3% to settle at $44.04 a barrel, and Brent climbed 2.8% to $45.74.If producers in Texas alone decided to complete all their 2,500 drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells at once, they could add 1.25 million barrels of oil per day to the world market, Minter estimated.Production from Texas DUCs could come back on fairly quickly, as completion times average 30 days. But Minter cautioned that the response could take longer if producers don't have enough cash or labor on hand.Some shale producers with major operations in Texas are already seeing some growth.On Monday, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), which is active in the Permian Basin in West Texas, boosted its 2016 production growth outlook to 12% from an earlier outlook of 10%, helped in part by increased output from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp zones.Last week, Sanchez Energy (SN), which operates in south Texas, reported a 25% rise in first-quarter production to 56,500 barrels of oil per day, above its 48,000-52,000-barrel guidance, on better-than-expected results in the Eagle Ford’s western Catarina region. The producer brought 11 new wells online in the area.Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie reportedly has said that Pioneer plans to complete some of its wells this year, along with Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Hess (HES).Pioneer shares jumped 7.6% in the stock market today. Sanchez shares were up 1.3%. Cabot added 2.3%, Oasis rose 3.5%, and Hess gained 2.2%.With more production potentially coming back back online, more dramatic price swings could be ahead, warned Minter.Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, also noted that bringing wells online may not happen that quickly.""It will take a little longer than what people think -- nine months, 12 months -- because you have to get the capital markets back open again, workers to come back and rigs to come back,"" he told the Senate committee.Meanwhile, Iran is also working on bringing more crude back to the market as it looks to boost production to presanction levels.So far this month, exports rose to 1.75 million barrels per day, up from 1.6 million barrels a day in March, according to Reuters, citing an industry source.But an Iranian official said that production is around 3.5 million and that exports will hit 2 million in May.
"
132,PXD,"More U.S. oil bankruptcies should pile up as shale producers continue be collateral damage in the geopolitical rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, whose new leadership has shown it would rather inflict pain on Tehran than rebalance oil markets.Oil prices fell sharply immediately after a meeting of top OPEC and non-OPEC countries in Doha, Qatar, failed Sunday to result in an agreement to freeze production at January levels. But prices recovered some losses Monday on reports of a labor strike in Kuwait.Brent crude closed down 0.4% at $42.91 a barrel, and U.S. crude fell 1.4% to $39.78. Oil stocks reversed higher. Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 1%, BP (BP) gained 1.3%, Chevron (CVX) added 1.5%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) edged up 0.35%.Despite Monday's stock gains, prospects for U.S. producers look gloomier.“The Doha disaster will now make it less likely that U.S. oil producers will bring production back online quickly,” Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote in a note. “Companies that were hoping that an accord would keep them in business will give up those hopes and more production destruction will occur.”Shale firms had been more resilient than initially expected as efforts to lower production costs helped keep companies like Continental Resources (CLR), EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) drilling for longer.But the prolonged slump in prices is sending more oil companies into bankruptcy. Magnum Hunter Resources, Energy XXI and Goodrich Petroleum have already filed for bankruptcy protection and more are on the horizon, according to James Williams, a WTRG Economics analyst.“Even if this meeting had been successful, it wouldn’t have kept some companies off the edge,” he told IBD.Since the summer of 2014, when oil prices started to fall, about 60 North American oil and gas companies have filed for bankruptcy, the law firm Haynes & Boone has estimated. And a study in February by Deloitte found that a third of U.S. producers are at high risk of filing.Oil needs to be around $50-$60 a barrel to prevent more companies from going over the edge, Williams said. A price above $50 is needed just to maintain production, with any increase requiring a $60-$70 range, he added.But U.S. prices have been below $50 since last July, and U.S. production has fallen from a peak of 9.61 million barrels a day in June 2015 to 8.98 million in the latest week, according to the Energy Information Administration.Last week, the EIA cut its total 2016 U.S. production forecast to an average of 8.6 million barrels per day from last month’s prediction of 8.7 million, and trimmed its 2017 forecast to 8.0 million from 8.1 million.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries have pumped more oil and won't back down. Saudi Arabia and Iran are waging proxy battles in Yemen and Syria, diminishing hopes for cooperation on oil.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producers wouldn’t agree to an output freeze Sunday unless Iran and others joined, according to Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, who called Saudi Arabia’s demand “unreasonable.” Iran is against any freeze because its production in January remained well below historic levels as sanctions over its nuclear program had only just been lifted.Qatar’s energy minister, Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada, said the producers need more time. OPEC will hold its next meeting June 2, but analysts already are skeptical about the prospects for any progress then.Flynn said the Doha meeting’s failure showed that longtime Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi has “lost control of the Saudi oil market” and that decisions would be coming from King Salman and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who would be more swayed by political issues.“That makes the Saudis a less reliable energy partner and creates more havoc and uncertainty in the global oil markets,” he wrote. “It seems this new crew of princes are more aggressive, more abrupt, less interested in oil politics and more interested in sending a message to their enemies.”
"
133,PXD,"Oil rigs in three of the nation's most prominent shale formations continued to shut down in the wake of energy companies such as Continental Resources (CLR), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Whiting Petroleum (WLL) recently announcing moves to scale back their operations.Rigs in the Eagle Ford formation in South Texas fell by one to a total of 40 for the week ended March 4. Permian Basin rigs, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, declined by six to 156, while the Williston basin, located in eastern Montana, southern Canada and the Dakotas, saw its rigs fall by three to 33.Eagle Ford's rig count has plunged 80% since early October 2014. Permian rigs are down 72%, and Williston rigs have fallen 83% since that time.The rig count decline comes after Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum, two of the largest oil producers in North Dakota's Bakken formation, announced cutbacks. Last month, Continental stopped completing Bakken wells in Q3 2015. The Oklahoma City-based company reported net losses of $354 million in 2015.Whiting Petroleum announced plans in Q2 to stop completing its wells in North Dakota as well as Colorado's DJ Basin formation. The Denver-based company last month reported a $2.2 billion net loss last year, including a $1.5 billion writedown in its oilfields' value.Also last month, Pioneer Natural Resources reported a fourth-quarter loss of $623 million, less than analysts expected. But it also announced plans to cut its rig count in half to 12.Shares of all three companies have steadily declined since mid-2014, as crude oil prices plunged about 70%. But all three companies have rallied to some degree, as crude oil, which was trading below $27 per barrel earlier this year, climbed to nearly $38 per barrel.
"
134,PXD,"Continental Resources (CLR), a top producer in the Bakken shale formation, said Wednesday it has ceased fracking operations there amid the continued slump in oil prices.The bellwether shale company had already planned to defer most Bakken completions in 2016. It has four operated drilling rigs in the North Dakota Bakken with plans to maintain that level through the year.But Continental said it currently has ""no stimulation crews deployed in the Bakken.""Shares were up 2% in after-hours trading in the stock market today.Continental posted an adjusted net loss of 23 cents per share in Q4, down from a profit of $1.14 per share a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a loss of 21 cents per share. Revenue sank 55.6% to $575.5 million, above views for $568.2 million.But Continental was bullish on acreage in its STACK play in Oklahoma, and expects an average estimated ultimate recovery of 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per well.""Our overpressured Meramec wells in STACK are delivering some of the highest returns in the Company,"" said COO Jack Stark in a statement. ""We clearly have another high impact, long-term platform for growth underlying our 155,000 net acres of leasehold in STACK.""The company plans to average four-to-five operated drilling rigs in the STACK play in 2016.Last month, Continental guided 2016 capital spending to $920 million, down 66% from 2015. It also sees production falling during the year on lower drilling and well completion activity.Other shale companies reported Q4 results below estimates late Wednesday and further reduced capital spending plans.Concho Resources (CXO) swung to a Q4 adjusted loss of 7 cents per share from a profit of 88 cents per share a year ago, missing views for a profit of 4 cents a share. Revenue sank 34.5% to $389.2 million, well below views of $525.4 million.Concho sees 2016 capital spending of $1.1 billion-$1.3 billion vs. $1.8 billion in 2015, which was already a 20% drop from 2014. The company expects full-year 2016 production will be flat-to-down approximately 5% vs. 2015.Shares were unchanged late.Oasis Petroleum's (OAS) earnings tumbled 85.7% to 5 cents a share, missing analyst estimates by a penny. Revenue fell 39.2% to $182.1 million, under views for $238 million.Oasis set its total capex budget at $400 million, down from $610 million in 2015, when it dropped 61%.For the year, Oasis said that 70% of its projected oil volumes are hedged to more than $51 per barrel for U.S. crude. On Wednesday, West Texas Intermediate futures settled at $32.15 a barrel, up 0.9%.Oasis shares jumped 4% after hours.Unlike Exxon Mobil (XOM)  and other integrated oil majors, shale producers don’t have downstream operations that benefit from cheap oil to help cushion profit during price slumps.Earlier this month, Cabot Oil & Gas' (COG) quarterly results swung to a loss and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) posted a better-than-expected loss but cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.EOG Resources (EOG) reports Thursday. EOG is expected to swing to a 31 cent per-share loss down from a per-share profit of 79 cents. Revenue is expected to fall 53.2% to $525.4 million.Earlier Wednesday, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) said it is closing its unconventional resources unit, with its shale assets becoming part of its upstream business, and projects in Canada becoming part of its downstream unit.Chesapeake Energy's (CHK) Q4 results swung to a loss and revenue fell 47.5%. The oil and gas producers said it has signed deals to divest $700 million in gas fields and other assets, well above its $200 million-$300 million target, and plans to sell $500 million-$1 billion in additional assets this year. Chesapeake will also cut 2016 capital spending by 57% to $1.3 billion-$1.8 billion and sees production falling by as much as 5% excluding asset sales.Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said that U.S. inventories rose by 3.5 million barrels vs. the 7.1 million barrel build the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported late Tuesday. Analysts expected a rise of 3.4 million barrels. 
"
135,PXD,"Saudi Arabia's oil minister quashed hopes for a near-term rally in crude prices Tuesday, ruling out a production cut while also dismissing worries of oversupply and slowing demand.At the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston, Ali al-Naimi said there would be another meeting among top producer countries, possibly in March, to freeze production and ease high inventories.But a production cut ""is not going to happen,"" he said. ""Not many countries are going to deliver, even if they say they would cut production.""Instead, al-Naimi thinks it's “easier to freeze production and let demand rise and some inefficient supplies decline.""Brent fell 4.1% to $33.72 per barrel Tuesday, and U.S. crude lost 4.6% to $31.87. Top oil stocks followed, with Exxon Mobil (XOM) closing down 1.4%, Chevron (CVX) down 4.4%, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) down 4.1% and BP (BP) down 4.3%.James Williams, a WTRG energy economist, said Saudi Arabia could still cut production later, noting the next OPEC meeting in June ""is a good time to start talking about quotas"" and offers three more months of data on declining U.S. output.But he doesn't expect Saudi Arabia to let prices go past $50 per barrel, which would spark new drilling in North America.Omar al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, pointed out that Saudi Arabia and Iran have cut off diplomatic ties with each other, and Russia is engaged in a proxy war in Syria against other OPEC members.""The idea of cutting production is never going to work in the near future,"" he told IBD. ""In order for a cut to work, you need to be able to effectively monitor each other.""Al-Ubaydli sees a drop in production from global oil markets over the next 12 months, as output from older oil fields decreases and new investment slows.""Output will decrease, but not because cartel members are sitting at a table playing with numbers,"" he said.Still, Williams noted, OPEC has survived even when member countries were at war with each other, like Iraq and Kuwait at the beginning of the 1990s.Al-Naimi also said Tuesday that he doesn't have any concerns about demand, which ""remains strong."" Markets, however, have been worried that slowing global economic growth, especially in China, could dampen oil demand.And he appeared to brush off supply fears, saying he welcomes new supplies, including shale oil. The boom in U.S. shale over the past decade has been a major driver of the current oil glut.Al-Naimi's remarks come as Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar, Venezuela, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to freeze their production at January levels, but only if countries such as Iraq and Iran also participate.Iraq and Iran have said they support a freeze but won't commit to join in limiting output. On Tuesday, Iran appeared unlikely to participate.Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said the proposal to cap output at January levels puts ""unrealistic demands"" on Iran, according to state-run media. Iran’s production last month remained well below historic levels, as sanctions from the West had just been lifted over its nuclear program.The probability of Iran and Iraq agreeing to a freeze eventually is ""fairly high,"" Williams said, but not until Iran boosts daily production to 4 million barrels a day, roughly its production before the sanctions.Iraq will have a hard time agreeing to terms as its central government doesn't control the oil flows from the Kurdistan region, Al-Ubaydli noted.Speaking to a room of shale firms, al-Naimi added that high-cost producers ""must find a way to lower their costs, borrow cash or liquidate."" Later he said that ""inefficient and uneconomic producers will have to get out.""Unconventional drilling is more expensive than traditional means, but shale producers have been resourceful as oil stays lower for longer. Companies were able to weather the low-price environment in 2015 by slashing costs, payrolls, drilling rigs and capital expenditure budgets. They also used new techniques on their most efficient, productive wells.But gains from drilling innovations, such as using higher sand concentrations and higher proppant volumes, are expected to slow this year, and costs have less room to drop.Top shale firms report Q4 results this week, and the latest news is expected to be grim. Earlier reports pointed to further deterioration. Last week, U.S. shale producer Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) swung to a loss below analyst views, and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.Continental Resources (CLR), Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Concho Resources (CXO) are expected to announce results this week.Cabot shares plunged 10.6%. Pioneer shares fell 4.35%. Continental shares lost 3.4%. Oasis plunged 9.5%. Concho shares fell 4.3%.

Cabot Oil & Gas (COG)  swung to a loss below analyst views as oil prices stay lower for longer. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) posted a better-than-expected loss but cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.Continental Resources (CLR) and other bellwether shale players are on tap in the coming week.Continental, Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Concho Resources (CXO) are scheduled to report fourth-quarter results Wednesday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Continental swinging to a quarterly loss of 21 cents per share from a per-share profit of $1.14 a year ago. Revenue is seen plunging 56.2% to $568.2 million.Last month, Continental guided 2016 capital spending to $920 million, down 66% from 2015. It also sees production falling during the year on lower drilling and well completion activity.Continental is one of the few large independent E&P companies that haven't issued a round of job cuts, and CEO Harold Hamm has predicted that oil could hit $60 per barrel by the end of the year.Analysts expect Oasis's quarterly EPS to plunge 83% to 6 cents. Revenue is seen falling 20.6% to $238 million.Wall Street sees Concho Resources' earnings tumbling 95.6% to 4 cents per share and revenue down 11.6% to $525.4 million.EOG Resources (EOG) reports Thursday.

171,PXD,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: July Performance Report 
"
172,PXD,"Large-cap growth mutual funds leaped ahead of peers in a markedly volatile month for U.S. equities in July. Investors shunned risk as worries grew over Greece and China and the earnings season got off to a fitful start.
"
173,PXD,"TCW Select Equities , a $1.8 billion large-cap growth fund, was a top-performing mutual fund last month. It vaulted 8.2% after eking out less than 1% gains the previous three months. Its 31 stock holdings include Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), Starbucks (SBUX) and Visa (V).
"
174,PXD,"The average large-cap growth mutual fund rose 3.3% in July and was up 7.7% for 2015 as of month-end.
"
175,PXD,"""When the market moves to uncertainty, investors move to growth stocks and safety,"" says David Kalis, a senior co-portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion Calamos Growth Fund .
"
176,PXD,"Calamos Growth is up 8.9% year to date vs. 3.4% for the S&P 500 index. The fund gained 3.1% in July.
"
177,PXD,"Internet and biotech stocks drove the performance of large-cap growth funds, Kalis added. And mergers and acquisitions continue to propel biotechs.
"
178,PXD,"In July, Celgene (CELG) — a top 10 holding in TCW Select and No. 11 in Calamos Growth — acquired Receptos (RCPT) for $7.2 billion.
"
179,PXD,"""Almost a week doesn't pass when you don't have one or two deals out there,"" Kalis said. ""It's a pretty easy way to make money in the market, but is a reflection of the low interest rate environment and not fundamentals.""
"
180,PXD,"Another factor that buoyed large caps: the annual Russell index rebalance in June.
"
181,PXD,"Several poor-performing energy stocks such as Halliburton (HAL) and Pioneer (PXD) moved upon rebalancing from the Russell 3000 growth index to its value counterpart.
"
182,PXD,"That gave an additional boost to growth funds in July, Kalis said.
"
183,PXD,"U.S. diversified equity funds rose 0.8% on average in July. They're up 3.4% year to date, with growth funds crowding the top end and value funds bringing up the rear.
"
184,PXD,"By comparison, world equity funds gave up nearly a full percentage point in July. They gained 3.7% in 2015 as of month-end.
"
185,PXD,"Mutual funds holding China stocks sold off violently last month.
"
186,PXD,"The Shanghai Composite Index slumped 8.5% in late July, pegging its worst one-day drop since 2007. Weak industrial profit aggravated concerns about a stock market bubble in the world's second-largest economy.
"
187,PXD,"China region funds overall plunged close to 10% last month on worries about the slowdown. They're still up 4% year to date after the big run-up in Chinese equities in the first half of 2015.
"
188,PXD,"Emerging markets funds stumbled more than 5% in July and almost 4% year to date as of July's end.
"
189,PXD,"They've been hurt by their big stakes in China and Latin America.
"
190,PXD,"Latin American funds shrank nearly 8% in July, taking 2015 losses to 14.6%. Stocks in the region have been gutted by the rout in oil and gas prices.
"
191,PXD,"Energy commodity funds suffered a 13% hit in July, making them the worst performers among commodity funds.
"
192,PXD,"Precious metal commodity funds also underperformed, stumbling 6.9% last month. Precious metal equity funds — such as gold mining companies — gave up nearly 19%.
"
193,PXD,"That made them the biggest laggards among sector funds. Gold and silver equities are a leveraged play on the commodity itself.
"
194,PXD,"Against that backdrop, health/ biotech funds rose a relatively tidy 2.9% in July. Their science and technology counterparts gained 1.1%. Year to date, the two sectors continue to outperform, with 20.7% and 5.2% advances, respectively.
"
195,PXD,"How To Invest
"
196,PXD,"The health sector's outperformance is drawing some caution.
"
197,PXD,"Kalis points out health care stocks have risen about 80% since 2010, with about 90% of that rise due to multiple expansion and not earnings increases. Only 30% of the tech sector's 70% run-up in that period is from P-E expansion.
"
198,PXD,"""Health care stocks right now are caught in this issue with M&A, biotechs and FDA approvals,"" he said. ""That creates speculation in the market. I'm cautious on health care from a valuation perspective, but very positive on technology.""
"
199,PXD,"Kalis believes growth stocks will continue to do relatively well as global uncertainties linger. ""It will be hard for cyclicals to do well"" through year-end, he added, as sharply declining commodity prices weigh on the economy.
"
200,PXD,"At Russell Investments, strategists urge caution ahead of a Fed move to raise rates. ""The U.S. dollar, U.S. Treasuries and U.S. equities are all expensive ahead of this Fed shift, and the outlook for corporate profits is far more subdued,"" they wrote in a Q3 update report. ""Within global equities, our favored exposure is Europe, while we are neutral on Japan and emerging markets as well as underweight the U.S.,"" they added.Best Mutual Funds 2015: July Performance Report Large-cap growth mutual funds leaped ahead of peers in a markedly volatile month for U.S. equities in July.

""A lot of naysayers have said that it wouldn't have worked in the $100 oil price environment because the cost of the wells were way too high.""Goodrich's stock price issues come from its weak balance sheet and concerns about its ability to weather the oil price drop, not from its wells in Tuscaloosa, he added.The company said it still has the ability to ""enhance liquidity by pursuing a potential joint venture or sale of its Eagle Ford Shale asset.""Shale producers held off on completing drilled wells to wait for oil prices to recover. With crude nearing a threshold that could trigger more completions, analysts have said production could ramp back up quickly.But on Tuesday, at the Energy Information Administration conference, Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said completing drilled wells will have little impact on production levels in the near term.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

"
205,PXD,"It's been an interesting week for anyone keeping an eye on the oil supply scene. On Wednesday, a tentative cease-fire began in the fighting between Saudi Arabia and Houthi rebels in Yemen. The conflict had forced oil prices higher on fear that the Houthis could seize control of the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a major oil passage midway between the Persian Gulf and the Suez Canal.
"
206,PXD,"Also on Wednesday, the International Energy Agency released its Oil Market Report for May, saying global supply continued to grow by 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in April. The gains were driven by output increases in Iran and Iraq, as well as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' largest player, Saudi Arabia, which churned out a record 10.3 million bpd.
"
207,PXD,"That led the IEA to hand the first round of the contest primarily between the Saudis and U.S. shale oil producers to the Saudis. OPEC production rose; U.S. output declined during the month. The Saudis appear unlikely to alter their stance at next month's scheduled OPEC meeting.
"
208,PXD,"An unnamed Saudi official told the Financial Times on Thursday that ""the price fall of the last several months has deterred investors away from expensive oil, including U.S. shale, deep offshore and heavy oils.""
"
209,PXD,"The battle is far from over, the IEA report said. The price of the near-month oil futures contract dived 53% between July and mid-March. Drilling rigs in operation contracted 60% over the past several months, and U.S. production buckled in April, the IEA said.
"
210,PXD,"Oil prices have recovered 30% from their March low through Thursday. The level of $55 a barrel is acting, at least for now, like a possible floor under prices.
"
211,PXD,"On the corporate front, EOG Resources (EOG) said on May 4 it would restart shuttered fracking operations if prices stabilized near $65. A week earlier, Whiting Petroleum (WLL) said it would boost production if prices hit $70. Others set to pull the production trigger include Pioneer Resources (PXD) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY).
"
212,PXD,"That points to at least two possible scenarios. U.S. domestic production could grow slowly, spooning supply back into the global market until prices move down to a reasonable level.

213,PXD,"The more probable scenario: Domestic producers will pile willy-nilly back into production mode, sending inventories soaring and threatening another price collapse.It's been an interesting week for anyone keeping an eye on the oil supply scene.

U.S. domestic production could grow slowly, spooning supply back into the global market until prices move down to a reasonable level.The more probable scenario: Domestic producers will pile willy-nilly back into production mode, sending inventories soaring and threatening another price collapse.
"
214,PXD,"Oil prices are nearing a magic number that could spur shale producers — who have become more efficient — to pump more, but Saudi Arabia will likely keep prices from rising much higher so it can defend its market share.
"
215,PXD,"The world's top oil exporter has shown no signs of easing up on its strategy of keeping prices low to drive out higher-cost producers like U.S. shale firms. Saudi crude production hit a fresh record high last month: 10.3 million barrels a day.Saudi Arabia could put another million barrels a day or more on the market, said James Williams, an analyst at WTRG Economics. It would come in addition to the 2 million barrels a day in surplus output already coming from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.That means that the oil prices preferred by U.S. shale firms, which have become the swing producers that rebalance world oil markets, will be more pivotal.""OPEC's role shifted to allow U.S. shale producers to determine the maximum price for oil,"" Williams told IBD.Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm has said that a U.S. crude price of $70 per barrel would spark more production growth. Whiting Petroleum (WLL) recently said that it would add drilling rigs if crude prices hit $70.Hitting A Ceiling?Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) plans to add rigs in July if prices continue to stay around the low 60s or higher, and EOG Resources (EOG) said that it would boost production if prices stay around $65 per barrel.Markets have taken notice. Doubts are growing about whether oil's strong rally since April can be sustained. On Friday, U.S. crude futures dipped 0.3% to $59.69 a barrel, adding to a retreat from more than $61 a barrel, reached days earlier.Meanwhile, the collapse in U.S. oil rigs is starting to bottom out. Baker Hughes (BHI) said that the rig count dropped by eight in the last week, the smallest decline since December. And Energy Department data show that U.S. oil output has already peaked and is now tilting lower.WTRG's Williams said that there isn't a single magic number that would work across all shale companies, because production costs vary by play and within zones in each play. But he said that a U.S. price of about $75 per barrel would be enough to start increasing production.Any ramp-up in U.S. output could happen quickly. Even as prices plunged last fall and winter, shale companies continued drilling wells but held off on completing them. As a result, they can keep the oil in the ground in order to store it until prices rise enough for them to extract it profitably.Sitting On A 'Fracklog'A recent analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence puts this so-called ""fracklog,"" or backlog of wells, at 4,731, with 322,000 barrels a day underground.With this looming fracklog, and with oil prices nearing a green-light threshold for U.S. producers, OPEC members will likely maintain production levels at their next meeting June 5.In addition to forcing U.S. firms to cut production, the cartel's other goal is to stimulate the world economy with lower oil prices, according to Williams. Customers in key markets like Asia would then boost demand, helping OPEC and Saudi Arabia grow their market share.But as fracking becomes more efficient, the breakeven price for shale could get much lower, potentially pushing the Saudis to take the long-term threat of U.S. producers more seriously.U.S. firms have narrowed their focus to the most productive areas of a shale play, a practice called high grading. Oilfield-services companies have had to lower prices. Technology and techniques are still improving. For example, drillers have been ""zipper fracking"" — to tap multiple wells from a single drilling pad — to keep costs down.""There has been a lot of skepticism on (the Saudis') part regarding the long-term viability of U.S. shale,"" said Tamar Essner, energy analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services. ""It just seems that they don't really believe in it as a long-term thing.""But she added that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members are waiting to see what shale producers will do next as they become more efficient.

239,PXD,"The crude export ban has been in place since the 1970s and was designed to protect domestic energy supplies.

And no matter what - the market is now second guessing everything they do....because it has been disappointed over and over again...and then she sends out the troops to deliver different messages as she tries to calm the markets......As Bryan Carter - Former US Treasury Economist and now lead PM at Acadian Asset said -""They are creating the conditions that are causing the external environment to be weak, and then they say they can't hike because of those same conditions that they have created.""European markets are bucking the trend - as they move higher....seemingly ignoring the Chinese PMI data and the growing VW scandal (which still remains a company-specific problem - not an industry problem) yet this issue has taken 41% out of the value of VW since the news broke.....FTSE + 1.5%, CAC 40 +0.94%, DAX + 0.83%, EUROSTOXX + 1%, SPAIN +0.77% and ITALY +1.4%.US futures are up 8 handles at 1940 as trader types are following in Europe's footsteps - ignoring the negative news out of Asia.........Now yesterday - we traded right down to support at 1925ish......and bounced.....as the day wore on - we found plenty of bargain hunting going on as they rallied them off the lows towards the end of day....I suspect the market wants to once again try and rally around the 1950 level on the S&P.....but any move much above that will surely be met with resistance as the trader types move in and out taking advantage of the volatility.Expect volumes to be light today as many participants are away for the Jewish holidays...Take good care.KpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O'Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

270,PXD,"Texas has squarely reaffirmed its status as king of the oil patch. Oil coaxed from the rapidly developing Eagle Ford and Permian Basin production areas recently lifted the state's output back above 3 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time in more than three decades. That put the Lone Star state at more than a third of total…

271,PXD,"Parsley Energy hit the ground running in its stock market debut this spring.
"
272,PXD,"Fueled by prospects for heady growth in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas where it operates, Parsley Energy (PE) stock spurted 20% above its initial public offering price to close at 22.20 on its first day of trading on May 23. And the company's shares have traded mostly at or above that price since.
"
273,PXD,"Why the hot IPO reception from investors? ""It's somewhat sector related,"" said Cindi Profaca, managing director of IPOfinancial.com. ""Energy stocks in general have done very well this year. Obviously, with the need for us to be able to extract more oil reserves from resources in the U.S., people see this as a good play getting in right as the company is going public.""
"
274,PXD,"The vast majority of Parsley Energy's 111,644 net acres are in the Midland Basin, a subarea of the Permian Basin. And most of its identified vertical and horizontal drilling locations are located in the core area of the Midland Basin. The majority of its reserves and production are positioned in the ""stacked pay"" fairway of the Spraberry, Wolfberry and Wolftoka trends.
"
275,PXD,"From the time it started drilling operations in 2009 through the end of March 2014, it has drilled and placed in production over 400 vertical wells in the Midland Basin.
"
276,PXD,"Sideways Strategy
"
277,PXD,"In 2013, Parsley Energy began increasing its focus on a horizontal drilling development program, which CEO and founder Bryan Sheffield sees as having the potential for far greater returns than the basin-leading returns it is achieving from vertical drilling, as has already been proved by other operators in the area.
"
278,PXD,"Parsley Energy had placed on production three horizontal wells, had one well being finished and another being drilled as of April 30.
"
279,PXD,"Sheffield is eying more opportunities with its horizontal drilling program. 
"
280,PXD,"""I am excited about transitioning to a horizontal driller over time, which will in turn help us execute on our growth strategy,"" Sheffield told IBD. ""We have accumulated a core position in the sweet spot in the Midland Basin.
"
281,PXD,"""I feel like we have enough acreage to ramp up on horizontal rigs and plan to run six by 2015 (from two working currently) as well as maintain our seven to eight vertical rigs.""
"
282,PXD,"He hopes to achieve ""substantially greater returns"" with horizontal drilling than what Parsley Energy is achieving with vertical drilling, which is ""generating basin-leading returns.""
"
283,PXD,"""The whole goal is to capture the stacked-pay potential through horizontal drilling,"" he added.
"
284,PXD,"Stacked pay refers to multiple productive oil and gas formations on top of each other ""like a sandwich,"" said Sheffield.
"
285,PXD,"He says that means Parsley Energy can drill multiple horizontal wells on top of each other.
"
286,PXD,"Drilling Techniques
"
287,PXD,"Horizontal drilling is a technique used in certain formations where a well is drilled vertically to a certain depth, then drilled at a right angle within a specified interval.
"
288,PXD,"Parsley Energy has been successful with its initial horizontal drilling efforts, says Renaissance Capital analyst Nick Einhorn.
"
289,PXD,"""At the time of the IPO, Parsley had results from its first horizontal wells, which were pretty strong,"" he said. ""Early on, what they're trying to do with horizontal drilling is working. Generally, the Permian Basin has been pretty attractive for a few years because of its potential for very strong returns from horizontal drilling.""
"
290,PXD,"Most of the publicly traded companies in that area have benefited from ""strong returns"" from horizontal drilling, he added.
"
291,PXD,"Einhorn says Parsley Energy is one of the faster-growing publicly trade companies in the Permian Basin.
"
292,PXD,"He cites the fact that the company's average net production tripled in the first quarter from a year earlier to 9,163 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
"
293,PXD,"""The growth should continue to be pretty high,"" said Einhorn. ""But they're spending a lot in capex (capital expenditures) to drive the growth.
"
294,PXD,"""There's no question they're going to grow fast. The question is how their growth relates to capex spending to drill the wells. That's the challenge of valuing fast-growing E&Ps (exploration and production companies).""
"
295,PXD,"In an initiation report on Parsley Energy, JPMorgan analyst Joseph Allman noted that the company's core acreage in and around Midland, northern Upton and southern Martin counties in Texas, as well as its tier 1 acreage outside of its core, should ""allow the company to grow production and reserves at strong double-digit rates for the next several years.""
"
296,PXD,"He estimates the company will boost production 120% in 2014 and 70% in 2015 compared with the exploration and production group median of 13% in 2014 and 16% in 2015.
"
297,PXD,"As of March 31, the company had identified 1,594 80- and 40-acre potential vertical drilling locations, 1,986 20-acre potential vertical drilling locations and 1,681 potential horizontal drilling locations on its existing acreage, which includes only 20 vertical locations in its Gaines County (Midland Basin) acreage, according to a company filing with the SEC.
"
298,PXD,"It also started a vertical appraisal drilling program in the Delaware Basin during the 2014 first quarter and expects to drill three vertical appraisal wells this year.
"
299,PXD,"Through this effort, the company has identified a multiyear inventory of 3,580 potential vertical drilling locations and 1,681 potential horizontal drilling locations on its existing acreage, excluding its Southern Delaware Basin acreage.
"
300,PXD,"Energy IPOs
"
301,PXD,"Parsley Energy is one of a handful of oil exploration and production companies that have launched IPOs since the start of this year, including RSP Permian (RSPP), Rice Energy (RICE) and Enable Midstream Partners (ENBL).
"
302,PXD,"Parsley Energy began operations in August 2008 when it acquired operator rights to well producing from the Spraberry Trend in the Midland Basin from Joe Parsley, a co-founder of Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co.
"
303,PXD,"Parker & Parsley merged with Mesa Inc. to create Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).
"
304,PXD,"Bryan Sheffield is the son of Pioneer's CEO Scott Sheffield.
"
305,PXD,"Parsley Energy ""grew organically from scratch,"" from two employees at its inception to about 125 today, said Bryan Sheffield.
"
306,PXD,"Followers are upbeat about the company's prospects.
"
307,PXD,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2015 earnings to spurt 105% to 84 cents a share from the 41 cents anticipated for 2014.

309,PXD,"Stocks traded quietly higher in light volume with a little more than one hour remaining in Monday's session.The Nasdaq and S&P led the way, rising 0.5% and 0.4% respectively. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking considerably lower than Friday's levels.In the stock market today, big buyers were in online travel firm Priceline.com (PCLN) ahead of its earnings report next week. Shares rose 3.5%. It's been basing since March and is now flirting with a breakout over 1292.76. The base, however, hasn't shown much in the way of accumulation. Earnings are due Aug. 11 before the open.Elsewhere, China-based growth names led the IBD 50 higher. Autohome (ATHM), which caters to automobile buyers in China, jumped 9% ahead of its earnings report on Thursday.China-based YY (YY), BitAuto (BITA) and TAL Education (XRS) also did well in the IBD 50, rising anywhere from 4% to 6%.Amgen (AMGN) rallied 2% in strong trade after the company reported positive late-stage trial data for its blood-cancer drug Kyprolis. Amgen cleared a cup-with-handle pattern last week. It's now 4% above a buy point of 123.21.On the downside, another wave of institutional selling hit Michael Kors (KORS). Shares dived nearly 7% after the company reported earnings before the open. Once again, earnings and sales growth came in much better than expected, but increased markdowns took a tool on profit margin.The after-hours session will be busy with another round of earnings reports.

310,PXD,"Pioneer Natural Resources shares jumped Wednesday after the Texas-based oil company got the OK from Washington Tuesday to export oil. Refiners' shares sank on the news.Domestic drillers Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) received approval from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security to export condensate, a type of ultralight oil, reported the Wall Street Journal. Shipments can begin as early as August and likely will be small.The ruling probably will encourage other oil producers to ask for export permission, and the Commerce Department is working on an industrywide approval, according to the report. But as of Tuesday, the department said ""no change in policy on crude-oil exports"" has been made. By midafternoon, Pioneer Natural shares had traded up 4% to 230.57 in the stock market today, Wednesday. Enterprise Products shares rose 1.1% to 76.97.Separately Tuesday, Enterprise announced plans to build a 1,200-mile pipeline to connect the Bakken play in North Dakota to the oil pricing hub of Cushing, Okla.The pipeline will have a daily capacity of 340,000 barrels of oil and should be operational by the end of 2016.The Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production group is highly ranked at No. 3 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks.Only refined petroleum products can be exported under current laws. The ban started in the 1970s as an attempt to protect Americans from price spikes caused by Middle Eastern countries and OPEC using oil as a political weapon. But with the new influx of oil from previously unreachable plays in the Dakotas and Texas, many analysts and lawmakers believe that the ban is outdated.Refiners are the biggest opponents to lifting the ban and have benefited from the discount of light crude in the U.S., sending refined products abroad at much higher prices.Valero Energy (VLO) shares fell 10.6% to 50.08. Phillips 66 (PSX) fell 5% to 80.60.The IBD Oil & Gas-Refining/Marketing group is ranked at No. 17.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich.

311,PXD,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

341,PXD,"Rapid adoption of the latest and greatest technology is often the route to commercial success. But sometimes it pays to hang back a bit and wait for others to perfect leading-edge tools while exploiting advantages in the processes and tools they have left behind.
"
342,PXD,"Such has been the path of Athlon Energy (ATHL), a Permian Basin oil exploration outfit that is still drilling mostly vertical wells even as its peers race to capitalize on the advantages of horizontal drilling.
"
343,PXD,"Founded in 2010, Athlon went public in an August 2013 IPO. Its founders came from Encore Acquisition, an exploration firm founded by Texas oilfield veteran I. Jon Brumley. Like other outfits headed by him, Encore had extensive drilling experience in the Permian.
"
344,PXD,"That's significant because the key to Athlon's growth since its founding has been management's grasp of the 70,000-square-mile Permian, which stretches from western Texas into the southeast corner of New Mexico. By buying leases from smaller operators in drilling zones that had not been drilled horizontally, Athlon picked up producing vertical properties for pennies on the dollar.
"
345,PXD,"Low-Cost Buildout
"
346,PXD,"Eli Kantor, analyst with Iberia Capital Partners, estimates that Athlon built its huge position of 109,000 net acres in the Permian's Midland Basin at an average cost of less than $5,000 an acre. Today, he notes, similar leases are going for $25,000 an acre.
"
347,PXD,"Athlon, says Kantor, has followed the old industry maxim that ""the best acquisition companies are the best development companies.""
"
348,PXD,"It was able to buy some acreage on the cheap in Howard County, Texas, because many doubted its suitability to horizontal drilling. And it scarfed up leases from smaller operators who lacked the capital and expertise to even try.
"
349,PXD,"""They have been buying in areas where there's a little more risk and not as much horizontal drilling experience,"" said Kantor.
"
350,PXD,"Wells Fargo analyst David Tameron describes Howard County as ""less sexy"" than other Permian hotbeds. (Wells Fargo was an underwriter on Athlon's IPO).
"
351,PXD,"As a smaller producer, he explains, they picked up parcels of land that Permian giants like Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Chevron (CVX) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) might have spurned.
"
352,PXD,"""It was easier to acquire smaller pieces because the big guys didn't want to bother,"" said Tameron.
"
353,PXD,"With everyone racing to drill horizontally, Athlon got discount pricing on vertical rigs. A lot of vertical rigs were just ""sitting around,"" said Tameron. Again, an opportunistic ploy by a firm redirecting toward the latest technology.
"
354,PXD,"Despite the questions about drilling horizontally in Howard County, Athlon executives knew they could drill vertically through multiple hydrocarbon layers.
"
355,PXD,"And, as Kantor said, ""They have enough vertical data to give them confidence of horizontal results.""
"
356,PXD,"Now Athlon boasts a deep inventory of more than 3,900 vertical drilling sites. It's also testing the feasibility of horizontal drilling.
"
357,PXD,"If successful, horizontal wells could provide a meaningful production kicker. RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold said Athlon has ""a big upside opportunity if they can drill successfully horizontally in Howard County."" (RBC has been an underwriter on Athlon equity offerings.)
"
358,PXD,"Meanwhile, vertical wells are workhorse producers. In a Jan. 24 update, Athlon claimed average daily production in the fourth quarter totaled 14,689 barrels, a 69% increase from the year before.
"
359,PXD,"Full fourth-quarter earnings will be reported Tuesday after the market close, but Athlon said it expects 2014 production to expand by 62% to 70%. RBC Capital's Hanold expects 45% growth in 2015.
"
360,PXD,"Athlon's huge inventory of vertical drilling locations lends stability to the company's production outlook. Upside will come from success in its nascent horizontal drilling program.
"
361,PXD,"The key question: ""Does horizontal drilling work in Howard County?"" said Tameron. ""Nobody knows for sure if horizontal works.""
"
362,PXD,"Athlon has recently reported good horizontal drilling results on two Howard County locations.
"
363,PXD,"This has encouraged analysts. With the stock recently trading above $33, Tameron estimates it already has a net asset value of $37.
"
364,PXD,"That assumes that just 25% of its potential horizontal drilling sites pan out. If Athlon has success on 50% of its horizontal locations, that would bump net asset value ""another $10,"" noted Tameron.
"
365,PXD,"Like other exploration firms riding the wave of increased output via new drilling techniques, Athlon does face challenges.
"
366,PXD,"In the Permian, water availability is a concern. Hydraulic fracturing of shale requires huge quantities of water. As drillers drain west Texas water resources, supply is a lurking issue. ""It's a big risk for everybody,"" said Tameron. ""It's a hurdle everybody has to overcome.""
"
367,PXD,"Yet as a driller in oiler-friendly Texas, Athlon does not face the political and environmental opposition that clouds prospects for drillers in Colorado and parts of the northeast's Marcellus Shale.
"
368,PXD,"The Oil Price Question
"
369,PXD,"Athlon is also well hedged against oil price declines — at least for this year. Tameron estimates that 75% of Athlon's 2014 production is hedged around $92 a barrel.
"
370,PXD,"Still, just 7% of 2015 production is hedged, so a sustained price drop could hurt.
"
371,PXD,"Price stability is critically important to oil exploration outfits. Kantor says he recently met with institutional investors who expressed ""concern about oversupply.""
"
372,PXD,"It was oversupply from shale drilling that sent natural gas prices reeling several years ago. Could supply now streaming out of the Permian, the Marcellus, Colorado and North Dakota lead to a sharp decline in domestic oil prices?
"
373,PXD,"Most drillers, says Kantor, would still fare well with prices of $80-$90 a barrel. But if oil falls below $80 a barrel, producer balance sheets would be ""stressed,"" he added.
"
374,PXD,"The chief rationale for new technology is greater efficiency.

398,PXD,"Here's another clip for the China scrapbook: China-based energy firms led the world in oil and gas-related acquisitions in 2013, with a big piece of that representing a move into North American shale oil and natural gas.A Jan. 2 report from IHS showed overall deal activity declined 20% in 2013 after notching a 10-year high — with more than $250 billion in deals — the year before. Asset-based transactions dropped 15%. Corporate mergers declined 50%, with no single deal announced at more than $5 billion, IHS said.China's Cnooc (CEO) closed its $15.1 billion acquisition of Calgary, Alberta-based Nexen in February. Because the deal was announced the prior year, it was tallied in the 2012 M&A count.In 2013, China's largest refiner, Sinopec (SNP), paid $1.02 billion for a 50% stake in Chesapeake Energy's (CHK) 850,000 acres in northern Oklahoma shale assets called the Mississippi Lime.In May, Sinochem closed on its $1.7 billion purchase of a 40% share in Pioneer Natural Resources' (PXD) 207,000 acres in west Texas' Wolfcamp development.Analysts generally read the deals as strategic moves by Chinese companies to gain shale production expertise, which they can then translate to China's nascent shale gas industry. China has the world's largest shale gas reserves, according to the Energy Information Administration.Despite those deals, purchases of U.S-based shale and other unconventional assets, after a three-year run of transactions totaling more than $200 billion, slowed sharply.Buyers became more cautious, IHS said, as cross-border deals slowed and oil and gas companies turned their attention to ""exploiting the best performing areas of their vast development inventories.""As a result, North American-based acquisitions were only three of the 20 largest deals during the year. Asset-based deals dropped to a five-year low. Corporate gas and oil mergers slowed to a 10-year low.In October, Australian big-block mining and energy name BHP Billiton (BHP) announced it would trim its shale holdings in Texas and New Mexico.The company spent $20 billion snapping up U.S. shale assets in 2011 — just as natural gas prices headed for 12-year lows.

400,PXD,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Mexico is hopeful it will join Canada in importing U.S. crude, as exemptions to Washington's oil export ban grow.Sending light shale crude from the U.S. to Mexico in exchange for Mexico's heavier crude is ""under active consideration"" by Washington, said Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz at the Energy Information Administration's conference Monday. ""With Mexico's energy reform, a lot of things are different.""There is demand for Mexico's heavier crude as refineries in Louisiana and other Gulf states are fitted to process heavy crude, not the light stuff coming from the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin.But the export ban isn't in Moniz's ""bailiwick,"" and the Commerce Department needs to approve the deal.Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Mexico's state-run oil company, applied for the swaps last year, though no updates have been given to the status of its request.But Mexico doesn't want to push the U.S. into speeding up the decision, according to Leonardo Beltran Rodriguez, Mexico's deputy secretary for planning and energy transition.The crude export ban has been in place since the 1970s and was designed to protect domestic energy supplies and reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East and other overseas players. But some shipments to Canada are allowed under the law, and exports of refined products aren't affected.While lifting the export ban outright might not come for several years, more exemptions are gaining momentum. Last June, the Commerce Department gave Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) approval to export minimally processed condensate, a type of ultralight oil.Mexico is eager to improve energy relations with its northern neighbor. Rodriguez also emphasized how important ""integration"" is as it opens up its energy industry. Mexico is already working on building 10,000 kilometers of natural gas pipelines with the U.S.In December of 2013, Mexico declared the start of its energy reform, allowing Pemex to keep its monopoly on oil but partner with foreign firms on development projects.Rodriguez expects total investments in the oil and gas sector of $50 billion to $60 billion over the next four years.U.S. companies are poised to take advantage of Mexico's energy revolution.

410,PXD,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Continental Resources' (CLR) CEO argued Tuesday for removing the ban on exporting crude oil from the United States, saying that ""Cowboyistan"" producers already face limits on domestic buyers as foreign companies acquire U.S. refiners.Foreign countries own 28% of U.S. refining capacity, or about 4.9 million barrels per day, according to Harold Hamm. Venezuela owns the most, with Canada second and Saudi Arabia third.Two-thirds of U.S. refining capacity handles heavy crude, like that from Venezuela and Mexico, leaving only 6 million barrels per day of refining capacity for the light, sweet crude coming from Cowboyistan's Eagle Ford, Permian and Bakken plays in Texas and North Dakota.""A lot of our refiners are being converted for other people's use,"" Hamm said at the Energy Information Administration conference.So while American crude is stuck inside the U.S. to compete against imported oil for refining, global refining capacity can handle 64 million barrels of the lighter crude, with Europe and Southeast Asia among those markets, Hamm noted.Continental Resources shares ticked up 0.1% to 46.82 on the stock market today. U.S. crude futures were up 0.7% to $59.94 per barrel. Brent was flat at $63.95.Calls for lifting the export ban — which began in the 1970s to protect Americans from price spikes — intensified after oil prices sank last fall and winter, and forced companies to shut down drilling activity. Domestic producers say that opening up more markets for exports would keep the U.S. shale oil flowing.But Hamm acknowledged that even when production starts to recover, it takes three to four times longer to restart production than to take it offline. So if removing production takes six months, putting it all back online will take two years.Hamm and others believe that the export ban is outdated now that the U.S. has entered into an energy ""renaissance"" with horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.""We know lifting the ban would de-intensify the Middle East,"" he said. ""And we need to get supplies to our allies in Europe who are so dependent on Russia.""Hamm said that unlike exporting liquefied natural gas, exporting oil could happen quickly as the U.S. already has the infrastructure in place to send crude abroad.Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and ConocoPhillips (COP) all support lifting the ban, with only some smaller independent producers against, Hamm said.The export ban hasn't protected American jobs from predatory practices by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has shown no signs of easing up on its strategy of keeping prices low to drive out higher-cost producers like U.S. shale firms.Hamm estimates that the drop in oil prices has directly and indirectly affected half a million jobs related to the oil industry.He believes that the ban will be lifted and says that two bills are currently under consideration in Congress. But while lifting the export ban outright might not come for several years, more exemptions are gaining momentum. Last June, the Commerce Department gave Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) approval to export minimally processed condensate, a type of ultralight oil.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

567,PXD,"The energy sector appears to be gaining strength on the final day of April. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Anadarko Petroleum (APC) reached new highs on Monday.Both oil stocks are slightly out of buy range. Watch for a potential light pullback that could offer a second chance to buy shares.Both companies belong to the U.S. oil and gas exploration & production industry group. It ranks No. 9 among 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance. Leading stocks tend to come from leading industry groups or high-ranking sectors.The oil and gas E&P group ranked 49th three weeks ago and 79th six weeks ago.Pioneer closed Monday with a healthy gain and finished 6% past a 190.05 buy point. Translation: the stock is a bit extended in price. Try to buy stocks that break out as close as possible to the proper entry point. You can buy up at a price higher than that, but no more than 5% above. So for Pioneer, the ""5% buy zone"" goes up to 199.55.What if you bought, say, 10% or 15% above the proper buy point. If the stock sinks fast and tries to test that buy point, you might get snagged with a loss of 7%, 8% or more in a normal pullback. That would force you to follow the golden rule of investing.IBD research has found that, in general, 4 out of 10 true market winners break out of a good base, then retreat to or mildly below the proper buy point for a short period. After that shakeout, they resume their run-up to new highs.Pioneer got very productive in 2017. The Irving, Texas-based producer boosted its revenue 61% to $5.46 billion, the biggest top-line increase since a 77% jump in 2010. Also last year, Pioneer earned $1.15 a share, reversing a two-year streak of net losses.The Street expects Pioneer to earn $1.50 a share in the first quarter of this year. It lost 78 cents a share in the year-ago period. Watch for results to arrive after the close Wednesday.Anadarko Petroleum is also a tad out of buy range. In Monday afternoon trading, shares held 7% above a 63.15 buy point. How to find that buy point? Add a dime to the highest price in the roughly two-week handle it formed starting the week ended March 30.That handle is part of a gigantic cup base that shows a 73.33 peak on the left side.Anadarko is set to report Q1 results Wednesday before the open. Analysts see earnings soaring 167% to 40 cents a share even though revenue may drop 20% to $2.99 billion. In the year-ago period, Anadarko's sales bulged 125% to $3.77 billion.

568,PXD,"More than $1 billion a day. That's the price tag for a Permian Basin pipeline crunch that's increasingly affecting investors as much as it is West Texas oil drillers.Eight of the top explorers focused on the booming U.S. shale region have lost $15.6 billion in combined market value in about two weeks, as shipping constraints devour the profit they can fetch for a barrel of crude. Parsley Energy (PE) shares have wilted 16% in that time; Diamondback Energy (FANG) has been defanged, down 18%.Even as production soars, dwindling pipeline space and a rail and trucking shortage have raised shipping costs, boosting the discount Permian producers take to offload their oil. The bottleneck benefits refiners who can buy cheaper crude and pipeline owners with extra space, but it's dragging down explorers.""You just don't want to touch these Permian names,"" said Gabriele Sorbara, a Williams Capital Group analyst in New York. ""They are falling off a cliff.""Relief may not come until 2020, when new pipelines are expected to be up and running. For now, here's a rundown of winners and losers amid the space crunch:Being a ""pure play"" shale producer, even a Permian stalwart, is no longer the ticket to success for energy equities.Since May 21, the price of benchmark West Texas intermediate crude has fallen about 10% and companies focused primarily on the Permian have been shunned. The hardest fall: Concho Resources (CXO), which has lost $4.1 billion off its market capitalization as of Tuesday.As of Wednesday, oil in Midland, Texas, was trading for about $19 a barrel below Brent crude, the global benchmark price.Even Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), with relatively strong finances and secure pipeline contracts, has been swept up, Williams Capital's Sorbara said by phone. It's lost $3.2 billion in market value, or 9%, since May 21.While the shortages are real, he deems much of the market sell-off ""overblown,"" since even discounted Permian crude is selling for well above where many producers set their budgets earlier this year.Investors, though, are fleeing to the relative safety of larger names with more diverse portfolios such as Occidental Petroleum (OXY), whose shares are flat over the past couple weeks. The Permian's biggest oil producer also pumps in the Middle East and Colombia, with roughly 40% of its output this year based on higher international crude pricing, Capital One Securities said in an analyst note.The company also operates pipelines and a Gulf Coast export terminal that will benefit from cheaper U.S. crude prices. ""The largest companies or companies with diverse portfolios can rotate capital around,"" Sorbara said. ""If you're a pure play, the only thing you can do is step on the brakes.""With bottlenecks between the Permian and major Gulf Coast refiners, operators in other parts of the country served by less-congested pipelines have a relative advantage, analysts say.That includes Delek US (DK), CVR Refining (CVRR) and HollyFrontier (HFC), with refineries in New Mexico, Arkansas and northeastern Texas, among other locations, according to Barclays. Delek gets about 78% of its crude from the Permian, HollyFrontier gets 39% and CVR gets 14%, the bank said in a June 5 analyst report.Delek shares have climbed 7.5% in the past two weeks while CVR is up 3.3% and HollyFrontier is up 1%.""Simply put, we think U.S. refiners win big with lower input costs,"" analysts including Justin Jenkins at Raymond James & Associates said in a June 4 note.Enterprise Products Partners and Magellan Midstream Partners also stand to benefit from the blowout in Midland prices as they own crucial pipelines in the Permian and dock space on the Gulf used for exports — and have plans to add more.""The very idea of congestion is beneficial,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil research at Chicago-based Morningstar. ""If I'm going to pitch my new pipeline or expand my pipeline, and I'm going to hold my open season, I can expect to see a full crowd there anxious to sign up quickly.""Enterprise started full service in April on its 416-mile Midland-to-Sealy pipeline, which can carry some 575,000 barrels per day of crude from the heart of the Permian to key export facilities in Houston. They also own the lion's share of crude storage tanks and docks along the Gulf.Magellan operates and owns part of the 400,000-barrel-a-day BridgeTex pipeline, transporting oil from the Permian to Corpus Christi, Texas. That route is scheduled for expansion in early 2019 because of added interest. The company said last month that almost all existing customers on its Longhorn pipeline, connecting the Permian to Houston, have renewed their contracts for two years.

But investors have also been waiting for companies to return more capital via dividends and buybacks as higher oil prices leave them flush with cash.Last week, EOG Resources (EOG) also beat views and said plans to increase its payout at a faster pace can survive future volatility in oil prices.But with oil prices near the highest levels since late 2014, producers will be more tempted to spend more money on expanding output rather than maintain capital discipline.On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration raised its estimates on U.S. crude production and now sees 2018 output averaging 10.72 million barrels per day, up 0.3% from a prior forecast, and sees 2019 output averaging 11.86 million barrels a day, a 3.6% upward revision.Editor's note: this story has been updated to clarify Occidental's Permian production.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalThe 'Apple Of Oil' Sees Bigger Dividend Lasting Through Oil Swings

570,PXD,"Shale producer EOG Resources (EOG) said Friday that plans to increase its payout at a faster pace can survive future volatility in oil prices.XAfter oil prices crashed in late 2014, companies slashed dividends and halted buybacks to conserve cash. With oil prices rallying and producers emphasizing capital discipline over expansion, investors have been hopeful that shale companies will return more capital to shareholders.During the company's conference call Friday, EOG executives said the company is in a position to ""more aggressively grow our dividend than we ever have in the past. We believe our dividend is sustainable through commodity cycles.""Management is targeting an increase in its dividend growth rate above the 19% compound annual rate seen from 1999 to 2017.EOG also is unlikely to commit a lot of capital to any mergers or acquisitions, with management saying the company's organic operations are better at building up drilling potential.Shares were down 1.2% at 114.66 on the stock market today, drifting further below a 119.10 buy point from a cup base. EOG cleared that threshold intraday on Monday but closed below it.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNicknamed the ""Apple (AAPL) of oil"" by analysts for its technical innovation in drilling and completion techniques, EOG also said Friday that it achieved a new record by drilling 26 stages on a 4 well pad in Colorado's DJ Basin in a 24-hour period. EOG averaged 21 stages per day for the rest of the job.The company's technical prowess is also helping it keep drilling costs in the Eagle Ford play down 5%, with completion rates expected to follow.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) warned earlier this week that it's seeing prices for oilfield services rising in the Permian Basin, but EOG said it's locked in about 60% of well costs with services already on contract.Late Thursday, EOG reported Q1 earnings of $1.19, up from 15 cents year-over-year, with revenue up 41% to $3.68 billion. Analysts expected EPS of $1.01 on revenue of $3.46 billion. Total production grew 15.6% to 659,900 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day. Crude oil production grew 15% to 363,300 barrels a day on premium drilling and technical advances. EOG had 19 rigs in the Delaware Basin in Q1 vs. 13 rigs at the end of 2017, and brought 12 wells online in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming during Q1.EOG reiterated its 2018 oil production growth target of 16%-20% and its full-year exploration and development budget forecast of $5.4 billion-$5.8 billion, after raising it by $1 billion last quarter.Total Q2 production is seen at 670,300-706,200 BOE per day and full-year output is seen at 685,800-728,500 BOE per day.Also Thursday, Parsley Energy (PE) reported a 107% jump in Q1 EPS to 31 cents per share, beating analysts' estimates by 9 cents. Revenue rose 95.5% to $392.4 million, above the $348 million analysts forecast.Total production leapt 70.6% to 93,444 barrels of oil equivalent per day, as net oil production jumped 57% to 59,341 barrels per day.""Accelerated development last year not only gave Parsley a head start on securing high quality services and equipment, the corresponding production uplift also means we are benefiting disproportionately from currently higher oil prices,"" Chairman and CEO Bryan Sheffield said in a written statement.

571,PXD,"Marathon Oil (MRO) shares jumped into buy range, the only oil giant with a significant gain Thursday, while Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) tumbled along with other top shale producers.Late Wednesday, Marathon Oil reported Q1 EPS of 18 cents on revenue of $1.733 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks Research were expecting EPS of 15 cents and revenue of $1.347 billion.The company also raised its full-year guidance for production growth from its resource plays to 25%-30%, up from a prior view 20%-25%. But it kept its 2018 development capital budget forecast at $2.3 billion, noting its commitment to ""financial discipline.""Pioneer Natural Resources also beat Q1 forecasts late Wednesday and said Permian Basin production growth for 2018 is tracking toward the high end of its 19%-24% forecast.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHowever, Pioneer CEO Tim Dove said during the company's conference call Thursday that this year's expected capital budget of $2.9 billion will likely increase.He cited the addition of rigs, cost inflation and a ramp-up in a more intense completion process that involves higher concentrations of fluids and proppants as well as tighter spacing of wells. Based on the success of these so-called Version 3.0+ completions, the company is considering adding more of them in the second half of the year.Dove said Pioneer will have a better handle ""mid-year"" on how much the spending increase will be, but the company still plans to spend within its forecast cash flow of $3.2 billion.Shares of Marathon Oil jumped 6.3% to 19.45 on the stock market today, breaking out of a cup with handle base with an 18.76 entry point. Pioneer dropped 2.15% to 191.11, above its buy point of 190.05 after falling intraday to 188.79.U.S. crude futures rose 0.7% to $68.43 a barrel. Brent crude advanced 0.4% to $73.62.Last year, oil companies began stressing spending discipline over production growth, even as crude prices rallied, cheering investors who hoped more of the extra cash generated would be returned to investors instead of development budgets.Last month, oilfield services giant Schlumberger (SLB) CEO Paul Kibsgaard said he doesn't see spending increasing across the oil and gas industry this year, even though crude prices are at the highest levels in more than three years.Shale companies are also focusing more on the Permian Basin, where oil can be extracted and delivered at lower costs than in other shale plays.Pioneer decided to go all in on the prolific Permian, selling off 70,000 acres in the Eagle Ford play and other assets in South Texas; Raton, New Mexico and the West Panhandle earlier this year.""Looking forward, our deep, low-risk inventory of high-margin Permian Basin wells allows us to deliver increasing cash flow and corporate returns,"" Dove said in a statement Wednesday, noting the company's transition to a Permian ""pure play"" is progressing.""Our balance sheet remains among the strongest in the industry, while our focus on capital discipline supports an economic, steady long-term growth profile. We believe our high Permian 'return on capital' will enhance shareholder value by delivering increasing 'return of capital' to investors.""Despite the drop in shale stocks, the earnings season has been positive for the sector so far. Along with Pioneer, Matador Resources (MTDR) and Continental Resources (CLR) reported earnings and revenue beats late Wednesday.On Tuesday, Viper Energy Partners (VNOM), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Noble Energy (NBL) and Concho Resources (CXO) topped quarterly estimates.EOG Resources (EOG) and Parsley Energy (PE) will report Q1 results after the market closes Thursday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

574,PXD,"Encana Corporation (ECA  -  Free Report), a Canadian upstream company, recently inked a deal with a midstream player, Keyera Corporation regarding its Pipestone infrastructure project near Grande Prairie, Alberta in a bid to bolster its growth plans in the Montney region.Deal HighlightsPer the deal, Keyera Partnership — a subsidiary of Keyera — will pay C$39 million to acquire and fund the development of Pipestone Liquids Hub and Pipestone Processing Facility in western Alberta.The Pipestone liquids hub is currently under construction and is expected to become functional from the fourth quarter of 2018. The startup of the Liquids Hub is likely to enhance Encana’s net raw condensate processing capacity by 14,000 barrels per day (bbls/d). This will aid in Encana’s ambitions to double its liquids production in the Montney region from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018. Keyera is expected to fund the remaining cost of the hub which is estimated at $105 million.Additionally, Keyera will also own and fund the planned Pipestone Processing Facility located adjacent to the Liquids Hub. The Processing Facility is expected to become operational by 2021, providing Encana with additional 19,000 bbls/d of net raw condensate processing capacity plus 170 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of net inlet natural gas processing capacity.Under the terms of the midstream agreement, Encana will handle the construction and the initial operatorship of the project. Keyera will become the owner of the project and undertake the responsibility for its commercial development. The company will provide processing services to Encana under a long-term fee-for-service arrangement.Keyera also has the option to assume operatorship five years from the startup of a natural gas processing and liquids stabilization plant.Deal MotiveThe deal is in sync with Keyera’s strategy to strengthen its presence in the Montney region which is a hot area for the producers owing to its attractive economics. With this Pipestone project along with Keyera’s Wapti and Simonette plants, around 50% of the company’s processing margins are focused on Montney and Duvernay regions.Overall the deal supports Encana’s condensate-focused growth plans in Montney leading to additional 33,000 bbls/d of raw condensate processing capacity and 170 MMcf/d of net inlet natural gas processing facility in the region.  Along with boosting the production growth, the deal also reduces Encana’s financial obligations emphasizing its commitment to capital efficiency.Over the years, Encana has increased its focus to streamlining its portfolio by divestiture of its non-core assets including Gordondale, Wheatland properties and DJ Basin holdings. Concurrently, it has successfully repositioned its asset base and shifted focus to four key growth areas namely Montney, Duvernay, Eagle Ford and Permian. The deal is also expected to give a boost to Encana’s five-year targets for strong cash flow generation along with high production growth. The company is targeting a production growth of 60% from its core assets through 2021, while being within its cash flows. Management also expects its cash flow to skyrocket about 300% with its margins doubling over the next five years.Zacks Rank and Key PicksEncana currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Encana Corporation Price Encana Corporation Price | Encana Corporation QuoteSome better-ranked players in the energy space include Concho Resources Inc.

575,PXD,"After enduring the toughest start to the year in recent times, markets have started the second quarter on a sorry note. U.S. stocks have had their most disappointing start to April since 1929. And now trade war and tech stock related concerns are threatening to cause a deeper correction for the markets.Historically, however, April has been a good month for stock gains. Also, first-quarter earnings are likely to be strong, coming on the back of strong fourth numbers. A flurry of recent reports also suggests that the economy continues to be resilient.And it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on all the warnings he has issued recently. Taking all these factors into consideration, picking large-cap stocks which promise considerable returns may be a good idea at this point.April Historically Strong for StocksGoing by historical data, April has traditionally been a productive month for U.S. stocks. Data from the Stock Trader’s Almanac for 2018 shows that the Dow has gained 1.9% on average during April since 1950. This means that April is the most profitable month for the Dow, going by average monthly returns.Other major indexes also fair well during April, per the Almanac. For both the small-cap heavy Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, April is the third-best month of the year. Both these indexes have increased 1.5% on the average every April since 1950. April is also the fourth-best month for the Nasdaq. The tech-heavy index has notched up a 1.4% average gain during the month, per historical data.Data from independent broker-dealer LPL Financial shows that gains in April have been particularly notable during the last few years. The S&P 500 has ended April with gains 90% of the time over the past 10 years. The index has notched up an average gain of 2.2% over this period. The success rate of 90% is the highest for any month during this period. Also, average monthly gains are the third highest, after March and July. Strong Economy, Q1 Earnings to Boost StocksThe U.S. economy had finished 2017 on a strong note, growing faster during the fourth quarter than earlier estimated. Business investment expanded during this period even as consumer spending hit a three-year high.The first economic reports for April indicate that the economy continues to be resilient. Though the ISM Manufacturing Index dipped slightly, the economy as a whole expanded for the 107th consecutive month. Construction spending also inched up in February.Meanwhile, the outlook for first-quarter earnings is particularly bright, coming on the back of strong results for the fourth quarter. As of Mar 23, total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index were expected to be up +15.9% from the same period last year on +7.3% higher revenues. This would follow +13.5% earnings growth on +8.5% revenue growth in the preceding period. (Read: Handicapping the Q1 Earnings Season)Our ChoicesStocks have recently been buffeted by the twin concerns of an impending trade war with China and losses for tech stocks. While losses for tech stocks are likely temporary, it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on his warnings or opts for a compromise. Meanwhile, April remains a historically good month for stocks. Also, while the economy remains strong, prospects for first-quarter earnings remain encouraging.Given this backdrop, it seems prudent to bet on relatively stable alternatives which hold out the promise of considerable returns. Large-cap stocks are relatively safer bets. At the same time, it is important to consider only those which offer the promise of short-term benefits and the prospect of good long-term performance. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

576,PXD,"The liquidity of a stock is an important yardstick that many investors tend to ignore. It primarily indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. Liquid stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns.However, one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks. While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screen:Watertown, MA-based athenahealth Inc (ATHN  -  Free Report), through its cloud-based network athenaNet, provides services that manage the administrative duties of medical providers.

577,PXD,"SM Energy Company (SM  -  Free Report) has provided its production and capital spending updates.Permian Production StrongThe upstream energy player expects oil equivalent production for the January-to-March quarter of 2018 to be almost at the top end of the initial projection of 9.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoE) to 10 MMBoE. The optimism is backed by SM Energy’s impressive performance in the Permian Basin during the first two months of 2018.The company anticipates crude proportion in the first quarter to be 40% or more. SM Energy maintains its capital budget expectations for the first quarter at $350 million. The company added that a major portion of the 2018 capital budget of roughly $1.27 billion will likely be allotted for the January-to-June period.SM Energy expects significant well completion activities in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford shale in May and June. In other words, all the competed wells will likely commence operations in the months. Although well completions will be higher during the second quarter as compared to first, the company will likely start witnessing growth in production during the July-to-September quarter.Most importantly, the firm expects production in 2019 to be strong although capital allocation for the year will likely be 15% lower. It is to be noted that the well completion numbers through 2019 will be same as last year. Powder River Acres DivestmentAlong with operational updates, the company announced the conclusion of divestment of almost 112,200 net acres in Powder River Basin. The value of the transaction stands at roughly $500 million, which will likely be utilized by the upstream player for reducing debt loads and normal corporate activities. Price PerformanceHeadquartered in Denver, CO, SM Energy is a leading oil and gas explorer with strong focus on North America’s onshore resources.However, the company’s pricing chart is not impressive. Over the past year, the stock has lost 22.8%, underperforming the industry’s12.6% decline.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSM Energy has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Meanwhile, a few better-ranked players in the energy space are W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Headquartered in Houston, TX, W&T Offshore is primarily an upstream energy player. It is expected to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 3.6% in 2018.Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources is an upstream energy firm. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 66.9% for the last four quarters.Headquartered in Midland, TX, Concho is also an upstream energy company. It will likely see a year-over-year rise of 73.2% in 2018 earnings.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

578,PXD,"Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) is set to offload its entire stake in Iraq-based West Qurna 1 oil field through a $406-million deal, moving ahead with its divestment goals. This represents the second international divestment deal that the company announced in a week after declaring its intention to exit New Zealand by selling its portfolio of energy assets in a $578 million deal.Per the latest divestment deal, the Anglo-Dutch supermajor will vend 19.6% interest in the West Qurna 1 oil field to Japan's Itochu Corporation. According to the agreement, Itochu will assume a debt of $144 million. The deal has already received necessary regulatory approvals and is scheduled for completion within a next few days.The European oil giant Shell commenced its operations in the Qurna 1 field in 2009 partnering with energy firms. Other stake holders in the venture are ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), PetroChina Company Limited (PTR  -  Free Report), Indonesia-based Pertamina Corporation and state partner Oil Exploration Company with the respective interest of 32.7%, 32.7%, 10% and 5%. Post the contract’s culmination, ExxonMobil will continue as the chief operator of the Qurna 1 field.The move will help Shell proceed with its $30-billion divestment program. The deal provides the company with a major uplift in its drive to decrease debt following the acquisition of BG Group for $47 billion. The divestment is expected to reduce the company’s cost and enhance cash flow as well as return to capital.With Shell already wrapping up divestment deals worth more than $23 billion, it remains focused to meet its target by 2018. Further, the company announced asset disposals amounting to around $2 billion and talks for prospective transactions of additional $5 billion divestment deals are already in advanced stages.The deal is also in tandem with the company’s strategy to streamline its upstream portfolio in the Middle-Eastern country and simplify its operational structure by getting rid of the less profitable non-core assets.The company also intends to divest its interest in the Majnoon oil field in Iraq to the state-run Basra Oil Company by June 2018. Apart from its divestment goals, another reason behind Shell steering clear of Majnoon is that the oil department of the country and the company could not mutually consent on the future production plans and investments for the field. With the divestment of both Majnoon and Qurna 1 field, Shell will jettison all its oil assets in the country as it shifts its sights toward natural gas.The company will however, carry on with its operations in Iraq to ramp up the country’s energy infrastructure as it will continue its association as a joint-venture partner in the Basra Gas company with 44% stake. The collaboration focuses on capturing and utilizing associated gas from three large oilfields in Basra. Further, Shell holds a stake in Nebras petrochemicals plant in Basra.Headquartered in Netherlands, Shell is one of the largest integrated energy companies, engaged in production, refining, distribution and marketing of oil and natural gas. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of Shell have rallied 21.4% over a year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 12.5%. Meanwhile, investors interested in the energy space can consider a better-ranked stock, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Based in Texas, Pioneer Natural is an independent exploration and production company, displaying an impressive earnings surprise history.

580,PXD,"The first quarter of this year is finally drawing to a close, calling for a quick recap of the show put up by the S&P 500. First and foremost, profit growth, one of the primary factors behind the current bull run, is well expected to remain robust for this elite index. What’s more, early estimates suggest that the earnings momentum will continue mostly on the Republican tax cut policy and solid global economic growth.The energy sector is poised to report highest earnings growth among all sectors, with materials, industrial products and financials contributing the maximum. Thus, investing in fundamentally solid stocks from these sectors is a well thought-out strategy as these are likely to make the most of the Q1 earnings season. Here, we should bear in mind that better-than-expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price.Q1 Earnings Expected in Double-DigitsQ1 earnings results are expected to be quite impressive. Total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are estimated to improve 15.9% from the same period last year on 7.3% higher revenues. Such an uptick will follow 13.5% earnings growth on 8.5% revenue improvement last quarter. The gains are likely to be broad-based, with nearly all the sectors expected to report year-over-year earnings growth. Around 10 of these sectors are likely to report double-digit growth.Earnings are likely to rise mostly on Trump’s polices, including tax cuts, repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays. Needless to say, economic growth remains solid both at home and abroad.Multinationals Have an EdgeHigher global growth is actually a boon for multinationals during the Q1 earnings season. World Bank has estimated that the global economy will expand at a rate of 3.1% year over year in 2018. This comes on top of a promising 3% growth rate in 2017.Lest we forget, trade war fears have abated. Both the United States and China have initiated discreet negotiations to expand American companies’ access to Chinese markets. He said that he has been talking to Chinese officials to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control.Energy Sector Poised to Gain the MostThe highest year-over-year earnings growth is likely to be recorded in the energy sector, which is estimated to surge 65.7% from the same period last year on 15.4% higher revenues. Among the sub-sectors, oil and gas exploration and production; oil and gas refining and marketing; oil and gas equipment and services; and oil and gas drilling companies are positioned to report solid growth.An uptick in oil prices and steady earnings comps are mostly cited to be the reasons for the elevated expectations. As per Factset, oil prices have averaged $62.61 so far in Q1 versus $51.78 in the year-ago quarter.Materials Takes Second Spot, Industrials NextThe materials sector has recently been looking up, with Q1 earnings expected to rise 42.4% on 21% higher revenues. Industrials is likely to report the third-highest year-over-year profit growth, with Q1 earnings poised to be up 23.7% from the same period last year on 12.3% higher revenues.Improving global economies and firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs, reflecting sustained strength in the sector.Financials Not Lagging BehindFinancial sector, in the meanwhile, is expected to rise double digits. Total Q1 earnings for the financial sector are projected to rise 18.7% from the same period last year on 4% higher revenues. Banks, insurers and asset managers are all expected to report double-digit growth as Fed raised benchmark lending rates for the first time this year.At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020, citing a healthy economic outlook. The vote to lift the benchmark lending rate was a unanimous 8-0.5 Solid ChoicesGiven the aforesaid positives, investing in sound stocks from such winning sectors seems prudent.

584,PXD,"PetroChina Co. Ltd. (PTR  -  Free Report) announced 2017 earnings of RMB 22,793 million or RMB 0.12 per diluted share compared with RMB 7,900 million or RMB 0.04 per diluted share a year earlier. Moreover, China’s dominant oil and gas producer’s total revenue for the year jumped 24.7% from 2016 to RMB 2,015,890 million.The positive comparisons can be primarily attributable to higher oil prices, which helped its exploration and production unit to report a jump in profitability. Interestingly, the company has decided to pay all of its annual profit of RMB 22,793 million as interim dividend to its stockholders – something it did in the first half as well.PetroChina followed another big energy name from the country — Sinopec (SNP  -  Free Report) — in reporting encouraging results. Sinopec also saw its profit surge as the largest petroleum and petrochemical company in Asia managed to generate strong petrochemical margins.Following the robust showing, PetroChina has decided to boost 2018 capital expenditure. The group pegged its 2018 capital budget at RMB 225,800 million, up 4.4% from what it invested in 2017 as it focuses to cash in on the recovery in crude prices.However, the Chinese energy giant’s earnings per ADR came in at $1.90, unable to match the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.82 on higher expenses and losses from gas imports.12-Month Segment PerformanceUpstream: PetroChina, one of the world's largest oil company by market value, posted disappointing upstream output during the twelve months ended Dec 31, 2017. In particular, crude oil output – accounting for 61% of the total – fell 3.7% from the year-ago period to 887 million barrels (MMBbl). This was partly offset by marketable natural gas output, which was up 4.5% to 3,423.4 billion cubic feet (Bcf). As a result, PetroChina’s total production of oil and natural gas declined by a marginal 0.6% year over year to 1,457.8 million barrels of oil equivalent.However, average realized crude oil price during 2017 was $50.64 per barrel, 33.3% higher than the year-ago period. This buoyed the upstream (or exploration & production) segment results, which posted an operating income of RMB 15,475 million compared to a much smaller operating profit of RMB 3,148 million in 2016.Downstream: The Beijing-based company’s ‘Refining & Chemicals’ business generated an operating income of RMB 39,961 million. This marks a slight increase from the year-earlier period earnings of RMB 39,026 million. The improvement in the downstream division was due to cost control initiatives, higher share of high valued-added chemical products and operational flexibility to adjust to market conditions.PetroChina’s refinery division processed 1,016.9 MMBbl of crude oil during the twelve-month period, up 6.7% from 2016. The company produced 9.284 million tons of synthetic resin in the period (a rise of 2.3% year over year), besides manufacturing 5.764 million tons of ethylene (up 3.1%). It also produced 92.715 million tons of gasoline, diesel and kerosene during the period against 86.022 million tons a year earlier.Natural Gas & Pipelines: Revenue rose 19.5% to RMB 295,786 million on higher natural gas sales volumes. Still, PetroChina lost money to the tune of RMB 23,947 million on the sales of imported natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Central Asia and Burma. This pulled down the group’s natural gas business’ income to RMB 15,688 million in 2017, a 12.3% decline from the year-earlier profit of RMB 17,885 million.Marketing: In marketing operations, the state-owned group sold 169.5 million tons of gasoline, diesel and kerosene during Jan–Dec 2017, an increase of 6.5% year over year. Higher volumes were accompanied by improved product prices due to which sales for the division were up 27.6% to RMB 1,660,456 million.However, a number of adverse factors – spiraling operating expenses and fierce competition – meant that the segment reported a profit of RMB 8,279 million – lower than the prior year’s RMB 11,048 million.Liquidity & Capital ExpenditureAt the end of 2017, the stock’s cash balance was RMB 122,777 million, while cash flow from operating activities was RMB 366,655 million. Capital expenditure for the year was RMB 216,227 million, up 25.4% from the year-ago level.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksPetroChina holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Apart from PetroChina, one can also look at energy players like Concho Resources Inc.

585,PXD,"On Mar 27, Stone Energy Corporation  was raised to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Why the Upgrade?For first-quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been revised upward from 38 cents to 39 cents over the last 60 days. The consensus mark for current-year earnings was raised to $1.78 from $1.43.  The company’s free cashflow for 2017 was recorded at $535 million against negative free cashflow of $161 million in 2016. Partial recovery in crude prices primarily supported the massive improvement. Hence, Stone Energy generated sufficient operating cashflow during 2017 for financing its capital budget.Stone Energy has negligible current debt as its long-term debt contracted 33.2% through 2017. Moreover, cash balances surged 48.1% last year, reflecting considerable balance sheet strength. The company’s pricing chart looks impressive. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 68.9%, outperforming the industry’s 10.4% decline. We appreciate the company’s strong foothold in the Gulf of Mexico — which offers abundant crude reserves. With innumerable discoveries of oil fields in the Gulf regions, the company estimated total Gulf reserves of more than 50 billion barrels. The company’s allocation of 36% capital budget for 2018 toward exploration activities in the prospective oil and gas resources is highly positive especially when crude prices recovered from historical lows touched during early 2016. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude recently crossed the $65-per-barrel mark, way higher than historical low-mark of $26.21 per barrel in February 2016.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the energy space include W&T Offshore, Inc.

No injuries were reported following the fire.The incident hit the facility's crude receiving pipeline that is run by Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (PAA  -  Free Report). It reduced the facility's production rate to 30,000-31,000 barrels per day (BPD) from its original capacity of 45,000 BPD. The refined products from the facility are sold primarily in Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, and eastern Washington. The Woods Cross refinery is one of the five refineries the company owns.The company is assessing the scenario to determine the necessary steps to be taken to revive the facility. Per the company, available information from the refinery so far is not enough to affect its first-quarter guidance.About HollyFrontierDallas, TX-based HollyFrontier is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States. The company reached its current form following the 2011 merger between Holly Corp. and Frontier Oil. HollyFrontier's operations are organized into three reportable segments: Refining, Petro-Canada Lubricants Inc. and Holly Energy Partners.Price PerformanceHollyFrontier has gained 82.8% in the last year compared with 22.9% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderHollyFrontier has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Continental Resources, Inc.

587,PXD,"Energen Corporation (EGN  -  Free Report), on Mar 28, was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The $5.25 billion market cap exploration and production company has a lot to offer its investors as shown below.Why the Upgrade?Analysts’ ViewThe company has witnessed six positive estimate revisions for its current quarter in the past 60 days against a single negative revision, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has also moved higher over the same period from 60 cents per share to 70 cents per share. During the same time period, eight analysts bumped up their estimates for 2018, pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year to $3.17 a share from $2.38.Positive CatalystsEnergen’s first-quarter 2018 revenues are expected to go up 37.9% year over year, while its sales for the whole year are anticipated to surge 40.1%. This is supported by the company’s expectation of increasing full-year 2018 production by 25% from 2017. The Permian Basin-focused company expects the increase in output to continue as its annual production is estimated to reach the level of 160 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d) by 2020.Additionally, Energen’s total proved oil-equivalent reserves — as of Dec 31, 2017 — was 444 million barrels, 40% higher than 2016, most of which is in the low-cost Permian Basin.Moreover, the oil and gas explorer has an impressive earnings surprise history, the average positive earnings surprise being 19.7% in the trailing four quarters.The good news does not stop here. Energen has set a capital budget of $1.1-$1.3 billion for 2018 that will be spent for the oil-rich projects. The decision seems impressive given that the company has a low leverage than the industry it belongs to, giving it the room to take loans without hurting its balance sheet.  Moreover, the company’s 2018 guidance states that per unit spending is expected to go down significantly from 2017. Net salaries and general & administrative expense, production costs, marketing & transportation and DD&A expense are anticipated to reflect most of the declines in spending.Also, the Birmingham, AL-based upstream energy firm has gained 10.3% in the last year against its industry’s 8.5% decline.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) and Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), each sporting the same bullish Zacks Rank of 1 as Energen.

588,PXD,"Investors looking for stocks in the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States sector might want to consider either Rice Midstream Partners (RMP  -  Free Report) or Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Rice Midstream Partners and Pioneer Natural Resources are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that RMP's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.RMP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.13, while PXD has a forward P/E of 25.48. We also note that RMP has a PEG ratio of 0.65. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PXD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.94.Another notable valuation metric for RMP is its P/B ratio of 0.68. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PXD has a P/B of 2.72.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to RMP's Value grade of B and PXD's Value grade of D.RMP stands above PXD thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that RMP is the superior value option right now.

589,PXD,"All eyes are on the outcome of the OPEC meeting on Jun 22, which is expected to be driven by the recent developments in the oil industry. On the one hand, Saudi Arabia and Russia are advocating a rise in production, while on the other countries like Iraq, Iran and Venezuela are opposing the stance.Notably, Saudi Arabia proposed a 1-million barrel per day (BPD) production hike prior to the meeting. Several leading producers also feel the same way. The Chairman of Permian behemoth Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) – currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) – Scott Sheffield, recently took an unusual step and publicly urged the 14-nation consortium to produce more crude to keep the global oil supply and demand in balance. Pioneer Natural Resources carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Supply Demand ImbalanceStable Demand: Global energy demand is on the rise primarily due to growing consumption in Asia and other economies. The trend is expected to continue till 2040 at a pace of around 1.3% per annum, said BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report) in its latest annual outlook.  Another energy major, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) expects global energy demand to surge 25% through 2040 at a stable pace. The International Energy Agency (IEA) had also forecast a demand hike. The agency expects demand to reach 100 million BPD in 2019. It will keep rising gradually, fueled by economic growth in several countries like China, India and others.Supply Risks:While demand is expected to rise steadily over a period of time, global crude supply is expected to take a hit due to multiple reasons, which can result in an imbalance in the energy market.Areas of ConcernIran Sanction: The sanctions against Iran by the United States have clouded the OPEC member’s crude export plans. Before the sanctions, Iranian crudes were transported to several European and Asian markets on a regular basis with volumes reaching as high as 2.617 million BPD. While the United States is not a buyer of Iranian oil, it exerts considerable influence on the markets. The buyers of Iranian crude and many companies with major investments in the country’s upstream sector – especially those with assets in the United States – have scaled back purchases/investments out of fear of being kept out of the world’s largest capital markets. In fact, per Bloomberg, “Shipments heading to European Union countries drop by a third” since the sanctions. Per Sheffield, 500 thousand BPD of oil were lost from the Iranian exports due to the sanctions.Venezuela: Fast falling production in Venezuela added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by almost 50% since 2005. Venezuela currently churns out less than 2 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledged level, per the OPEC-led supply cuts.Libya: AnotherOPEC member Libya’s production dropped to 600-700 thousand BPD from more than 1 million BPD, primarily due to political unrest within the country.  The situation led the National Oil Corporation to declare force majeure on exports from two of its three ports. Companies like Repsol, S.A. (REPYY  -  Free Report) are having a difficult time operating in the country due to ongoing tensions.U.S. Shale: Pipeline bottlenecks in the U.S. shale are discouraging producers, who are forced to sell their products at a discounted rate. Per Sheffield, the lack of infrastructure will lead to a flat output level in the country, especially in the Permian Basin, which has outrun other resources like Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara in terms of production. The situation has elevated to a level, where producers in the basin are likely to stop output from wells in the coming 3-4 months, stated Bloomberg. It can force some rigs out of the Permian Basin to other resources, where growth rate is lower than Permian. Hence, U.S. shale cannot fill the blanks in supply created by the abovementioned causes.How Will These Factors Impact OPEC’s Stance?Sheffield thinks the U.S. shale situation, combined with OPEC related troubles can push oil prices closer to $100 per barrel, out of the producers’ comfort zone of $60-$80 per barrel, with the demand supply imbalance looming large.However, oil touching the triple-digit mark will hurt the global energy market by impacting demand growth, affecting all producing countries – both OPEC and non-OPEC.At the same time, increasing supply indiscriminately can push prices closer to $40 per barrel again.Hence, OPEC’s decisions (on output) must consider these in order to maintain market stability.Is There an Ideal Solution?In order to achieve the desired result, the member countries need to cast their individual goals and differences aside and work toward a long-lasting solution that can keep the oil market well balanced. Therefore, top suppliers, Saudi Arabia and Russia are probably right in their efforts to step up output but just enough to compensate the reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela. In this way, oil market fundamentals will remain largely tight.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

590,PXD,"It was a week where oil prices extended their recent declines but natural gas futures moved above the critical $3 threshold.On the news front, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) announced plans to spend more than $2 billion to build a massive pipeline in the Permian Basin and smaller rival Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) started production from the second LNG unit at the Wheatstone project in Australia. Meanwhile, Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report) announced its intent to retire four rigs.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1% to close at $65.06 per barrel, natural gas prices rose some 4.6% to $3.022 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Devon's Asset Sale, Exxon's Brazil Win & More)The U.S. oil benchmark booked fourth weekly drop in a row on fears of supply increase, climb in domestic production, and increasing rig count.Of late, oil futures have been dragged down by reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela.The commodity was also spooked by the federal government’s EIA report that showed production climbing to a fresh record.Data showing U.S. drillers adding oil rigs for fourth consecutive week brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week on warm weather forecasts that should lead to rising power sector demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    ExxonMobilintends to construct a pipeline in the Permian Basin, in line with its plan to allocate more than $2 billion for midstream asset expansions in the crowded shale play.The largest publicly traded integrated energy firm along with Plains All American Pipeline will likely invest billions of dollars for building a pipeline that will transport crude to the Gulf coast region from the Permian Basin.The Permian faces a dearth of pipeline capacity for transporting oil to Gulf Coast export facilities, major refinery terminals and principal hubs like Cushing. This has forced Midland operators to sell stranded oil at a big discount to that in Cushing.The latest announcement seems that ExxonMobil is following the same path to construct pipeline networks in the Permian so that explorers can boost oil production. In fact, the integrated energy firm is willing to lift Permian production three times through 2025. (Read more ExxonMobil to Construct Pipeline in Crowded Permian)2.    Chevron recently achieved a major milestone, as it started production at its second unit of the Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia, solidifying its position as one of the biggest suppliers of natural gas to the Asian countries.The project is located 7.5 miles west of Onslow and is intended to process gas from the Wheatstone and Iago fields, both of which are operated by Chevron. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company holds an 80.2% interest in the offshore licenses containing the Wheatstone and Iago fields. The Wheatstone fields are estimated to contain more than 4.5 trillion cubic feet of gas deposits. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The $34-billion Wheatstone project consists of two liquefaction trains with a shipment capacity of 8.9 million metric tons of LNG per year. The first cargo from liquefaction train 1 was shipped last October, few months behind target. With the second train coming online, Chevron currently operates five LNG trains in Australia, including three at the Gorgon Project. (Read more Chevron's 2nd Train at Wheatstone LNG Project Comes Online)3.    Transocean recently announced its intention to retire four of its aging rigs —Deepwater Discovery, Deepwater Frontier, Deepwater Millennium and Songa Trym — amid continued offshore weakness. Post the announcement of its decision, the company’s shares have declined more than 3% to eventually close at $11.92 on Jun 15. In regard to this, the oilfield services player will book non-cash impairment charges of around $520 million, which will be reflected in its second-quarter results.Evidently, Transocean’s Deepwater Discovery built in 2000, has been stacked since March 2015. Likewise, Deepwater Frontier, established in 1999, is also stacked since November 2015. The company also stacked its Deepwater Millennium drillship — built in 1999 — since May 2016. The same is the case of Songa Trym — which had been added into Transocean’s portfolio as part of the acquisition of Norwegian contractor, Songa Offshore — that needs to get retired amid lack of contracts in the current scenario.Transocean has been facing pressure in its top line owing to lower contract drilling revenues from the deepwater and ultra-deepwater floaters amid reduced dayrates and weak utilization. Last September, Transocean retired six of its ultra-deepwater floaters that had been cold-stacked, booking $1.4 billion charge to cover the cost of the same. The latest retirement of the four rigs was actually quite inevitable, considering the challenging issues associated with stacking as well as the present bleak deepwater drilling scenario.

(EGC  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal, per which privately held Dallas-based operator Cox Oil Offshore LLC will acquire the former. Apart from expanding Cox’s presence in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), the acquisition also offers Energy XXI the much-needed respite and best solution to maximize its shareholders’ value amid its distressing financials.Per the deal, Cox will buy all outstanding shares of Energy XXI for $9.10 a share, representing a 21% premium to Energy XXI’s closing share price as of Jun 15. The transaction is valued at $322 million.Energy XXI has had been going through quite a tumultuous phase since a couple of years, considering its bankruptcy filing and then successfully emerging out of it, along with a major shakeup in its leadership position.Interestingly, the latest development comes a month after the company announced its decision to offload non-core assets worth $125 million to Orinoco Natural Resources LLC, which would have ended up acquiring 35% stake in Energy XXI. Of course, negotiations with Orinoco Natural have been terminated now, due to the more profitable proposition by Cox. (Read more Energy XXI to be Acquired by Cox for $322M in GoM Push)5.    Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its entire stake in Colorado’s Raton Basin.The divestment to Evergreen Natural Resources LLC is expected to fetch $79 million. The transaction, which needs to meet customary closing conditions, will likely conclude in July 2018. Through the January-to-March quarter of 2018, the to-be-divested properties produced 84 million cubic feet of natural gas every day.The sale is in line with Pioneer Natural’s focus to operate only in the Permian Basin. To become a pure play firm in the Permian, Pioneer Natural also divested certain Eagle Ford assets – spreading across 10,200 net acres. The company believes that operating on the low-cost and prospective drilling locations in the Permian Basin will help generate high cashflow for shareholders.

The worst performer was independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) whose stock fell 6.9%.But longer-term, over six months, the sector tracker is up 8%. Another downstream operator, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is far and away the major gainer during this period, experiencing a 32.3% price appreciation.What’s Next in the Energy World?As usual, market participants will be closely tracking the regular releases i.e. the U.S. government statistics on oil and natural gas - one of the few solid indicators that comes out regularly. Energy traders will also be focusing on the Baker Hughes data on rig count.

593,PXD,"Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) led Sakhalin-1 project awaits decision on a hike in oil output. The final decision will be announced by the Russia’s Ministry of Natural Resources by the end of April 2018.ExxonMobil’s Russian subsidiary — ExxonNeftegaz — did not disclose any details regarding the news.Located off Russia’s Pacific coast, the Sakhalin-1 oil project abandoned plans to increase output to 250,000-260,000 barrels per day (bpd) after the authorities ordered it to lower production limits to the previous level of 200,000 bpd. As a result, during January-March, there were lower loadings of Sokol crude oil.Per the global oil deal, the countries were to reduce production by the end of 2018. Hence, a rise in production will jeopardize Russia’s commitment.Per another three trading sources, in mid-March, ExxonMobil lowered its Sokol loading plans from De-Kastri terminal for April-June citing the loading schedule.Initially, Sokol loading plans for April and May were estimated at 12 and 11 cargoes, which were later revised to 10 and 9 cargoes, respectively. In June, Sokol loadings were lowered to 9 cargoes from 12 in the initial loading plan.Sakhalin-1 functions under a Production Sharing Agreement struck in the mid-1990s.The local government is required to approve all plans relating to the project.Price PerformanceExxonMobil’s shares have lost 13.2% in the last three months, compared with the industry’s 5.4% decline.Zacks Rank & Key PicksExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Continental Resources, Inc (CLR  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc (CXO  -  Free Report).

594,PXD,"Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential in determining whether a stock’s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average.If the stock’s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.It’s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks. This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen.

595,PXD,"Stocks battled to stay in the green during Friday morning trading, with major indexes like the S&P 500 hoping to rebound after surrendering their year-to-date gains over the course of this brutal trading week. But a strong bump in oil prices helped the energy sector generate momentum on Friday morning, and if energy stocks continue to surge in this volatile market, investors need to be properly exposed to this sector.This week’s volatility was inspired by new worries over an impending trade war with China, with President Trump on Thursday directing U.S. trade representatives to level tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese imports.Of course, some sectors are more at risk to trade concerns than others, and the energy sector itself is more contingent on the price of key natural resources. And those commodities moved higher on Friday morning. Specifically, May contracts for Light Crude Oil surged about 1.6% on the back of renewed hopes of extended OPEC production cuts.Overall, the S&P 500 Energy sector gained nearly 1.3% in morning trading, making it the day’s biggest winner so far. With this in mind, let’s take a look at three strong oil stocks that stand to benefit from increasing prices, even if the broader market remains volatile.1. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report)Pioneer Natural Resources is a large, Texas-based independent exploration and production company. Analyst sentiment surrounding the stock has improved significantly over the past few weeks, evidenced by 14 positive revisions for the company’s full-year EPS estimates. Our consensus mark for Pioneer’s full-year earnings per share has gained $2.29 over the past 60 days.This positive revision activity has helped PXD earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Meanwhile, Pioneer is generating cash flow growth of nearly 21% right now, outpacing its industry’s average. The company is also projected to see earnings growth of 187% on the back of 22% revenue growth this year. And the stock is about $10 off its 52-week high, so investors have plenty of room to ride shares higher before it tests a new range. 2. Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report)Continental Resources is a crude-oil concentrated, independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with operations in the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. Analyst estimates have trended higher recently, with our Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLR’s full-year EPS gaining $1.01 within the past two months. That activity has helped the company earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Continental is another company that is improving its financial position, generating 35% cash flow growth and bringing in about $5 in cash per share right now. The company also presents better-than-industry-average net margin and RoE. CLR is another aggressive growth pick for 2018, with current estimates calling for revenue growth of 42% and EPS improvement of 359%. 3. CNOOC Limited (CEO  -  Free Report)Cnooc Limited is a company that engages primarily in the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas offshore China. Chinese oil producers should come out of any trade war relatively unscathed, as both countries have more important trade partners for black gold. CEO is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Analyst estimates have also been trending higher for this company, evidenced by the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its full-year earnings moving $1.41 higher within the past 60 days. The stock also has a “B” grade for Value in our Style Scores system and is trading at just 9x forward 12-month earnings. Want more market analysis from this author?

596,PXD,"The energy sector has always been a key driver of the quarterly outperformance of the S&P 500 index. In the fourth quarter, the index recorded year-over-year earnings growth of 13.5%. However, excluding Energy, S&P 500’s earnings growth was 11.2%. Also, for first-quarter 2018, we expect Energy to surpass all other sectors, posting earnings growth of 65.7%.Among all the industries belonging to the Energy sector, Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production seems lucrative with healthy free cash flow and declining debt load. Partial crude price recovery is also a positive for the industry.Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production Industry The firms belonging to this industry are involved in exploration and production of oil and natural gas in prospective resources – like the Permian basin, Eagle Ford, Utica and the Appalachian basin – spread all over the United States.Operating in this industry needs huge capital spending. The explorers are vulnerable to volatility in oil and gas prices. But, the industry is rewarding too. Partial recovery in oil prices is highly favorable for this industry. From the historical low-mark of $26.21 per barrel hit in February 2016, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose beyond the $60 psychological level. The extension of the production cut deal, first signed in late 2016, by the OPEC players through the end of 2018, primarily initiated the rally in crude.Per the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA), average WTI crude prices for the first two months of 2018 have been $63.70 per barrel and $62.23 per barrel, respectively. The average monthly oil price had never traded near the $60 per barrel mark since 2015.The AnalysisThere are few parameters that clearly show that investors willing to invest in the energy space should consider this industry.Industry RankIn terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, the Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry is among the top performing industries.The industry is ranked #96 and lies in the top 38% of all industries. The industry has a good industry rank, as the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Decent Upside PotentialWe have employed a trailing 12-month Enterprise Multiple for determining the value of the industry. This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt for investing in growth projects and EV includes debt for valuing a company or industry.Enterprise Multiple = Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDAWe calculate the current EV/EBITDA value for Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry at 12.99. Although the stock’s current valuation is higher than its five-year median EV/ EBITDA of 6.96, the current value is still lower than its five-year high EV/EBITDA of 16.61, reflecting the industry’s healthy upside potential.Sufficient Free Cash Flow to Fund Capital SpendingAfter subtracting capital spending from operating cash flow, we get free cash flow. This is one of the most important parameters when it comes to exploration activities. Positive free cash flow for an industry or a company means the firm is in a position to fund its core operations with its operating cashflow and hence don’t have to rely on debt market heavily.Last year, the Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry spent $935 million of capital and earned $1.2 billion of operating cashflow. Eventually, the industry’s free cash flow was recorded at $248 million, 2.3% higher than 2016. Most importantly, the industry recorded negative free cash flow of $601 million during 2015, thanks to weak crude prices, from where free cash flow turned positive to $242 million in 2016.Declining Debt LoadFrom mid-2014, the market witnessed free fall in crude prices. Following this, it was difficult for explorers to continue their operations and they had to depend on debt financing. Eventually, the balance sheet of most of the explorers were loaded with huge debt.But, with the partial recovery in crude prices, both the long-term and current debt load of the Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry fell drastically.Focus on Oil ExplorersPicking oil explorers seems to be a smart option at this moment. However, selecting winning stocks may be a daunting task.This is where our proprietary Stock Screener comes in handy. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank and other parameters.Headquartered in Midland, TX, Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) is primarily engaged in exploration activities in the Permian Basin. The company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the prior four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 48.9%. We are also expecting the firm to record earnings growth of 81.3% and 35.5% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.Currently, the firm sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.EOG Resources, Inc.

Also, the firm is expected to see earnings growth of 278.6% and 18.8% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.Headquartered in Dallas, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is focused on resources in the United States.

600,PXD,"Riding on the shale revolution yet again, the United States topped the global energy production charts in 2017 by churning out more than 15 million barrels per day (MMBbl/d). Retaining its status as the world's No. 1 producer of petroleum and natural gas hydrocarbons for the sixth straight year, the United States has beaten Saudi Arabia and Russia.As crude prices surged last year to above break-even levels, American drillers extracted record amounts of oil, especially from the less expensive shale plays even as Russia and Saudi Arabia withheld supplies to revive the commodity.It must be mentioned that the United States became the world’s largest natural gas operator back in 2009 when it went past Russia, while it jumped to the top of the petroleum hydrocarbons leaderboard in 2013 ahead of Saudi Arabia. As far as overall production is concerned, the United States has been the world's top producer since 2012.The Shale RevolutionWith the advent of hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) – a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water, sand and chemicals – shale production is now booming in the United States. Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract oil/gas from shale formations, the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U.S. energy supplies, playing a key role in boosting domestic reserves. As a result, once faced with a looming deficit, oil and natural gas are now available in abundance.U.S. Production Rises in 2017 to Maintain No. 1 PositionAccording to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), which provides official energy statistics from the U.S., domestic liquids supply increased by 745,000 barrels a day last year as oil prices gained 21% to around $65-a-barrel.In contrast, both Saudi Arabia and Russia saw their petroleum output decrease in 2017 as part of a broader alliance – forged in late 2016 – to limit production. The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Meanwhile, U.S. natural gas production turned around from previous year’s loss but rose by a meagre 1% in 2017. The tepid growth was mainly on account of lower prices prevailing in the early part of the year, relatively warmer winter weather (compared with 2016) and fall in power generation demand.On the other hand, Russia and Saudi churned out significantly higher natural gas in 2017 – growing at 8% and 6% year over year, respectively.Overall, U.S. production of petroleum liquids and natural gas reached an estimated 15.60 MMBbl/d in 2017.What’s Ahead?The EIA further added that U.S. petroleum production is forecast to average 17.58 MMBbl/d in 2018 and 19.14 MMBbl/d next year, continuing the positive trend from 2017. Volume from U.S. oil fields (inclusive of shale) has risen 27% since mid-2016 to more than 10.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter. In fact, domestic volumes are now breathing down the neck of top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million barrels per day.The EIA also predicts natural gas production to set a new record in 2018, churning out 80.5 billion cubic feet on a daily basis.Shale Industry Adjusts to the New RealityNow at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Want to Own a Shale Stock Now?While there are several leading players like Matador Resources Company (MTDR  -  Free Report), Continental Resources, Inc.

601,PXD,"On Mar 22, Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?For first-quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) has been revised higher from a loss of 2 cents to EPS of 10 cents over the last 60 days. The consensus estimate for 2018 earnings was revised to 42 cents from 10 cents over the same period.Moreover, the exploration and production company has an impressive earnings surprise history, the average being 175% for the last four quarters.Along with the announcement of fourth-quarter 2017 results, Northern Oil and Gas reported an increase in total net proved reserves. Through 2017, the company witnessed an increase of 40% in net proved reserves to 54.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), which entails higher future oil and gas production.The company has raised first-quarter and full-year 2018 guidance for production. For first-quarter 2018, Northern Oil and Gas expects average daily production to increase 5-6% over the prior-year quarter, up sequentially about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It has also raised full-year 2018 production guidance, projecting an increase of 18-22% from 2017 and up from the previous guidance of 16-20%.We appreciate the company’s decision to complete higher wells during 2018. This year, Northern Oil and Gas plans to bring online 20-22 net oil and gas wells compared with 16.9 last year.Northern Oil and Gas has set a capital budget of $165-$180 million for 2018. Majority of the budget is expected to be spent for drilling and completion activity. The decision seems impressive considering that the company has a trailing 12-month return on capital investment of 2.4%, higher than 2% of the Zacks Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production industry.Also, the upstream energy firm gained 2.4% over the last three months against the industry’s 1.9% decline. Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked players in the same sector are Continental Resources, Inc (CLR  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc (CXO  -  Free Report).

602,PXD,"Markets closed slightly lower on Thursday after President Donald Trump scrapped his planned meeting with North Korea’s premier Kim Jong Un. Further, Trump also threatened to impose import duty on cars and trucks that took a toll on the markets. Moreover, the broader energy sector took a hit as investors dumped energy stocks as oil prices declined on news that Opec members could escalate production to ease supply restraint from Iran and Venezuela.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.3% to close at 24,811.75. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to close at 2,727.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed almost unchanged at 7,424.43, declining less than 0.1%. A total of 6.3 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.6 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow lost 75.05 points after hitting a lot of as much as 280.91 points on news of Trump cancelling the Singapore summit. However, the losses were pared by gains in Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report).The S&P 500 lost 5.53 points, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) and Financial Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) losing 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors ended the day in negative territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq made a marginal loss of 1.53 points.Trump Cancels Meeting with Kim Jong UnTrump on Thursday cancelled the scheduled June 12 Singapore summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Trump cited “open hostility” from North Korea as the reason behind the cancellation of the meeting. This would have been the first face-to-face meeting with an U.S. president and a North Korean leader.The cancellation followed even though North Korea kept its promise to blow up tunnels at its nuclear test site. The news dented investors’ confidence, with stocks taking a hit immediately. However, the initial losses were pared later after shares of Netflix and General Electric rallied. Netflix’s market value jumped to $153 billion, surpassing Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) for the first time to make it the world’s most valuable entertainment company.Oil Prices Fall Investors shunned energy stocks on Thursday, on possibilities of easing oil production caps by Russia and Opec countries sending crude oil prices lower. News of Opec members planning to increase the production of oil in order to ease supply constraints from Venezuela and Iran, saw investors panicking over crude oil prices going down. Both Iran and Venezuela are under threat from U.S. sanctions.This saw major energy stocks plummeting with Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD  -  Free Report) and Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) declining 3.1% each. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) declined 2.3% and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) sank 1.6%. Chevron has a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).

Trump is also considering slapping 25% import duty on automobile imports. This dampened the spirits of foreign automakers, which continued to take a toll on shares of foreign automakers on Thursday. This saw shares of major foreign carmakers like Toyota (T  -  Free Report) and Honda (HMC  -  Free Report) taking a hit once again on Thursday.Stocks That Made HeadlinesFoot Locker Q1 Earnings & Sales Top Estimates, Stock UpFoot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) continued with its positive earnings surprise streak for the third straight quarter, when it reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.  (Read More)Gap Q1 Earnings Miss Hits Stock, Revenues Top EstimatesShares of The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) declined in after-hours trading yesterday, following lower-than-expected earnings in first-quarter fiscal 2018.   (Read More)Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

Their combined power distribution lines will likely spread across 93,600 miles.As of now, the price performances of SCANA and Dominion Energy are not impressive, although the stocks are poised to gain from the merger.

605,PXD,"Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), a firm in the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, PXD has beaten estimates by at least 60% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago, PXD expected to post earnings of 30 cents per share, while it actually produced earnings of 48 cents per share, a beat of 60%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver earnings of 76 cents per share, when it actually produced earnings of $1.22 per share instead, representing a 60.5% positive surprise.Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and EPS Surprise Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and EPS Surprise | Pioneer Natural Resources Company QuoteThanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Pioneer Natural Resources.

606,PXD,"Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) recently released a statement updating its downstream segment’s outlook, bringing in pleasant news for the investors. Post the announcement, shares of the Anglo-Dutch giant have moved up 2.04% to eventually close at $63.48 on Mar 21. The European supermajor now expects strong growth in its downstream segment over the coming years.The company’s downstream segment — comprising refining, marketing/retail and chemical business — reported adjusted income of around $1.4 billion in the last quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of more than 4% on the back of improving refining environment and higher marketing contribution.Adapting to the changing times, Shell is successfully reorienting and re-strategizing its business to de-carbonize the energy system. In a bid to generate double-digit returns and maximize the value of its downstream segment, the company is focused on streamlining its portfolio by divesting various projects including Motiva JV, Showa Shell and SADAF petrochemicals. Meanwhile, it is concentrating on modernizing and upgrading its refineries by using superior technologies to derive high-value light products. As such, it is poised for a competitive downstream portfolio, helping the company ride out commodity price fluctuations.  Shell plans to make a yearly investment of around $7-$9 billion in its downstream segment, forecasting a return on average capital employed (ROACE) of more than 15%. The company now forecasts to generate annual organic free cash flow of about $6-$7 billion for its downstream segment by 2020, in line with its prior guidance. It additionally updated its estimates for 2025, aiming to generate $9-$12 billion in annual free cash flow in its downstream business by 2025.The marketing unit, accounting for almost half of Shell’s total downstream unit, is expected to generate more than $1 and $2.5 billion in annual earnings by 2020 and 2025, respectively, with an average annual growth rate exceeding 7%.Annual earnings in its retail division is also likely to grow to $4 billion by 2025 (versus 2.2 billion in 2017), on geographical expansion by tapping in fast-growing markets, premium fuels and lubricants, increase in convenience stores, along with digital and e-mobility services.Shell also aims to reduce its refining integrated margin and improve operational excellence to create more value in the refining division.  The Chemicals business, which had a record year in 2017, is a strong growth priority and set to be the driving factor for the downstream business of the company. The company estimates to generate more than $3.5-$4 billion annually in its Chemicals division by 2025, on the back of increased global demand for petrochemicals that is expected to grow at least 3% per year.Additionally, the division is also set to get a boost from annual capital investment of around $3-$4 million in world-scale projects including local cracker plants, among others. The company’s $6 billion ethane cracker plant in Potter Township will come online by early next decade, generating substantial revenues for Shell. The Alpha olefins and Pernis solvent deasphalting expansion projects in the Netherlands also bode well for the Chemical unit.Shell has had an impressive run on the bourse over a year and possesses a great potential to continue its momentum forward. Shell’s shares have returned 20.8% in a year, outperforming 13.1% gain of the industry it belongs to. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked players in the energy space include Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Continental Resources, Inc.

Can you blame them?The energy stocks plunged to multi-year lows in 2016 and 2017 as crude fell into the $30s. Oil analysts were forecasting even more doom, with some predicting crude would fall under $20 a barrel.It never did.The energy stocks have recovered from the sell off in fits and starts during that time, with at least one false bottom.But now, in mid-2018, it appears, with crude above $70 a barrel for the first time in 3 ½ years and the stocks on a tear, that the worst is over.If this is the beginning of the big energy turnaround, where do you want to invest?Where to Invest?

609,PXD,"The United States has pulled out of the landmark deal curbing Iran’s nuclear program and reimposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Trump said that it was a “horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.” He added that the “Iran deal is defective at its core” and it’s an “embarrassment” that the United States did little to restrain Iran’s nuclear ambition.In the run-up to the U.S. decision, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that he has evidence that the nuclear deal was nothing but fabrications and Iran was hiding nuclear weapons. Trump agreed that Netanyahu’s claims corroborated his own view.So, what is the Iran nuclear deal? It was a historic agreement reached by Iran and several other world powers including Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States to reduce the Islamic Republic’s ability to produce two major components of nuclear weapons — plutonium and uranium. In return, Iran will be able spared of crippling financial sanctions. The deal also permitted Iran to export more crude provided the nation restricted its nuclear activities.Let us now take a look at the potential winners and losers emerging from the end of the Iran nuclear deal:Oil Near $70, Energy Stocks GainWith the United States poised to reimpose sanctions on Iran’s petroleum sales, oil prices initially dropped but rebounded soon after. This has disrupted global oil production at a time when the crude market is tight. The international benchmark, Brent crude oil, rose as high as 3.1% to $77.20 in early trading in London on May 9, while the benchmark price for U.S. crude oil climbed to $70.93. Shares of energy companies are, undoubtedly, rallying as crude prices hover near $70 a barrel. Energy shares are looking up after they fell out of favor when oil price slipped from $100 a barrel to under $30 in 2014. In fact, the energy sector of the S&P 500 has risen more than 10% in the past month to total gains of 3.1% so far this year.From exploration and production firm Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) to petroleum refiner Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), all have seen a rally in shares of more than 20% to date, easily outperforming the broader S&P 500’s decline of less than 0.1%. Meanwhile, smaller energy equipment and services companies, whose shares tend to rise with an uptick in oil prices, have gained even more.At the same time, companies like Encana Corporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company’s (PXD  -  Free Report) earnings are poised to improve further as oil prices scale north. This is because these companies have already posted better results in the most recent quarter when oil prices were between $50 and $60 a barrel.As oil continues to hover around $70 a barrel and is probably heading toward $80 soon, these energy players will not only make the most of the higher spot prices but will also hedge into next year at higher oil prices.But let’s admit that it’s just not oil prices that are changing investors’ attitude toward energy companies. Stronger balance sheets, steady rise in profitability and focus to boost shareholders’ returns are shaping the turnaround in the energy space.Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) have already seen the best first-quarter performance in years last month. In all, the highest first quarter year-over-year earnings growth is likely to be recorded in the energy sector, which is expected to surge 73.9% from the same period last year on 14.4% higher revenues.Given this bullishness, some of the top-ranked energy shares one could consider are Evolution Petroleum Corporation (EPM  -  Free Report), Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (PES  -  Free Report), Oasis Midstream Partners LP (OMP  -  Free Report) and Rice Midstream Partners LP (RMP  -  Free Report). These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners (read more: Oil Hits $70 for First Time in 4 Years: 5 Top Energy Picks).Travel Shares Go Down, Boeing in TroubleThe surge in oil prices incited investors to dump travel and leisure stocks, put off by the prospect of increasing fuel costs for airlines. Travel and leisure stocks dropped as much as 2.1% on May 8.Trump’s announcement to withdraw from what he considers a “defective” Iranian nuclear deal, in the meantime, is expected to heighten tensions in the Middle East region. This doesn’t bode well for The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report). The airline manufacturer stands to lose a whopping $20 billion in business with Iran. After all, it has an agreement to sell around 110 planes worth the said amount to Iranian airlines.The U.S. withdrawal also affected Boeing’s French rival Airbus SE, which had a multibillion-dollar sale planned. IranAir has ordered nearly 80 passenger aircraft from Airbus.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

610,PXD,"It was a week where oil prices reached their strongest level in over three years, while natural gas futures ended lower on a bearish inventory report.On the news front, energy biggies BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher oil prices and production, while refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) agreed to acquire rival Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) for more than $23 billion.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 2.4% to close at $69.72 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 2.2% to $2.711 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: CVX & RDS.A Earnings Impress, XOM & TOT Disappoint)The U.S. oil benchmark settled at three-year highs on the possibility of United States re-imposing sanctions on Iran and sharp declines in output from Venezuela.Of late, crude prices have been supported by indications that the Trump administration might lead America's exit from the landmark Iran nuclear deal if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12. The return of sanctions would put pressure on OPEC’s third-largest oil producer’s energy industry and reduce global supply.Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by almost 50% since the early 2000s. Venezuela currently churns out just around 1.5 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week following a larger-than-expected increase in supplies – the first storage build of the injection season when demand is at its weakest ahead of the summer cooling period. Investors were further spooked by expanding dry gas production, which is currently at an all-time high.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    British energy giant BP plc reported strong first-quarter 2018 results on rebounding oil prices, record production and increased refinery throughput.The company’s adjusted earnings of 78 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS) – on a replacement cost basis, excluding non-operating items – surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents and the year-ago quarter’s 46 cents.

612,PXD,"PetroChina Company Limited (PTR  -  Free Report) recently received stakes in two offshore oil concessions from the national oil company of UAE, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (""ADNOC""), for a total consideration of $1.18 billion. The Chinese oil company signed the agreements that have a term of 40 years and are back-dated to Mar 9, 2018. Present Scenario at the ConcessionsPer the deal, PetroChina paid a fee of $600 million for a 10% stake in the Lower Zakum concession, and $575 million for 10% interest in the Umm Shaif and Nassr concession. Notably, last week, French oil major TOTAL S.A.

613,PXD,"It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectation. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to eight.Here are five out of the eight stocks:Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report): This is a manufacturer and seller of construction and mining equipment. The stock comes from a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 3%). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.

615,PXD,"On Mar 21, Antero Resources Corporation (AR  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?For first-quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been revised upward from 25 cents to 35 cents over the last 60 days. The consensus mark for current-year earnings was raised to $1.29 from $1.03 over the same time period.Antero Resources’ free cashflow for 2017 was recorded at $1.1 billion, up 337.5% from the comparable period last year, courtesy of the partial recovery in natural gas and oil pricing scenario. This reflects the company’s generated sufficient operating cashflow in the preceding year for funding its capital spending.  Last month, Antero Resources reported an increase in total net proved reserves, which by the company’s estimate, grew 12% through 2017 to 17.3 Tcfe (trillion cubic feet equivalent), having entailed higher future liquid and gas production.  During 2017, the upstream energy player enhanced daily production by 22% to 2.3 Bcfe/D (billion cubic feet equivalent). Moreover, the company projects a rise in its net daily output to 2.7 Bcfe/D through 2018. We also appreciate Antero Resources’ sturdy balance sheet. Its total debt to capitalization ratio stands at 35.1%, lower than the industry’s 46.8%. The company’s increased expected production will likely be supported by its strong grip over the prospective Marcellus and Utica Shale plays. In the Utica Shale, Antero Resources’ footing spreads across 137,000 net acres while the company’s Marcellus footprint covers 486,000 net acres.Moreover, Antero Resources’ pricing chart looks impressive. Year to date, shares of the company have outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 3.6% against the industry’s 9.3% decline. Other Stocks to ConsiderOther Zacks #1 Ranked players in the energy space include W&T Offshore, Inc.

The company started the detailed engineering work of the project as it foresees a rise in demand for high-performance, lightweight durable plastics.The final decision on the multi-billion facility, expected to come online in 2021, will be made this year. The construction period is expected to create more than 600 jobs. Once the project comes online, it will generate in excess of 60 permanent jobs. Project RationaleThe advanced polypropylene products from the facility can be used in several businesses including high performance automotive, appliance and packaging applications.

618,PXD,"SandRidge Energy, Inc. , an oil and gas player, recently aborted plans to merge with Tulsa-based rival Midstates Petroleum Company, in an all-stock deal. Last month, Midstates Petroleum had made the proposal to merge with SandRidge after the latter dropped its plan to acquire Colorado-based Bonanza, Creek Energy, Inc. (BCEI  -  Free Report) following intense opposition from its shareholders.However, after comprehensive technical and financial review, along with careful evaluation of all other strategic alternatives, SandRidge also canceled plans to merge with Midstates Petroleum.Had the deal been finalized, it surely would have improved the scale and value for both the players by creating one of the largest entities in the Mississippian Lime shale formation, as both the companies have a strong presence in the region. However, the merger would entail a significant risk as Mississippi Lime requires much higher commodity prices to prove highly productive.The company is skeptical about Midstates’ reserves, and the economic feasibility of drilling locations at current oil and gas prices. Further, SandRidge believes that the merger is not likely to unlock substantial synergies unless the company employs Midstates’ assets with high operational efficiency. As such, SandRidge does not support Midstates’ estimate that the merger would result in free cash flows of $320-$400 million over the next four years. The company thus views the collaboration as highly dilutive and not in the best interests of shareholders.Meanwhile, SandRidge is exploring other strategic alternatives that will help increase significant shareholders’ value. The company is likely to examine divestment and joint venture opportunities at its North Park Basin assets, along with other potential mergers that stand to fit best in the company’s long-term growth. In fact, SandRidge is open to reconsider merger offer from Midstates’ as well albeit with certain changes in the terms and conditions, so as make it an appealing investment that would yield superior risk-adjusted returns in the coming years. Notably, Midstates, which still believes in the efficacy of the deal, is thus considering options related to the transaction.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSandRidge is engaged in the development and production of oil and gas. The company mainly focuses on promoting high return, growth-oriented projects in the U.S. Mid-Continent and Niobrara Shale. SandRidge is headquartered in Oklahoma City, OK.SandRidge recovered from bankruptcy in October 2016 after reorganizing $4.1 billion in debt. The company is undertaking strategic initiatives to make the company more efficient and reduce costs in order to reap higher investment returns. In the 2018 guidance, the company announced its intention to lower general and administrative expenses in the range of $36-$39 million per annum.The company carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).SandRidge Energy, Inc.

619,PXD,"Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) recently cleared a significant regulatory hurdle of final environmental review for its proposed Line 3 crude pipeline project in northern Minnesota. The project has received unanimous approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The project's fate now awaits an administrative law judge's report on its importance, which is expected to be released on Apr 23, 2018.Regulators: Line 3 Project is “adequate” The regulatory board is of the opinion that the project meets all legal requirements, after it considered the proposed alternatives for the pipeline's route. Through the project, which was highly opposed by the environmentalists, the company is planning to replace the aging Line 3 crude oil pipeline.The old pipeline was built in the 1960s and ships crude to Enbridge's terminal in Superior, WI from Alberta through North Dakota and Minnesota. The company, with the use of strong steel, is likely to restore the pipeline's original shipping capacity of 760,000 barrels per day (BPD), which has come down to 390,000 BPD. The company's proposition incorporates replacing the old pipeline's 282-mile stretch in Minnesota with a new alternate routed pipeline of 337 miles that goes through the pristine Mississippi River headwaters area. It is also expected to make the shipping to Midwest refineries more reliable.Meanwhile the public opinion on the pipeline remains divided. The Minnesota locals have welcomed the replacement to ensure better environmental security and the creation of 8,600 jobs. The total economic impact of the project on the state is expected to be around $2 billion. On the other hand, it contradicts with the interests of the Ojibwe groups, who fear that a spill in their lake can disrupt food sources as it can contaminate the area where they gather wild rice.Enbridge’s View Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge’s take on the project answers many questions regarding the environmental impact of the pipeline.  As it is, the pipeline, being quite old, needs frequent maintenance. Moreover, the pipeline’s currently curtailed capacity forces oil shippers from Alberta oil sands to carry the additional crude by rail or road, both less efficient than the pipeline. Enbridge believes, the approval of the replacement project will help the refineries in Minnesota and the regional oil market. Moreover, the company expects that the jobs created through the project and following its completion will be important for the state's economy.The capital cost of the project in Canada is estimated to be C$5.3 billion while the portion in the United States will cost $2.9 billion. The pipeline will transport light, medium and heavy crude oil.Price Performance Enbridge has lost 24.7% last year against 12.2% growth of its industry. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEnbridge carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), Continental Resources, Inc.

622,PXD,"W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI  -  Free Report), on Mar 20, was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?The company has recently released some positive news that is bound to help the company in the long run. On Mar 12, 2018, the company signed a joint exploration and development deal with an investor group, which will enable the company to drill 14 projects in the prolific Gulf of Mexico for more than three years. Initially, W&T Offshore will receive 30% of the net revenues from the project, which can later increase to 38.4%. The deal is expected to help the company develop its high-return inventory.Additionally, W&T Offshore successfully bid on an interest in three blocks in the Gulf of Mexico’s Heidelberg field. The bid by the company covers Cobalt International Energy’s entire interest in the field, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Cobalt's production in February 2018 from the assets was approximately 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. W&T Offshore bid $31.1 million cash for the interest as the quality of the assets satisfies the company’s acquisition criteria.Moreover, the leading oil and gas explorer has an impressive earnings surprise history, the average positive earnings surprise being 542.8% in the trailing four quarters.W&T Offshore’s total proved oil equivalent reserves – as of Dec 31, 2017 – was 74.2 million barrels, marginally higher than 2016.W&T Offshore has set a capital budget of $130 million for 2018 that will be spent for the oil-rich projects. The decision seems impressive given that the company has a trailing 12-month return on capital investment of 21.7%, significantly higher than 2% of the industry it belongs to. Also, the Houston, TX-based upstream energy firm has gained 39.7% in the last year against the industry’s 12.4% decline.  Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), Continental Resources, Inc.

623,PXD,"Per sources, Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE  -  Free Report) is looking for a partner to finance the costs amounting to C$1.3 billion ($993.1 million) relating to the construction of the supporting infrastructure at the company’s Narrows Lake oil sands project in Alberta.The Canadian energy firm’s balance sheet has been under tremendous pressure after it spent C$17 billion on the purchase of oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips (COP) last year. Hence, Cenovus Energy has been trying to raise funds in order to reduce its debt burden.Though the transaction increased the company's size by twofold, shareholders have raised concerns with respect to its strained financial position. As a result, Cenovus Energy had to lay off personnel, lower costs and sell assets. In 2017, it raised about C$4 billion from divestments. This year, the company estimates further sales from its Deep Basin position.To refrain from putting further pressure on its balance sheet, Cenovus Energy expects to secure the funds for the above-mentioned construction project from an external partner. In exchange, Cenovus Energy will enter into a long-term agreement with the partner to utilize the assets.Per Cenovus Energy’s website, production from the first phase of Narrows Lake is anticipated at about 65,000 barrels of oil per day.

624,PXD,"BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report), per Bloomberg, recently started the divestment process for its Egyptian mature oil fields. The move is expected to enable the company shift its focus toward the massive natural gas resources in the country.DivestmentThe British energy giant was planning to divest its Gulf of Suez assets — which employ thousands of locals — for a few months and generate around $1 billion from the oil assets. Total daily production from the assets includes 70,000 barrels of oil and 400 million cubic feet of gas. The sale is in line with the company's strategy to divest $2-$3 billion worth of assets through 2018, which is much lower than $4.3 billion the company received from divestment and other proceeds last year.The sell-offs are helping the company reduce its overall debt burden that increased rapidly since 2009. Moreover, the oil spill incident of 2010 in the BP-operated Macondo Prospect has shaken the company to the core. Through the divestments, the company is still recovering from the oil spill. Focus on Natural GasBP is following the global trend of increasing focus on cleaner energy, natural gas. The company projects demand for gas to increase 1.6% per annum in the 2016-2040 time frame, much higher than oil's 0.5%. This explains the company's intention to shift toward natural gas production. Last year, the company brought quite a few gas projects online that included the Zohr field of Egypt. Focusing on assets of natural gas in the country further ensures the potential of the gas reserves in Egypt. Additionally, along with its partners like Eni S.p.A. (E  -  Free Report) and others, BP is responsible for 30% of Egypt's gas production.The divestment is also expected to enable the company concentrate on deepwater gas fields off the country’s Mediterranean coast.About BP & Price PerformanceLondon-based BP is among the leading integrated energy players in the world.

625,PXD,"Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (EEP  -  Free Report) has announced the initial evaluation of the effects of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) recent policy change, related to the recovery of income tax amounts included in the cost of service rates of pipelines within a master limited partnership (MLP).A major change in its long-standing policy was announced by FERC on Mar 15, 2018. Pursuant to this, permit entities organized as master limited partnerships (MLPs), would no longer be able to recover an income tax allowance in the respective cost of service rates.  The policy in place since 2005, has always treated the income tax amounts as inclusion in the rates of pipelines and other entities, subject to cost of service rate regulation within an MLP.Enbridge Energy Partners, organized as an MLP, used to charge certain amount of the rates applicable to its expansion projects annually on a cost of service basis through the Lakehead Facility Surcharge Mechanism (FSM).The firm plans to ask for rehearing of this policy change at the FERC. The commission's new policy will be effective when it gets published in the Federal Register probably on Mar 31, 2018 for the purpose of estimating the 2018 impact.However, if FERC’s new policy is approved ditto its announcement, then Enbridge Energy Partners’ revenues would be reduced by around $100 million and distributable cash flow (DCF) by $60 million in 2018.Per the prior preliminary analysis and estimates, Enbridge Energy Partners is altering its 2018 DCF guidance range to $650-$700 million from $720-$770 million and that of 2018 total distribution coverage to about 1.0x from about 1.15x.More clarification is required with respect to the new policy statement’s implementation while the partnership firm will keep an eye on evaluating the financial impact on its operation as and when more information is available.Price PerformanceEnbridge Energy Partners’ shares have underperformed its industry in the last three months.

626,PXD,"Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) has released its strategic plan for 2018-2021, signifying a usual progression of the same executed in the previous years and intends to continue boosting all business value.The company has undergone a successful transformation, resulting in a more integrated set-up, well positioned for further growth in the upstream sector. The mid-downstream businesses have also been reorganized, making them financially more sound and prepared to generate worth even in the low oil price scenarios.DividendEni intends to increase the dividend for 2018 to €0.83 per share, up 3.75% from 2017, fully payable in cash.UpstreamDuring the 2018-2021 period, Eni proposes to invest about €3.2 billion for exploring new acres of land, with resource potential of 2 billion barrels of oil and gas. The company plans to drill around 115 wells in more than 25 countries worldwide and include a new net acreage of 400 thousand square kilometers.Over the same phase, hydrocarbon production is estimated to grow 3.5% a year. This in turn will be backed by the ramp-up and commissioning of new projects, which is likely to contribute about 700 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021.From 2018 to 2021, Eni expects a cumulative free cash flow generation of €22 billion, subject to the success of the exploration strategy and the extensive portfolio of new conventional projects with a break-even of less than $30/barrel together with a rigorous financial discipline.Gas and PowerThe segment is projected to witness rapid growth in the company’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolio with a target set to reach 12 million tons per year of contracted volumes in 2021 and 14 million by 2025. Further, through the improvement of the equity component, the volumes will be expanded to 70% in 2021 from 30% in 2017.Moreover, the gas portfolio and retail sector in Europe would register growth. It expects a customer base of about 11 million in 2021, up 25% from 2017. These upsides would help the business attain a wide clientele base of 800 million in 2021, of which 60% would come from retail and increase from 300 million of 2018. Cumulative free cash flow during 2018-21 is predicted at €2.4 billion.Refining & Marketing and ChemicalsUnder this segment, Eni expects strong growth during the planned period with a cumulative free cash flow of more than €2 billion and an EBIT of €900 million in 2021.To achieve these targets, Eni needs to restart the Sannazzaro EST plant by the end of 2018, boost the green refining capacity as well as the bio-refinery in Gela would come online by the end of 2018 and the second phase of development of Venice would conclude by 2021. Moreover, consolidation of the company’s leading marketing position in Italy, capitalizing on the new sustainable mobility initiatives would also be required.ChemicalsIn this segment, Eni estimates to achieve an EBIT of about €400 million in 2021. This can be attained by boosting integration and efficiency, enhancing the production portfolio of differentiated products, international development, escalating the company’s presence in Asia and growing its commercial footprint in the Americas and in the Far East. Consolidation of organic chemistry is also possible through leveraging new industrial platforms from renewable sources.New Energy SolutionsThe latest New Energy Solutions business is expected to grow over the four-year period. The growth would be attributable to a unique model based on incorporation with existing assets and activities, which will lead to creation of new opportunities and value. This unique model will bring synergies in energy costs for production facilities, thus making more gas available for local consumption or export. The expected return on these projects will be about 10%. Over the next two years, Eni’s new energy capacity will rise by about 400 MW. This will be mainly because of the ongoing projects and those already recognized. Moreover, through investments worth €1.2 billion, Eni will develop 1 GW of new capacity by 2021 and up to 5 GW by 2025, over the medium to long term.Decarbonization ProcessEni has outlined a decarbonization process and expects to follow a comprehensible and definite climate strategy with total investment of more than €1.8 billion in the four-year period of 2018-21. The model emphasizes a cut in direct GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by about 43% compared with 2014 through projects designed at reducing process flaring, eliminating fugitive emissions of methane and achieving energy efficiency measures. The new upstream projects in execution have break-even points below $30 per barrel. The second phase of the Venice bio-refinery will also be developed along with a startup at Gela in Sicily by the end of 2018 and consolidation in green chemistry.Financial StrategyThe capital expenditure for this four-year plan is estimated at less than €32 billion. It will focus on high-value projects with quick returns. Of the total capex, over 80% will be allocated to the upstream, about €3.5 billion is apportioned for the repair and maintenance (R&M) while the chemicals business is anticipated to have about 10% return rate. Moreover, the amount will provide ample flexibility as more than 50% of the investments will not be committed by 2021.Based on Brent price of $60 per barrel, Eni is assumed to realize an operating cash flow of more than €11 billion in 2018, which might further appreciate above €2 billion in 2021 for the same scenario.Price PerformanceEni’s shares have gained 3.3% in the last three months against the industry’s 2.6% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEni carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

627,PXD,"Brazil's state-run energy giant Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (PBR  -  Free Report) or Petrobras announced fourth-quarter earnings per ADR of 20 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents. However, the bottom line fell by a penny year over year. The earnings beat was supported by higher oil prices, partially negated by lower production and decreased margin from downstream operations.Petrobras’ free cash flows through 2017 increased almost 12% to $13,850 million, reflecting that the company has sufficient operating cashflow to support investment. However, adjusted EBITDA was down 6% year over year to $24,039 million. During 2017, exports of oil and oil products rose 23%, while imports fell 18%. This helped the company maintain the position of net exporter with a positive balance of 361 thousand barrels per day.Asset Disposal PlanOver the 2017-2018 period, the company intends to rake in proceeds of $21 billion from asset sale. This will help Petrobras strengthen its balance sheet by lowering debt.Revenue, Production and PricesThe troubled national oil company’s net fourth-quarter 2017 operating revenues of $23,567 million improved from the year-earlier sales of $21,403 million on higher crude prices but fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26,321 million.The Rio de Janeiro-headquartered company’s total oil and gas production during the fourth quarter reached 2,737 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d) — 80.4% liquids — down from 2,868 MBOE/d in the same period of 2016. The decline can be attributed to issues related to operations in the Hadrian South gas field.Compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, Brazilian oil and natural gas production — constituting 96% of the overall output — dropped 4% to 2,636 MBOE/d.  In the October-to-December period, the average sales of oil in Brazil jumped 22.1% from the year-earlier period to $55.82 per barrel.Capital Spending & Balance SheetDuring the year ended Dec 31, 2017, Petrobras’ capital investments and expenditures totaled $13,639 million, lower than $14,085 million incurred in the year-ago period.This allowed the world's most indebted oil company to record the lowest debt over the last six years. At the end of December 2017, the company had net debt of $84,871 million, reflecting a decline from $96,381 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 51%, down from 55% a year ago. Additionally, Petrobras ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $22,519 million.Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksPetrobras carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.

628,PXD,"Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) boosted production at Nooros gas field to 32 million cubic meters per day or about 215,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d).The production level marks the highest in ten decades by an Eni field in Egypt. The level was achieved owing to the commissioning of the NW-7, the 13th well within this field. The production will be boosted when a 14th well, currently under drilling, is brought online by June 2018. This is estimated to boost production to 34 million cubic meters per day or about 230,000 boe/d.Discovered in July 2015, the Nooros field lies in the Nile Delta offshore area. The field was brought into production within a month of discovery. Currently, Nooros is the leading gas producing field in the company’s Egyptian asset portfolio. It is also an example of the company’s integrated model success. The discovery reflects Eni’s ‘near field’ exploration strategy, which aspires to trace potential additional reserves located nearby to already existing upstream infrastructures.In the mid-term, Nooros’ development will be escalated following the extension of the development lease that will involve investments, especially the construction of a new pipeline connecting Nooros with the El Gamil onshore treatment plant by year end 2018 and early 2019. These developments will make certain the attainment of above-production level in the mid-term while maximizing recoverable reserves.The measures will include the commissioning of Baltim SW along with the ramp up of any future exploration potential in the Nile Delta area. Eni holds a 50% stake through its affiliate IEOC Production BV, in Baltim SW, while BP plc (BP) holds the remaining 50%.Eni holds a 75% stake through its affiliate IEOC Production BV, in the Nile Delta Concession, where Nooros is located, while BP holds the remaining 25%.Price PerformanceEni’s shares have gained 3.2% in the last three months against the industry’s 3.5% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEni carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Statoil ASA , Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report).

629,PXD,"On Mar 15, EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?For first-quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been revised higher from 82 cents to 88 cents over the last 30 days. The consensus estimate for 2018 earnings was revised to $4.11 from $3.60 over the same period.Moreover, the leading oil and gas explorer has an impressive earnings surprise history, the average positive earnings surprise being 25.7% for the last four quarters.Along with the announcement of fourth-quarter results last month, EOG Resources reported an increase in total net proved reserves. Through 2017, the company saw an 18% increase in net proved reserves to 2,527 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), which entails higher future oil and gas production.We appreciate the company’s decision to complete higher wells during 2018. This year, EOG Resources plans for the completion of 690 net oil and gas wells versus 536 last year. Importantly, the company believes that a minimum of 90% of the completed wells will be premium. Such wells contribute 30% after tax return even if crude and natural gas traded lower at $40 per barrel and $2.50 per MMBtu respectively, per EOG Resources.EOG Resources has set a capital budget of $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion for 2018. Majority of the budget is expected to be spent for oil-rich resources like Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and the Bakken. The decision seems impressive given that the company has a trailing 12-month return on capital investment of 3.1%, significantly higher than 1.9% of the Zacks Oil & Gas-U.S Exploration industry. Also, the upstream energy firm has gained 2.9% over the past year against the industry’s 12.7% decline. Other Stocks to ConsiderOther Zacks #1 Ranked players in the energy space include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc.

630,PXD,"Investors may consider allocating their assets in stocks with favorable liquidity positions for big returns. Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.However, one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks. While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screen:Watertown, MA-based athenahealth Inc.

Pioneer's production from the West Panhandle field is expected to halt due to the damages. Production from the field averaged at around 8,000 barrels oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), of which roughly 20% was oil, 55% natural gas liquids and 25% gas. Total production in fourth-quarter 2017 averaged approximately 305 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), up 26.1% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 298 MBOE/d.Impacts on 2018 ResultsThe company fears its first-quarter 2018 production to get affected due to the stoppage of production in the field by around 2,000 BOE/d. Yet, Pioneer expects its total production in the first quarter to be in the guidance limit of 304,000-314,000 BOE/d. This can be supported by its Permian Basin outputs. Pioneer remains focused on the Permian Basin, which is among the lucrative oil shale plays with fewer risks for operation. The company expects first-quarter 2018 production from the basin to be in the range of 252,000-260,000 BOE/d.Additionally, in the Permian Basin, the company is expecting to start production from 250-275 wells in 2018, of which, 200-225 wells will be from the northern area, while 50 wells from the southern Wolfcamp joint venture area. The company’s focus on the Permian Basin is noteworthy as it provides ample growth opportunities.Alternative Option at HandAlthough the company can use some of its idle compressors to restart production in the West Panhandle field, production will likely start in late March or early April. Moreover, production will be then at its 80-90% of the earlier levels.Price PerformancePioneer has lost 5.4% in the past year compared with 9.9% decline of the industry it belongs to.About the CompanyIrving, TX-based Pioneer is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

635,PXD,"CNX Resources Corporation’s (CNX  -  Free Report) shares have gained 11.6% in a year’s time, against a decline of 10.7% in the Zacks Domestic E&P Oil and Gas industry.. CNX Resources is benefiting on the back of strong production from its Marcellus and Utica Shale holdings, and cost improvement.  CNX Resources planned its 2018 drilling and completion (D&C) expenditures in the range of $515-$580 million. Out of the D&C expenditures for 2018, 65% will be for the Marcellus Shale and 35% for the Utica Shale.Investments in both the resource-rich regions will help the company increase production volumes and meet its 2018 production volumes of 520-550 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), or nearly 31% annual increase based on the midpoint of its guidance. The company expects to drill 75 wells in 2018 and turn-in-line 59, and out of those 59 wells 46 will be in the Marcellus.CNX Resources was able to lower total quarterly natural gas production costs to $2.17 per thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe), compared with the year-earlier quarter of $2.27 per Mcfe, driven primarily by reductions in operating and gathering, and transportation expenses, due to increased volumes. The company aims to lower costs further in 2018.However, exploration & production of natural gas involves loads of operational risks. The cost of drilling, completing and operating its shale gas wells, shallow oil and gas wells, and coalbed methane wells is often uncertain. A number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations, decrease production and/or increase the cost of its natural gas operations at particular sites for varying lengths of time, thereby adversely affecting its operating results.CNX Resources Corporation has a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold).

637,PXD,"Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results, before the opening bell on Apr 27.   The company failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, the average negative surprise being 1.7%. In the last reported quarter, Exxon Mobil’s earnings of 88 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06, thanks to lower refinery throughput.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings of $1.20 has been revised upward over the last seven days.

640,PXD,"Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 26.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.96% on the back of rebounding commodity prices and cost-cut initiatives. Notably, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history, surpassing estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 9.34%. Investors are keeping their fingers crossed, expecting the Anglo-Dutch giant to top earnings estimate this time too.Royal Dutch Shell PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Royal Dutch Shell PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Royal Dutch Shell PLC Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 for the first quarter has been revised upward by 8 cents in the last seven days. The estimate of $1.22 also reflects a year-over-year decline of 48.8%.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that are likely to influence Shell’s earnings this quarter.Factors at PlayPer EIA data, crude oil rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to end the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. In fact, the first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark to attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite a record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts including strong demand, and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. The upstream segment of Shell is likely to benefit from higher crude price realizations.Last month, the company also raised the outlook for its downstream segment, which is poised for strong growth over the coming years. Shell plans to make a yearly investment of around $7-$9 billion in its downstream segment, forecasting a return on average capital employed of more than 15%. Importantly, the Chemicals business, which had a record year in 2017, is set to be the driving factor for the downstream business of the company.Shell’s $50-billion buyout of BG Group has boosted its strong and diversified portfolio of global energy businesses that offer promising long-term growth opportunities. We appreciate the company’s cost-reduction initiatives and efficiency gains. Last quarter, Shell raked in $6,610 million free cash flow compared with $5,741 million a year ago. The trend is expected to continue and drive the financials of the company.Moreover, Shell, which remains focused on reorienting and re-strategizing its portfolio, entered into various divestment deals this quarter — including the sale of Borssele wind project, coal gasification technology unit, West Qurna 1, Majnoon Field and a few others — to offload its non-core assets and buoy finances.Though these deals will strengthen financials and credit metrics of the company, it might affect volume growth adversely. As it is, Shell's fourth-quarter 2017 oil and gas production declined sequentially as well as from the year-ago period.Further, per EIA, prices of natural gas — which accounts for more than 40% of Shell’s total volumes — suffered a decline of 7.4% to end the quarter at $2.73 per million British thermal units, which can adversely impact the overall revenues.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Shell is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at $1.22.Zacks Rank: Shell sports a Zacks Rank #1.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Though a Zacks Rank #1 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat EarningsWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Shell, one can consider firms from the energy space having the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.53% and a Zacks Rank #3. The upstream player is anticipated to release earnings on May 2.NOW Inc. (DNOW  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +17.65% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. The energy equipment maker is expected to release earnings results on May 2.Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.15% and a Zacks Rank #3. Texas-based energy explorer is anticipated to release earnings results on May 2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

641,PXD,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 25.In the last reported quarter, the upstream energy company posted a negative earnings surprise of 12.2%. Moreover, Hess delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 0.8% for the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 55 cents for the first quarter has seen two upward revisions and one downward revision by firms in the last 60 days. It reflects an improvement of about 48.6% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,178 million for the first quarter, down 10.1% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderHess is among the leading producers of crude in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota. The company has interests in the best areas of the play. With healthy Q1 crude pricing scenario following OPEC’s extension of production cut deal through 2018-end, we believe that the Bakken play should contribute to the company’s production growth.  Analysts polled by Zacks expect average worldwide realized oil price to rise to $60 per barrel, from $57 in fourth-quarter 2017 and $48.61 a year ago. The rally in oil prices will benefit upstream players like Hess.Also, the company’s long-term debt fell 4.4% last year while cash balances jumped 77.4%, reflecting balance sheet strength. On top of that, free cashflow turned positive in 2017, against negative free cashflow recorded in 2016.Price Performance in Q1During the quarter, Hess has outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 6.6% against the industry's decline of 1.4%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Hess is likely to beat on earnings this time because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +6.36%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of 52 cents is narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 55 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hess carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings. The combination of Hess’ favorable Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report) is an oil and gas explorer.

646,PXD,"Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) signed two Concession agreements with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (“ADNOC”). The move is expected to strengthen the company’s footprint in the region, which is known to hold the largest hydrocarbon reserve in the world.The agreements include two offshore oil blocks in the Persian Gulf and marks Eni’s first expedition into oil development in the United Arab Emirates.For a total participation fee of about $875 million, the company acquired a 5% stake in the Lower Zakum offshore oil field and o a 10% stake in the oil, condensate and gas offshore fields of Umm Shaif and Nasr.

648,PXD,"Energy was a key sector driving profits for S&P 500 index in 2017. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the index witnessed year-over-year earnings growth of 7.1% last year. However, excluding the Energy sector, the index’s earnings growth fell drastically to 4.4%.Despite the impressive performance by energy companies, valuation of the sector is not on par with the index. We have employed trailing 12-month Enterprise Multiple for determining the value of the sector. This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt for investing on growth projects and EV includes debt for valuing company or industry.Enterprise Multiple = Enterprise Value (EV) / EBITDAOur proprietary model calculates EV/ EBITDA for the Energy sector at 6.53, lower than the index’s 11.8.Impressive Q4 ResultsAmong all the 16 sectors defining the index, only energy recorded triple-digit Q4 earnings growth of 157.2%. During fourth-quarter 2017, the Energy sector generated profits of $11.4 billion, compared with the respective $11 billion, $8.1 billion and $9.1 billion during the last three quarters.  Also, the trailing 12-month results show 271.6% earnings growth for Energy on 17.5% higher revenues. Per our data base, the sector raked in $39.3 billion profits in 2017, significantly higher than $9.2 billion through 2016.Higher oil prices primarily drove the sector’s performance. From the historical low-mark of $26.21 per barrel touched in February 2016, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI  -  Free Report) crude rose beyond the $60 psychological level. The extension of the production cut deal, first signed in late 2016, by the OPEC players through the end of 2018, primarily supported the rally in crude.Strong Earnings OutlookWe expect the Energy sector to earn $15.2 billion through the January-to-March quarter of 2018, up 33.3% sequentially. Moreover, in the second and third quarters of this year, the sector will likely report earnings of $17.4 billion and $17.5 billion, respectively.The forward 12-month earnings growth of the Energy sector stands at 88.6% on 18.4% higher revenues. On top of that, for 2018 and 2019, we project earnings of $66.9 billion and $72.6 billion, significantly higher than 2017 profits.The primary factors driving the expectations are tax cut and crude recovery. The Energy sector has long been a major tax payer with a median tax rate of 36.8% for the last 11 years, per the corporate tax calculator of MarketWatch. With a 21% tax rate, oil and gas companies will definitely save a lot of money, which could be directed toward growth and maintenance projects.Moreover, major energy players have started banking on the partial crude recovery. Global crude demand will also be a driving factor, believes The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report). The leading investment bank added that although a trade war might affect oil demand slowly, a weaker dollar could nullify the negative impact. This makes Goldman confident about its daily crude demand growth projection of 1.85 million barrels during 2018.Stocks in FocusRecord low jobless claims, robust jobs addition and healthy GDP numbers have been backing the market’s bull run. The chart provided below clearly shows that after a fall in 2008, the S&P 500 continues to move up at a steady pace, making the stock market significantly overvalued.However, energy is still undervalued despite its strong fundamentals and excellent earnings history.

650,PXD,"Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 20, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.1%, courtesy of a surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market. Moreover, Schlumberger delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4% over the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.   Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for the first quarter has been stable in the last seven days. The estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of about 52%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7,850 million for the first quarter, indicating a rise of13.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderSchlumberger is the largest oilfield services player in the world with access to every energy market. Through all operating business segments, the company maintains its position as one of the key players.For the Drilling Group segment, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pretax operating profit is $299 million, significantly higher than $229 million reported in the first quarter of 2017.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Production Group business unit is pegged at $282 million, higher than $110 million in the prior-year quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pretax operating income at the Reservoir Characterization segment is $290 million, higher than $281 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Overall, higher crude price during the first quarter is expected to support oilfield players, involved in the setting up of oil wells.The average monthly price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude per barrel for the month of January, February and March of 2018 was recorded at $63.70, $62.23 and $62.73, respectively, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Notably, the average monthly WTI crude price has never touched $60 since 2015. Crude rally was supported primarily by continued production curbs from OPEC and its allies.Nevertheless, we are concerned about Schlumberger’s lesser exposure to the U.S. shale plays – where more drillers have gathered following partial recovery in crude prices. Thus, Schlumberger is losing out on the opportunity to gain profitable contracts from shale drillers of late.Price Performance in Q1During the quarter, Schlumberger lost 3.9% compared with the industry’s 8.3% decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Schlumberger is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -2.22% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 37 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 38 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with earnings ESP of -2.22%, lowers the possibility of an earnings surprise.Stocks to ConsiderThough earnings beat looks uncertain for Kinder Morgan, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Continental Resources, Inc (CLR  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company.

651,PXD,"Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) is expected to post first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 18.Last quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 16.7%. Moreover, Kinder Morgan delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 4.6% in the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents for the first quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. It reflects improvement of about 23.5% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,482 million for the impending quarter, showing an increase of 1.7% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderKinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America, spread over almost 70,000 miles. Notably, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States, rich in natural gas.These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines, for which the company has invested billions of dollars, provide stable fee-based revenues. In fact, Kinder Morgan expects 85% of its cash flow generation to come from fees charged for midstream properties over the coming quarters. The revenues from midstream properties will be reflected in the quarterly results.However, Kinder Morgan’s weak balance sheet is a concern. As of fourth-quarter 2017, total debt — short and long term — is pegged at $34 billion. Debt capitalization ratio of 49.9% is higher than the industry’s ratio of 48.2%, which depicts the company’s significant exposure to debt. The company may face liquidity issues, if its debt continues to increase.Moreover, the company’s Trans Mountain pipeline is plagued by uncertainties. The company has deferred bulk of work on its $5.8 billion Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and is likely to abandon the project if Canada’s provincial and federal governments cannot reach an agreement by May 31. After this announcement, Alberta offered financial assistance. However, nothing is certain. If the pipeline is not constructed, this will be a major drawback for the company and it will adversely impact earnings in the first-quarter.Price Performance in Q1During the quarter, Kinder Morgan has underperformed the industry. In the aforesaid period, the stock has lost 16.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 14.9%. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kinder Morgan will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kinder Morgan carries a Zacks Rank #3.Please note that we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell Rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderThough earnings beat looks uncertain for Kinder Morgan, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model.

653,PXD,"On Apr 6, W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI  -  Free Report) was raised to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?The share price of W&T Offshore has skyrocketed over the past year, rallying 63.9% against the industry’s13.3% decline.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share has been revised upward from 16 cents to 58 cents over the last 60 days. We expect the company to post earnings growth of 3.6% in 2018. W&T Offshore is expected to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 37.9% in 2019, surpassing the S&P 500 index’s 9.4%.In 2017, W&T Offshore generated positive free cashflow of $28 million against negative free cashflow of $33 million in 2016. A partial recovery in crude prices primarily supported the improvement. Hence, the company generated sufficient operating cashflow during 2017 for financing its capital budget.The company’s cash balance surged 41% through 2017 while long-term debt declined 4.3% — marking three consecutive years of decline. This reflects the company’s balance sheet strength.W&T Offshore has a strong earnings surprise history. The firm surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 542.8%. We appreciate the company’s solid cost-control initiatives. In 2017, the company managed to lower total expenses by nearly 50%.The strong focus of the leading upstream energy player on oil-rich prospective resources in the Gulf of Mexico is highly appreciated. W&T Offshore’s operations spread over 710,000 gross acres, which will likely support production growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the energy space are Antero Resources Corp.

654,PXD,"Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) is planning to offload part of its stake in Mexican oilfield to cash in on other opportunities, said Bloomberg.The integrated energy player is reportedly discussing the sale of 20% to 35% stake in the Campeche Bay oil prospect with prospective buyers, including Qatar Petroleum. Eni presently has full ownership in the massive crude discovery and anticipates to produce first oil by early next year.The stake divestment plan is in line with the company’s dual exploration model. The model reflects Eni’s intention to gain liquid assets from a potential prospect much before the field starts production. This will also help the company return cash to shareholders through dividend payments. Over the last four years, the dual exploration model has fetched Eni $9 billion, per Bloomberg.Eni won rights to conduct operations in the two-billion barrels of oil prospect in 2015, when Mexico conducted its second crude auction. The sale of the minority oilfield stake reflects the companies’ participation in active farm out agreement in Mexico. The country has put an end to state monopoly in its upstream operations by opening up the business for other players during 2013.Headquartered in Rome, Italy, Eni has rallied 12.8% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 8% gain.Eni carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The project is expected to come online in 2019.The companies that are planning to bid for the stakes in the wind farm project include Brookfield Asset Management Inc, Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec and Green Investment Group Ltd. of Macquarie Group Ltd.  The divestment can aid the company, which has a significant exposure to debt. During 2017, its long-term debt has risen more than 70% while cash balance declined almost 73%, reflecting weak financials. If divested, the move will be in line with the company's plan to get rid of C$10 billion ($7.8 billion) worth of non-core assets. In 2018 alone, the company wants to sell $2.34 billion (C$3 billion) worth of the non-core properties, as it is trying to reduce its debt burden and streamline portfolio since its Spectra Energy acquisition last year.Price PerformanceEnbridge has lost 25.4% in the last year compared with 19.6% decline of its industry.About Enbridge Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta in Canada, Enbridge is a leading energy infrastructure company.

656,PXD,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) announced a new share repurchase plan after receiving authorization from its board of directors. Through 2018, the explorer will likely buy back shares worth $1 billion.Late 2017, the company declared a $500-million stock buyback plan. The recent announcement reflects the firm’s strong commitment toward returning cash back to stock holders on a regular basis.The business scenario has improved owing to the partial recovery in crude. From the historical low-mark of $26.21 per barrel touched in February 2016, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude crossed the $60 psychological level. A rally in oil price is highly favorable for key upstream energy players like Hess.The company foresees higher oil and gas production which when combined with healthy oil prices will likely boost cashflow. Hess added that with the new buyback program, it will not compromise with its potential to invest in key developments like Guyana and Bakken. Earlier, the company had announced that majority of its 2018 capital budget will likely get allotted toward low-cost resources in Bakken and projects located off the coast of Guyana.Overall, with the robust business outlook, the management might think the company’s shares are undervalued and hence is the right time to boost share buyback.Headquartered in New York, Hess is a leading explorer with a solid balance sheet. Through 2017, the company’s cash balance surged 77.4%, while long term debt contracted 4.4%.However, the company’s pricing chart is unimpressive. Over the past year, the stock has lost 3.5%, against the industry’s 4.3% gain. Hess carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

658,PXD,"YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF  -  Free Report), an Argentine state-run energy company foresees its shale production to rise 35% this year as the cost of production in the Vaca Muerta shale play continues to fall, where the company recently completed drilling its first 3,200 meters long lateral well.Following the last year's decline of 5.3% output from mature fields in the Vaca Muerta shale, production there is expected to fall 2-3% more in 2018. The company’s total production in the year declined from 577.4 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Kboed) in 2016 to 555 Kboed in 2017.To counter the situation, YPF wants to drill 100 new wells in 12 distinct regions of Vaca Muerta shale play this year. The company expects the increase in production from the shale play to more than offset the declining output from the matured fields in 2018.The production ramp up will be supported by declined drilling costs for horizontal wells in the region. The cost was $3,050 per lateral foot in 2015 and $2,270 in 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the cost fell more amounting to $1,390 per lateral foot. It is also expected to reduce the company’s overall cost, which increased 19.5% in 2017 year over year.Notably, the company has a total acreage of around 5.5 million acres in the prolific shale. In 2018, the company is expected to launch five pilot projects in the shale, one of which will be aided by Statoil ASA , the Norwegian oil giant. The rise in production and declining costs are expected to push the company’s revenues for the year 2018.

659,PXD,"Noble Energy (NBL  -  Free Report) has returned 24.8%, outperforming the industry's rally of 15.4% in the last six months. Capital investment, solid production from Noble Energy’s organic and inorganic assets, cost reduction and higher demand from both international and domestic assets, are driving results.Nearly 70% of its planned capital expenditure for 2018 was directed toward the development of U.S onshore assets. The higher number of wells brought online in the DJ Basin, Eagle Ford and Delaware area will increase production volumes, and U.S. onshore production is expected to contribute in excess of 71% of total production.

661,PXD,"President Trump’s plan to slap hefty tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum compelled top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, to depart from the White House. After all, Cohn was the last man standing in the way of such a protectionist stance. With the stepping down of Cohn, the odds of the imposition of tariffs are higher. Now, it will be easier for the White House to take tougher action against China and this might also lead to collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).Naturally, market pundits are panicking over the retaliatory tariffs that may harm the global economic growth. The European Union (EU) has already chalked out a plan to impose penalties on iconic U.S. brands, while the World Trade Organization (WTO) warned Trump that his proposed tariffs will trigger tit-for-tat protectionist measures.With growing fears of a trade war, the broader market continues to move in and out of the negative territory. Despite such turbulence, not all stocks should be treated equally as a few are protected against the impact of a trade war. These stocks are sound enough to dismiss tariff fears and keep scaling higher.Before we look into such stocks, let’s understand why Cohn’s resignation will spark a global trade war.Cohn: Advocate of Free TradeMost recently, Trump shocked the global market by announcing high tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The President plans to impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% on aluminum.Cohn had opposed the high tariff proposal and called for a moderate approach toward protectionist trade policies. He was aware that such protectionist trade policies will lead to retaliation, crippling the  economy engaged in such trade wars. Such trade policies affect several industries, causing the unemployment rate to rise and bumping up the price of essential commodities.But Gary’s departure removed a restraining influence in the White House. His departure leaves the trade policy mostly in the hands of hawkish figures like Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and economic adviser Peter Navarro. They have expressed their views on using tariffs on countries that have unfairly taken advantage of the United States.Needless to say, Trump’s announcement on a pair of tariffs drew protests from major trading partners like the EU and Canada, both of which threatened to adopt retaliatory measures. The EU confirmed that they will slap tariffs on some well-known American brands, including Harley Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and bourbon whiskey.Trade War Heats Up! Buy These 4 StocksCohn’s sudden exit rattled the stock market, stoking fears that the United States could fight a trade war. Thus, we have selected four stocks that are immune to tariff fears and will keep moving north. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

In this regard, Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) is a solid choice since it is a global digital advertising and distribution platform. Facebook controls about 20% of the U.S. digital ad market.Facebook has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings moved up 9.8% in the last 60 days. The stock’s projected earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year are 13.8% and 16.7%, respectively. The company has outperformed the broader industry in the past year (+32.9% vs +20.5%).Axon Enterprise — Mostly Sells to Government AgenciesAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report) that operates through two segments, TASER Weapons and Axon, continues to be attractive amid trade war anxieties. And why not? The company sells an array of digital solutions to government agencies that makes them recession proof. No matter what happens with tariffs, government agencies will upgrade their institutions.Axon Enterprise has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings surged 57.1% in the last 60 days. The stock’s projected earnings growth rate for the next quarter is a whopping 100%. The company has outperformed the broader industry in the last one-year period (+76.8% vs -23.8%).Boeing — Increase in Cost of Aluminum InsignificantInvestors may be fretting that tariffs on aluminum will increase its cost, a key component in plane construction. This in turn might hamper the world’s largest aerospace company, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report). But, Boeing has just a trade war exposure of 35.2%, per Fundstrat. Even if the costs rise, it will be passed on and ultimately borne by consumers.Right now, Boeing has a Zacks Rank #1.

662,PXD,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) has outlined its growth strategy, which intends to more than double earnings and cash flow from operations by 2025 based on current oil prices.Per the growth plans, the company expects earnings of $31 billion by 2025, up more than 100% from last year’s adjusted profit of $15 billion. The figure does not include the impact of U.S. tax reform and impairments.ExxonMobil has set capital spending at $24 billion for 2018, $28 billion for 2019 and $30 billion from 2023 to 2025, to meet its target to achieve high growth. However, its peers including Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) are cutting down on spending and keeping budgets unchanged.Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, also emphasized that the plan estimates double-digit rates of return in all three segments of ExxonMobil’s business — upstream, downstream and chemical.Upstream Growth Drivers: Guyana and the PermianExxonMobil expects to enhance earnings in the upstream sector by initiating various growth programs, including low-cost-of-supply investments in U.S. tight oil, deepwater and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Moreover, ramp up of existing projects and commissioning of around 25 new projects are likely to boost yield to about 5 million oil-equivalent barrels per day (MMBOE/D), up from 4 MMBOE/D. The company proposes to boost tight-oil production by five times from the U.S. Permian Basin. It also intends to increase LNG production to meet the growing demand worldwide.ExxonMobil’s exploration successes and strategic acquisitions will benefit upstream growth. The testimony to this is the addition of 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base in locations including the Permian, Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil, in 2017.Guyana and the Permian are key drivers of growth in ExxonMobil’s portfolio. In Guyana, the company has added 3.2 billion gross oil equivalent barrels of recoverable resource and plans development and exploration. In the Permian, the company expanded resource base to 9.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels from less than 3 billion in 2016. This was possible mainly because of acquisition of several entities in 2017 along with application of its expertise in technical evaluation and successful delineation. ExxonMobil managed to lower the acquisition cost to just above $1 per oil-equivalent barrel.The New Mexico acquisition is estimated to hold over 4,800 drilling locations with an average lateral length of more than 12,000 feet. This will facilitate efficiency in execution of Permian volumes growth and enhance growth.Downstream Growth Backed by Investing in RefineriesThe earnings of downstream business of ExxonMobil are expected to increase two fold by 2025. The growth will come through strategic investments that will include upgradation at refineries in Baytown and Beaumont in Texas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Singapore, and Fawley in the U.K. The investments will boost yield of higher-value products — ultra-low sulfur diesel, chemicals feedstocks and basestocks for lubricants. These initiatives will lead the downstream margins to increase 20% through 2025.The projected demand growth in the emerging markets will support the expansion. ExxonMobil is also venturing into new markets such as Mexico and Indonesia. Moreover, integration with chemical manufacturing and upstream production also support growth.Chemical Segment to Increase Presence in America & Asia PacificIn its chemical business, ExxonMobil is likely to increase manufacturing capacity in North America and Asia Pacific by about 40%. The probable growth can be attributed to the addition of 13 new facilities, comprising two world-class steam crackers in the United States. These investments will facilitate the company to meet rising demand in Asia and other emerging markets.ConclusionOverall, ExxonMobil’s growth strategy aims to fully leverage competitive advantages to boost shareholder value in three of its world-class businesses. The increased investments are expected to enhance and boost returns on capital employed to about 15% by 2025.However, many analysts view the long-term goals of ExxonMobil as complex, thanks to the uncertainty in the oil and gas industry over the last few years. Shares of the company dropped 2.5% after the company announced that spending will not enhance near-term production.Price PerformanceDuring the last three months, ExxonMobil’s shares have lost 10.1% compared with the industry’s 0.8% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report).

668,PXD,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Synthetic Genomics Inc. have initiated a new phase in their joint algae biofuel research program. Through the study, the company intends 10,000 barrels of algae biofuel per day by 2025.ExxonMobil’s assumption is based on the research carried out till date and emerging technical capability. To progress toward large-scale production, extra work is required. As the study advances, the companies continue to perform basic research on algae biology in their laboratories.The scope of the new phase comprises an outdoor field study that will raise naturally occurring algae in numerous contained ponds in California. Better understanding of the fundamental engineering parameters including viscosity and flow will be facilitated from the research. These parameters are difficult to imitate in a lab. The potential commercial deployment of this technology largely depends on the outcome of this research.Subsequent to the companies’ years of fundamental biological research into accepting and enhancing algae oil production, outdoor research will follow.ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics have been researching jointly since 2009 to develop oil from algae that could be substituted as a renewable, lower-emission fuel to traditional transportation ones.ExxonMobil also partnered with universities, government laboratories and other companies to perform a wide range of research on advanced biofuels.In 2017, ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics got a breakthrough research published in Nature Biotechnology that lead to a modified algae strain which more than doubled oil content without considerably restraining growth, a key challenge along the path to commercial scalability.Transportation-related global energy demand is estimated to grow about 25% through 2040. Thereby, a cut in emissions from the transportation sector will play a significant role in reducing global greenhouse gas release.Additionally, other researches by ExxonMobil include emission-reducing technologies, including carbon capture and sequestration.

673,PXD,"YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF  -  Free Report) of Argentina along with ENAP of Chile recently announced their intention of increasing the production of natural gas, offshore South America. The project is worth $354 million. ENAP is the operator of the Incremental Project Magallanes Area (PIAM), which will ramp up gas production from the existing 2.4 million cubic meters per day to 4 million cubic meters. The project will also boost petroleum production by around 25%. The state-run energy companies engaged five oil platforms in the project, which are located in Argentina’s Santa Cruz province near the Strait of Magellan.The investment plan was carried out for one and a half years, the peak which created more than 1,000 jobs. Laying new pipelines and modifications of the existing infrastructure were part of the investment plan. To treat the additional natural gas, a new plant with compressors of 9,000 horse power was built by the partnership.The project is expected to directly address the Argentine demand for gas that increased rapidly since 2014. The production shortage of natural gas started increasing in the country before 2010, forcing more imports from neighbor countries like Bolivia. The project, thus, is in line with President Mauricio Macri’s plan to eliminate dependency on gas imports by 2020-21, which primarily banks on the country’s Vaca Muerta shale.Price PerformanceYPF has lost 15.3% in the past year against 8% growth of its industry. About the CompanyYPF is an international energy company based on the integrated business of hydrocarbons, focalized in Latin America, with high standards of efficiency, profitability and responsibility.

674,PXD,"Buckeye Partners, L.P. (BPL  -  Free Report) announced a plan to further expand storage capacity at its Chicago Complex by 600,000 barrels, through investment of $80 million. The expansion of the storage capacity is backed by a long-term agreement with BP plc’s (BP  -  Free Report) unit, BP Products North America, Inc.Increasing liquid production in the United States and fluctuating liquid prices call for higher storage requirement. Buckeye Partners’ expansion of storage capacity will support the growing needs of its customers.How the New Expansion Will Help?Buckeye Partners’ Chicago Complex currently serves nearly 70 different customers with approximately 6.8 million barrels of storage capacity.This new expansion will further increase the importance of the Chicago Complex and strengthen its position as the premier storage and trading facility in the Chicago area. Given the increasing production in the region, the partnership might need to expand its storage facility again in the complex in the near future.Increasing Oil ProductionPer a recent release from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), annual average crude oil production in the United States touched 9.3 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2017, improving 5% from 2016 levels.The report also indicates that crude oil production will continue to improve and is expected to average between 10.7 million b/d and 11.3 million b/d in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The rising production level will call for further expansion of the storage capacity and boost revenues of the midstream operators.Price MovementIn a year’s time, units of Buckeye Partners have lost higher than its industry.

675,PXD,"Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (CRZO  -  Free Report) has been grappling with low liquidity and high leverage issues. Over the past year, shares of Carrizo have plunged 39%, underperforming the broader industry’s decline of 12.7%.Despite weak financials, the company has plans to incur capital expenditure of around $700-$800 million in 2018, owing to a double-digit rise in the oilfield services cost. Notably, the projected capex is higher than $695.7 million spent in 2017. Further, the production outlook of the company also doesn’t look very promising. Carrizo expects first-quarter 2018 production to lie between 48,600 and 49,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d), lower than the prior-quarter’s output of 62,417 Boe/d.Driven by the concerns, private-equity firm Kimmeridge Energy Management Company has recently boosted its stake in Carrizo to put pressure on the company, for pursuing asset sales and other strategic initiatives to buoy its staggering financials and share price.Activist Investor Kimmeridge increased its stake in Carrizo to 8.1%, reflecting a 65% jump from the previously held 4.9%. Post the development, shares of Carrizo have moved up 11.5% to eventually close at $17.15 on Apr, 5.Carrizo is burdened with a heavy debt pile of around $1.63 billion, which is even higher than the company’s market capitalization. Notably, the company’s debt levels witnessed a year-over-year increase of 22.5% in 2017. Carrizo currently carries a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 81.5% that limits its growth and restricts financial flexibility. The low liquidity of the company, which stands at 0.33, also raises concern over its asset-management practices, considering it as a small-cap company.Kimmeridge wants the company to divest its assets in the Eagle Ford Shale to delever its balance sheet. The private equity company either wants Carrizo to exit entirely from its Eagle Ford Holdings for debt reduction or if not all, then part of its holdings to use the proceeds for share buyback purposes.   Notably, the company closed the divestment of its non-core Eagle Ford assets in February for $245 million. In fact, over the past few quarters, the company has been concentrating to streamline its portfolio, and made various non-core divestitures in Marcellus, Utica, Appalachia and DJ Basin.However, Carrizo still owns around 78,500 acres in the Eagle Ford Play, which the activist investor does not view as a promising region owing to operational issues and estimated production decline from these holdings. As such, it wants the company to divest its remaining Eagle Ford properties to shore up the financials, and in the process, become a Pure-Permian play that offers more lucrative prospects.Importantly, last year Carrizo acquired Delaware Basin assets for $648 million to increase its core position in one of the highest-return plays in North America. The company currently owns 43,600 net acres in the Delaware Basin, which is part of the Permian Basin. Oil production in the Permian region has been witnessing significant growth, with current capacity of churning around 3 million barrels per day (Bpd), which is expected to rise by another 2 million Bpd within 2025. Kimmeridge appreciates the attractive economics of the Permian region, owing to the low cost-high margin operational structure, and hence wants the company to become a Permian pure play that will help it to drive its production.However, of late, with many oil producers entering the Permian and surging production, a lack of pipeline takeaway capacity has pushed crude prices in the region to trade at a discount to the U.S. benchmark.Thus, Kimmeridge believes that merger with some other Permian-focused rival will turn out to be a prudent strategy for Carrizo, owing to its small scale and weak financials. A merger will bolster its scale and position in the Permian, along with enhancing buying power in securing services in the region. The financial, operation and commercial synergies from a strategic acquisition will also position the company better.  While Kimmeridge is putting pressure on Carrizo to make some serious strategic changes for boosting its value, whether the upstream player will give in to the activist investors’ demands or not is a wait and watch story.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCarrizo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked players in the energy space include Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Continental Resources, Inc (CLR  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The second consortium comprises Spain’s Repsol and Hellenic Petroleum. The first consortium submitted a bid to jointly explore off Crete, while the other consortium intends to commence exploration in a block in the Ionian Sea.The tenders were launched in 2017 after expressions of interest were received from the ExxonMobil-led consortium for the two sites off Crete and from Greece's Energean for the Ionian block. However, Energean has backed out since then.Subject to final approval by the Energy Ministry, Hellenic Hydrocarbons Resources Management (HHRM) will immediately appraise the offers.

Credit rating agencies Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) & Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) rated the company’s debt as BBB+ and Baa3 — among the lower investment grade ratings. Any downgrade by the rating agencies will make the company’s bond non investment grade. Hence, it is a serious matter of concern as Enbridge will not be able to raise debt capital in favorable terms for financing growth projects if there is a downgrade in credit ratings.In the last few years, the company's debt increased strongly. Importantly, during the first nine months of 2017, long-term debt has risen more than 75% while cash balance declined 59%, reflecting weak financials. It has a long-term debt of C$61.4 billion and debt to capitalization ratio of 50.1%.The company expects the divestment program to strengthen its balance sheet by fast debt reduction. The sale is also expected to increase its free cash flow and support its dividend hike program. Notably, the company has increased its annual dividend payout for more than 10 years.Price PerformanceEnbridge has lost 18.2% in the last year compared with 9.7% decline of its industry.About Enbridge Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta in Canada, Enbridge is a leading energy infrastructure company. One of its businesses is the transportation of energy through the most extensive and advanced crude and liquids pipeline system that spreads globally.

691,PXD,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its 50% stake in the Scarborough gas field offshore Western Australia to Woodside Petroleum Ltd for $744 million. The gas field is located in the Carnarvon Basin.Divestment RationaleThe divestment can shrink ExxonMobil's risky asset portfolio and give an opportunity to focus on comparatively cheaper offshore liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) prospects in Papua New Guinea, Mozambique and others.Moreover, the company was of the opinion that the economic development of the gas field involved a few challenges like water depth, resource characteristics and execution complexities. With production unlikely to start before 2025, short-run payoff from the field is not available.Additionally, offshore drilling is excessively expensive that might dent the company’s cash flow. The Scarborough project’s overall estimated cost was $9.7 billion. ExxonMobil’s move is likely to enable the company to improve its cash flow situation.About the CompanyIrving, TX-based ExxonMobil is the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas firm. The company has a leading position in the energy industry owing to the size and diversity of its asset base, both in terms of business mix and geographical footprint. It has three operating segments: Upstream, Downstream and Chemical.Following the shale revolution, the area along the Gulf Coast boasts plentiful supply of oil and gas. ExxonMobil is expected to capitalize on the availability of cheap natural gas to manufacture chemicals as well as energy efficient plastics for export. In other words, the company will cater to growing demand for chemicals and refined fuels, by taking advantage of the shale revolution. Hence, the company is expected to generate significant cash flows from its downstream operations in the long run.ExxonMobil has lost 7.9% of its value in the last year, against 5% rise witnessed by the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Suncor Energy Inc.

692,PXD,"It was a week where oil prices settled under $60 a barrel for the first time this year and natural gas logged its lowest closing since February 2017.On the news front, energy biggies TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher oil prices. Moreover, all the companies awarded shareholders with dividend increases.Overall, it was another dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 9.6% to close at $59.20 per barrel, while natural gas prices dived 9.2% to $2.584 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon & Chevron's Q4 Earnings Miss, Shell Reports Strong Numbers)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its third decrease in four weeks. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As per EIA’s latest data, U.S. output rose by 332,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.2 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 and the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing for a third straight week – this time by 26, the most in more than a year – brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas had a forgettable week of its own following a smaller-than-average decrease in supplies. The 119 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was less than last year’s drop of 142 Bcf and the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 151 Bcf for the reported week. Investors were also spooked by forecasts of warmer weather, leading to the heating fuel’s tepid demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    France-based supermajor TOTAL S.A. reported fourth-quarter 2017 operating earnings of $1.10 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 by 3.8%. The outperformance was due to solid operational performance, steadily decreasing production costs, improvement in the realized prices of commodities and new projects ramp ups, which boosted production.Operating income was $3,359 million, up 26% from the year-ago period. Higher contribution from Exploration & Production and Gas, Renewable & Power segments boosted operating income. Adjusted net income in the reported quarter was $2,872 million, up 19% from the year-ago quarter. The cost-reduction initiatives have resulted in cost savings of $3.7 billion in 2017.Cash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2017 were $33.18 billion compared with $24.59 billion as of Dec 31, 2016. Net debt-to-equity ratio was 13.8% at the end of the quarter, down from 27.1% at the end of fourth-quarter 2016. Coupled with strong cash flows, TOTAL has decided to lift its dividend by 10% over the next three years, while planning to repurchase about $5 billion in shares.TOTAL’s upstream production is expected to increase 6% in 2018, in sync with its objective to grow 5% per year on average between 2016 and 2020. The company continues to work on its cost-management initiatives and expects to generate cost savings of $4 billion in 2018. Organic capital expenditure is expected to be $14 billion in 2018.

693,PXD,"Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) recently announced two acquisitions: one at Syncrude oil sands project and the other at Fenja Development, an offshore project.Syncrude DealSuncor has agreed to buy 5% interest in the Syncrude project from its partner Mocal Energy and increase its share in the joint venture. Per Suncor, the deal, which is valued at $730 million, is expected to close by March. The effective date of the transaction is Jan 1, 2018. The deal increases Suncor's interest in the project to 58.74%. We note that Suncor’s share of production from the Syncrude operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 174,400 barrels per day (Bbl/d) compared with 187,000 Bbl/d in the year-ago quarter.Deal RationaleThe transaction is expected to add a capacity of 17,500 barrels a day of light sweet synthetic crude to the company's portfolio. The move is in line with the company's strategy to invest in projects that would help grow shareholder value in the coming years, apart from a vote of confidence in the long-term future of oil sands.In a similar move, Suncor increased 2.26% working interest in the Fort Hills project, which it bought from Total S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) last month.Fenja DevelopmentLocated in the Norwegian Sea, the Fenja field is supposed to start production in 2021. Suncor Energy Norge AS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Suncor, acquired 17.5% interest in the Fenja Development from Faroe Petroleum. The deal — valued at $54.5 million — is anticipated to be over by the second quarter of this year.Suncor has VNG Norge, Point Resources and Faroe Petroleum as partners in the project with 30%, 45% and 7.5% interests, respectively. Suncor is expected to invest C$280 million as its share of go-forward capital in the project.Deal RationaleThe transaction is expected to add a lesser risked asset to Suncor's offshore portfolio. The move is anticipated to assure profitable growth for the company in the long term. Price PerformanceSuncor has gained 4.6% in the last year against 12.6% decline of its industry. About Suncor Energy Calgary, Alberta-based Suncor Energy is Canada’s premier integrated energy company. Suncor's operations include oil sands development and upgrade, conventional and offshore crude oil and gas production, petroleum refining, and product marketing under the Petro-Canada brand. It is one of the largest owners of oil sands in the world. The company has gained new oil sands properties to supplement its existing operations in northern Alberta, making it the dominant producer in the region where reserves are second only to Saudi Arabia. Suncor’s business can be divided into three main segments: Oil Sands, Exploration and Production, and Refining and Marketing.Through its aggressive expense management, Suncor has been able to lower its cash costs amid the industry downturn. This has helped the company take advantage of the rebound in oil prices. Moreover, Suncor's healthy financial profile allows it to pay an attractive dividend while pursuing an aggressive share repurchase program. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSuncor Energy has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

694,PXD,"Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) recently announced that the company has agreed to sell liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") to China National Petroleum Corporation (“CNPC”) through two sale and purchase agreements. The deal marks China's first ever long-term contract targeted to import U.S. LNG. Following the news of the deal, Cheniere Energy stock jumped 4.6% last Friday.Cheniere Energy and CNPC signed a memorandum of understanding during President Trump’s visit to China last November, which resulted in this deal.Deal DetailsPer the deal, Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC and Cheniere Marketing International LLP, two of Cheniere Energy’s units will sell around 1.2 million tons of LNG per year to PetroChina International Company Limited, which is wholly owned by PetroChina Company Limited (PTR  -  Free Report).  State-run CNPC is the owner of PetroChina Company. The deal requires Cheniere Energy to start part of the supply this year while the rest is slated for 2023. Both parts of the deal are expected to continue through 2043. Cheniere Energy and CNPC have agreed keep LNG price indexed to the Henry Hub price. The LNG price will also assume a fixed component.Deal RationaleThis long-term deal is crucial for the natural gas exporter and is expected to help Cheniere Energy with its development plans. The company is still at the expansion stage, which means high capital spending and cash outflow in the foreseeable future. Cheniere Energy expects the deal to support its Corpus Christi Train 3 development in Texas, which saddled the company with a substantial leverage and credit burden. The company has a long-term debt to capital ratio of 95.8%, much higher than the industry's 49.3%.Moreover, the deal enables Cheniere Energy to meet the rising demand for LNG in China and strengthens its hold in Asia. Per China's pollution control measures, the use of coal for heating purposes is expected to go down. It will give a boost to LNG demand in the country in the coming years. By 2030, China is believed to become the largest LNG importer.Price PerformanceCheniere Energy has gained 15.5% in the last year versus the 22.9% fall of its industry.About Cheniere EnergyHouston, TX-based Cheniere Energy - founded in 1983 - is primarily engaged in businesses related to liquefied natural gas through its two business segments: LNG terminal, and LNG and natural gas marketing. The company boasts of low-cost gas resources.Being the first company to receive Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal in Cameron Parish, LA, Cheniere Energy enjoys a distinct competitive advantage over other players to ship overseas. However, exporting natural gas – by setting up large liquefication plants – is a very capital-intensive undertaking, with each unit running up multi-billion dollar bills. This has translated into a huge debt load for Cheniere Energy - currently nearly $25 billion.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCheniere Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report)and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report).  Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

695,PXD,"Liquidity indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash and equivalents. Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as these are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks. While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through).

In fact, following the merger, Enbridge lost 28.2%, reflecting investors’ apprehensions over the outcome of the acquisition.Reportedly, Enbridge will take assistance from Royal Bank of Canada for the deal. However, neither Enbridge nor Royal Bank of Canada made any comments on the deal.Last November, Enbridge — belonging to the Zacks Oil & Gas Pipeline industry — announced the identification of several non-core properties worth as much as C$10 billion, of which roughly C$3 billion will likely be divested through 2018. Enbridge is anticipated to focus on growth projects and strengthen its balance sheet with the proceeds from the sale.Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, Enbridge’s overall operational results were not impressive last year. Through 2017, the company generated $5.1 billion in operating cashflow, which was not sufficient to meet capital spending, resulting in negative free cashflow of $829 million.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

698,PXD,"Royal Dutch Shell plc ((RDS.A  -  Free Report) is set to offload its 90% stake in the Gaza Marine gas project to Palestine Investment Fund, moving forward with its $30-billion divestment goal. The financial details of the transaction have been kept under wraps.The Anglo-Dutch giant had gained ownership of the Gaza Marine tract, located offshore Palestine, via its BG Group buyout. The field was discovered by the BG Group in 2000 but did not progress to the development stage amid political and commercial concerns. Palestine Investment Fund is seeking a capable international partner to hand over 45% of the project’s stake along with designing a field development plan with the operator. Gaza Marine's development will aid in meeting the demand for gas-fired power plants in Palestine and further help it to become an energy exporter.The move will help Shell proceed with its divestment program. The deal provides the company with a major uplift in its drive to decrease debt following the acquisition of BG Group for $47 billion. The divestment is expected to reduce the company’s cost, and enhance cash flow as well as return to capital. The move will also help the company to upgrade and streamline its portfolio.With Shell already wrapping up divestment deals worth more than $23 billion, it remains focused to meet its target by 2018. Further, the company announced asset disposals amounting to around $2 billion, and talks for prospective transactions of additional $5 billion divestment deals are already in advanced stages.Headquartered in Netherlands, Shell is one of the largest integrated energy companies engaged in the production, refining, distribution and marketing of oil and natural gas.

699,PXD,"Sunoco LP (SUN  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal with Superior Plus Corporation to acquire its wholesale fuel business and storage assets, in a bid to further bolster its fuel distribution segment.The assets to be sold to Sunoco will include wholesale refined fuels operations across five states in the northeast United States along with three pipeline connected terminals in New York. The wholesale business comprises around hundreds of dealers and commercial contracts, with an annual sale of nearly 200 million gallons of fuel. The three terminals include 17 tanks with a storage capacity of 429,000 barrels.The deal is valued at approximately $40 million. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the deal is set for completion by this month.The announcement of this acquisition deal comes a day after the partnership effectively completed the conversion of its 207 retail sites across West Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico markets to a single commission agent. Per the commission agent model, Sunoco will own and price the fuel at the sites, paying the agent a fixed commission per gallon of fuel sold. Meanwhile, the master limited partnership will receive fees and rental income from the commission agent, who will be responsible for conducting operations in the sites.Prior to this in January 2018, Sunoco had closed its $3.2 billion divestment deal with 7-Eleven Inc., aiming to exit from retail operations and strengthen its focus in the core fuel distribution and logistics segments.   Thus, with the successful completion of its divestment deal with 7-Eleven and conversion of its remaining retail business to a commission agent model, the partnership has made a strategic change in its business model that has helped it in strengthening its financial position. The strategic initiatives have helped the partnership to reduce its debt metrics and become better positioned to tap on attractive acquisition opportunities in the near term.The recent acquisition deal is likely to be immediately accretive to Sunoco’s distributable cash flows, and bring about increased synergies and scale.The partnership remains focused on more such lucrative acquisition opportunities for the growth of its wholesale fuel distribution business, which will enable it to have an edge over other regional wholesalers and distributors.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSunoco carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Over the past six months, shares of Sunoco have declined more than 18%, wider than its industry’s loss of 12.65%.With the Oil and Gas Refining & Marketing Industry ranked at the bottom 5% (252 out of 265), it does not come as a surprise that none of the companies from this industry is set to outperform in the near term, according to the Zacks Model. Meanwhile, one can consider a few better-ranked players in the broader energy space like Concho Resources Inc.

701,PXD,"Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report) issued 2017 highlights and 2018 guidance based on a NYMEX gas price of $2.85.Amid commodity price volatility, the company was able to achieve targets cited in 2017 guidance. Southwestern Energy made investments through net cash flow, which included $200 million from the 2016 equity offering. In 2017, total net production was 897 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), of which 89% was natural gas and 11% was NGLs and condensates. Of the total production, 578 Bcfe came from the Appalachian Basin and 316 Bcf from the Fayetteville Shale. Gross operated exit rate production of 2.35 Bcfe per day from the Appalachian Basin was up 40% from December 2016 levels.Preliminary total proved reserves was about 14.8 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), including 11.1 Tcfe from the Appalachian Basin, up 181% and 393%, respectively, compared with 2016 figures. At end-2017, total proved reserves comprised 75% natural gas and 25% NGLs and condensate compared with 93% and 7% in 2016, respectively. Proved undeveloped at year-end 2017 was 46%.For 2018, the company intends to invest $1.15-$1.25 billion and fund it entirely through net cash flow.

702,PXD,"Italian oil giant Eni S.p.A. (E  -  Free Report) recently reported the discovery of a potential natural gas field at the Calypso prospect, located in Block 6 offshore Cyprus. The company has partnered with France's Total S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) for the development of the field. With both the companies having 50% stake, Eni is the operator in the field. The government officials of Cyprus believe this is the second significant discovery in the Cypriot exclusive economic zone, since the discovery of around 5 trillion cubic feet in 2011. The company drilled a well, Calypso 1 NFW, in 2,074 meters of water depth. The rocks in the well are from the Miocene and Cretaceous age. Per Eni, the geology of the new finding is similar to its Zohr prospect in offshore Egypt, whose reserves were estimated at more than 30 trillion cubic feet by the company. Eni commenced natural gas production in the field in December 2017. The newfound prospect is 80 kilometers away from the Zohr field.Although the company is yet to announce the gas volume of the Calypso prospect - which requires further analysis to determine options – an Israel-based news website, Globes reported that the new prospect might hold 170-230 billion cubic meters of natural gas.Notably, the new finding poses a risk of geopolitical rivalry between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, where the latter is internationally recognized and has its neighbors' support.Price PerformanceEni has gained 8.2% in the last year compared with 6.2% growth of its industry.About Eni Based in Rome, Italy, Eni is an integrated energy player. The company has operations in 73 countries. The company explores for oil and gas and trades oil, gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and electricity. The company was founded in 1953.We believe that Eni’s constant efforts to expand its upstream operations in Cyprus, Egypt, Vietnam, Indonesia, Pakistan and Kenya will go a long way in generating profitable growth in the future.

704,PXD,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently announced that its oil and gas reserves grew 19% in 2017 owing to growth in several places like the U.S. shale, the United Arab Emirates and Guyana. ExxonMobil reported its reserve update following its fourth-quarter earnings, which failed to meet expectations. In 2017, the company added 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) to its reserves, which marks 183% production replacement. It brings the company's total proved reserves to 21.2 billion BOE. ExxonMobil believes that the proved reserves hold significant development opportunities, which can grow shareholder value in the coming years. Of the total proved reserves, 57% was liquids, which increased by 4% from 53% in 2016. At the current production rate of the company, its reserves are expected to last for 14 years. The company, with higher profitability ratios and lower leverage than the industry, is poised to yield higher values in the long run. ExxonMobil spent more than $6 billion in 2017 to increase its presence in the Permian Basin. The company added more than 800 million BOE to its reserves in the basin. The Upper Zakum field in the United Arab Emirates contributed another 800 million BOE. The company's Guyana assets provided proved reserves of 3.2 billion BOE, where it is partnering with Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) and others.We note that ExxonMobil had reduced its proved reserves in 2016 by 3.3 billion BOE, most of which was due to the writedowns of the Canadian oil sands assets' value in the low crude-price environment. The current rebound in oil prices has made some of those devalued assets profitable for the company. It provided ExxonMobil 900 million BOE of proved reserves. The company's press release stated, ""ExxonMobil’s resource base totaled approximately 97 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2017, taking into account field revisions, production and asset sales.""About the CompanyIrving, TX-based ExxonMobil is the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas firm.

706,PXD,"Building on the sector's second annual gain in a row, energy stocks have witnessed a solid start to 2018 and look poised to continue climbing in the coming months.Just a few months ago, or until September last year, the commodity had a very difficult year. In June 2017, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell to nearly $42 a barrel - the lowest in ten months. Since then, the contract has risen more than 50%. In fact, WTI hit a more than three-year high of around $66 recently.Unlike other short-lived rallies over the past three years, we believe the current higher oil prices are a result of improving fundamentals. Declining inventories and the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 are the two major factors helping to balance the market and support the strong uptrend.Production Cut Deal ExtensionOne of the significant reasons why the U.S. oil benchmark soared, revolves around the expansion of the output-cut deal between OPEC and other major producers beyond March. True to predictions, the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018.The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut. While there are several question marks over the degree to which the cartel members are adhering to their quotas, there's no ignoring the fact that the cuts continue to narrow the market imbalances.Sharp Inventory DrawdownsInvestors have pinned hopes of recovery over the U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles – pointing to a slowdown in shale output. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015.Investors Bet on a Sustained Rise in the Price of WTI crudeCurrently at around $63 a barrel, the price of oil has more than doubled from the multi-year lows of early last year and it’s a whole new ballgame for investors who are now the most optimistic on the commodity than at any time in the past three years. They believe that the OPEC and Russian agreement will help whittle down huge global stockpiles and lead to even higher prices in the near-term.Strong Oil Market Supported by a Robust U.S. Macro EconomyNotwithstanding recent hiccups, U.S. stock markets have hitting all-time highs on a regular basis. Stocks have mostly rallied since last year’s election, with a booming U.S. economy, supportive monetary policy and robust corporate earnings being the key triggers. Expectations that the Trump administration’s proposed tax and regulatory reforms will help companies’ and consumers, have given investors further reasons to put their money in stocks.Improving Cash Flows Prompt Oil Companies to Reward ShareholdersAs low oil prices over the past three years weighed on the energy companies' top and bottom lines, the industry was forced to chalk out new strategies and resort to dividend cuts and cost-reduction initiatives to shore up cash flows. The downturn not only impacted the smaller and the more-leveraged companies, it also affected the fairly larger companies (generally considered safe haven investments). They were forced to cut or suspend cash dividend and share buyback programs.Thanks to rebounding oil prices and strategic initiatives, most of the energy firms have finally managed to successfully come out of the slump. A stable floor under crude price, together with lower operating expenses not only helped boost profits but also encouraged a number of companies to raise dividend payouts.How to Pick the Right Stocks?With a host of oil producers raising payout of late, It is no easy task to select outperformers. Therefore, we are using the Zacks Rank to zero in on companies with strong fundamentals.To guide investors to the right picks, we highlight four energy stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

709,PXD,"Canadian energy giant Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 operating earnings per share of 63 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. Strong refined product sales, reduced total expenses and higher crude price realizations drove the company’s earnings. In the year-ago quarter, the company posted earnings of 29 cents a share. Quarterly operating earnings came in at C$1,310 million compared with C$636 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting an increase of 106%. Meanwhile, quarterly revenues of C$3,941 million increased from C$3,352 million in the year-ago quarter.Suncor Energy Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Suncor Energy Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Suncor Energy Inc. QuoteProductionTotal upstream production in the reported quarter was 736,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), which decreased marginally from the prior-year level of 738,500 BOE/d. The decline in production was due to a drop in output from the Syncrude operations and the Exploration and Production segment.Oil Sands operations volume was 446,800 barrels per day (Bbl/d) compared with 433,400 Bbl/d in the year-ago quarter. The increase can be attributed to improved mining and extraction reliability and record Firebag production, partially offset by the lower production at MacKay River.Production from Syncrude operations was 174,400 Bbl/d compared with 187,000 Bbl/d in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was due to the lower upgrader reliability. In the quarter under review, the Syncrude upgrader reliability was 94% lower than year-ago quarter’s 102%.Suncor’s Exploration and Production segment (consisting of International and Offshore and Natural Gas segments) produced 115,200 BOE/d compared with 118,100 BOE/d in the prior-year quarter. Lower offshore production drove the company’s results, partially offset by the increased output in Libya.Notably, Suncor’s newly commissioned Hebron asset started production in this quarter, ahead of its schedule.Also, refinery utilization came in at 94% compared with 93% in the year-ago quarter.Product SalesThe company’s refined product sales of 526,800 Bbl/d increased from the prior-year quarter level of 514,800 Bbl/d owing to strong reliability at most of Suncor’s refineries. It was partially offset by the impact of Montreal refinery’s third-party power outage.ExpensesTotal expenses in the reported quarter declined to C$7,156 million from C$7,415 million in the year-ago quarter. The company’s financing expenses decreased C$225 million compared with C$532 million incurred in the year-ago quarter.  Lower exploration, depreciation and transportation expenses also lowered expenses. The results were partly offset by increased costs related to purchase of crude oil and products.Balance Sheet & Capital ExpendituresAs of Dec 31, 2017, Suncor had cash and cash equivalents of C$2,672 million and total long-term debt of C$13,372 million. The total debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 25.6%. The company incurred capital expenditures of C$1,444 million in the quarter under review.Dividend and Share RepurchaseSuncor returned C$526 million to shareholders through dividends and bought back C$835 million of outstanding shares in fourth-quarter 2017.Dividend HikeThe company’s board members have approved a 12.5% hike in its quarterly dividend. Suncor will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 36 cents per share. This translates to an annualized dividend of $1.44 per share. The increased dividend will be paid on Mar 26, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Mar 5.GuidanceThe full-year outlook range for E&P production is envisioned to lie within 105,000-115,000 Boe/d.  The same for Syncrude production is projected between 150,000 Bbls/d and165,000 Bbls/d.  Furthermore, the full-year outlook range for Syncrude cash operating costs anticipated to lie in the $32.50-$35.50/bbl band.For 2018, the estimated capex came in at $4.5-$5 billion.Q4 Price PerformanceIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Suncor has gained 4.8% compared with 2.3% rise of its industry.About the CompanyCalgary, Alberta-based Suncor is Canada’s premier integrated energy company.

710,PXD,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report) recently provided a glimpse of its fourth-quarter 2017 production update. The upstream firm also provided details on deals signed for divesting non-core assets.Details on ProductionThe company projects fourth-quarter 2017 production at 593,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BoE) per day, up 15% from a year ago and 10% from the previous quarter. The quarterly output has been adjusted for the divested assets.An uptick in crude output from the Eagle Ford acres of the firm led to the increase in oil equivalent production. Ramp up of natural gas output from the acres of Haynesville and Marcellus also drove total production.  Out of the total average daily production, the proportion of crude stands at 100,000 barrels. The daily output of natural gas and natural gas liquids were recorded at 2.6 billion cubic feet and 59,500 barrels, respectively.  Asset DivesturesChesapeake entered three different accords during the October-to-December quarter of 2017 and the January-to-March quarter of 2018. The agreements reflect the company’s plan to divest its acres in the Mid-Continent region.The company concluded one of the divestments in January. The other two transactions will likely conclude by the end of the April-to-June quarter of 2018. The assets to be sold comprised 3,000 producing wells that spread over 238,000 net acres. Presently, the daily net production from the resources stands at 23,000 BoE.The total value of the transaction stands at roughly $500 million. The proceeds will likely get utilized to lower outstanding debts. For reducing debt load, Chesapeake is also expected to use the $78-million in proceeds from the sale of roughly 4.3 million FTS International stock.The company expects fourth-quarter capital expenditure of roughly $525 million.About the Company & Price ChartChesapeake is primarily involved in developing prospective oil and gas resources in the United States.The pricing chart of the company — based in Oklahoma City — is not lucrative. Over the past year, the stock has lost 52.8%, underperforming the industry’s16.6% decline.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderChesapeake carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

711,PXD,"We are in the thick of the Q4 earnings season, with 251 S&P 500 members having reported so far. Up until now, the energy sector has witnessed year-over-year earnings growth of 146% in the fourth quarter, courtesy of a partial recovery in crude prices. Leading oil players like Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) managed to hike quarterly dividends, following an improvement in Q4 results.British energy giant BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) also saw its fourth-quarter earnings skyrocket from the prior year. However, the integrated energy firm maintained its dividend payment even though analysts were expecting it to announce a dividend hike along with quarterly results.That does not mean that BP is not fundamentally strong enough to raise dividends. In fact, our research shows that the company has the potential to hike dividend in the near term.Dividends Consistent Despite Crude DownturnThe market has experienced a downturn in crude prices, after average monthly crude prices fell below the $100-per-barrel mark in August 2014.Excess supply of oil amid lackluster global demand led to multi-year lows for the commodity. The concurrent race for market share among leading crude exporters like Russia, Saudis, and US shale players resulted in crude languishing in bearish territory.Subsequently, energy players experienced trouble sustaining their businesses, ending up with huge debt loads. Eventually, many energy firms were compelled to stop paying dividends. Though BP couldn’t escape the situation, it did reasonably well when compared to others.BP has been paying dividends to American Depositary Share (ADS) holders for 13 quarters in a row despite persistent crude weakness. ADS holders will again receive dividend payments on Mar 29, 2018 as announced by the company along with its fourth-quarter 2017 results, the quantum of which has been maintained.Investors should note that even though BP’s adjusted earnings per ADS was $1.94, 83 cents, and $1.88 in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, the annual dividend of $2.40 paid during each of the respective three years was comparatively higher.The picture clearly shows that BP has been distributing dividends in excess of their earnings, a trend which may not be sustainable. In fact, the company's current dividend yield of 5.9% is much higher than the industry’s 3.8%. In other words, the era of low crude prices and the oil spill incident of 2010 in the BP-operated Macondo Prospect – events which are still affecting the company –  could not deter BP from paying shareholders steady dividends.Can Investors Expect a Dividend Hike?Since the beginning of 2018, crude has been trading above the $60-per-barrel psychological mark. Notably, for the first time after 2014, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude started off the year above $60 a barrel. We view this as a partial recovery for oil prices, thanks to the extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players.On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of market.The improvement in crude price is favorable for BP as the company has a portfolio of major upstream projects. Last year, BP brought online seven key projects — Khazzan Phase 1, Zohr, Juniper, Persephone, Quad 204, Trinidad Onshore Compression and West Nile Delta - Taurus / Libra — which helped the firm produce record volumes of oil and gas during the October-to-December quarter. In fact, fourth-quarter 2017 production touched the highest mark since the January-to-March quarter of 2011.BP is also expected to bring online five more upstream developments in 2018. All these projects along with the developments placed online during 2016 will likely help the energy giant add 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to net production capacity by 2020.All those developments are reflected in the company’s healthy pricing chart. Over the past year, BP has rallied 18%, outperforming the industry’s 8.2% gain. Hence, there are strong reasons to believe BP will be able to boost shareholder’s dividends in the near term.  BP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

712,PXD,"The government of Netherlands recently said that gas production from the Groningen field, once biggest in the continent, will be gradually phased out by 2030 to lower the risk and damages from the earthquakes caused by drilling. Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV or NAM, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is the operator in the field.For the last few years, production cap in the field increased, reducing output from 53.8 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2013 to its current-year target of 21.6 bcm. The government wants to reduce production from the field to 12 bcm in the next four to five years. The production decline being gradual is expected to help the local industrial natural gas users, giving them time to look for other energy sources.To ease the transition, the government intends to build a new $616.6 million (€500 million) nitrogen plant that will convert imported gas for everyday use. The decision is also expected to affect Dutch exports. Notably, 30% gas production of the European Union comes from Netherlands.Each year, the region witnesses earthquakes triggered by gas extraction that damage many properties. The situation led the government to the decision of slowly ending production from the field, located in the northeastern part of the Netherlands. A lawsuit pursued by 3,500 victims, states that around 100,000 houses in the area have lost €1 billion in total due to seismic activities in the field.Both Shell and Exxon Mobil — with Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) — have number of energy assets in the continent. Therefore, the gradual decline in production from the Groningen field is not expected to be a headache for the oil majors in the long run.

713,PXD,"China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation or Sinopec (SNP  -  Free Report), per Reuters, has recently declared its plan of increasing liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving capacity by more than double within 2024. The company will also boost its shale gas production in the domestic territory by two thirds within the next two years.The plan is in line with the company's strategy of shifting its energy focus to cleaner resources. It will also benefit China’s fight against pollution, and the shift from coal to LNG for heating. By 2023, Sinopec aims clean fuel to account for almost half of the company's total supply of energy. During this time, the company expects to increase its natural gas supply capacity that incorporates both domestic and imported output, to 60 billion cubic meters (bcm) compared with 2017's figure of 27 bcm.Capacity IncreaseThe new imported LNG receiving facilities will be added along China’s east coast, increasing the company's capacity to a total of 26 million tonnes per annum from its present capacity of 9 million tonnes. To achieve the target, Sinopec plans to expand its Dongjiakou and Tianjin terminals. Moreover, a new terminal will be built in eastern Zhejiang province to facilitate the expansion.Production BoostThe state-owned energy company's domestic shale production ramp-up plans include Weirong block discovery, located in the southwestern Sichuan province. The new find is expected to enable Sinopec reach its goal of 10 bcm of shale gas output by 2020. Notably, the company operates in Fuling in Chongqing, the country's largest commercial shale gas field. Along with improved technologies and cost-reducing measures, Sinopec expects government subsidies to facilitate the company in reaching its production ramping-up targets. Additionally, by 2023, Sinopec intends to build 1,000 natural gas filling stations.Since the beginning of 2015, Sinopec’s cash balance jumped from $1.6 billion to roughly $32 billion, tremendously reflecting balance sheet strength, which the company can use to achieve its targets.Price PerformanceSinopec, one of the leading integrated energy players in the world, has gained 11.1% in the last year compared with 26.5% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderSinopec has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), EOG Resources, Inc.

714,PXD,"Major energy players on the S&P 500 index are expected to start reporting Q1 numbers starting mid-April. Like in the last three quarters, we expect the Energy sector to contribute majorly to the index’s earnings growth this time around. In fact, excluding Energy, we anticipate a drop in S&P 500’s earnings growth to 14.4% from 15.9%.Last year, the sector generated $11.6 billion in net operating cashflow, which was enough to meet capital expenditures of $5.5 billion. This resulted in positive free cashflow of $6.1 billion in 2017, the highest since 2009.We also believe that the healthy crude pricing scenario will help the sector report substantial free cashflow in Q1.Oil Pricing Scenario RosyPer the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA), average WTI crude prices for the first two months of 2018 have been $63.70 and $62.23 per barrel, respectively. The average monthly oil price had never traded near the $60 per barrel mark since 2015. Also, during the entire of March, the commodity traded above $60, reflecting a healthy pricing scenario.The oil production cut extension deal signed by OPEC players late last year continued to support the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. All crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end.Strong Earnings GrowthWe expect Energy to post the strongest earnings growth in first-quarter 2018, courtesy of the tick up in oil price. Compared with the January-to-March quarter of 2017, Energy is expected to see earnings growth of 60.8% on 15.7% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends.Notably, Energy’s Q1 earnings growth is expected to surpass 20.9% of the technology sector — the market’s largest segment with boundless investment opportunities. Moreover, for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2018, we project Energy’s earnings growth at 112.5%, 62.2% and 51.2% respectively.For the first quarter of this year, we expect Energy to record $14.6 billion in earnings, higher than $11.4 billion and $9.1 billion in fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2017, respectively. On top of that, for the second, third and final quarters of 2018, we look forward to Energy raking in $17.3 billion, $17.8 billion and $17.3 billion, respectively.Which Energy Players Will Make the Most?The fate of upstream energy firms is largely dependent on oil prices. With increased exploration and production activities, a higher number of rigs will likely get hired and oil field services players are expected to clinch more contracts for setting up oil wells.In fact, the market has seen a ramp up of crude drilling activities in the January-to-March quarter of 2018. As per data provided by Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) – oilfield service provider – the total number of rigs exploring oil fields in the United States rose from 747 to 797 in the aforesaid quarter.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the way to shortlist.

716,PXD,"With a host of S&P 500 members expected to release results by the end of this week, we are in the thick of the fourth-quarter earnings season.Picture So FarAround 251 S&P 500 members, representing 50.2% of the index's total market capitalization, have released fourth-quarter results. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues, with 80.5% positive earnings surprises and 78.1% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, total earnings for the companies in the Energy sector are up 146% year on 23.1% higher revenues. However, quite a few companies are scheduled to post earnings in the upcoming days and events are shaping up favorably for their reports.Energy: 2017 RecapIn 2017, Energy was the strongest S&P sector. In November 2017, the historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut was able to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity witnessed a stellar run on optimism around the agreement and improving outlook for oil stocks.We would like to remind investors that the Oil/Energy sector displayed considerable upside potential in fourth-quarter 2017 after a prolonged period of weakness. The improvement in the sector’s performance drove the aggregate growth for the S&P 500 index. In fact, the most important feature of this earnings season seems to be the positive revenue momentum, in terms of growth as well as beats.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices have trended in the fourth quarter of 2017.Strong Q4 Earnings Growth PredictionA look at the fourth-quarter earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector are spectacular, which boosted the S&P 500 index’s aggregate growth.The October-December 2017 period turned out to be rather good with oil and natural gas prices benefitting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago quarter.For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total earnings witnessed strong year-over-year dollar growth on 23.1% higher revenues.Notably, oil and gas prices during the quarter supported growth. Prices of oil at the end of the quarter improved, amid persistent decline in domestic inventories and improvement of supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil price at the end of the fourth quarter was $57.88 per barrel, up about 2.2% sequentially and 11.4% year over year. A year ago, crude prices were around $51.97 per barrel.The picture looks rather encouraging for first-quarter fiscal 2018 as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared with the second and fourth quarters of 2016, when energy companies reported unusually low bottom line.Energy Stocks Reporting on Feb 6Let’s see what’s in store for three energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers.Texas-based upstream player Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is slated to report results after the closing bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 60% on improved drilling program and higher price realizations. In the last four quarters, Pioneer Natural’s average positive earnings surprise was 67.6%.Pioneer Natural is expected to maintain its earnings streak in the fourth quarter of 2017 as it has the right combination of two key ingredients.

724,PXD,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions as price performance is believed to be positively correlated with efficiency. Efficiency, a company’s ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)   The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 22.Here are five stocks from the 22 that made it through the screen:Lululemon Athletica (LULU  -  Free Report), an athletic apparel company, together with its subsidiaries, designs, distributes, and retails athletic apparel and accessories for women, men, and female youth.

726,PXD,"Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) said last week that it will buy RSP Permian Inc. (RSPP  -  Free Report) for about $9.5 billion in the latest notable transaction involving the lucrative Permian Basin. The region has been gripped by a deal frenzy in the last few years, with a series of acquisitions, mergers and drilling rights involving both ‘Big Oil’ and smaller energy companies. It is worth noting that among last year's energy deals, more than 36% (valued at $24.3 billion) were Permian-focused, reflecting its status as the dominant domestic growth area for onshore oil production.Agreed, the sentiment in the oil market has not been this good in years, with U.S. crude prices hitting a more than three-year high of around $66 recently – a spectacular recovery from below $30 in early 2016.But regardless of the commodity’s price movement though, one oil-producing area that continues to attract investors is the low-cost Permian Basin spread over west Texas and New Mexico. According to some estimates, the region – that has been churning out crude continuously for nearly 100 years – has produced in excess of 30 billion barrels of oil since output began in 1921. Incredibly, despite that impressive output history, analysts maintain that its best days are yet to come. In fact, Permian Basin is touted as the key reason that U.S. crude production has now overtaken industry behemoth Saudi Arabia and is poised to surpass Russia shortly to become the global oil leader.The Permian ‘Super’ Basin   A sedimentary basin lying underneath the western part of Texas and the south-eastern part of New Mexico, the Permian Basin Shale covers roughly 75,000 square miles, almost half the size of California.Experts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin, as compared to most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels, well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability.Per S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – the average wellhead break-even price for oil producers in the Permian shale play has come down to a staggering $33 per barrel. Permian’s attractive economics means that producers can make money and sustain growth there at the current, $60-a-barrel price.The low operating cost stems from the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that makes year-round work possible. Most other domestic share regions need far higher prices to support new developments and expansions.Unsurprisingly then, the Permian has drawn the lion’s share of energy investment. Of late, more than a third of the total amount spent on all U.S. deals was spent on   Permian land purchases and leases. No other major oil region in the country has come close to this activity.Massive Reserve Potential Attracting ProducersAccording to business information provider IHS Markit, the Permian play is estimated to hold a staggering 60-70 billion barrels of recoverable crude oil -  enough to feed all the domestic refineries for 12 years.It is primarily because of the Permian shale that volume from U.S. oil fields has risen 24% since mid-2016 to more than 10.4 million barrels per day - the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Despite the slight uptick in service costs, a growing number of companies are devoting bulk of their investments into the Permian as they turn their attention to less-expensive projects that can deliver cash quickly in today’s ‘moderate oil’ environment. The recent Concho-RSP deal is likely to spur the “Permania” that has engulfed the U.S. oil industry and herald another consolidation wave in the Permian region.Such is the popularity of this unconventional basin that oil supermajors like ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) have made the region mainstays of their future production. While ExxonMobil doubled its Permian Basin resource to six billion oil-equivalent barrels last year in a series of transactions, Chevron has allocated a massive $3.3 billion as capital expenditure for this lucrative region in 2018.Four Permian Basin Oil Stocks to BuyThough a number of companies have built sizeable acreage positions in the Permian Basin, we have shortlisted four of them that might fetch you outstanding returns. Each of our picks boast of a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Concho Resources, a #1 Ranked stock, is our first pick. The impending RSP Permian acquisition will make the Midland, TX-based company one of the top energy producers in the lucrative play. The deal adds 92,000 acres of complementary holdings to Concho’s Permian portfolio, expanding the total Permian acreage of the company to 640,000 net acres. The combined entity is set to run 27 rigs in the region, marking one of the largest drilling programs in the Permian shale play.Then we have EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report). This Zacks Rank #1 stock has significant interests in the Permian Basin. In 2016, the company scooped up privately held Yates Petroleum Corp for $2.5 billion to expand its holdings in the region.

731,PXD,"BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 6, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14%. Also, the company was able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the prior four quarters, the average positive surprise being 26.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company’s upcoming earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 66 cents has been stable in the last seven days. It reflects year-over-year growth of 407.7%.BP p.l.c. Price and EPS Surprise  BP p.l.c. Price and EPS Surprise | BP p.l.c. Quote Factors to ConsiderFollowing the ongoing ramp up of key upstream developments, BP expects production to increase sequentially in the October-to-December quarter.Also, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased almost 20% in the October-to-December quarter of 2017, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through most of November and the entire December, the commodity traded above the $55-per-barrel psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year.The improvement in oil price along with higher expected quarterly production by the company will likely fetch BP impressive profits from upstream business.However, for fourth-quarter 2017, the company expects refining margin to decline sequentially owing to turnaround activities.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that BP is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 66 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks Rank: BP carries a Zacks Rank #1. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s 0.00% ESPmakes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for BP, here are a few firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is an upstream energy player, primarily exploring oil and gas.

735,PXD,"Over the last three years, the energy market has witnessed extreme volatility in terms of pricing. However, with crude now trading at over $60 per barrel, it seems that energy stocks are finally on their way to recovery. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s fourth-quarter results.Q4 Progress Report: Energy Treads on Growth TrajectoryThe U.S. oil benchmark ended a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 32 of the last 40 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April 2017. The gradual decline helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 419.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 13.2% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015.The U.S. oil benchmark saw an uptick of nearly 17% last quarter as rounds were made that OPEC and other major producers will likely expand their output-cut deal beyond March, 2018. True to the predictions, the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018. The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended 2017 at $60.42 per barrel — the first settlement above $60 mark since June 2015. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $53 per barrel mark.It goes without saying that all oil-related stocks are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.A General Review of the Energy SpaceThe Oil/Energy sector had put up a stellar show in the July-September 2017 period. Earnings for the sector recorded a massive 152.3% jump from the year-ago period — the highest among the 16 broad Zacks sectors — on 19.3% higher revenues.With 185 S&P 500 participants having released their financial numbers as of Jan 31, we are in the thick of the fourth-quarter earnings season. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the results reflect a positive trend, with an above average proportion of companies beating top- and bottom-line expectations. Overall earnings, for the companies that have already reported, are up 13.3% from the year-ago period on 8.2% higher revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 82.2% while that for the top line was 80%.In fact, the Energy sector is poised to witness the highest growth in Q4 yet again. Per the latest Earnings Trends, earnings for the sector are expected to be up 185.1% from the year-ago quarter, while the top line is likely to register 25.2% growth.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonThe encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies likely which are likely to trump fourth-quarter estimates.However, with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, our proprietary methodology — Earnings ESP — makes it relatively simple.

736,PXD,"Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) investors have more than one reason to cheer about. The board of directors of the company approved a 3.7% hike in its quarterly dividend. Also, it has made a significant oil discovery in Gulf of Mexico's (GoM) Ballymore prospect.About the Dividend HikeChevron – which is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 2 – will now reward shareholders with a dividend of $1.12 per share compared with $1.08 earlier. This translates to an annualized dividend of $4.48 per share. We note that this puts Chevron in line for a 31st consecutive annualized dividend hike in 2018. It is one of the only two energy stocks on the list of Dividend Aristocrats - a group of 51 companies in the S&P 500 that have raised their payouts for more than 25 years in a row. The increased dividend will be paid on Mar 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Feb 16, 2018.What Possibly Led to the Hike?In the third quarter of 2017, Chevron generated $5.4 billion in operating cash flow, while shelling out around $5.2 billion in capital expenditures and dividends. This led to around $200 million in excess cash flows - something the company achieved for the first time since 2012. Moreover, as a result of Chevron's focus on planning and execution, the company continues to reduce its operating costs with underlying expenses down almost 5% year to date.In addition, the company’s financial flexibility and strong balance sheet are real assets, which support the company's dividend hike – the first since the fourth quarter of 2016. Chevron is in excellent financial health, with more than $6.6 billion in cash on hand and an investment-grade credit rating with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 22.2%.About the DiscoveryAround three miles away from its Blind Faith platform, Chevron has found oil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico's Mississippi Canyon area. The Ballymore prospect is at a water depth of 6,536 feet. The prospect holds at least 670 feet of net oil pay. The company discovered that the well has a great reservoir and fluid properties. Chevron holds 60% operating stake in the new finding, while the rest is owned by Total E&P USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Total S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceChevron has gained 12.9% in the last year compared with 15.3% growth of its industry.About the CompanySan Ramon, CA-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas entities in the world as per proved reserves. It engages in oil and gas exploration and production, refining and marketing of petroleum products plus manufacturing of chemicals and other energy-related businesses. The company divides its operations into two main segments: Upstream and Downstream.Cash capital expenditures for the first nine months of the year declined 30%, which will boost its financial strength. However, we remain worried about the headwinds faced by Chevron's U.S. production. The company's exposure to violence-prone regions in Nigeria poses an additional risk.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderChevron has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas (COG  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD  -  Free Report).  Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

739,PXD,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. After all, efficiency is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health. Moreover, a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 21.Here are five stocks from the 21 that made it through the screen:Copart, Inc. (CPRT  -  Free Report) provides online auctions and vehicle remarketing services. The company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 10.7%.The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1.

741,PXD,"Now that Q4 earnings season is knocking at the door, there is no mystery in investors’ hunt for stocks with estimate beating potential. This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if it has been decelerating.Also, seasonal fluctuations can come into play. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company’s financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project its earnings. They also take a company’s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Locate Potential Outperformers? Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true. One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to exceed estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering a positive surprise in a quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria to push up chances of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity, we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 10.Here are five out of 10 stocks:Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report): This is a manufacturer and seller of construction and mining equipment. The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 8%, at the time of writing. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Crocs Inc. (CROX  -  Free Report): The company is a retailer of casual footwear for men, women and children.

(LM  -  Free Report): This is a Zacks Rank #1 holding company, which, through its subsidiaries, is principally engaged in providing asset management, investment banking and related financial services.

742,PXD,"Over the last three years, the energy market has experienced intense price volatility. However, it seems that following an extended period of relative weakness, energy stocks are finally on their way to recovery. With crude now back over $60, the panic that swept over the market is all but gone. The incredible turnaround has stoked high expectations from the energy sector going into the final quarter of 2017.Let's take a look at how oil prices behaved during the fourth quarter of 2017 and what makes the Energy sector a material factor this earnings season.Q4 Report Card: Oil Prices End on a Positive NoteThe U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 32 of the last 40 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 419.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 13.2% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015.Another reason why the U.S. oil benchmark soared nearly 17% last quarter revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. True to predictions, the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018. The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended 2017 at $60.42 per barrel – the first settlement above $60 since June 2015. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $53 per barrel mark.All oil-related stocks stand to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q3 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index. The July-September period turned out to be a rather good one with earnings for the sector recording a massive 152.3% jump from the same period last year – the most among all 16 broad Zacks sectors by a long way – on 19.3% higher revenues.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q4 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil prices improved considerably from the year-ago period. In fact, the strongest growth in Q4 is again set to come from the Energy sector. As per our Earnings Preview report, earnings for the sector are expected to be up 178.5% from the fourth quarter of 2016, while the top-line is likely to show an impressive growth of 24.1%.How to Identify the Outperformers?The encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies likely to beat our fourth quarter earnings estimates.Investing in such companies can fetch handsome returns for investors.

746,PXD,"Liquidity is an important yardstick that many investors tend to ignore. It primarily indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns.However, one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks. While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screen:Watertown, MA-based athenahealth Inc (ATHN  -  Free Report), through its cloud-based network athenaNet, provides services that manage the administrative duties of medical providers.

747,PXD,"Ensco plc (ESV  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 loss of 23 cents a share (excluding one-time items), which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents. However, the figure compared unfavorably with earnings of 9 cents in the year-earlier quarter. The decline was mainly attributable to lower dayrates of the floater and jackups as well as higher expenses. Total revenues were $454.2 million, down from $504.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $452.25 million. Ensco plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Ensco plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ensco plc Quote Full-year 2017 loss of 66 cents per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 50 cents.

However, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,840 million.Segmental PerformanceFloaters: Revenues in the segment totaled $303 million and were flat year over year. This was caused by fewer rig operating days, which had led to a fall in the average day rate to $306,937 from $358,405 a year ago. Reported utilization was 44%, unchanged from the prior-year quarter. Floater contract drilling expenses increased nearly 27.5% to $193 million from $151.4 million in fourth-quarter 2016.Jackups: Revenues at this segment declined 26.5% to $137 million from $186.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The downside mainly stemmed from fewer rig operating days for several jackups and a decline in the average day rate to $76,037 from $101,252. Reported utilization was unchanged at 54% from the year-ago quarter. Contract drilling expenses inched up 1% year over year to $128 million in the fourth quarter.Other: Revenues of $15 million were flat year over year. Contract drilling expenses increased to $13 million from $10.8 million in the prior-year quarter.Costs and ExpensesDepreciation expenses were $119.5 million compared with $110.2 million in fourth-quarter 2016.

It stores crudes, diesel, gasoline, gasoline blendstocks, gas oil, jet fuel and naphtha. The company expects the deal to close in the July-September quarter of 2018.Valero wants to retain the present employees in the facility, who can bring further expertise in their operations.

757,PXD,"There are many things we may consider when choosing stocks for our portfolio.Depending on our investment horizon, some of these may be short-term factors while others, longer-term.Depending on our need for cash and risk appetite, we may try to make the most of daily market movements, or hold on in the hopes that the overall financial health/stability of a company will yield higher value in the form of dividends or share price appreciation.We may also look for exposure to certain industries because stocks belonging to industries with strong growth potential may generate high returns, or stocks of more mature industries that may offer steady dividends.So our gains are highly individual and depend on our own needs and preferences that we then try to match with what the market has to offer.Given this backdrop, let us take a look at rising estimates as a factor guiding our investment decision. Estimates move up generally when analysts covering a stock see that the company has the strength in fundamentals to support continued earnings growth. This could mean that it has a good revenue generating model, that the market in which it operates is conducive to such growth and there are one or more other factors such as strong IP, brand value, operating leverage, etc. that can support this growth.In addition, if the company has a good earnings surprise history, it usually means that the estimates are conservative (likely because management is more conservative) meaning that the chances of positive surprises and consequent share price appreciation are higher.Here are some Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks that recently posted big earnings surprises and saw positive estimate revisions.

758,PXD,"Independent oil and gas firm SM Energy Company’s (SM  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 8 cents per share came narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents and the year-ago quarter’s loss of 31 cents. The improvement in bottom line can be attributed to an increase in oil-equivalent price and fall in operating expenses.Although total revenues (Oil, gas and NGL production sales) decreased to $341 million from $380 million in the prior-year quarter, the figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $330 million. The year-over-year decline in revenue performance was due to a fall in production.Even though SM Energy managed to beat the fourth-quarter estimates, investors seem concerned with the company’s 2018 outlook as the stock fell 9.3% following the earnings release. The company’s capital spending plan of $1.27 billion indicates a 36% rise from the prior-year figure of $936 million but the guidance for total production does not reflect much change, as shown below.SM Energy Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SM Energy Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SM Energy Company QuoteOperational PerformanceIn the fourth quarter, production was 112.6 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), down 23% from the year-ago level of 145.6 MBoe/d. This stemmed from natural declines in Eagle Ford volumes and absence of new wells in the region.Production in the fourth quarter reflects strong 21% sequential growth in Permian Basin volumes, which was more than offset by lower sequential Eagle Ford volumes as a result of the previously-announced joint venture as well as natural declines, as no new wells were completed in the Eagle Ford during the quarter.SM Energy produced 282.5 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas in the quarter, down 26% year over year. Oil production decreased 5% from the prior-year quarter to 41.5 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d). Natural gas liquids contributed 24 MBbls/d to total volume, down 37% from fourth-quarter 2016.   Due to hedging, the average equivalent price per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) was $32.16 compared with $27.59 in the year-ago quarter. Including hedging activities, average realized price of natural gas increased 26% year over year to $4.03 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). Average realized prices of oil at $48.90 per barrel, came in line with the year-ago quarter, whereas average realized prices of natural gas liquid grew 11% year over year to $18.84 per barrel.CostsOn the cost front, unit lease operating expenses (LOE) increased 39% year over year to $5.10 per Boe. Transportation expenses decreased to $5.01 per Boe from $6.39 per Boe in the year-ago period. General and administrative expenses flared up 36% to $3.38 per Boe from the prior-year level of $2.49. Depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A) expenses were down 1% to $12.69 per Boe from the year-ago level of $12.81.    Operating ExpensesOperating expenses amounted to $441.4 million in the fourth quarter compared with $664.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Exploration expenses decreased to $16.9 million from $23.7 million in the comparable quarter last year.LiquidityNet cash from operating activities increased to $144.8 million during the reported quarter from $137.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter.

The company had a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 54.9% in the quarter.Proved ReservesAt the end of the year, the company had proved reserves of 468 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), which increased from 396 MMBoe reported at the end of 2016.GuidanceSM Energy has set its 2018 production estimate to be within 42-46 MMBoe, of which 41% is expected to be oil. In comparison, the company’s production for full-year 2017 came in at 44.5 MMBoe. If the company’s 2018 production is at the lower limit of the guided range, it will be lower year over year, even though total capital spending for the full year is estimated to rise 36%.Production for the first quarter of 2018 is projected between 9.5 and 10 MMBoe, of which 40% is expected to be oil.Q4 Price PerformanceSM Energy's shares declined 34.8% in the fourth quarter compared with the 14.4% fall of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSM Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Continental Resources, Inc.

761,PXD,"EQT Corporation’s (EQT  -  Free Report) board of directors has finally succumbed to months of pressure from investors and agreed to separate the company's upstream and midstream businesses. It will form an independent publicly traded company (NewCo), whose operations will focus on the midstream businesses of EQT. Following the news of spin-off, the stock declined 3.1%, making the stock fall 11.1% in the last 30-day time period.Notably, since the $6.7 billion Rice Energy acquisition by EQT, activist Jana Partners and hedge funds D.E. Shaw & Co had pushed for the separation, as they thought it would bring better returns for shareholders.DetailsThe deal is devised to be tax-free for the company's shareholders, who will retain their EQT shares and receive a pro-rata share of the NewCo.Moreover, midstream assets of the company will drop down to its master limited partnership, EQT Midstream, which will then merge with the Rice Midstream Partners, the master limited partnership of Rice. The merged entity, NewCo, will focus on midstream businesses. The deal is expected to be over by the third quarter of 2018.  The Senior Vice President of EQT, Jerry Ashcroft, is expected to continue as the CEO of the newly independent company.How will it Help EQT?The spin-off is expected to enable the company to concentrate on its upstream assets, and exploration and production business. The deal will leave EQT with 680,000 core Marcellus acres and 65,000 Ohio Utica acres. With the shale production to ramp up in the coming quarters, this move can help the company benefit largely through efficient allocation of capital, compared with the previous company set-up that constrained the company's returns in the recent years.Additionally, $2.3-$2.8 billion of free cash flow over the 2019-2023 time frame is expected to trickle down from the move, which forecasts 10-15% annual production growth. This is much needed for the company as its free cash flow generating ability did not work much in the last few years, staying in the negative region for most of the quarters.Price PerformanceEQT has lost 17.7% in the last year compared with 15.1% fall of its industry.About EQT CorporationBased in Pittsburgh, PA, EQT Corporation is an integrated energy company. It focuses on natural gas production, gathering and transmission in the Appalachian region.

The increase was mainly due to higher volumes on its South Texas and Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline Systems as well as its Midland-to-ECHO pipeline.Petrochemical & Refined Product Services segment reported gross operating income of $172 million compared with the year-earlier level of $149 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $193 million.FinancialsDuring the quarter, the partnership spent $1 billion.

The company delivered average positive earnings surprise of 18.95% in the trailing four quarters.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayPrices of oil at the end of the fourth quarter were $60.46 per barrel, up about 12.5% and 19.6% year-over year and sequentially, respectively. Improving energy landscape is attributed to tightening supplies, brighter demand outlook and OPEC-deal extension talks. The energy equipment supplier is likely to realize the benefit of recovering commodity price environment.Rising momentum in the U.S. markets and modest improvement in international markets along with increasing demand are likely to improve the revenues of the company. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,936 million for the quarter, up 14.4% and 5.5% year-over-year and sequentially, respectively.Robust performance from onshore-levered Wellbore Technologies segment is likely to buoy the company’s top line this quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Wellbore Technology segment in the quarter under review is $725 million compared with $693 million reported in third-quarter 2017 and $531 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.We believe that the company’s cost-containment efforts and solid project execution will lead to positive results. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of EBITDA for the Wellbore Technology segment is pegged at $108 million, significantly higher than $20 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The figure is also ahead of the prior-quarter’s EBITDA of 94 million.Further, the Completion and Production Solutions segment is also expected to drive the company’s results.

769,PXD,"The board of directors of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) recently approved a 15% hike in its quarterly dividend. The company will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 46 cents per share compared with 40 cents earlier. This translates to an annualized dividend of $1.84 per share. The increased dividend will be paid on Mar 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Feb 21, 2018.What Led to the Hike?The oil refining and marketing giant was able to pull off the dividend hike due to the strategic actions it undertook last year for generating long-term cash flow. Notably, Marathon Petroleum's $8.1 billion drop-down deal with MPLX LP (MPLX  -  Free Report) bodes well for the company as it will lead to huge cash influx, boosting dividend and buyback programs. Moreover, the recent tax reform by the U.S. government has reduced the company's cash burden, leading to the hike.Why Marathon Petroleum Deserves Attention? Marathon Petroleum is known for raising dividends since it became a standalone public company in mid-2011. Additionally, it has an active share repurchase program. These highlight the company’s commitment to return more value to shareholders. Notably, the dividend hikes and buybacks, since the company's inception, have totaled $13 billion.Moreover, the financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet of Marathon Petroleum – which will release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Feb 1, 2018 – are its real assets gives it an edge over other companies in the industry. In addition, the company’s return on equity (ROE) of 8.5% is much higher than the industry’s 7.9%.Also, Marathon Petroleum has gained 45.1% in the last year compared with 28.2% growth of its industry. About the CompanyFindlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. The company, in its current form, came into existence following the 2011 spin-off of Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation’s refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity. Marathon Petroleum operates in three segments: Refining and Marketing, Speedway (Retail), and Pipeline Transportation.Marathon Petroleum recently took the final call of retaining its retail network unit — Speedway LLC — as a fully-integrated business within the company. Holding on to the Speedway, which contributed around a quarter of the company's total earnings in 2016, will help in generating long-term returns for shareholders. The segment is well poised for solid earnings and growth on healthy merchandise margins.Zacks Rank and More Stocks to ConsiderMarathon Petroleum sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Suncor Energy Inc.

770,PXD,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Thursday, Feb 1.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 22.07% on stronger fuel margin. Specifically, refining margin of $14.14 per barrel increased versus $11.32 last quarter and $10.67 a year ago.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a good history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteHowever, things do not look too bright for the company in the quarter under review. In fact, the pessimistic sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter, which moved down 8.3% over the last 30 days.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Marathon Petroleum’s fourth-quarter results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe expect a more conservative refining outlook to affect the company’s bottom line in the fourth quarter of 2017. While crack spreads still remain elevated compared to where they were around a year ago, margin estimates have come down from post-Harvey levels.Gasoline prices jumped to two-year highs in the third quarter in the wake of Hurricane Harvey that struck the U.S. Gulf Coast – home to more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity – and caused weeks of disruptions, creating supply shortages. With oil prices essentially remaining unaffected, crack spreads soared.However, capture rates have since come off those lofty levels. This is expected to hamper financial and operational performance of the Refining & Marketing segment – the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings. As it is, the recent oil price rally has made the commodity costlier for refiners and has in turn led to higher input cost.The negative impact of lower margins will be partly offset by higher sales volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total refined product sales volume is pegged at 2,410 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from the 2,240 mbpd in the year-ago quarter and an increase of 2.2% sequentially.Meanwhile, Marathon Petroleum’s Speedway (or Retail) division is also likely to benefit from higher output. We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly merchandise sales is $1,246 million, above the $1,230 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Also, we anticipate merchandise gross margin at $355 million, up from the prior year quarter margin of $350 million.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not conclusively show that Marathon Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -4%.Zacks Rank: Marathon Petroleum is #1 Ranked.

Moreover, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 10.26%.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $1.11has been revised downward over the last 30 days, with five firms being bearish and one firm taking a bullish stance.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of VLP segment for the fourth quarter is pegged at $71 million, up from $69 million reported in the preceding quarter.The company’s strong balance sheet as reflected from the rising cash balance since 2015 is encouraging. Moreover, the overhaul of the nation’s tax code is expected to bolster the refiners. With the implementation of the law, the corporate income tax will be lowered from 35% to 21%.However, the company’s escalating debt levels over the past six quarters are a concern. From no long-term debt as of December 2015, Valero Energy’s long-term debt is currently at $8.4 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of ethanol segment for the fourth quarter is pegged at $1 million, down from $82 million reported in the preceding quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of refining segment for the fourth quarter is pegged at $933 million, down from $1,429 million reported in the preceding quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for throughput margin per barrel from Valero’s refining operations stands at $9, lower than $10.94 in the preceding quarter. Lower expected throughput margin will likely lead the lower projected profit for refining segment.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Valero Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

The pipelines carry natural gas, NGL, crude oil and refined products. Notably, the partnership’s midstream properties are linked to all prospective shale plays in the United States, rich in natural gas and oil. These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines provide stable fee-based revenues.Recently, it was witnessed that an increase in oil exports from the United States into the Asian markets can put pressure on the world markets as the supplies from OPEC may eventually be replaced with that of the United States. These are expected to benefit pipeline companies like Enterprise as transportation activities increase.Price PerformanceEnterprise Products Partners’ shares have gained 1.7% against the industry’s decline of 4% in the last three months. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

773,PXD,"Toward the end of 2017, we saw partial recovery in oil prices. Solid demand growth, declining inventories and the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 is keeping the market steady and supporting strong uptrend.While there might be a number of winners within the energy sector, refiners have stood out amid weakness in the commodity prices. Moreover, the overhaul of the nation’s tax code is expected to benefit the refiners. With the implementation of the law, the corporate income tax will be lowered from 35% to 21%, which will benefit the refiners.This is because unlike crude producers and equipment makers who have been victims of stubborn low oil price environment and struggled to generate positive cash flows, refiners have been among the handful of energy sub industries displaying strength during the shaky period.The business of downstream players is negatively correlated with crude prices. This is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline, the prime transportation fuel in the United States. Hence, lower the oil price, higher will be their profits. Therefore, the income from converting crude into gasoline and diesel — also known as refining margin or crack spread — has been going up over the past few quarters.Consequently, these companies — having generated positive income before taxes — are in a much better shape to take advantage of the current situation. Consequently, shares of the major downstream operators have been rising lately.    In this context, we put the spotlight on two of the refining players — Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) — with market caps of $50.92 billion and $38.28 billion, respectively. Since both stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it will be interesting to see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.Valero Beats on the BoursesOver the past year, Valero surpassed the industry’s gain of 22.6% as well as S&P 500 index’s rally of 21.3%. Moreover, Valero’s rise of 40.4% has outshined Phillips 66’s returns of 20.3%.ValuationPhillips 66 and Valero have P/E ratios of 29.4 and 20.3, respectively. Clearly, Valero is the cheaper proposition. Notably, while Valero is underpriced, Phillips 66 is overpriced compared with the industry’s P/E ratio of 25.4.LiquidityThe liquidity of a company is determined through quick ratio which is a more stringent test to measure the capability of a company to pay both short- and long-term obligations.Valero has a better liquidity than the industry’s level of 1.02 and that of Phillips 66’s 0.86. Valero’s quick ratio of 1.24 puts it in a more comfortable position to meet short-term obligations.Return on Capital (ROC)Coming to Phillips 66 and Valero, ROC for the trailing 12-months is 5.4% and 7.1%, respectively, which are above the sector’s level of 5.3%.Last Quarter Performance & ProjectionsPhillips 66 delivered impressive results in third-quarter 2017 wherein adjusted earnings per share not only surged 58.1% year over year to $1.66 but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. Phillips 66 expects year-over year earnings growth of 60.28% and 39.39% in 2017 and 2018, respectively.Valero’s third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings surged over54% year over year to $1.91 per share, also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83. Valero expects year-over year growth of 34.41% and 29.68% in its earnings in 2017 and 2018, respectively.In terms of long-term growth expectations, Phillips 66 scores above Valero. The expected growth rate for Phillips 66 for the next 3-5 years is 10.00% compared with an expected growth of 9.86% for Valero.Earnings Surprise HistoryConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Phillips 66 seems to be a clear winner. Phillips 66 delivered average positive earnings surprise of 429.3% in the trailing four quarters. However, the Valero reported average negative earnings surprise of 10.3% in the same period.Dividend YieldIna year, the dividend yield for both Valero and Phillips 66 has been higher than the broader sector. While the sector depicted yield of 2.6%, Valero returned almost 3%. Phillips 66 has a dividend yield of 2.7%.Cash Flow From OperationsOver the last nine months, Phillips 66 reported a sharp year-over-year decline in cash flow from operating activities, which is a key metric to gauge the financial health of the firms. Valero’s figure was unchanged. Valero generated enough cash to fund capital payment.Phillips 66 generated operating cash flow of $1717 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared with $2296 million reported in the corresponding period of 2016. Valero generated cash flow from operations of $3822 million, unchanged from the corresponding period of 2016.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Valero has an edge over Phillips 66 considering price performance, valuation, liquidity, dividend yield.  Phillips 66 scores on long-term projections and earnings surprise history. On overall comparison, the scale is slightly tilted in favor of Valero.However, we prefer to be on the sidelines and ask investors to hold the stocks for now, reflected by the companies’ Zacks Rank.A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Statoil ASA  and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report).

774,PXD,"Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report) recently announced that its proved reserves as of Dec 31, 2017 increased 27% year over year to 1,162.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (Bcfe). Following the news, the company’s shares rallied more than 8%. This continues the recent uptrend for the company as the stock is now up 24% in the last 30 days.Per the company, it has taken into account oil and natural gas prices, which were a respective 30% and 26% higher than 2016, in order to determine the proved reserves. Comstock operates 98% of the proved reserves.The notable rise in proved reserves is primarily due to the success of the Haynesville shale drilling program in 2017, which helped the company to add 292 Bcfe to its reserves. Moreover, the improvement in realized prices and solid well performance last year added 41 Bcfe to the company's reserves. Notably, the company's development activities witnessed spending of $174.6 million in 2017. We would like to remind investors that the company has low liquidity and high leverage, which remains an overhang on its growth plans. It has a long-term debt to capital ratio of 91.8%, much higher than the industry’s 49.3%. To counter the situation, Comstock plans to divest its Eagle Ford shale properties in South Texas. These assets include 10.5 Bcf natural gas and 7.1 million barrels of oil of the latest proved reserves. About the CompanyFrisco, TX-based Comstock is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas properties.Comstock’s major position in the prolific Haynesville/Bossier Shale play provides a highly visible and cost-effective production growth profile. However, being a relatively small player, Comstock lacks the financial resources of larger industry giants. As such, during periods of prolonged credit crunch, the company is forced to spend within its internal cash generation. This may prove detrimental to its growth plans.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderComstock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Suncor Energy Inc.

776,PXD,"Shares of Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) fell around 3% to eventually close the day at $44.55 on Jan 9 after the company issued drab production outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017. Houston-based upstream player estimates fourth-quarter production from international operations to miss the prior guidance — provided in October 2017 — owing to weaker-than-expected performance of some of its projects in the North Sea. The company currently expects the fourth quarter production values from international operations to be in the range of 138,000-140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared with its prior forecast levels of 150,000-160,000 BOE/d. Unexpected shutdown of Forties Pipeline System and underperformance of wells in the Beryl area have been the primary factors for the lower forecast. Nevertheless, Apache expects improved realized prices to offer respite amid the declining volumes.As it is, the company has been bearing the brunt of contracting production volumes in all the last three reported quarters. From January to September 2017, Apache’s production averaged 345,495 BOE/d, down 13% from the first nine months of 2016.   Meanwhile, despite the international shortfall, the oil producer is expected to meet its fourth-quarter production target on the back of its U.S. operations. The company expects its output in the United States to be at the high end of its guidance range of 218,000- 224,000 BOE/d for the fourth quarter driven by strong performance in the Permian shale play. The company expects to have achieved its production target of 25,000 BOE/d at Alpine High.In fact, Apache has been banking on its Alpine High discovery in West Texas to remain afloat in the market, which could be its major growth driver in 2018. Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves, the wells are expected to drive strong economics and top-tier returns. The company expects to more than double its product portfolio by virtue of its Alpine High shale play in 2018 compared with the last year’s tally as it has initiated drilling operations in more than 5,000 locations. Notably, Apache intends to invest $1 billion in the region in 2018 toward this end.Apache currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of Apache have tumbled 33.8% over a year compared with the industry’s decline of 15.6%. Investors interested in the same space can consider some better-ranked players like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Denbury Resources, Inc.

777,PXD,"Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into cash and equivalents. Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as these are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks. While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through).

Further the top line witnessed an increase of more than 53% from the year-ago number of $368.6 million. Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Helmerich & Payne, Inc.

However, utilization levels of 57% in the quarter under review (versus 31% in first-quarter fiscal 2017) resulted in an operating income of 24.7 million at the segment marking a turn around from the year-ago loss of $30.9 million.Offshore: Helmerich & Payne’s Offshore revenues came in at $33.4 million compared with $33.8 million in the prior-year quarter.

While the average rig revenue per day is likely to be flat compared with the first fiscal quarter, daily average rig cost is expected to be roughly $13,900 during next quarter.As for the offshore segment, Helmerich & Payne sees the average rig margin per day to be around $11,500 during second-quarter fiscal 2018 and revenue days to fall 2% sequentially.The international land segment will likely suffer a 4% decrease in revenue days during the next quarter, while average rig margin per day is expected to average roughly $8,000.For fiscal 2018, Helmerich & Payne projects a capital budget of $350 million.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHelmerich & Payne currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Meanwhile, one can look at some better-ranked energy players like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Denbury Resources, Inc.

780,PXD,"U.S. shale players and Saudi Arabia have recently adopted various strategies to cope with the different phases of the energy sector. The goal has been to combat the persistent weakness in crude, and to gain an edge in the race to win title of the world’s largest oil producer.The current business scenario is quite profitable for the United Sates, as crude prices recovered partially after OPEC decided to extend the production cut deal. The uptick in oil prices may encourage more shale players to gather on domestic oil resources and thereby boost production. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects the United States to become the world’s second-largest oil producer in 2018, outpacing Saudi Arabia. IEA also expects 2018 to be a remarkable year, as U.S. shale players have the potential to outpace even Russia, the largest oil producer in the world.OPEC Deal Supports Partial Crude RecoverySince the beginning of 2018, crude has been trading above the $60-per-barrel psychological mark. Notably, for the first time after 2014, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude started the year above $60. We view it as partial recovery as the commodity traded above $100 a barrel before mid-2014. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally.On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end; Saudi Arabia, Russia, and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of market.US Shale Players to BenefitThe rally in crude is favorable for U.S. drillers. In fact, drillers in the domestic shale plays have been ramping up operations following a more than 15% rise in oil prices in 2017. As per the recent rig count report of Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE), the total number of rigs exploring oil and gas in the United States jumped from 665 to 929 through 2017.Higher drilling resulted in increased production. IEA added that the surge in U.S. production by 0.6 million barrels per day in 2017, thanks to the shale revolution, backed the increase in global crude output despite OPEC’s compliance with the production cut deal.Per IEA, the daily production of crude in the United States is recorded at 9.9 million barrels, the maximum in the past five decades. On top of that, IEA elevated the projection for oil production growth through 2018 to 1.1 million barrels per day from 870,000 in a recent report. If the projections come true, the United Sates will surpass Saudi Arabia — the world’s second largest producer of crude — with a historic production of more than 10 million barrels a day.Time to Focus on Shale PlayersCost-cutting measures and efficient operations have helped U.S. shale players bounce back, said IEA. Also, new methods such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) could reduce the dependence of United States on foreign crude and will help the country to export domestic crude to more nations globally, said CNBC. Picking winning oil stocks seems prudent at the moment. We have employed our proprietary Stock Screener  to zero in on companies with solid Zacks Rank and other favorable parameters. Headquartered in Houston, TX, EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) is a leading upstream energy player.

The firm surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the prior four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 67.6%.Pioneer Natural sports a Zacks Rank #1.Matador Resources Company (MTDR  -  Free Report), headquartered in Dallas, TX, is a leading upstream firm with operations in the prospective Eagle Ford shale play.The company, with a Zacks Rank of 1, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 34.7%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

781,PXD,"Kinder Morgan, Inc.’s (KMI  -  Free Report) $500-million Utopia Pipeline project has commenced operations with the product delivery of ethane from Harrison County, OH to Windsor, Ontario, Canada.The 270-miles pipeline system has an initial capacity of 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) that can eventually be expanded to more than 75,000 bpd on construction of additional pump stations. The project is supported by a long-term, fee-based transportation agreement with a petrochemical customer.The new pipeline will connect with and use existing Kinder Morgan pipeline and facilities to transport ethane and ethane-propane mixtures eastward to Windsor, Ontario.Initially, these ethane and ethane-propane mixtures are intended to be used mainly as a feedstock for producing plastics for containers, bottles, home rugs and automotive parts. These products will mainly be distributed to producers, businesses and domestic households throughout the larger Great Lakes region.The Utopia Pipeline Project will help meet the increasing demand for Ohio’s Utica Shale energy by delivering refined or fractionated products to Kinder Morgan’s customers safely.Kinder Morgan —– headquartered in Houston, TX  — has the largest network of natural gas pipeline in North America that spreads over almost 70,000 miles.

782,PXD,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus on Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for PXD’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Short Term Price Change for Pioneer Natural ResourcesA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity. This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now. It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.With a one week price change of 0.01% compared to an industry average of 0%, PXD is certainly well-positioned in this regard. The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large.Quarter EPS Estimate Change for Pioneer Natural Resources StockWhile looking at price performance or full year earnings can be essential to understanding a momentum stock, you shouldn’t forget about the current quarter EPS and the trend in estimates there. This change can signal how a stock might perform in the next earnings season, which is obviously vital for momentum investors.Right now, PXD is seeing a nice trend over the past month when it comes to this quarter’s earnings estimate projections. In the time frame, EPS estimates for Pioneer Natural Resources have gone up by 28.9% compared to an industry average move of 19.3%, suggesting that not only is PXD heading in the right direction, but it is seeing an increase relative to the industry too.PXD Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with PXD as of late.Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and Consensus Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and Consensus | Pioneer Natural Resources Company QuoteOver the past two months, 10 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that 10 estimates has moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate, as two months ago, PXD was expected to post earnings of $1.40 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $1.61 for the full year, representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have PXD as a security with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of A.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep PXD on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Zacks’ Best Private Investment Ideas While we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

783,PXD,"Leading exploration and production company, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is set to release its fourth-quarter 2017 financial results, before the opening bell on Feb 1, 2018.Last quarter, the company delivered an impressive 77.8% positive earnings surprise on the back of higher oil and natural gas price realizations. The company also came up with a positive average  surprise of 152.3% in the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.ConocoPhillips Price and EPS Surprise ConocoPhillips Price and EPS Surprise | ConocoPhillips QuoteWhich Way Are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at estimate revisions in order to get a clearer picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased from 40 cents per share for the fourth quarter to 45 cents in the last 30 days. While two firms are bearish on the stock, four firms are bullish. The estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of about 273.1%.Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $4.70 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), higher than last quarter’s $4.11 per Mcf and the year-ago quarter’s $3.44 per Mcf. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas production for the fourth quarter has declined to 2,793 million cubic feet per day (Mmcfd) from 2,918 Mmcfd in the last quarter and 3,863 Mmcfd in the year-ago quarter.The average sales price of natural gas liquids for the fourth quarter is estimated to be $30.20 per barrel, higher than last quarter’s reported price of $23.82 per barrel and $21.82 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. However, production is expected to fall to 94 thousand barrel per day (MBD) from third-quarter production of 95 MBD and the year-ago quarter’s production of 143 MBD.Average crude oil sales price is expected to be $55 per barrel, higher than third quarter’s $49.39 per barrel and the year-ago quarter’s price of $47.05. Moreover, production of crude oil per day for the fourth quarter is expected to rise to 604 MBD from previous quarter’s 420 MBD and the year-ago quarter’s 596 MBD.Though we expect average realized prices in the fourth quarter to increase for all the commodities, their production is expected to decrease, except crude oil output. The fall in production can be primarily attributed to the company’s asset sales in 2017. These divestures include the sale of mining operations in Foster Creek Christina Lake oil sands and Western Canada’s Deep Basin gas assets. The company also closed the divesture deals of San Juan asset and Barnett asset in the third quarter of 2017. Hence, it is difficult to conclusively predict the net impact on fourth-quarter results.Q4 Price PerformanceConocoPhillips gained 9.6% in the fourth quarter compared with 9.4% growth of its industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that ConocoPhillipsis likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -10.30%. While the Most Accurate estimate stands at 40 cents, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 45 cents.Zacks Rank: ConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #2,which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Houston, TX -based Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is an independent energy company. Its Earnings ESP is +15.15% and the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1.Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) is a Calgary, Canada based integrated energy company. Its Earnings ESP is +12.44% and it carries a Zacks Rank #1.Irving, TX-based Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

785,PXD,"Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash. Investors seeking solid returns may invest in companies that boast a favorable liquidity position.However, one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks. While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through).

786,PXD,"Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD  -  Free Report) intends to augment the capacity at its butane isomerization facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas.The expansion comprises a 20-year, 35,000 barrel per day (bpd) fee-based, tolling agreement, backed by long-term agreement to provide butane isomerization. Currently, Enterprise is examining two options to develop butane isomerization facilities that will boost incremental capacity by about 30,000 bpd.Enterprise’s butane isomerization facility at Mont Belvieu has a capacity of 116,000 bpd and is the largest commercial producer of high-purity isobutane in the United States. The facility comprises about 13 million barrels of aggregate isom grade normal butane, storage capacity for high-purity isobutane salt dome and 162 miles of distribution pipelines.The process of converting normal butane into high-purity isobutene is called butane isomerization. Isobutane is used as feedstock for the petrochemical and refining industries.The growth of petrochemical and refining industries has been very beneficial for the partnership. The facility expansion reinstates Enterprise’s focus and commitment to growth.Since its IPO in 1998, Enterprise has successfully executed organic growth projects worth $38 billion and completed acquisitions of about $26 billion. Currently, the partnership has $9.1 billion worth of capital growth projects under construction. Low cost of capital and financial flexibility has helped it achieving one of the highest credit ratings among MLPs of Baa1 / BBB+.Though it is estimated that Enterprise possesses solid cash flow stability from quality pipeline and storage assets and geographic diversity, volume risk and commodity price exposure can negatively impact near-term results.

787,PXD,"Rowan Companies plc (RDC  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of two LeTourneau Super 116E jack-up rigs — the P-59 and P-60 — for $38.5 million per unit.The rigs, which were delivered into service in 2013, were purchased in a public auction from a subsidiary of Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report).In May 11, 2017, it was reported that Rowan was the highest bidder in a Petrobras public auction with a bid of $30 million per rig. However, the price was unacceptable to Petrobras. After discussions, the parties settled on the revised price. During the end of first-quarter 2018, Rowan plans to mobilize these modern jack-ups to the Middle East from their present location in Brazil.Subsequent to the completion of latest contract, Rowan announced that it divested the Cecil Provine in November 2017 for scrap and has cold-stacked the Gorilla IV. Moreover, since mid-2015, the company has also sold five older jack-ups — Rowan Louisiana, Rowan Juneau, Rowan Alaska, Rowan Gorilla II and Rowan Gorilla III.Hence, the addition of these two rigs during a cyclical low at a very attractive price will revamp the Rowan fleet and boost the company's future earnings capability. Owing to Rowan’s years of expertise in this industry, it is very familiar with the design and construction of these rigs.

It hit about 230 feet (70 meters) of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. The well was drilled to a total depth of 21,161 feet (6,450 meters) in water depth of 8,973 feet (2,735 meters).The Stena Carron drillship, which is being used to drill the Ranger-1 well, will be mobilized to the Pacora prospect, 4 miles from the Payara discovery, on completion of the same. For 2018, additional exploration drilling is planned in the Stabroek Block, which is spread across 6.6 million acres (26,800 square kilometers). Potential appraisal drilling at the Ranger discovery is also planned to be executed during 2018.ExxonMobil, the operator of Stabroek Block, holds 45%, while Hess and CNOOC Nexen Petroleum Guyana Limited hold 30% and 25%, respectively.The discovery further validates the significant potential of Guyana.

789,PXD,"Efficiency, which is the ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health. Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company’s price performance.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory.Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) — to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)   The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 16.Here are five stocks from the 14 that made it through the screen:Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) designs, distributes, and retails athletic apparel and accessories for women, men, and female youth. It has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 8.1%.

790,PXD,"Welcome to Episode #107 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Zacks Director of Research, Sheraz Mian, who is also a former oil analyst, in their annual, end of the year discussion about the price of oil and the oil stocks.Their first podcast on the oil industry was in December 2015. Since then, they’ve given predictions about what would happen with crude, and the energy companies.Tracey’s the first to admit that they have been wrong in the past. In late 2016, for example, Tracey and Sheraz had concerns about if the E&Ps and the drilling contractors could even find the workers to re-start rigs and increase production (they did.)Additionally, OPEC and the other big producers like Russia, actually came to an agreement on production cuts AND haven’t really been cheating.Has Oil Finally Bottomed?US rig counts have jumped dramatically in the last year but that growth stalled out in August 2017.Crude supply has been normalizing, which has pushed the price of WTI and Brent to new 2-year highs.Most analysts believe the worst of the price declines are likely over. But it’s unclear how much higher crude could move in 2018.Tracey and Sheraz discuss the possible scenarios for price increases including geopolitical events in Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, as well as record US oil production.Investors Have Fled the Oil StocksCrude initially plunged in 2015. Since then, there have been several “false” rallies in the oil stocks which have spooked investors.The oil stocks are now mostly being ignored. But third quarter earnings were the best in several years and earnings estimates are back on the rise.If you’re an investor looking to get back into the oil stocks, where should you invest?Big Oil, the E&P stocks, or the service companies?Or should you be buying in all three?Oil Stocks to Buy in 20181.      Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for the first time since 2008. Earnings are expected to be up 52% this year and 12% next year. You also get its refining and chemical businesses.2.      Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) is really expected to see a jump in earnings after a tough 2016. EPS is forecast to rise by 327% in 2017 and another 17% in 2018. Chevron has more exposure to rising oil prices than some of its competitors.3.      Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD  -  Free Report) is one of the largest E&P players in the Permian Basin, which is one of the key shale producing regions in the United States. Earnings are also on the move higher, jumping 800% this year and another 107% in 2018.4.      Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) is the market leader in the US in hydraulic fracturing but also has the international side. Investors may want to look at the opportunities outside of the US. HAL is expected to grow earnings by 82% next year.5.      RPC (RES  -  Free Report) is the most profitable pumper in the US. It continues to raise prices and sees this pricing power holding through the first quarter of 2018. Earnings are expected to rise 222% this year and another 88% next year.There are plenty of other names investors should also focus on, as the entire industry is being ignored by the Street. Tracey and Sheraz discuss some other possibilities.The turn in the earnings, to the upside, is undeniable though. The “story” is changing in the energy sector.What other surprises await oil stock investors in 2018?  Find out on this week’s podcast.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

791,PXD,"(0:45) - Never Ending Stock Market Melt Up(5:30) - Melt up Recipe: What Will Slow It Down?(10:00) - Are Stocks Expensive or Overvalued?(16:45) - Small Cap's(25:00) - Takeaways On The Market: Podcast@Zacks.com Welcome to Episode #116 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Kevin Cook, Zacks Senior Strategist and podcast host of Mind Over Money, to discuss the sizzling hot stock market.Stocks are off to a fast start in 2018 with all of the major indexes hitting new record highs nearly every day.Yet, Tracey has been unsettled by the mania that has gripped some stocks. No, she’s not concerned about the FANG stocks or the semiconductors being too hot to handle. They are relatively tame right now compared to what is happening in other sectors.It’s the 100-year-old industrials that have her worried. Investors are pouring into the big cap industrials as if valuations didn’t matter. Many are trading at 25x or higher.Kevin’s Melt-Up RecipeKevin provided three ingredients in the melt-up recipe that investors should keep in mind.1.      Multiple Expansion Is Under Control: We may be in the 6th inning of this bull market, but multiple expansion isn’t yet as high as it was at the peak of other bull rallies like 1999-2000. There could still be more upside to go.2.      Competition: There’s less stock and more investors. Additionally, Wall Street, unlike most retail investors, has to buy, but doesn’t have to sell.3.      No global macro worries: Whatever happened to the Eurozone crisis or China having a hard landing? For the first time in a decade, the global economy is in sync and growing at the same time with virtually no economic crises looming.Is Boeing Too Hot to Handle?Boeing’s (BA  -  Free Report) big move higher in 2018 has Tracey on edge. Over the last year, the shares have gained over 110% with a jump of 13% in just 2018 alone. While the Dow has been hot as well in 2018, it’s up just 5.5% on the year.What is causing Boeing’s sizzling move higher?Boeing is now trading with a forward P/E of 28 which, it turns out, is about the same as that of Facebook.Is the big move in the industrials a sign of a market melt-up?What Other Stocks Look to be Melting Up?1.      Square (SQ  -  Free Report) has a forward P/E of 97. Year to date it’s up 25% after being up 210% over the last year. Yes, it’s a blockchain play but how much should investors be paying for it?2.      Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) has been a high flier for the last year. Shares are already up nearly 20% in 2018. With a forward P/E of 55, is it too hot to handle for new investors? Or does all the AI business justify the valuation?3.      Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) just reported a stellar quarter which pushed shares to new highs. They’re up over 24% to start 2018 and trade with a forward P/E of 97. Do investors even care about valuations with some of these high fliers?With so much buzz around a few big cap stocks, is there an industry where investors can find some value?Kevin and Tracey say to look at the energy shares. Many energy stocks aren’t even hitting 52-week highs, let alone record highs.Tracey likes Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD  -  Free Report), a big E&P player in the Permian Basin. While shares are up about 7% year-to-date, they’re only up 1.4% over the last year.Should You Be Buying Stocks Now?The biggest question during a market melt-up is whether or not to still get in.Should you wait for a pullback or is this melt-up going to last a while?Find out the answers to all your melt-up questions on this week’s podcast.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

792,PXD,"Will crude oil cross the $100 a barrel mark again? Even though this seems quite unattainable--after mid-2014, the commodity hasn’t even treaded close to this benchmark thanks to the supply glut--the crude pricing scenario is looking up.Oil has been steadily recovering from its historic lows, currently trading above $50 a barrel. The recovery has been largely backed by OPEC’s compliance with its landmark production cut deal.Is the agreement leading OPEC to lose crude export market share in the race with U.S. shale players?Record-High Volume of Oil Export in US HistoryThe United States has never exported more than 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. During the week through Oct 27, the nation exported 2.13 million barrels a day of light oil, way higher than 400,000 barrels shipped after the lifting of the four-decade long ban on oil exports at the end of 2015, per CNBC. The all-time high export volumes were primarily supported by record weekly U.S. production. As per the Energy Information Administration (EIA), American crude output for the week ended Oct 27 was 9.55 million barrels a day, close to 9.61 million barrels — the highest in the week through Jun 5, 2015.The U.S. shale boom has been the primary reason for the record-high levels of export and production. The combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has made many oil projects economically viable, encouraging shale players to relentlessly pump out oil.Strong European Crude DemandAccording to Kpler, the lion’s share of export volumes was shipped to Europe. For the week ended Oct 27, the United States shipped 914,000 barrels of crude a day to the continent, significantly higher than the preceding week, reported Kpler. This clearly reflects the substantial demand for light oil in Europe.Though Asia has significant demand for U.S. crude, shipments to the continent surprisingly declined 54% from mid-September through October, per Kpler. However, the proportion of U.S. crude export to China — the largest importer of oil in the world, per EIA — jumped to 20%, as of July 2017, from 3.7% in 2016, per a media report.Also, on Oct 2, the United States exported a massive 1.6 million barrels of oil to India — the third largest crude importer in the world — for the first time, per CNBC.Investors should know that the significant discount of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) relative to Brent has made U.S. light oil popular among overseas crude buyers. As long as Brent is more expensive than WTI, demand for U.S. oil will remain high.OPEC Loses Market ShareOn Nov 30, 2016, OPEC signed a landmark deal to curb oil output by 1.2 million barrels a day. Following in the footsteps of the cartel, non-OPEC players headed by Russia decided to lower oil output by 558,000 barrels per day las December. Collectively, they decided to cut crude production by 1.8 million barrels each day.On May 25, the cut in oil production was extended until the first quarter of 2018. Now, speculations are rife that OPEC could extend the agreement through the end of 2018.To comply with the accord, OPEC is lowering supplies to major crude buyers, which has helped the United Sates gain an edge over OPEC.    US Shale Players to GainAs per rig count data provided by Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), total U.S. drilling rigs increased dramatically from 664 – as of Jan 8, 2016 – to 909 as of Oct 2, 2017. This shows that more shale players have gathered in the U.S. lately, supporting record US production that has resulted in soaring export.Growing U.S. crude export will definitely prove favorable for the shale players. Major shale-focused companies are EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report).EOG Resources and Whiting Petroleum carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Apache and Pioneer carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Exxon Mobil – the largest publicly trading oil company – sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

793,PXD,"Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 19, before the opening bell.  Last quarter, the company’s earnings of 42 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 4.17% for the last four quarters.  Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents for the fourth quarter has been stable in the last seven days. It reflects growth of about almost 63% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,116 million for the quarter, up 14.2% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased almost 20% in the October-to-December quarter of 2017, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through most of November and the entire December, the commodity traded above the $55-per-barrel psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year.Improvement in crude price will likely be favorable for Schlumberger as oilfield service businesses are positively correlated with crude price. This is reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for each of the company’s business segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Reservoir Characterization segment’s earnings-before-tax stands at $318 million, higher than $316 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Moreover, for the Drilling unit, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $307 million, up from $234 million in the prior-year quarter.The balance sheet looks solid as Schlumberger’s total current assets of $19.9 billion — as of Sep 30, 2017 — is higher than $13 billion of current liabilities. The long-term debt level is slightly discouraging as $15.9 billion is higher than $10.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2014.  Q4 Price PerformanceIn the fourth quarter, shares of Schlumberger underperformed the industry. The stock lost 3.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.8%.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.01%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 43 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 44 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Meanwhile, we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell Rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Schlumberger, here are a few firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) primarily explores oil and gas and hence is an upstream energy player. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.45% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Headquartered in Houston, TX, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is also an upstream energy player. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.81% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.Headquartered in Houston, TX, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report)  is a leading integrated energy firm. The company has an Earnings ESP of +8.28% and a Zacks Rank #1.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 8.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% positive earnings surprises and 66.2% beating revenue estimates.As of now, 17 energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q3 numbers. Recently two biggies ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) reported strong quarterly results, courtesy of increased commodity price realizations and robust refining profits. Chevron reported earnings per share of $1.03, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents and the year-ago profit of 68 cents. (Read more: Refining, Higher Oil Power Chevron's Q3 Earnings Beat)ExxonMobil reported earnings of 93 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents. Also, the bottom line improved from the year-ago quarter level of 63 cents. (Read more: ExxonMobil Earnings Beat Estimates in Q3, Rise Y/Y)Q3 Oil and Gas Price Report CardOil:Prices of oil at the end of the third quarter improved amid continued decline in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, price of oil at the end of the third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude prices lingered around $45 per barrel.Natural Gas: Prices of natural gas dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages. Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices remain favorable when compared with the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Bullish Expectations and ResultsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that earnings for the sector recorded a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year — by far the highest growth among all sectors — on 16.8% higher revenues.The energy sector is poised to see the strongest growth in Q3 again. This is evident from the current upbeat projection of 148.2% year-over-year earnings growth for the sector. The top line is likely to witness an improvement of 19.7% from the year-ago levels.True to the predictions, the sector came out quite a winner. So far, for the sector components enlisted on the S&P 500 index, total Q3 earnings grew 253.9% on 33.5% higher revenues.Energy Stock Reporting Q3 Earnings on Nov 1Let’s see what’s in store for three energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers.Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report): Texas-based upstream player is slated to report results after the closing bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 90.91% on improved drilling program and higher price realizations. Also, for the last four quarters, Pioneer Natural’s average positive surprise was 46.74%.Pioneer Natural is expected to keep its earnings streak alive this quarter also as it has the right combination of the two ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and EPS Surprise  Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and EPS Surprise | Pioneer Natural Resources Company Quote Higher production and commodity price realizations are likely to drive the company’s results in the third quarter. Pioneer Natural recently announced 6.4% sequential rise and 15.4% year-over-year growth in production volumes. Further, the company also reported realized crude and natural gas prices of $45.35 per barrel and $2.58 per thousand cubic feet, respectively, both of which are higher than year-ago quarter levels. (Read More: Is a Beat in Store for Pioneer Natural in Q3 Earnings?)Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report): Houston, TX-based energy explorer is set to report results after the closing bell.In the last quarter, the company reported a wider-than-expected loss on lower production from the U.S. land markets. However, Marathon Oil has topped estimates in three out of the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.57%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output is pegged at 237,000 BOE/d, higher than the 222,000 BOE/d reported in the prior quarter. This may boost the company’s prospects. However, lower price realizations for oil and gas especially in the international markets may put the company’s earnings under pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized oil and gas prices in the international markets are pegged at 8.8% and 11.5%, lower than the prior-quarter levels.Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of -11.54% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report):Tulsa, OK-based energy infrastructure provider is anticipated to release results after the closing bell.In the preceding quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 31.6% owing to unfavorable changes in income tax provision. For the trailing four quarters, the company has an average negative earnings surprise of 13%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Williams Companies is likely to beat on earnings in the quarter under review. This is because the company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.36%.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Strong growth in production in the Northeast region is likely to result in higher transport volume for the company. The company also dominated the West American gas transportation with the help of its Northwest Pipeline. These factors bode well for the company’s performance this quarter. However, the divestiture of the Geismar Plant and Canadian assets can offset the positives and adversely affect the year-over-year results.

797,PXD,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Pioneer Naturalis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PXD in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 30 cents per share for PXD, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PXD, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.77% heading into earnings season.Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and EPS Surprise Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and EPS Surprise | Pioneer Natural Resources Company QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that PXD has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Pioneer Natural, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

798,PXD,"Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Nov 1, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 90.91%. Also, for the last four quarters, Pioneer Natural’s average positive surprise was 46.74%.Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents for third-quarter earnings has been revised upward over the last 30 days, with eight firms being bullish and five firms taking a bearish stance. The consensus estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 120.8%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Pioneer Natural is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.    Zacks ESP: Pioneer Natural’s Earnings ESP is +2.77%. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.      Zacks Rank: Pioneer Natural currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 has a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.  Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Pioneer Natural’s Zacks Rank #3 and +2.77% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.  What’s Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?On Oct 12, Pioneer Natural announced that its total production came in at 275.7 thousand barrels oil equivalent per day (MBOE/D) in the third quarter, representing an increase of 6.4% sequentially and 15.4% year over year. Higher activities in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry plays of Permian Basin primarily supported the upside. However, total output failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 278 MBOE/D, thanks to lower activities in the Raton basin.Along with the production update, Pioneer Natural reported realized crude and natural gas prices of $45.35 per barrel and $2.58 per thousand cubic feet, respectively. The reported prices for both the commodities are higher than year-ago quarter.Given the higher production and commodity price realizations, we expect the company to solid third-quarter numbers.Q3 Price OutperformanceDuring the quarter, Pioneer Natural lost 7.5%, underperforming the industry’s 5.1% gain.  Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report), headquartered in Plano, TX, is a leading exploration and production player. The company has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #2.

799,PXD,"One thing the oil market downturn has taught investors: nobody has much visibility into the future. So, when you think of something as a clear line of sight one quarter, it can soon be overshadowed by an unforeseen event.To sum up, even as crude prices continue to make their way up, world oil supply remains in a glut and is likely to remain so through 2017. This might make any oil price strength short-lived.Regardless of the commodity’s price movement though, one oil-producing region that continues to attract investors is the low-cost Permian Basin spread over west Texas and New Mexico. According to some estimates, the region – that has been churning out crude continuously for nearly 100 years – has produced in excess of 30 billion barrels of oil since output began in 1921. Incredibly, despite that impressive output history, analysts maintain that its best days are yet to come. In fact, Permian Basin is key to the studies that say the United States has now overtaken industry giants Saudi Arabia and Russia in recoverable oil reserves.Permian Basin: A Hot Area for Producers   A sedimentary basin lying underneath the western part of Texas and the south-eastern part of New Mexico, the Permian Basin Shale covers roughly 75,000 square miles, almost half the size of California.Experts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin, as compared to most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels, well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability.Permian’s attractive economics means that producers can still make money there at the current, $50-a-barrel price. This is mainly because of the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that makes year-round work possible. Most other domestic share regions need prices above $60 to support new developments and expansions.As a result, the Permian currently constitutes the lion’s share of the industry's recovery. In 2016, more than a third of the total amount spent on all U.S. deals was spent on Permian land purchases and leases. No other major oil region in the country came close to this activity.Permian Deals GaloreIn January, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) announced its intention to more than double its Permian Basin resource of 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The company aims to achieve this through the buyout of companies owned by the Bass family of Fort Worth, TX. Alongside an upfront payment of $5.6 billion, ExxonMobil will make a series of additional contingent cash payments of up to $1 billion. (Read: Exxon Mobil to Buy Bass Family Assets, Double Permian Yield.)Also, Noble Energy Inc. entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Clayton Williams Energy Inc. in a bid to expand its footprint in the Permian Basin. The transaction is worth $3.2 billion, post Noble Energy’s assumption of Clayton Williams’ net debt of $500 million. (Read: Noble Energy to Acquire Clayton Williams for $3.2B.)In February, Parsley Energy Inc. entered into an agreement with Double Eagle Energy Permian, LLC to acquire certain assets in the oil-rich Permian basin for $2.8 billion. (Read: Parsley Inks Permian Acquisition Deal, Updates Guidance)Toward the end March, Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) bought additional Permian Basin acreage for $700 million in cash. The followed the company’s decision to acquire 70,000 net acres in the lucrative region for $1.1 billion just weeks before. (Read: Marathon Inks Deal to Expand in the Permian Basin)According to analysts, deals of this nature could push up the value of the group as a whole. With its relatively low break-even cost, the Permian Basin is likely to attract more transactions of this nature in the near future. Also, with their new-found confidence, companies could soon be venturing into other oil rich areas. The new administration has already indicated that it would likely review regulations limiting drilling activities in Alaska and in other parts of the United States.Meanwhile, late last year, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) announced that it has discovered the biggest deposit of untapped oil in the U.S., located in the Wolfcamp shale formation in the Midland Basin portion of Permian Basin. (Read: USGS Just Discovered the Biggest Shale Oil Field in America.)Permian Basin Oil Stocks in FocusWith the hectic pace of land grab set to continue in the Permian basin and investor’s strong appetite for stocks focused in that region, we present five companies that investors should watch out for.Founded in 1954, Houston, TX-based Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) is one of the world's leading independent energy companies engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In particular, Apache’s recent Alpine High discovery in Delaware sub-basin, a section of the Permian, is expected to be a gamechanger for the company. Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves, the wells are said to have strong economics and top-tier returns.Second on the list is Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report). An independent oil and gas exploration and production company based in Irving, TX, Pioneer’s growth continues to be focused on the Permian operations. Its world-class assets in the region is likely to see year-over-year production growth of 30% in 2017.Denver, CO-based Resolute Energy Corp. (REN  -  Free Report) is another independent oil and gas finder in the U.S. with primary focus on its Permian Basin properties. Divided into the Appaloosa and Mustang project areas in Reeves County in the Delaware Basin, Resolute Energy’s Permian Basin drilling program continue to deliver compelling results. Second quarter production from the properties jumped an astounding 227% year-over-year, contributing meaningfully to cash flows.Next on our focus list is Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report), an energy explorer with its exploration and production activities taking place primarily in two areas: the Permian Basin and the Mid-Continent region. The Denver, CO-headquartered entity is set to invest more than 60% of its exploration and development expenses in the Permian region this year and hopes to bring 61 net wells online.Finally, we have Tulsa, OK-based independent oil and gas operator WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report). Shifting its portfolio from Colorado's Piceance Basin to Permian’s Delaware basin, the company owns around 135,000 net acres in the oil-rich area. WPX Energy entered the Permian Basin in 2015 following the $2.75 billion acquisition of privately held RKI Exploration, gaining 92,000 net acres in the prolific play. Importantly, the company’s acreage acquisition cost at that time was much lower than current levels, providing further impetus to its returns.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Energy is one of those.A few months ago, on the podcast, Tracey covered the Big Oil and E&P companies that had insider buying. But as the shares fell further throughout the summer, she noticed the insiders jumping in again. They’re doubling down.Two Scenarios When Insiders BuyThere are two different scenarios in which the insiders normally buy shares.1.  The shares have plunged and the insiders now think they’re oversold. They consider the shares to be a deal.2.  The shares are trading at or near all-time highs but the insiders think things are so bright at the company that they still want more shares.Most of the insider buys are scenario #1, including right now in the energy industry.Tracey looked at 17 Big Oil and E&Ps for insider buying. She didn’t consider the service companies, the refiners or the pipelines.She also didn’t look at the fundamentals of any of these companies. In that way, they may not have traditional “value” characteristics. All investors should do their own research on company fundamentals.Where Are the Insiders Buying?1.  In the last podcast, the big oil insiders were mostly on the sidelines, including at Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron and Conoco. Exxon shares are now down 15% year-to-date. Are the insiders jumping in?2.  A cluster of directors bought in both Apache (APA  -  Free Report) and in Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD  -  Free Report). Insiders had been buying at one of them earlier in the year. But at the other, insiders haven’t bought since 2015. Where did the insiders jump in for the first time?3.  Insiders have been buying at many of the smaller E&Ps. Three directors and the CFO bought in July and August at QEP Resources (QEP  -  Free Report). That’s a big cluster buy. Insiders didn’t even buy at the January/February oil stock lows in 2016.4.  Three directors also bought at Range Resources (RRC  -  Free Report) in August. They had been buying in both March and June.5.  Insiders bought in June 2017 at SM Energy and SRCI Energy. Did they buy again in August?Investors can tell a lot by where the insiders are buying, or, in many cases, not buying, as shares slide. Remember, the insiders are risking their own cash.Want to know if the insiders are buying at your favorite oil companies?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of APA, WLL and SRCI in her personal portfolio.]Want more value investing insights from Tracey?

802,PXD,"We issued an updated research report on upstream energy player, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) on Aug 17. We believe that strong focus on the low-cost and lucrative Permian Basin will help Pioneer Natural counter the rise in exploration expenses.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.We appreciate the company’s focus on the Permian Basin. The company has considerable interest in the basin, which is among the lucrative oil shale plays with less risk for operation. In other words, the company’s presence in the Permian Basin is likely to prove beneficial, especially in the wake of weak crude and gas pricing environment.Pioneer Natural has strong financials. Since the beginning of 2016, long-term debt load has been declining. Also, cash balances, though falling since the beginning of 2017, have scaled to $2.2 billion from $200 million at the end of 2012. This improvement is reflected in the current debt-to-capitalization ratio of 20.5%, which is much lower than 49.4% of the broader industry.Also, Pioneer Natural expects production growth in 2017 between 15% and 18%. In second-quarter 2017, the company’s production grew 12% year over year to 259.1 MBOE/d, which touched the high end of the company’s guidance. The outperformance can be attributed to the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program of the company.However, expenses related to exploration increased almost 45% during the second quarter of this year. If the trend continues, the company’s profits might get hurt.It is to be noted that despite the massive recovery in oil price since last February, the price of the commodity is significantly below the level reached in early 2014. Lower commodity price realizations could dent the company’s revenues, earnings and cash flow. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2017 earnings has been revised downward over the last 30 days.On top of that, over the last year, the company’s price fell 28.6%, comparing favorably with the broader industry’s 31.9% decline.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked players in the energy sector include TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report), Transmontaigne Partners LP (TLP  -  Free Report) and Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   TransCanada posted an average positive earnings surprise of 4.06% over the last four quarters.Transmontaigne posted an average positive earnings surprise of 6.60% over the last four quarters.Range Resources’s 2017 earnings are estimated to grow 116.5%.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

803,PXD,"Upstream energy player Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) recently announced third-quarter 2017 production update.During the quarter, the company’s total production came in at 275.7 thousand barrels oil equivalent per day (MBOE/D), representing an increase of 6.4% sequentially and 15.4% year over year. Higher activities in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry plays of Permian Basin primarily supported the rise in total production in the third quarter.  However, total output failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 278 MBOE/D, thanks to lower activities in the Raton basin.Of the total amount, oil production came in at 161.6 thousand barrels per day (B/D), marking more than 10% sequential rise and 20.4% increase from the prior-year comparable period.Natural gas output for the July-to-September quarter was reported at 340.4 million cubic feet per day, down 3.7% sequentially. However, the commodity output increased 3.4% year over year.Pioneer Natural added that Hurricane Harvey hurt third-quarter output by 3,500 barrels oil equivalent per day (BOE/D), which mostly lowered natural gas production. The upstream firm also said that excluding the losses in the third quarter, the company’s production could reach the high end of the earlier projected guidance of 274-279 MBOE/D.Along with the production update, Pioneer Natural reported realized crude and natural gas prices of $45.35 per barrel and $2.58 per thousand cubic feet, respectively.Pioneer Natural’s third-quarter 2017 results are scheduled for release on Nov 1, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 26 cents per share.Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural is primarily involved in oil and gas exploration and production activities in the prospective resources of the United Sates.

804,PXD,"Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) is expected to post fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 17.Last quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 7.1%. Moreover, Kinder Morgan delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.8% in the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents for the fourth quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. It reflects growth of about 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,324 million for the impending quarter, down 0.2% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderKinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America, spread over almost 70,000 miles. Notably, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States, which are rich in natural gas.These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines, for which the company has invested billions of dollars, provide stable fee-based revenues. In fact, Kinder Morgan expects 91% of its 2017 cash flow generation to come from fees charged for midstream properties. The revenues from midstream properties will be reflected in the quarterly results.However, Kinder Morgan’s weak balance sheet is a concern. As of third-quarter 2017, total debt — short and long term — is pegged at $38.3 billion. Debt capital is higher than total equity capital of $36.5 billion which depicts the company’s significant exposure to debt. If debt continues to grow, the company may face liquidity issues.Moreover, the company’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion faces threats. Being a part of the legal dispute, the successful appeal is expected to nullify the federal sanction for the C$7.4-billion or $5.9-billion Trans Mountain project and result in long postponement. This will be a major drawback for the company.Price Performance in Q4During the quarter, Kinder Morgan has underperformed the industry. In the aforesaid period, the stock has lost 5.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 3%. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kinder Morgan is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -1.16%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kinder Morgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Conversely, we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell Rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderThough earnings beat looks uncertain for Kinder Morgan, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

806,PXD,"The Q2 earnings season has come to a close for all S&P 500 Oil/Energy companies. The sector contributed the most to year-over-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 index.After thorough research, we can say that the sector is poised to keep churning profits in the coming quarters as well. Hence, it is an ideal time for investors to scoop up more energy stocks.Oil/Energy Outperforms Other SectorsWe have divided the S&P 500 Index into 16 Zacks Sectors. As per the latest Earnings Outlook, among all the sectors, Oil/Energy has witnessed the highest year-over-year earnings growth. The Oil/Energy companies have recorded 252.7% earnings growth on the back of 16.8% revenue rise. The other sectors significantly lag Oil/Energy. Most importantly, the Energy sector alone is responsible for 2.3% year-over-year earnings improvement during second-quarter 2017 for the S&P 500 Index.What Drove Energy in Q2?The oil and gas pricing scenario in second-quarter 2017 was substantially better than the year-ago period.Hopes of OPEC’s production cut deal extension was the prime factor driving the year-over-year hike in prices during April and almost the entire of May. Market anticipations proved somewhat correct as OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018 in the Vienna meeting.Natural gas also made a modest recovery in Q2 after the commodity hit its lowest annual average price in 2016 in almost 20 years.  Energy Will Continue to Generate More ProfitDuring second quarter of this year, Oil/Energy sector has recorded profits as high as $8.1 billion, which surged from $2.3 billion from the April-to-June quarter of 2016. We are also expecting the sector to earn profits of $9.2 billion, $9.8 billion, $11.8 billion and $13 billion during 3Q17, 4Q17, 1Q18 and 2Q18, respectively.Also, for full-year 2017, Energy sector will witness earnings of $36.1 billion, which is considerably higher than $9.6 billion during 2016. The upward trend will likely follow in the coming years as reflected that the Energy sector will generate profit of $49.1 billion and $59.3 billion during 2018 and 2019 respectively.Major shale players in the U.S. – that include Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) – have been focusing on lowering capital spending for exploration activities following persistently weak oil and gas prices as compared to mid-2014 level. With lower investment from the U.S. shale companies and constant efforts by the OPEC players to combat low oil, the crude glut problem will likely get resolved in the near future.Time to Buy Oil/ Energy StocksThe expectation of improved oil prices is favorable for energy companies. The exploration and production firms will be able to sell the commodities at higher prices in the near future that will again push them to restart producing more crude and natural gas. With higher exploration and production activities, there will be more demand for oil field services companies to efficiently set up oil and gas wells.Also, increased output level could increase the demand for midstream energy infrastructure assets like pipelines and storage facilities for transporting and storing the commodities.Our ChoicesPicking the prospective energy stocks from the stock universe can be a daunting task. To simplify the task, we have selected stocks using our proprietary stock screener.We have picked stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Moreover, all these stocks have beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter.Based in Fort Worth, TX, Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and gas company, engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties primarily in the southwestern, Appalachian and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S.The stock’s diversified asset portfolio is spread between low-risk/long reserve-life Appalachian assets and large-volume/rapid-payout Gulf Coast properties.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and posted a positive earnings surprise of 250.00% for the second quarter. Also, for 2017 and 2018, we are expecting year-over-year earnings growth of 117.7% and 89%, respectively, for Range Resources. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP  -  Free Report) – headquartered in The Woodlands, TX – is involved in midstream operations like transporting and storing oil and gas. The partnership has a Zacks Rank #1 and has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate during the last reported quarter with a positive earnings surprise of 17.07%.

The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 12.00% for the last reported quarter.Also, for 2017 and 2018, we are expecting year-over-year earnings growth of 12.5% and 12%, respectively, for TransCanada. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1.Subsea 7 S.A. (SUBCY  -  Free Report), based in Luxembourg, is the provider of subsea field development products and services to the offshore energy players globally. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 83.78%.

809,PXD,"Independent oil and gas exploration and production company, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 1, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 56.25%. Also, for the last four quarters, Pioneer Natural’s average positive surprise was 32.84%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors Likely to Affect EarningsAs compared to the year-ago quarter, the pricing scenario for both crude and natural gas has improved considerably. This is a favorable development for Pioneer Natural as it has been able to sell the commodities at favorable prices. Also, for second-quarter 2017, Pioneer Natural expects production in the range of 254−259 MBOE/D, higher than 233 MBOE/D during the April-to-June quarter of 2016. Hence, higher projected output in the view of higher oil and natural gas could prove favorable for Pioneer Natural.Also, reducing long-term debt over the entire of last year strengthened the company’s financials. However, the visible trend of declining cash balances during the first quarter of this year has dented the balanced sheet to some extent.Price PerformanceDuring the quarter, Pioneer Natural lost 14.3% as compared to the 16.9% decline of the industry.     Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Pioneer Natural is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients.

813,PXD,"Kinder Morgan, Inc.’s (KMI  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company LLC, has filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to boost flow of natural gas to Mexico.The company plans to boost capacity along one of its existing cross-border natural gas pipelines in the Rio Grande Valley. Kinder Morgan intends to enhance capacity of its Pemex Border Crossing Facility between Hidalgo, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company wants FERC to approve capacity expansion on this pipeline to 468 million cubic feet per day from nearly 185 million cubic feet per day.Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company has also appealed for the acceleration of the process. The boosting of the capacity along the 24-inch pipeline will not entail any construction activity or physical alterations. Moreover, Mexico is listed by the United States as a ""free trade nation"" under the North American Free Trade Agreement.In March 1999, the cross-border project was originally approved by the FERC officials. Kinder Morgan acquired Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company in August 2012. The company stated in its application that an environmental appraisal is not essential because one had already been executed for the project when it was initially approved. Further, the expansion will not entail any new construction.Per a notice released by the FERC Secretary under the federal law, the agency has 90 days to either file its own environmental appraisal of the project or open a schedule to perform an review, which will entail numerous state and federal agencies.A 20-day public comment period has been opened by FERC secretary for the company’s application and will close on January 24.Price PerformanceKinder Morgan’s shares have lost 1.6% against the industry’s gain of 2.1% in the last six months.Zacks Rank & Key PicksKinder Morgan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

815,PXD,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas prices suffered losses.On the news front, upstream biggies Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report) and Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) came up with contrasting second quarter results, while pipeline firm Genesis Energy L.P. (GEL  -  Free Report) is set to enter the chemical industry with the acquisition of the alkali business of Tronox Ltd.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.3% to close at $49.58 per barrel, while natural gas prices declined 5.7% to $2.7740 per million Btu (MMBtu).Following the year’s best week, oil prices logged a slight drop this time around. The commodity was affected by lingering concerns over OPEC and its allies' success in rebalancing the market after a survey showed that the cartel's output climbed to the highest level of the year in July and its exports were at record levels. Meanwhile, domestic production rose to a 2-year high.However, most of the negativity was offset by the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release that showed a sharp increase in refinery demand. Investors also cheered a lower rig count as it pointed to the softening of shale drilling activities.  Natural gas also turned lower amid worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of bearish weather predictions and a steady increase in production.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Leading upstream energy company Pioneer Natural Resourcesreported second-quarter 2017 earnings, excluding one-time items, of 21 cents per share. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents per share. Notably, the company had incurred adjusted loss of 22 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Significantly high commodity price realizations along with the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program resulted in the strong quarterly performance.Total production in the reported quarter averaged 259.1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), up 12% year over year. The Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program of the company led to the outperformance. On an oil equivalent basis, average realized price was $32.56 per barrel in the reported quarter as compared with $28.95 a year ago.For 2017, Pioneer intends to spend $2.7 billion, lower than the prior projection of $2.8 billion. Of this, it has planned drilling and completion capex of $2.4 billion and spending budget for water infrastructure, vertical integration and field facilities of $275 million. Pioneer expects production in the range of 274 MBOE/d to 279 MBOE/d for the third quarter of 2017.(Read more: Pioneer Natural Q2 Earnings Top on Increased Drilling.)2.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corp. reported second-quarter loss per share – excluding one-time items – of 21 cents against the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a profit of a penny. The underperformance stems from a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the past two years. However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago loss of 26 cents amid higher realizations.The production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 387,562 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (65% liquids), down 16% from last year.The average realized crude oil price during the second quarter was $46.89 per barrel, representing an increase of 9% from the year-ago realization of $43.14. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the Jun quarter of 2017 was $2.60 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 27% from the year-ago period.After aligning its spending plans with the low-price environment during the oil rout, Apache is now looking to increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. With returns-focused growth in mind, Apache announced a 2017 capital budget of $3.1 billion, representing a 60% increase over its 2016 spend.Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s oil and gas capital investments totaled $738 million during the Apr-Jun period, 85% higher than the $400 million incurred a year ago. (Read more Apache Reports Q2 Loss on Reduced Production.)3.    Oil and gas transportation and refining partnership, Genesis Energy, L.P. recently announced that it will enter the chemical industry with the acquisition of the alkali business of Stamford, CT-based Tronox Ltd. Per the deal, Genesis Energy will be shelling out $1.325 billion in cash to the chemicals and minerals maker for the assets.Investors should know that Tronox's alkali business, located at its Green River, WY. facilities, which is one of the biggest in the world, includes the trona and trona-based marketing, mining, exploring, processing, producing, and selling operations. It produces approximately 28% - 4 million tons - of the world's natural soda ash (sodium bicarbonate) output every year. It is used for various purposes like glass making, baking of goods, detergents, industrial chemical production, etc.Genesis Energy – carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) – believes the alkali business has a reserve life of more than 100 years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The buyout will help Genesis Energy in terms of its current asset base and aid the partnership to serve the refineries and petrochemical facilities connected with its pipelines better. It is in line with Genesis Energy’s strategy to diversify its business.Per the partnership, the soda ash assets generate stable cash flow, which might help with its $3.02 billion debt, as reported in second-quarter 2017. The estimated EBITDA from the business for the last 12-month period, which ended on Jun 30, 2017, was $166 million. (Read more: Genesis Energy Eyes Chemical Industry with Alkali Unit Buyout.)4.    Houston, TX-based leading upstream energy firm Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter adjusted loss of 24 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. Lower-than-expected production from the U.S. land markets impacted results.Marathon Oil reported North American production available for sale of 222,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d), down from 224,000 BOE/d in the second quarter of 2016. The deterioration was mainly due to reduced drilling and completion activities mainly in the Eagle Ford and Bakken Basins.Marathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses declined by 10.1% to $1,085 million in the reported quarter compared with the prior-year figure of $1,207 million. The decrease is attributed to the lower exploration, production, marketing and general/administrative costs. However, the decrease was partially offset by higher depreciation expenses and other operating costs.Marathon Oil has raised its production guidance for the full-year 2017 and expects the production available for sale from the combined North America and International E&P segments, excluding Libya, to average 345,000–360,000 BOE/d, about 7% higher than 2016. (Read more: Marathon Oil Q2 Loss Wider than Expected, Revenues Beat.)5.    U.S. refiner HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC  -  Free Report) reported strong second-quarter results, helped by improving refining margins, higher production and contribution from the newly acquired PCLI unit.Net income from the Refining segment – which is the main contributor to HollyFrontier earnings – was $86.6 million, turning around from the loss of $436.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The improvement reflects wider gross margins, which jumped 29% to $11.47 per barrel.Total refined product sales volumes averaged 483,210 barrels per day (bpd), up 9% from the 442,660 bpd in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, throughput increased from 428,590 bpd in the year-ago quarter to 467,090 bpd. Capacity utilization, at 102.13%, was up from 101.7% in the second quarter of 2016.Income from the newly acquired Petro-Canada Lubricants Inc. (or PCLI) business – bought from Canadian oil and gas giant Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) earlier this year – totaled $12.6 million. Product sales averaged 23,720 bpd, while production and throughput came in at 20,880 bpd and 21,470 bpd, respectively.

816,PXD,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in PXD.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 10 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just four upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.50 cents a share a month ago to its current level of $1.13 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Pioneer Natural has seen 12 downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 27 cents a share from 50 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 18.2% in the past month.Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and Consensus Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and Consensus | Pioneer Natural Resources Company QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report).

817,PXD,"Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD  -  Free Report) intends to add a capacity of 300 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) at the cryogenic natural gas processing facility near Orla, Texas in Reeves County.A third processing train at Orla, scheduled to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2019, is expected to boost inlet volume capacity to 900 MMcf/d. It would also facilitate Enterprise expand natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction capabilities by an additional 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 120,000 bpd. The third processing train will complement trains 1 and 2, which are estimated to be operational in the second and third quarters of 2018, respectively.Enterprise’s fully integrated pipeline system will receive mixed NGLs from Orla. The receiving pipeline will include the new Shin Oak Pipeline. The pipeline is under construction and is expected to commence operations in second-quarter 2019. A new 68-mile, 36-inch diameter pipeline which is expected to start operations in second-quarter 2018 will be used to transfer the remaining natural gas from Orla to the Waha area. Subsequently, it will connect to Enterprise’s Texas Intrastate pipeline system at the Waha hub.On completion of the Orla expansion projects, Enterprise’s total natural gas processing capacity will exceed 1.2 billion cubic feet per day, and its NGLs extraction capability will be more than 200,000 bpd in the Permian Basin.The facility, which is currently under construction, is expected to benefit from the continuous growth of NGL-rich natural gas production in the Delaware Basin and is backed by long-term contracts with producers.It is estimated that the supplies of natural gas and NGLs in the Permian Basin would nearly double in the next five years. The facility,  being located in close proximity to the region, is expected to leverage on growth opportunities. Orla is well connected to the partnership’s integrated natural gas and NGL infrastructure network.

818,PXD,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 14.Here are five stocks from the 14 that made it through the screen:Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) provides hospice and palliative care services in the United States.

819,PXD,"On Jan 3, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) was raised to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?Earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks investment philosophy. Stocks that have recently seen upward revision in estimates tend to outperform the market over the next nine to 12 months.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised higher from 65 cents to 72 cents. Also, for 2017, estimates were raised from $1.54 to $1.59.Pioneer Natural has an impressive earnings surprise history. The energy giant managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the prior four quarters, the average positive surprise being 67.6%. Also, we expect the company to witness year-over-year earnings improvement of 896.5% in 2017 and 122.9% in 2018.Also, Pioneer Natural’s balance sheet looks impressive. Total cash and equivalents as of Sep 30, 2017, was recorded at nearly $2 billion, which can easily take care of the current debt of $449 million. Moreover, the company’s long-term debt has been steadily declining since 2016. The business scenario looks profitable as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil recently traded at $60.74 per barrel — last touched before June 2015 — per Reuters. Also, natural gas traded above the psychological mark of $3 per million British Thermal Unit (BTU). Overall, the favorable commodity pricing scenario could fetch the exploration and production company attractive cashflow.Share price of Pioneer Natural, belonging to the Zacks Oil US Exploration industry, has rallied 6.2% in the last six months. Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other prospective stocks in the energy sector are Lonestar Resources US Inc. (LONE  -  Free Report), Northern Oil and Gas Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) and Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report).  All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   Headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, Lonestar is an upstream energy player. The company is expected to post year-over-year earnings growth of 81.3% in 2017.Based in Minnetonka, MN, Northern Oil is an upstream energy player.

820,PXD,"It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectation. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to five.Here are all five stocks:Caterpillar Inc.

821,PXD,"Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) has announced its intention to invest in the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project as majority of the pipeline transportation capacity has been booked by the shippers.The shippers have already committed to utilize 85% of the pipeline’s capacity for transporting natural gas. Per the company’s expectation, the shippers will book the rest of the transportation capacity by the initial phase of 2018. Investors should know that Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), DCP Midstream, LP (DCP  -  Free Report) and Targa Resources Corp. (TRGP  -  Free Report) are among the shippers.The to-be built pipeline project — worth $1.7 billion — will probably have the capacity to carry roughly 1.92 billion cubic feet of natural gas daily to the Texas Gulf Coast area from the Permian Basin. The pipeline, which awaits regulatory consents, is likely to commence operation by October 2019. It is to be noted that Kinder Morgan is likely to start construction by the first quarter of next year. With the operatorship of the project, Kinder Morgan will have 50% stake. Meanwhile, each of Targa Resources and DCP Midstream will probably own 25% stake.Texas-based Kinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipeline in North America that spreads over almost 70,000 miles. Notably, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States that are rich in natural gas. These extensive pipeline networks, for which billions of dollars has been invested to date, have been providing the company with stable fee-based revenues.However, the stock fell 12.8% year to date, wider than the industry’s 0.7% decline.Consequently, Kinder Morgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

822,PXD,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw to reach the lowest level since 2015. But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was partly offset by another build in gasoline supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production maintained its steadily rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 0.9% (or 53 cents) to end at $58.09 per barrel yesterday. Energy Stocks JumpThe federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – up more than 1.4% Wednesday. The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report). Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 6.5 million barrels for the week ending Dec 15, following a decrease of 5.1 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.2 million barrels. An uptick in refinery demand led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as U.S. output edged up 9,000 barrels per day last week to 9.8 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 29 of the last 37 weeks and are down nearly 97 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 436.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 10.1% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year. Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 754,000 barrels to 53 million barrels. The crude supply cover was down from 26.1 days in the previous week to 25.6 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days. Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the sixth straight week on strong production. The 1.2 million barrels addition – more than the polled number of 1.1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 227.8 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 0.4% below the year-earlier level but is close to the upper limit of the average range. Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) was up 769,000 barrels last week, greater than analysts’ expectations. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 128.8 million barrels, current supplies are 16.1% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year. Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.7% from the prior week to 94.1%. About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad. The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry. Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?

823,PXD,"Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), a firm in the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, PXD has beaten estimates by at least 60% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago, PXD expected to post earnings of 11 cents per share, while it actually produced earnings of 21 cents per share, a beat of 90.9%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver earnings of 30 cents per share, when it actually produced earnings of 48 cents per share instead, representing a 60% positive surprise.Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and EPS Surprise Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and EPS Surprise | Pioneer Natural Resources Company QuoteThanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Pioneer Natural Resources. In fact, the Earnings ESP for PXD is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company’s earnings prospects. This is the case for PXD, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of +24.96%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that PXD has a great Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile.

824,PXD,"It can be very difficult to find companies that are both flying under the radar, and still might have potential for gains. Many times, stocks are off investors’ radar screens for a reason, though there are some hidden gems that could be worth uncovering by those with a high risk tolerance.   One way to find these underappreciated stocks is by looking at companies that haven’t seen their share prices move higher lately, but have observed analysts raising earnings estimates for their stock. This trend could signal that investors haven’t quite embraced the rising estimate story yet, but that the potential for a big move higher is definitely there.One such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain, but has been overlooked by investors lately, is Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report). This Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 28.6%. But that is not yet reflected in its price, as the stock lost 1.8% over the same time frame.Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and Consensus Pioneer Natural Resources Company Price and Consensus | Pioneer Natural Resources Company QuoteYou should not be concerned about the price remaining muted going forward. This year’s expected earnings growth over the prior year is 865.6%, which should ultimately translate into price appreciation.And if this isn’t enough, PXD currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which further underscores the potential for its outperformance (See the performance of Zacks' portfolios and strategies here: About Zacks Performance).

825,PXD,"The increase in oil exports from the United States into the Asian markets can put pressure on the world markets as the supplies from OPEC may eventually be replaced with that of the United States.U.S. crude oil exports to Asia last week hit the highest in two months, and the second-highest on record, at 877,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data from Kpler. Of the total export, South Korea was the biggest buyer with imports of 357,000 bpd. It was followed by China and India who had imports of 222,000 bpd and 151,000 bpd, respectively. Indonesia and Japan were close with imports of 99,000 bpd and 47,500 bpd, respectively. In the first three weeks of November, the average export rate for U.S. crude to Asia was at 470,330 bpd.Reasons Behind Growing U.S. ExportsThere are two mains reasons behind the spur in US exports over the last few years.In 2015, Washington lifted the forty-year old ban on oil exports. Per CNBC, the United States has never exported more than 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. During the week through Oct 27, the nation exported 2.13 million barrels a day of light oil, higher than 400,000 barrels shipped at the end of 2015.On Nov 30, 2016, OPEC signed a landmark deal to curb oil output by 1.2 million barrels a day. Following the footsteps of the cartel, non-OPEC players headed by Russia decided to lower oil output by 558,000 barrels per day in December 2016.Collectively, they decided to reduce crude production by 1.8 million barrels each day. On May 25, the cut in oil production was extended until the first quarter of 2018. It is expected that OPEC can extend the agreement through the end of 2018.On Nov 30, OPEC and non-OPEC players will hold a meeting to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord beyond first-quarter 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, will participate in the Vienna meeting. The agreement entails putting roughly 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market.It can be assumed that the United States is gaining an edge over OPEC in the global crude market especially in Asia, considering that the cartel is lowering supplies to major crude buyers in compliance with the accord.Why the Interest in U.S. Crude?There are three main reasons behind the surging demand for U.S. crude. The crude is appropriate with the configuration of Asian refineries. These refineries process high quality so-called light, sweet crude that produce petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel.U.S. crude is less expensive as the WTI trades at a steep discount to other oil benchmarks like Brent.The cargoes are bought on a spot basis, providing refiners flexibility to balance the conventional Middle Eastern supplies that are sourced via long-term contracts.Other ReasonsPolitical reasons also at play for this boom in US exports to Asia, per oil traders and refining executives. Sources believe that all regions including Tokyo, Beijing and Asian governments are trying to improve trade relationship with America. Hence, buying crude from the nation is considered a medium to promote the relationship with Washington.GainersAs per rig count data provided by Baker Hughes, a GE company, total U.S. drilling rigs increased dramatically from 404 — the lowest hit in May, 2016 — to 923 as of Nov 22, 2017. The current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 588. This signifies that more shale players have gathered in the United States, which has led to higher U.S. oil production and export.Growing crude export is expected to benefit shale players like EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report).These players will be able to sell their production. Amid low oil prices, these companies will benefit from low cost and high yielding assets.Pipeline companies like Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD  -  Free Report) and Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) are expected to gain from increasing exports.These companies will witness an increase in transportation activities. The companies’ operations were hampered after the oil crash, which resulted from sluggish activities and lower oil demand.Pioneer holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while EOG Resources, Whiting Petroleum and Apache carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). ExxonMobil — the largest publicly trading oil company — sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
