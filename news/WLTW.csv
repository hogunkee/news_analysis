14,WLTW,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing, with 251 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances indicate a 16% increase in total earnings on 10.5% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 80.5% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 64.9%, outperforming on the top-line front.On an encouraging note, the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. Per the Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to grow 5.7% on 2.8% higher revenues.Industry Sneak PeekThe insurance industry, as an integral component of the Finance sector is likely to perform slightly better in the soon-to-be-reported quarter compared with the third quarter. However, the insurers’ underwriting profitability is still likely to bear the brunt of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter. This downside further added to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide, estimating cat loss at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn has even helped improving the premiums and driving the top line as well.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important ingredient of an insurer’s top line, is expected to have substantially improved on the back of a rising interest rate environment. Although the interest rates have been increasing at a slower pace, the impact of rate hike is clearly visible in the insurers’ investment portfolios. Notably, the Fed kept its promise of three hikes in 2017, the last one made in December, having raised enough optimism among investors.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographical footprint and strong client retention are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.Moreover, the tax reform policy — enacted in December 2017, reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35% — is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a considerable extent. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is estimated to make U.S. insurers more competitive, globally.With 482 companies (92 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings results this week, let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of their quarterly releases on Feb 8.American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) results are expected to suffer from weak performance of its Commercial segment, loss from catastrophes and a lower amount of share buyback.The company’s Commercial insurance segment has been underperforming for several quarters.

30,WLTW,"Third-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Oct 27, 272 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, third-quarter results of these companies account for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization.Total earnings for these companies are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% rise in revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings per share estimates and 66.2% topping revenue estimates.The insurance industry, an integral part of the the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), will witness soft results in the third quarter. A soft performance from the insurance industry will be a drag on the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our report, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 2.9% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, we expect prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment to withstand the loss to some extent.We do not expect insurance pricings to be strong in the third quarter.However, net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is likely to witness improvement courtesy of three rate hikes approved since December 2016. Though the rate environment is advancing at snail’s pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The third quarter will also not be an exception.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continued low rates. Annuity sales should also benefit from higher rates.However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Let’s take a sneak peek into the expected performance of four multiline insurance stocks that are scheduled to report earnings on Nov 2.American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are likely to suffer from nearly $3 billion of estimated catastrophe loss from hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico. A lower amount of share buyback would also hurt its bottom line.We expect to see earnings strength in its Consumer segment as the company enjoys a leading market position across many products and distribution channels, which allow it to maintain profitability in evolving markets.Our proven model shows that AIG does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 — to beat earnings estimates. It has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

31,WLTW,"Apparently, a safe and sleepy business nature keeps U.S. insurers out of federal regulations, which could have marred business expansion. But the industry is yet to be strongly braced by the advantages of operating under state-run regulations. Instead, decentralized regulation and consumer protection make the industry susceptible to insolvency.Now, the changing nature of business – more like banks in terms of liabilities – perhaps calls for federal oversight. Though the necessity for regulatory revamp has been strongly felt after witnessing the success of banks, this will delve another blow to the already struggling industry.A provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act requires setting minimum capital and leverage standards on insurance companies as well, but these are yet to be implemented by U.S. lawmakers, who are considering the distinct business fundamentals unlike banks. But the industry, which accounts for 7% of GDP in terms of insurance premiums paid each year, is not likely to be relieved of Federal Reserve control for very long.Following a slowdown in Q1, the industry witnessed a recovery keeping pace with the broader finance sector. Earnings growth of the insurance industry came in at 0.1% on 5.5% revenue increase compared with 8.7% earnings decline on 0.6% revenue drop in the prior quarter. However, the pace of premium rate increase remained subdued thanks to the continued low interest rate environment.Fundamental challenges such as weak underwriting gains and low investment yields also persist. While earnings could show better momentum in the coming quarters with growth in contingent income, a respite from the underlying weakness is not expected before long. Moreover, heightened market competition could mar profitability to some extent.
"
32,WLTW,"On the brighter side, the ongoing reserve development brings some relief. Also, increasing demand from economically recuperating American households should keep the endeavor to reach a favorable pricing cycle alive.
"
33,WLTW,"A lot depends on catastrophe losses too. The forecast of a below-normal (70% chance) 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, spanning from Jun 1 to Nov 30, is expected to keep catastrophe losses modest like last year. This should lead to recovery in underwriting and a lower combined ratio this year.
"
34,WLTW,"Looking at the broader trends, the overall health of the industry, which endured significant pricing pressure and reduced insured exposure since the latest recession, has recently improved riding on a stepped up macro economy. Moreover, learning from past experiences, insurers are now resorting to expense saving measures.
"
35,WLTW,"If insurers manage to overcome the short-term resistance that may be holding back premium rate increase, they should ultimately witness margin expansion and mitigate the adversities of the still low interest rate environment in their investment income. Also, in the absence of federal regulation, insurers can take on new challenges with the ample capital that they now have.
"
36,WLTW,"That said, though the market condition isn’t soft anymore, reasonable hardening is not expected at least in the near term. Moreover, stress on balance sheet, lack of real employment growth and legislative challenges will continue to restrict insurers’ ability to return to the historical growth rate.Zacks Industry Rank
"
37,WLTW,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, insurers are broadly grouped in the Finance sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and are further sub-divided into five industries at the expanded level: Property & Casualty (P&C), Multiline, Accident & Health, Life and Brokers. The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry.We rank all the 260-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
38,WLTW,"As a guideline, the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank #88 and lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
39,WLTW,"The Zacks Industry Rank for Accident & Health is #14, Life is #83, Property & Casualty is #93, Multiline is #192 and Brokers is #194.Earnings Trends
"
40,WLTW,"All companies in the Insurance industry, which is the medium level (or M-level) component of the broader Finance sector, have reported Q2 results. The earnings beat ratio (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) is 68.2%, while the revenue beat ratio stands at 63.6%.
"
41,WLTW,"The broader Finance sector showed a recovery from Q1 in terms of growth. The sector witnessed year-over-year earnings growth of 0.9% compared with a decline of 7.3% in the prior quarter. Revenues also witnessed 2.5% growth compared with a decline of 1% in the prior quarter. For the full year, the sector is expected to witness earnings growth of 2.2% and revenue decline of 6.3%.However, the sector’s Q2 beat ratios for earnings and revenues were impressive at 77.5% and 72.5%, respectively. For a detailed look at the earnings trend for this sector and others, please read our latest Earnings Trends report.Life Insurers Still Struggle: Modest Growth Ahead
"
42,WLTW,"Life insurers managed to increase net income in the last few quarters by trimming underwriting expenses and with the help of a modest increase in premiums. While variable annuity portfolios and other fee-driven businesses will act in favor with equity markets improving, downward pressure on investment yields due to higher hedging costs will continue to mar profitability.
"
43,WLTW,"Moreover, life insurers have been struggling with low interest rates for years, as these primarily invest in long-term interest earnings assets which were not able to generate sufficient returns to match their future commitments related to the policies sold to various individuals.
"
44,WLTW,"Until interest rates increase, which is not expected before 2Q14, life insurers will have to continue to seek alternative asset classes to optimize return from investments. But the addition of any risky asset class in their investment portfolios with the hope of better yield may result in further losses.
"
45,WLTW,"However, with the advent of a higher-rate environment, life insurers will be relieved from the lingering downward pressure on spreads and operating fundamentals. This will lead to higher returns and profit margins.
"
46,WLTW,"The industry’s statutory capital level improved significantly in the last few quarters, with the help of steady retained earnings and effective capital management. A beefed-up capital market should keep the industry’s liquidity profile strong in the upcoming quarters and help industry participants confront challenges.
"
47,WLTW,"Moreover, continued economic recovery and higher disposable income will help life insurers broaden their customer base. Also, the carriers are transforming their products and businesses to make them attractive and profitable for customers.P&C Insurers Look Steady, Growth Momentum Intact
"
48,WLTW,"P&C Insurers have been witnessing improvement across most segments in recent quarters. However, market hardening, which is the key to improvement, appears to have slowed again. After struggling with falling prices for years, the industry witnessed better premium rates in 2013. But the low interest rate environment is again restricting the improvement. The low-rate environment is also putting pressure on the investment portfolios of P&C insurers.
"
49,WLTW,"On the other hand, concerns related to weak capital levels are now things of the past, as the industry’s capital position has been building up on the back of better-than-before earnings. High capital levels and lower-than-normal catastrophe losses are further reining in price hardening.
"
50,WLTW,"While a pause in pricing power improvement and continued pressure on investment income are concerns, capital strength and better preparation to withstand catastrophe-related losses should translate into returns in the upcoming quarters.
"
51,WLTW,"As property-casualty insurers hold about two-thirds of the invested assets in the form of bonds, their capacity is highly sensitive to changes in credit market conditions. With credit and equity markets showing improvement, insurers are likely to incur lesser realized and unrealized capital losses on their portfolios in the quarters ahead.   
"
52,WLTW,"Moreover, insurance volume is expected to expand going forward on speedier economic recovery. With improved employment in the private sector and recovery, though uneven, in the housing markets, a number of carriers have seen growth in insurance sales in the recent quarters.
"
53,WLTW,"Further, the recent quarters have seen a rebound in claims-paying capacity (as measured by policyholders’ surpluses), which reflects the industry’s resilience. Conservative investment strategies and capital restructuring efforts will continue to help property-casualty insurers improve their financial footing in the upcoming quarters.
"
54,WLTW,"Though competition is cropping up both within the primary lines of the P&C space and with reinsurers’ expansion, proactive transformational measures, including adoption of technology solutions, will give a competitive advantage.Also, it appears that the pace of renewal rate growth is slowing with intensifying competition and is expected to remain flat through the remainder of 2014. In order to regain the renewal enthusiasm and meet evolving demands of policyholders, insurers are in the process of product reframing and innovation.OPPORTUNITIES
"
55,WLTW,"The industry has been undertaking several structural changes that will make underwriting and pricing schemes even more attractive to consumers. Also, improving fundamentals on the back of favorable macroeconomic trends make the stocks of a number of industry participants appear attractive.
"
56,WLTW,"We remain positive on Employers Holdings, Inc. (EIG  -  Free Report), Fidelity & Guaranty Life Common (FGL), AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (AFSI), Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd. (ENH), Federated National Holding Company (FNHC), Global Indemnity plc (GBLI) and Mercury General Corporation (MCY) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
"
57,WLTW,"Other insurers that we like with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) include Amerisafe, Inc. (AMSF  -  Free Report), Health Insurance Innovations, Inc. (HIIQ), Lincoln National Corporation (LNC), Protective Life Corporation (PL), AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (AXS), The Hanover Insurance Group Inc. (THG), American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) and Fortegra Financial Corporation (FRF).WEAKNESSES
"
58,WLTW,"We expect continued pressure on investment yield and lower income from the variable annuity business to restrict the earnings growth rate of life insurers at least in the near term. Also, pressure on underwriting gains will hurt the earnings of many property-casualty insurers.
"
59,WLTW,"We would suggest staying away from the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stocks such as Genworth Financial, Inc. (GNW), Universal American Corp (UAM), Meadowbrook Insurance Group Inc. (MIG), Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company (WSH), Markel Corp. (MKL) and Stewart Information Services Corporation (STC).Also, it would be safer to say away from the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stocks including Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings Ltd. (BCRH), Old Republic International Corporation (ORI), Prudential plc (PUK), Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (FNF) and RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report).
