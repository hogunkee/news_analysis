2,DFS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among the nation's biggest banks that got the OK from the Federal Reserve to hike shareholder returns, the second round of the central bank's annual stress tests showed Wednesday.X All 34 banks tested were cleared to do so, but the Fed had reservations about Capital One (COF), which got a conditional pass. The credit card company and American Express (AXP) had to adjust their plans to pass muster.After the test results, banks started announcing richer payouts:The Fed said that it is requiring Capital One to ""to address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices."" Capital One has until Dec. 28 to resubmit its capital plan.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying the Fed did not object to its capital plan, but the bank did not provide specific figures for shareholder returns.""We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in the statement.Other lenders delivering more capital to shareholders:Shares of JPMorgan rallied 2% late after closing up 2% at 89.82 on the stock market today, breaking out past an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base. Bank of America rose 1.4% late after finishing up 2.6% at 23.88, resurfacing above its 50-day average and approaching a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley rose 1.3% late adding to its 0.2% gain to 44.32, still below a 46.08 entry. Citigroup surged 2.3% late, after rising 1.5% earlier. Wells Fargo added 1.4% to its 2.2% gain at the close, while Goldman Sachs edged up 1.2% late, on top of its 1.3% regular-session uptick.IBD'S TAKE: The stress-test results could give bank stocks a jolt after they've been idling in recent months in anticipation of tax reform and regulatory cuts from President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures and determines how much lenders can pay out to shareholders. Banks will likely begin announcing their dividend and buyback plans shortly after the Fed releases the CCAR results.The results come after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a bold vote of confidence for banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the kind seen in 2008 is unlikely ""in our lifetime.""""I think the public can see the capital positions of the major banks are very much stronger this year,"" Yellen said at a conference in London, noting that regulators are more proactive in detecting threats to financial stability than they were a decade ago.The Fed's confidence in the financial system could mean banks may see some relief in the future from the crisis-era measures designed to ensure stability — or at the very least, they may not face tougher rules. But this year's test results are based on economic scenarios the Fed outlined in February.The CCAR test also contains a quantitative portion as well as a qualitative portion, which looks at a bank's internal quality controls. Twenty-one smaller banks this year, however, were exempted from the qualitative part of the CCAR test.The Fed said Wednesday that most of the 13 banks subject to the qualitative portion this year ""have continued to strengthen their capital planning practices since last year."" But it also said that some banks, despite improvements, ""continue to have areas of weaknesses that fall short of meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.""Citigroup in 2014 failed the qualitative portion, and in recent years Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs received ""conditional passes"" and had to resubmit their capital plans. But banks have largely gotten used to the stress tests since they were first instituted in the wake of the financial crisis.They could become easier as the Trump administration looks to shred big parts of Dodd-Frank financial regulations and fill open positions at the Fed and regulatory agencies.The Fed over the years has tried to balance banks' demands for more testing transparency and its efforts to make the tests matter. The Fed worries that giving banks too much information would make the tests too easy to pass.Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, also floated the idea of requiring fewer banks to take the tests.""We believe that future stress tests will also become easier, and the possibility of banks being exempted from the process or not having qualitative reviews for all banks remains open and possible,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note dated Friday.RELATED:Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

6,DFS,"The higher swipe fees American Express (AXP) charges merchants compared to some rivals will remain intact, after the Supreme Court on Monday threw out a lawsuit alleging the credit-card company stifled competition by barring merchants from encouraging customers to use cards that carry lower merchant fees.XThe court ruled 5-4 in favor of American Express, saying that the company's so-called ""anti-steering"" provisions didn't violate U.S. antitrust law. The decision could bolster American Express' financials, as credit card issuers, payment processors, banks and tech companies race to attract wealthier customers and adapt to a more mobile, electronic payments landscape.American Express closed up 1.35% at 98.54 in the stock market today. Rivals Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) both slid, falling 3.25% and 3.2%, respectively. Both Visa and Mastercard were testing support at their 50-day lines.Discover Financial Services (DFS) fell 1.5%, touching its 200-day line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe plaintiffs — Ohio and a handful of other states — argued that American Express' rules resulted in merchants having to pay higher swipe fees, which, in turn, were inherited by customers. AmEx said, basically, that they didn't.Here are five takeaways from the court's ruling:Businesses have to stomach swipe fees like those from AmEx when customers use credit cards to buy things. Thus, they sometimes try to discourage, or ""steer,"" customers away from using cards that carry higher merchant fees. When a shop takes American Express, they typically agree to the card issuer's antisteering provisions.AmEx has been doing stuff like this since the 1950s. But Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote for the majority, said that the plaintiffs' case failed to show AmEx's practices harmed competition.He also said their case failed to grasp the balancing act of who pays what on either side of a credit-card transaction. And he argued that when defining the credit card market, it should include both merchants and cardholders. He said the primary product of credit-card companies was transactions, rather than merchant services. Thus, ""the competitive effects of a restraint on transactions cannot be judged by looking at merchants alone.""""Evidence of a price increase on one side of a two-sided transaction platform cannot, by itself, demonstrate an anticompetitive exercise of market power,"" he wrote.Thomas said that instead, the plaintiffs needed to prove that American Express' anti-steering provisions raised the cost of credit-card transactions ""above a competitive level"" or reduced the number of credit-card transactions.Thomas also wrote that Visa and Mastercard have ""significant structural advantages"" over American Express. Thomas said that Visa and Mastercard accounted for more than 432 million cards in circulation in the U.S., while AmEx had only 53 million and that fewer locations accepted it.He also said that Visa and Mastercard get half their sales by collecting interest. American Express, conversely, gets most of its sales from merchant fees, and focuses more on rewards catered toward wealthier cardholders.""Amex's increased merchant fees reflect increases in the value of its services and the cost of its transactions, not an ability to charge above a competitive price,"" he continued.""It uses higher merchant fees to offer its cardholders a more robust rewards program, which is necessary to maintain cardholder loyalty and encourage the level of spending that makes it valuable to merchants.""Nomura analyst Bill Carcache, in a research note on Monday, said that a ruling against AmEx would be unlikely to cause significant damage to the company.He also said that AmEx's discount rates weren't much higher than other premium Visa and Mastercard cards, indicating that businesses wouldn't gain that much from discouraging customers from using their AmEx cards.""Although we never expected a negative fundamental impact on AXP's business even if the ruling went against it ... putting this issue in the rearview removes an overhang and is incrementally positive for the stock, in our view,"" he wrote.CFRA analyst Chris Kuiper appeared to agree.""We think this bolsters AXP's competitive positioning against rivals and removes a potential negative catalyst in the near term that may have been weighing on shares.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:PayPal Buddies Up To Visa, Mastercard — And New Accounts Roll InIBD Stock Of The Day: Online Payment Leader PayPal Hits Buy ZoneIBD Stock Of The Day Is One Of Several Payment Processors In Buy ZonesSquare Moves Into Buy Zone, Leading Italy-Resistant Financials

9,DFS,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.""Companies with businesses that are primarily domestic-focused tend to have higher tax rates on average. Similarly, small-cap stocks, which are generally more U.S.-centric, could see strong earnings revisions,"" wrote William O'Neil chief investment strategist Randy Watts and senior equity analyst Romeo Alvarez. Among S&P 500 sectors, ""Energy currently has the highest corporate tax rate and would see major relief.""The data show Marathon Oil (MRO) with a 49.9% effective tax rate and ConocoPhillips (COP) paying a 46.9% rate.Energy stocks were big winners Thursday. Conoco Philips jumped 3%, nearly breaking out to a buy zone on the stock market today. Marathon Oil was among the many energy stocks moving toward entry points. Diamondback Energy (FANG) did blast out into buy range in strong volume.CVS Health (CVS) has a 38.9% effective tax rate, tops among consumer staples companies, according to William O'Neil data. Aetna (AET), another high-tax company, is being acquired by CVS as it braces for the entry of Amazon.com into the retail prescription business. CEO Larry Merlo said recently that CVS would take some of its tax windfall and reinvest it in reconfiguring its stores to provide more health services.RELATED:6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechHere's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Will Boost Profits At These Banking GiantsFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market Leadership

11,DFS,"The Supreme Court next year will hear arguments for a case in which 11 states accused American Express (AXP) of harming competition by barring businesses from encouraging customers to buy things with rival credit cards that charge merchants lower fees.XThe court's decision comes ahead of the card issuer's third-quarter earnings, which are set for Wednesday. The matter could be a subject for discussion during the company's earnings call.Shares of AmEx finished 1% lower at 91.96 in the stock market today but remain extended above their buy zone. Visa (V) dipped 0.3% and Mastercard (MA) lost 0.8%, while Discover Financial Services (DFS) rose 2.3% and Capital One Financial (COF) added 1.8%.The hearing would take place several years after the U.S. and a coalition of states first sued American Express, Visa and Mastercard over those actions.In 2010, the states and the government alleged in a lawsuit that the credit-card companies' ""anti-steering"" rules restricted trade. Those anti-steering rules prevent merchants from pushing customers toward using lower-fee cards when the businesses agreed to take the bigger cards.Visa and Mastercard agreed to end their anti-steering arrangements. AmEx, at that time, didn't.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.A district court later found the anti-steering rules hurt competition.  An appeals court last year overturned that ruling.Meanwhile, AmEx reports quarterly results on Wednesday, and Wall Street expects EPS to jump 19% to $1.48 on revenue of $8.32 billion, up 7%.The results come as the card industry tries to entice wealthier, younger consumers with premium cards such as American Express Platinum.RELATED:American Express Earns Relative Strength Rating Upgrade; Hits Key BenchmarkShopping Around For A Luxury Credit Card?

13,DFS,"Credit-card issuer American Express (AXP) reported mixed fourth-quarter results after the close Thursday and gave strong guidance.Estimates: A 20% earnings-per-share drop to 98 cents, with revenue down 5% to $7.949 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS of 91 cents on revenue of $8.02 billion. Provisions for losses rose 9% to $625 million.Outlook: Full-year 2017 EPS of $5.60-$5.80, with the midpoint above consensus estimates for $5.61""We continued to grow our lending portfolio faster than the market while maintaining industry-leading credit metrics. We acquired over 10 million new cards globally last year, and we added more than a million new merchants to our network in the United States alone,"" Chairman and CEO Kenneth Chenault said in a statement.Stock: American Express fell 0.8% late. Shares closed down 1% at 76.69 on the stock market today. Visa (V) dipped 0.15% after finishing 0.2% higher at 81.73, closing in on an 84.06 buy point, while MasterCard (MA) was flat late, but ended 0.1% lower at 108.53, after clearing a 109.03 entry earlier in the day before reversing lower.Last year, American Express' partnership with Costco (COST) ended as the warehouse membership giant switched allegiances to Citigroup (C) and Visa. The strong dollar and low gas prices have also weighed on American Express.Q4 marked the second straight quarter of lower EPS, with further declines seen in Q1 and Q2, until comparisons ease as American Express laps the end of its Costco partnership.Adjusted for the Costco business, currency swings and interest expense, American Express said Q4 revenue rose 6%.IBD'S TAKE: Within the S&P 500, banks are among the few stocks that can benefit when interest rates go up.As with other financial institutions, shares of American Express have risen after the election on the prospect that the new Trump administration would usher in economic growth and higher interest rates.Banks that issue credit cards, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC), carry customers' balances and stand to earn more income from interest payments as rates rise.Likewise, American Express, Capital One Financial (COF) and Discover Financial (DFS) also carry balances, and shares in those companies shot up along with those of banks. Visa and MasterCard, however, make their money from transaction fees.RELATED:American Express, Lam Research Guide High; eBay Guides LowVisa Fiscal Q4 Earnings, Revenue Beat But Outlook Light

Visa (V) touched a new high in above average volume and then retreated. The stock clung to a 0.1% gain after being up almost 1%.American Express (AXP) popped 1% to 66 in below-average volume. The stock is trying to clear a 66.35 buy point in a double-bottom-with-handle base. American Express was one of the day's top gainers in the blue chip Dow in midday action.MasterCard (MA) retook its short term, 10-day line as the stock closed in on a 97.24 handle buy point. Discover Financial Services (DFS) tried to clear a consolidation.Among top-rated stocks, those hitting new highs included chip equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT), software company Ebix (EBIX), chip designer Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and auto salvage auction operator Copart (CPRT).On the downside, J.M.

15,DFS,"A digital crook needs only $70 for an encoder available on Amazon.com (AMZN) to ransack your Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) or American Express (AXP) credit card -- unless you're armed with a chip-and-pin card, says Mark Lanterman of forensic analysis firm Computer Forensic Services.There were 400 million EMV cards -- aka chip-and-pin cards -- in U.S. circulation by the end of 2015, but that's merely 8% of 4.8 billion EMV cards worldwide, according to EMVCo.com. Both figures are rising as EMV cards are protected by end-to-end encryption, reducing fraudulent transactions.Like Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Wallet, EMV cards represent a major security advance from the magnetic stripe cards that remain prevalent in the U.S., Lanterman, Computer Forensic's chief technology officer, told IBD.Magnetic stripes carry personal information and can be counterfeited. EMV cards -- the initials stand for credit card giants Europay, MasterCard and Visa, though many other cards are in the fold -- encrypt information on the chip and use a six-digit ""token"" that changes with every transaction.EMV is your best security bet, says Lanterman, and despite some persistent resistance, the U.S. is picking up the pace in user adoption and improved technology.In the days of Target's (TGT) 40 million-card breach in 2013, most transaction encryption took place on the point-of-sale terminal. In the Target case, hackers breached its POS system and then stole tens of millions of card numbers. With chip-and-pin cards, that can't happen, assuming the encryption is property configured.""Now, the encryption is taking place from that chip all the way to the bank,"" Lanterman said. ""It's point to point. There's no millisecond on the screen, and then it's encrypted. (The account number) is always encrypted.""Chip-and-pin cards reduced Visa's U.S. counterfeit fraud by 26% in January vs. a year earlier, says Stephanie Erickson, vice president of risk products for the credit card giant. It would have cut it even further if more EMV chip cards were in use compared to magnetic stripe cards. As of May, 53% of Visa credit cards and 35% of debit cards were backed by EMV technology, she told IBD.The U.S., though, continues to face not only adoption hurdles, but also technology issues, Lanterman said. Of 10 EMV cards he recently tested, he says he was able to bust into eight. He says the problem with those eight is likely that they weren't properly configured by the card-issuing banks, which clear all transactions on their cards. (More on this below.)Some retailers resist moving to the technology because of the time and cost of getting new card terminals and getting the certification they need from each credit card network.""The technology has great potential,"" Lanterman said, ""but we need to get more retailers on board.""Europe leads in adopting EMV, according to EMVCo.com, an entity set up by its six member organizations -- AmEx, Discover (DFS), Japan's JCB, MasterCard, China's UnionPay and Visa -- and supported by dozens of banks, merchants and others in the payments industry.As of last year, Europe's two zones -- roughly Western and Eastern Europe -- had deployed more than 1 billion EMV cards and boasted 84.3% and 52.3% adoption rates, respectively. In Western Europe, EMV cards accounted for more than 96% of card-present payments -- payments in which the cardholder is physically present along with the card at the point of purchase, such as at retail checkouts.Globally, 35.8% of all card-present transaction in 2015 used EMV tech, up from 32% in 2014. In the U.S., chip-card adoption jumped to 26.4% in 2015, up from just 7.3% in 2014.The U.S. was late to the EMV game in part because the need was less urgent here. Visa's Erickson says the U.S. lagged in EMV because it leads in sophisticated, predictive analytics that help financial institutions detect suspicious or fraudulent card transactions. Other countries had more motivation to move faster to chip-and-pin cards to bolster authentication efforts.Now, the two approaches are converging, she says.""They moved to chip technology to help provide some enhanced authentication and protection against counterfeit, knowing they were doing a deferred transmission of that transaction,"" she said. ""In the U.S., we're adding this chip cryptogram with this one-time code to provide better protection against counterfeit.""As of June, Visa counted 302 million EMV cards in circulation in the U.S. -- 145.7 million credit cards and 156.2 million debit cards -- with 1.2 million merchant locations accepting them. About 23,000 to 25,000 new retail locations come online weekly, Erickson says.Credit cards are the preferred payment method for international travelers and therefore have a head start on debit cards in the U.S., she said.In the meantime, the credit card companies are pushing EMV adoption. In October 2015, Visa changed its liability policy. Now, the bank isn't liable if a customer using one of its chip-and-pin card is hacked, but merchants that haven't installed EMV card readers will be liable, she said.""The liability shifted to the party that had not invested in the chip,"" she said. In October 2017, that policy will extend to fuel pumps and ATMs, adding more incentive to move to EMV tech.So far, say the experts, chip-and-pin cards have proved impossible to counterfeit. And, in any case, the six-digit tokens change for every transaction, so it is useless to hackers, says Erickson. Still, magnetic stripe cards far outnumber their EMV counterparts in the U.S.""The U.S. is the largest market,"" Erickson said, ""but in terms of the percentage of our spending, the U.S. is still in its early days.""Last summer, a Visa poll found that 70% of cardholders had at least one chip-and-pin card in their wallets. The U.S. has made strides, just not enough, says Computer Forensic's Lanterman. He sees the country three years out from real headway in displacing magnetic stripe payments.And ""as long as magnetic stripe cards are accepted, credit card fraud will still be committed,"" he said.But improper configuration, not any fault of users, is another hurdle. When he tested the 10 cards, it was at the behest of a news crew in Minneapolis, where he's based. Lanterman attempted to steal personal information from 10 chip-and-pin cards -- a relative impossibility if they had been encrypted properly at the chip. But as mentioned above, he was able to break into eight.""The two that I could not get were from large, national banks,"" he said. ""I could not steal those numbers. I think the banks outsmarted me and were implementing end-to-end encryption correctly.""Armed with Lanterman's skill, a crook could get a customer's name and account number through a hole in the encryption. Properly configured EMV cards are encrypted from the chip all the way through the processing bank. But eight of those cards had a fissure somewhere in the encryption, he says.Properly configured chip-and-pin card are as secure as Apple Pay and Google Wallet, Lanterman says. He calls the mobile wallet ""brilliant."" Despite popular belief, mobile payment applications don't store a user's actual account number. Like EMV, that account number is tokenized, and a token is worthless to hackers.""The best anyone can do is get a fake number they can't use, because the approval code is a one-off,"" he said. ""It's worthless.""So, fairly solid security in card-present payments is close, though it will be years before EMV tech reaches all of America's mom-and-pop shops.""Small credit unions don't have the resources to configure the technology correctly,"" Lanterman said. ""Issuers need to educate consumers, retailers and local financial institutions. (Broad adoption) will take buy-in from all three.""

Analysts see revenue growth of 19.6%.Stock: Shares of Visa were down 1.1% late after closing 1% higher at 83.20 on the stock market today. The stock this month has found support at its 50-day line and is still in buy zone after breaking out from a flat base last month.MasterCard (MA) gave up fractional gains late after finishing up 0.3%. It also remains in buy territory following a September breakout. American Express (AXP), which reported strong results and guidance last week, closed down 0.4% at 67.09 but is still back above its 50- and 200-day averages. Discover Financial (DFS) rose 1.9% as it works its way through a flat base.Visa's results will follow a partnership with PayPal (PYPL) announced in July that is intended to expand consumers' payment options by sharing a variety of resources. Analysts will likely be seeking more detail about the partnership, and there was some debate over which company benefited more after the two announced the agreement.Among other conditions, PayPal ""will make it easier for new and existing customers to choose to pay with their Visa cards"" under the deal, the companies said in July. The electronic-payments giant would also get access to Visa's token and other digital services, in turn enhancing transaction security and expanding ""acceptance for PayPal's digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are enabled.""The deal would also allow customers to immediately withdraw money and move it to their bank account from their PayPal and Venmo accounts via Visa Direct, the companies said.PayPal and MasterCard announced a similar agreement last month.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal's partnerships with Visa and MasterCard are the latest among many struck by the company. Analysts say such partnerships, including ones with Facebook and China's Alibaba, could bring more upside. Earlier Monday, Visa and Intel (INTC) said they would work together to develop stronger payment security for connected devices. That announcement comes after hackers allegedly used connected devices to deliver a massively distributed denial-of-service attack that hamstrung Internet service in much of the U.S. on Friday.Shares of Intel rose 0.3%.

21,DFS,"U.S. stock indexes struggled to stay positive Thursday afternoon, while small caps led for a second straight day.The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 hovered near the break-even line, and the Dow Jones industrial average edged 0.1% lower. But the small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.3%. Volume in the stock market today was running slightly lower than the previous session's pace.Blue chips were mostly up, but only narrowly so. Visa (V) popped 1.1%, the day's top gainer in the 30-stock Dow industrials. Visa is sketching a somewhat unorthodox, double-bottom base with handle. The middle peak is only 2 cents below the left-side high. Normally the middle peak is further below the left-side high. A handle with an 80.27 buy point might provide a better entry.Other payment processors show similar chart action. MasterCard (MA) could be seen as a flat base or as a double bottom with handle. The middle peak entry would be at 98.09 (best seen on the daily chart). The handle, which looks like it will complete the five-day minimum requirement today, could offer an entry at 96.60.Discover Financial Services (DFS) has etched a flat base with a potential entry at 58.20.The problem with all three of these stocks is that none have top-notch ratings. Wall Street expects Visa's earnings to rise 6% this fiscal year ending in September. For MasterCard and Discover, earnings are estimated at 5% and 12%, respectively, in the current calendar year.So why are these stocks stirring? Wall Street expects turnarounds for Visa and MasterCard in 2017. Earnings next year are expected to jump 19% for Visa and 16% for MasterCard. That is good growth for two mega-cap stocks. (Discover, which is smaller, is expected to grow earnings only 6% in 2017.)In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, winners for the day led losers by a 2-1 ratio. Stocks striking new highs included invisible braces provider Align Technology (ALGN) and telecom infrastructure stock Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT).

Consolidated passenger unit revenue fell 6.6% due to the strong dollar, weaker travel demand, competition and weaker demand for pricier airfare, among other factors, the company said.The carrier also forecast 1%-1.5% capacity growth for the year, down from a forecast given in April of 1%-2%. For Q3, United expects capacity to grow 1.5%-2.5% and consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall 5.5%-7.5%.Airlines face the prospect of higher fuel costs cutting into profit and concerns that expansion and lower airfares in some competitive markets are hurting financial results.United Airlines stock rose in early after-hours action but reversed lower to trade down 0.7%, despite unveiling a $2 billion share-repurchase program. Shares closed 0.3% higher at 47.85.Estimates: Q2 EPS of $1.42, up 7% from a year earlier, on revenue of $2.227 billion, up 2%.Results: EPS rose 10.5% to $1.47, beating by 3 cents. Net revenue was $2.216 billion, just below views. Total loans rose 4%. Thirty-day-plus delinquency and net charge-off rates inched up during the quarter.While concerns persist about consumer borrowing reaching more fragile heights, banks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) reported solid borrower-credit quality.Discover Financial stock fell 0.8% late. Shares closed down 0.2% to 56.98.IBD'S TAKE: Discover Financial is close to a buy point of 58.20, which would be the highest since late July 2015. Discover Financial has been meeting resistance in recent days as it approaches a breakout from a bullish consolidation. Investors should do a thorough review of a company's fundamentals and technicals before considering any buys. You can take a detailed look at Discover at IBD Stock Checkup.Estimates: Q2 EPS of $4.97, up 9%, with sales increasing 9% to $640.69 million.

23,DFS,"ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund (SBLGX) makes a habit of staying on top. The now-$3.5 billion portfolio's 15.72% average annual return over the five years ended July 29 ranked No. 5 among all large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.It was also in the top 3% and top 5% among its direct rivals over the past 12 months and three years.How does the fund do it? Co-manager Peter Bourbeau, who has been at the helm since July 15, 2009, says he and Margaret Vitrano -- co-manager since Oct. 11, 2012 -- stick to a few techniques, including investing in just their best ideas and investing in not one but several types of growth stocks.The results speak loud and clear. Their fund was in the top 33% of all U.S. diversified stock mutual funds last month. And their track record has made them an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner. The fund outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Forty-eight-year-old Bourbeau, who is based in Manhattan, spoke with IBD about his investment approach, while he was on the road in Nashville, Tenn.IBD: Peter, you hold three types of growth stocks: cyclical, stable and what you call select. Why not just focus on one?Bourbeau: We believe different types of growth companies will perform better at various stages of a market cycle. We seek to deliver solid performance through the full cycle by owning a diversified portfolio of growth companies which we divide into three categories of growth stocks or buckets: stable, cyclical and select.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe select bucket of growth stocks -- which has about 35% of our assets -- are elite growers with disruptive technologies or business models. These are growing earnings at a double-digit rate. We base our growth projections on the size of the addressable market. Facebook (FB), for instance, will only invest in new opportunities that represent 1 billion or more potential users. These companies often look expensive because many of them, like Amazon (AMZN) with aggressive capital spending on its web services business, invest heavily to support future growth. This focus on long-term value creation tends to make them volatile.The stable bucket has about 50% to 65% of our assets. These are stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Microsoft (MSFT). They are industry-leading companies that are growing earnings slightly above average on a very consistent basis. It's this long-term compounding of earnings and cash flows which gives these companies so many options to create shareholder value such as stock buybacks, acquisitions or dividend payments.Comcast (CMCSA), for example, recently announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation (DWA). Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) last year purchased SABMiller. Disney (DIS) has the cash to expand its theme parks globally with the opening of a park in Shanghai.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceOur cyclical-stocks bucket has companies whose revenue or profits are depressed for reasons that we think are fixable. Cyclical growers maintain the growth characteristics that we look for, but have issues with a visible inflection point. As patient, long-term investors, we can take advantage of price dislocations caused by near-term headwinds to establish new positions or dollar cost average into existing positions at attractive valuations.Schlumberger (SLB) and Grainger (GWW) are two. American Express (AXP) has faced revenue pressure on the top end by (JPMorgan) Chase (JPM) and Visa (V), and on the bottom by Capital One (COF) and Discover (DFS).IBD: And why do you prefer to be concentrated?Bourbeau: We usually have 40 to 50 names. We're around 47 now. We have 15% annual turnover, so we hold for eight to 10 years on average.We're concentrated because we're looking for the No. 1 leader in a market. Those companies have the highest margins, best free cash flow. They take over weaker companies. They become bigger and more powerful, harder to compete with. They have visionary men and women. Great companies remain great for a long time. Who needs the No. 2 or 3 company?IBD: Give me an example, please, as of your latest disclosure.Bourbeau: Sure. Schlumberger's rivals include Halliburton (HAL) (in oilfield services) and Baker Hughes (BHI) (in oil & gas machinery). But Schlumberger is three times bigger than Halliburton (in terms of market capitalization), its nearest rival in oil field services. (And more than five times the size of Baker Hughes.) It is by far the leader in products, distribution, margins. It is the favorite partner of exploration and production companies and integrated multinationals.IBD: What's your Facebook thesis?Bourbeau: Its rare business model takes advantage of the move of advertising from old media to new and to mobile from the desktop.They bought WhatsApp, they've got Messenger, they've got Instagram. And look at what they've done with video. They're building apps for billions of users as opposed to some of their smaller competitors.If you're an advertiser, you're getting targeting that you never had before. It can be refined down to age, demographic, gender, likes and dislikes. Your ads' effectiveness goes higher. And Facebook is just beginning this movement.IBD: Is Amazon the same -- one innovation building on another?Bourbeau: You're frustrated as investors, seeing huge ramp-ups in capital expenditures. But you know they're also seeing opportunities that we mere mortals could never see. Amazon Web Services started as a pet project for their retail operation. They built an infrastructure that they used maybe one month a year, then they wondered how to use it the rest of the year, and it grew 50%, 60%, 70%. They created an industry, renting software vs. buying it, which (Amazon founder and CEO) Jeff Bezos says will be bigger than retail.What's next? We don't know. Logistics? Moving packages around the world? Not all of their innovations will work. And we're aware of stretched valuations. But an innovative company with $10 billion in free cash flow gives us no reason to be alarmed.IBD: You boosted your stake in VMware (VMW) not long ago. Why?Bourbeau: This is another innovative company that created an entire business, which is server virtualization. Now, that's the mature part of their business. They still have a massive lead, but that will erode over time.They have another suite of products. And creating an easy user experience to a hybrid cloud is something they're going to have a leadership position in. They made acquisitions in network virtualization. One was Nicira (in 2012). They've got deployment to paying customers. The value proposition vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is early, but if it works it will be a massive home run.To be balanced, the Dell acquisition (of EMC (EMC), which owns a stake in VMware) was unfortunate. Structuring the deal with tracking stock (that mimicked shares of VMware) punished equity in VMware and made a messy transition. But we're finally toward the tail end of that. VMware will operate as a public company.It has double-digit free cash flow yield. It is a very cheap asset. They've got a huge buyback in place. It is a name we continue to like.IBD: Another position you've boosted is Xilinx (XLNX). Why?Bourbeau: This is an interesting company. They don't own their own manufacturing. They design intricate, high-power chips for very particular applications like cell towers, moving massive data, programmable logic device (PLD) chips that can handle enormous amounts of instructions and can change instructions on a chip remotely.They're used in defense. There are 17 PLD chips in the Mercedes S-class cars. And the fact that they don't manufacture them means this is almost a software company in terms of margins. Lastly, this was a duopoly. But Intel (INTC) bought Altera, so Xilinx could be an acquisition target down the road, not that's that what we're playing for.IBD: Cyclicals that you like or added to recently -- American Express, Schlumberger, VMWare, Xilinx: only VMWare has average growth of 10% or faster in the last three and five years. Only Schlumberger has expected earnings north of 10% in 2017. Do these companies need faster growth to get their stocks moving? When will that happen?Bourbeau: Growth rates are not the main criteria with cyclical stocks. We target an inflection point for each. If reached, it should cause earnings to normalize and stock valuation to increase.Here are their inflection points. For SLB, they include crude oil prices reaching supply-demand equilibrium and global production ramping up. Also, 65% incremental margins, which is a lot higher than any other recovery. For AXP: normalization of business post Costco (which no longer accepts AmEx cards). Normal earnings growth rate should return in 2017. XLNX: product cycle and further application penetration as well as market share gains. VMW: we don't have a comment.IBD: How do you and Margaret Vitrano divide duties, running this fund?Bourbeau: We don't divide up the portfolio. We're devoted to the same process. But we each have a slight bias in our knowledge bases. Margaret, given her consumer discretionary and technology background, has different experiences from my health care and financials background. But when we look at companies, we're on the same calls at the same time. Our different backgrounds helps us fact-check each other.IBD: And who was your mentor, Peter?Bourbeau: The first was Richie Freeman, who has run ClearBridge Aggressive Growth (SHRAX) (since 1983, and whose co-manager now is Evan Bauman). We talk every day. He's just down the hall. We're constantly talking ideas, sports.But our portfolio construction is now a little different. Richie's turnover is zero. When he's comfortable with a name, he's on it forever. Margaret and I are more disciplined in valuation. Our turnover is 15%, which makes Richie's fund look like a hedge fund.If you look at sectors, Richie and Evan are eclectic. Richie is more likely to have zero in a given sector if he doesn't like it. That's not how Margaret and I look at the world. We have industrials, media (and something in every sector). And Richie can have significant overweights. And he is more all-market-capitalizations. Margaret and I are more large cap.

24,DFS,"U.S. stocks rolled Tuesday morning, with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting a record high, although bulls and bears each found news to boost their convictions.The Dow industrials rose to 18353 soon after the opening bell, just eclipsing its May 2015 peak. The blue-chip index has settled to a 0.5% gain at 18319, led by Goldman Sachs (GS). The S&P 500, which set a record mark Monday, advanced 0.6% intraday. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.65%. The small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.9% gain. Early volume was running sharply higher vs. Monday's levels.BlackRock analysts offered a gloomy perspective. Reuters reported that the world's largest asset manager sees Britain falling into a recession over the coming year. On June 23, Britain voted to leave the European union.However, back in the States, a small-business gauge signaled optimism on the U.S. economy. The National Federation of Independent Business' small-business optimism index for June ticked up to 94.5, topping Wall Street's consensus number, as well as the highest estimate in the range. The survey includes hiring plans, capital outlay plans, plans to increase or decrease inventories, views on the overall economy and profit trends. The gauge is considered important because small businesses create most new jobs.Blue chips were mostly higher. On the Dow, the top gainers included Goldman Sachs, up 2.6%, and American Express (AXP), up more than 1%.Other credit card payment processors, such as Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and Discover Financial Services (DFS) also rose.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, winners led losers by a better than 3-to-1 ratio.In the commodities markets, West Texas Intermediate crude oil gained nearly 2% to just under $46 a barrel.

But GE rose 2% to 30.44.While Synchrony said it expected some level of weakness and that its loss rate was ""at historically low levels,"" the announcement came amid growing anxiety about consumer debt.""The consumer's ability to cure themselves when they get into those later due stages has been challenged,"" CFO Brian Doubles said at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference in New York on Tuesday. ""It's been challenged all year.""And as auto loans grow, so have warnings about potentially higher delinquencies. Other analysts have said banks are running out of higher-quality borrowers to target, forcing them to reach for less reliable ones.Meanwhile, Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), which do not issue credit cards but act as the middleman between businesses and banks, were less affected. Visa inched up 0.2% to 78.57, while Mastercard eased less than 0.1% to 94.11.Top banks, which issues cards, also sold off, though ""Brexit"" fears have been weighing on financial stocks. Bank of America (BAC) fell 2.5% to 13.26, Citigroup (C) lost 2.8% to 41.96, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was down 1.9% to 62.08, and Wells Fargo (WFC) surrendered 2.3% to 46.88.
"
63,DFS,"Median shareholder payout from many of the biggest U.S. banks could rise to as much as 77% of earnings from 68% last year if their dividend-and-buyback plans pass the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, analysts say, with money centers like JPMorgan (JPM) and credit-card banks American Express (AXP) potentially leading the returns.And banks' finances are generally seen holding up when the Federal Reserve on Thursday reports the first results of the tests, in which the Fed analyzes how well 33 banks' capital cushions could absorb shocks to the market and their finances. In the second round of evaluations, released on June 29, the Fed not only evaluates whether banks' finances pass muster amid broader economic turmoil but also whether their plans to return money to shareholders would be justified as a result, potentially restraining their ability to repurchase shares or hike dividends.Those passing grades would come despite a volatile market over the past year, rising consumer debt and tougher testing standards. In January, the Fed asked banks to assess how they would handle an economy with 10% unemployment and negative interest rates on short-term U.S. government bonds -- stricter criteria than in years past. Banks responded with their plans in April.But analysts feel that the banks are on solid enough footing today to withstand those rigors -- after Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan had to modify their capital return plans to pass the tests last year.""More broadly, we see limited downside risk given that nearly all of the companies under coverage have seen material improvement in capital ratios"" since the previous tests, Buckingham Research analyst James Mitchell said in a note Monday.The big money-center banks -- like JPMorgan, Citigroup, BofA and Wells Fargo -- ""are probably in the best capital shape that they have been since the financial crisis,"" Portales Partners said this month in a research note, which predicted that such banks would turn out the biggest shareholder returns.""I'd be surprised if any of the big four had a big hiccup this year,"" Morningstar analyst Dan Werner told IBD, referring to JPMorgan, Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America.Portales predicted that on average, roughly half of earnings this year and next from those banks would come back to shareholders in the form of buyback programs and dividends.Those increases would be in part driven by low payouts last year and an improved capital buffer, Mitchell said. He also said those big banks would see a bigger payout increase, 20%-44% as measured in dollars, than any other kind of bank Buckingham covers.Credit-card banks like Capital One (COF), Discover (DFS), and American Express (AXP), were also likely to ""enjoy above industry average payouts"" over the next year, Portales said.""It's surprising the credit-card banks have been more resilient, even with the large consumer losses that they predict and that they model,"" Werner said. ""I think the capital levels at those banks have generally been stronger, just because of the nature of the business.""But beyond JPMorgan and the credit-card banks, the picture for potential returns is less clear.On one hand, Buckingham Research said Monday that Morgan Stanley had tremendous potential for ""upside surprise,"" citing in part its move away from volatile fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading. Credit Suisse on Monday also said Morgan was among those best positioned to return a high percentage of its capital.However, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods remained cautious on Morgan, after the bank had to modify its capital plan last year. Portales analyst Paul Gulberg told IBD that investment banks Morgan, along with Goldman Sachs, were more exposed to the U.K.'s potential decision to leave the EU and other world market chaos, and could ""get hurt a little bit.""Coincidentally, the U.K.'s referendum on leaving the EU also takes place Thursday. Analysts have warned that a so-called 'Brexit' could roil the financial landscape in Europe and reverberate into U.S.-based banks. Some U.S. banks detailed what effect Brexit would have on them in their stress-test responses, the Financial Times reported this week.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods has also warned that post-stress-test payouts could be topping out.""Overall, payouts are near the upper end of what we believe is the long-term range of 70% to 80% of earnings over the CCAR cycle for the median bank,"" the firm said in a note last month, referring to the second round of testing, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.Payouts this year could also be affected by proposed adjustments to the stress tests' methodology in the future.Federal Reserve governors this month said some large banks could have to set more money aside to pass stress tests down the road. Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke said in a note that while those new requirements might not take hold until 2018, payout ratios could be affected as soon as this year.""The Fed has done its best to not be so predictable with its models,"" Werner said. ""It sounds like it's a little bit of a cat and mouse game – they don't want to banks gaming the models, but at the same time the banks are trying their best to get a more predictable result.""JPMorgan and Wells Fargo rose about 2% on the stock market today on optimism about the Brexit vote as well as the stress tests. Citigroup climbed more than 4% while Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs advanced more than 3%. American Express, Capital One and Discover Financial rose roughly 2%.

64,DFS,"Stocks held losses in afternoon trading Tuesday, as American Express (AXP) weighed on the Dow, and Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger (RGR) reversed lower.The Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.7%, the S&P 500 fell 0.6% and the Nasdaq gave up 0.5%. Volume was mixed, running higher on the NYSE but slightly lower on the Nasdaq. U.S. stocks have been following European bourses lower amid fears that Britain will exit the European Union and ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting results due Wednesday.Gold miners, steel and financial stocks were among the biggest losers in the stock market today, while food, beverage and utility stocks edged higher.American Express led the Dow industrials lower with a 5% drop in heavy volume. Shares are now well below their 200-day and 50-day moving average lines. The drop may be in sympathy with Synchrony Financial (SYF), which plunged 16% after the private-label credit card provider forecast net charge-off rates to rise 20 to 30 basis points. That implies more customers are late on payments.Other credit card issuers and payment processors getting hit included Capital One Financial (COF), down more than 7%, and Discover Financial Services (DFS), which fell over 4%, both in hefty turnover.Smith & Wesson fell 5% to below its 200-day line after a sharp downward reversal. Shares spiked 7% Monday in the wake of Sunday's mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub. Analysts expect the firearms maker to post a 23% increase in fiscal Q4 earnings per share on 18.5% higher sales to $214.55 million when it reports Thursday.Sturm Ruger, which gapped up and surged 8.5% Monday, also reversed lower and was down nearly 4%.

65,DFS,"Stocks wobbled in and out of mixed territory Wednesday morning, as earnings news, a rising dollar and a pullback in oil prices combined to pressure equities.The Nasdaq managed a 0.1% gain and the Dow held just below the 0.1% mark. The S&P 500 struggled against narrow losses.The stock market today moved in quiet volume. Trade slowed 4% on the NYSE and was down 8% on the Nasdaq, vs. action at the same time Tuesday.Homebuilder stocks traded lower, despite a better-than-expected reading on existing-home sales for March. The National Association of Realtors reported sales rose to an annualized rate of 5.33 million, up from 5.07 million in February and above projections for a sales pace of 5.268 million.The Dow felt the pull of undertow from Boeing (BA) and Coca-Cola (KO). Boeing thumped out a 3% loss after Bank of America downgraded the stock to neutral from underperform. Coke shed nearly 4% after its Q1 earnings, and revenue fell slightly less than consensus forecasts, but weakness in international markets left volume flat.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and American Express (AXP) led the index, up a bit more than 1% each.Check Point Software (CHKP) dropped 4% in heavy trade after earnings sneaked past consensus expectations, revenue just met views and management gave Q2 earnings guidance near the low end of the consensus range. The stock pared losses after finding support at its 50-day moving average. The dive cut 6% below an 88.08 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Discover Financial (DFS) and St. Jude Medical (STJ) led the S&P 500, surging 7% and 4%, respectively, after healthy Q1 reports. Discover's powerful volume gain lifted it well up the right side of a five-month cup base, easily clearing its 200-day moving average and putting shares within 3% of a 58.18 buy point.St. Jude is up 25% from a mid-February low, but still below its 200-day line and deep in a nine-month consolidation.MaxLinear (MXL) topped the IBD 50 list by a wide margin, surging 7% after revising its Q1 revenue and gross profit outlook. The stock tripped a sell rule Tuesday, dropping more than 8% below a 17.85 buy point and cutting its 50-day moving average in heavy trade. Wednesday's gain brought shares back even with the 50-day line.A big after-hours session today is scheduled to include quarter reports from American Express, Qualcomm (QCOM), United Continental (UAL) and Yum Brands (YUM).
"
66,DFS,"Thursday is a huge day for earnings, with earnings reports from a slew of companies, including many that are highly rated industry leaders. Here is what to expect from Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Starbucks (SBUX) and Visa (V).The Google parent likely benefited from strong mobile ad revenue in the first quarter. Earnings per share ex items likely grew 21% to $7.97. Total revenue is forecast to climb 18% to $20.37 billion. Revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs likely climbed 18% to about $16.5 billion.Core search and search-related ad sales should be strong, analysts expect. Also keep an eye on cloud-related services. Google competes against Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft's Azure.Alphabet stock tried  to break out last week from a cup-with-handle base with a 777.41 buy point, but volume was lackluster. Shares closed slightly below that entry area on Wednesday, but are up 0.5% to 778.63 in intraday trading on the stock market today. A strong gain in powerful volume would be an encouraging sign.The software giant should report a 2% revenue gain to $22.09 billion for the March quarter, ending a three-quarter string of declines. Microsoft earnings likely rose 5% to 64 cents. While Microsoft is trying to shift to its new mobile/cloud focus, weak PC sales will remain a drag on its core Windows/Office software suite.For the June quarter, analysts expected slightly faster growth, helped by declining currency headwinds as the dollar retreats.Much like Alphabet, Microsoft stock last week broke out of a cup-with-handle base in light volume, but then retreated below the buy point (55.76), dropping 1.4% to 55.59 on Wednesday. Shares moved just above that point Thursday afternoon, rising 0.4% to 55.79.Starbucks has continue to deliver surprisingly strong growth for a long-established coffee chain. For its fiscal Q2, analysts expect EPS to rise 18% to 39 cents. Sales should climbs 10% to $5.03 billion, though that would be the second straight quarter of decelerating growth.Aside from EPS and sales guidance, investors will be interested in how customers are responding to Starbucks' recently revamped loyalty rewards program. Some analysts have argued that it could hurt business, at least in the short term.Starbucks stock has been consolidating since peaking at 64 on Oct. 30. Starbucks fell 0.4% to 60.66 intraday. It offers a buy point at 61.88, though 61.74 also could serve as an alternative entry.The credit and debit card giant is expected to report a 6% EPS gain to 67 cents, with revenue up nearly 6% to $3.6 billion.Visa recently agreed to buy Visa Europe for $23.4 billion. Discover Financial (DFS) and American Express (AXP) reported this week.Visa stock cleared a buy point at 81.11 on Monday, hitting a new high but in light volume. Visa undercut that buy area on Tuesday, retook the entry point on Wednesday, but traded down 0.4% to 80.81 Thursday afternoon.

67,DFS,"The stock market opened with thin losses Wednesday as  Wall Street weighed more high-profile earnings reports.The Nasdaq eased 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 lost less than 0.1%.The stock market today finds the S&P 500 not quite 1% below a November high and less than 2% below its record high set last year in May. The small-cap Russell 2000 index opens still working to gain breathing room above its 200-day moving average.Oil prices are also in a fight at their 200-day line. Futures closed three sessions above the line last week, but slipped and have been unable to regain that support again this week.The day's economic releases are limited. The National Association of Realtors releases March existing-home sales figures at 10 a.m. ET. Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration delivers its weekly oil inventory report at 10:30 a.m.The dollar was mixed, up vs. the yen and down against the euro.  Commodities traded lower with oil down nearly 3% to $40 a barrel. Gold edged lower.Dow stocks traded generally flat to lower. Coca-Cola (KO) fell 4% on weak earnings. Boeing (BA) also lagged, down 2%. Early gainers included American Express (AXP) and UnitedHealth (UNH).Earnings stirred a good deal of early activity. Yahoo (YHOO) added 2% and St. Jude Medical (STJ) jumped 4%. On the downside, Intel (INTC) edged lower after reporting job cuts and a sales miss late Tuesday.Discover Financial (DFS) jumped 6%. The credit card processor reported late Tuesday that its first-quarter revenue and earnings comfortably topped analyst consensus views. Total loans and credit card loans rose 4% each, and the charge-off rate decreased by 5 basis points to 2.21%.

It reported after Tuesday's close that Q1 revenue easily topped analyst expectations, while its earnings scored a more narrow win. Shares ended Monday just below a flat-base buy point of 59.99.Most IBD 50 stocks also showed no change in premarket trade. The exception was MaxLinear (MXL), which strode ahead 5% after revising its outlook for fiscal Q4. The company tightened its revenue view around the midpoint of its prior guidance, to between $102 million and $103 million. Management expects gross profit to come in 200 basis points above its prior guidance, in percentage terms. The company reports after the market close on May 9. MaxLinear shares dropped 10% on Tuesday, cutting below their 50-day moving average in heavy trade.Overseas, eurozone markets carried modest gains into afternoon trade, while London's FTSE 100 was down 0.2%.

"
68,DFS,"With events such as Apple's (AAPL) recent wrangling with the feds pushing the issue of digital security to the forefront, it's no wonder payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) is growing more prominent in the ongoing battle against cybercriminals.The No. 2 company in its field by volume, Vantiv continues to reap the rewards of merchants' and financial institutions' move to chip cards and their corresponding terminals. Its suite of other cybersecurity products continues to play a key role in the company's upward climb.Vantiv processed $842 billion in transactions last year, and this is showing up in the company's numbers. Fourth-quarter results surpassed analyst estimates as adjusted earnings jumped 23% to 65 cents a share, marking a third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Net revenue increased 13% to $453 million.“Vantiv has strong secular tailwinds, in our view, spanning digital payments, security, software and e-commerce with little exposure to macro headwinds like (currency exchange), gas, regulation, credit or discretionary spending,” Pacific Crest analyst Josh Beck said in a recent note to clients. He also notes that Vantiv has ""above-average industry growth.""Vantiv can thank a number of entities for lifting awareness of cybersecurity, with the most recent example being Apple. The tech behemoth brought the issue of smartphone security front and center in recent days with its controversial refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that could contain terrorism evidence. The company says it wants to protect customer privacy.Cyberhacks have also struck customer databases at such merchants as Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) in recent years, and the threat they'll keep scouring the Internet for further vulnerability persists.One relatively new security measure in the U.S. payments space is that of chip cards and terminals known as EMV. Named for the three consumer credit companies that originated the technology -- Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) -- EMV uses a chip embedded in the card, rather than the traditional black strip, in an attempt to process payments in a much more secure way.The card-and-terminal upgrade cycle is driving significant growth for Vantiv, which plays on both sides of the equation. Some 80% of the company’s revenue comes from merchants, via the sale of new terminals, as well as other e-commerce, mobile, compliance and data analytics products. Clients include Macy's (M), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Kroger (KR) and the U.S. Postal Service.The other 20% comes from financial institutions, with Vantiv behind the reissuance of the cards that contain EMV chips. Partners include Comerica Bank (CMA), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One Financial (COF).Fortunately for Vantiv, the EMV upgrade cycle has a long way to go. Vantiv said last month during its fourth-quarter earnings call that, as of the end of 2015, more than two-thirds of the terminals of its merchant clients still needed to be upgraded. And more than half the debit cards of its bank clients still needed to be reissued as chip cards.""Some 15% of Vantiv's merchant transactions are chip-on-chip, meaning a chip card used by a consumer at a merchant that has a chip terminal,"" Beck told IBD. ""That gives you a sense that we're still pretty early, and my view is that this a multiyear cycle for Vantiv.""Further, the urgency for financial institutions and merchants to convert is growing. October 2015 marked a shift in liability to whichever party -- card issuers or merchants handling payments -- has the weaker technology. Prior to that, the card issuers were primarily responsible for cyber fraud liability.The company expects to see continued growth from EMV-related sales at least through early 2017, with an even longer tail from smaller clients on the merchant side, according to Vantiv Chief Executive Charles Drucker.""On the financial institution side, we're seeing the large banks adopt fast and reissue the cards,"" Drucker told IBD. ""The mid-size banks, as you pull into early 2017, you're going to see a lot of the cards out there with chips in them.""Along with upgrades, Vantiv is helping guide clients through the ever-changing regulatory environment, Drucker says. And its large clients are implementing Vantiv’s entire security suite, including end-to-end encryption and tokenization, a process that removes the credit card number completely from the retailer’s system.Beyond that, a number of merchants are buying terminals that also have near-field communication, or NFC, technology, which enables payments from the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google-owner Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Android Pay.The introduction of Apple Pay in September 2014 helped create a turning point in the payment processing industry, with nearly 1 in 5 point-of-sale terminals in the U.S. now enabled to accept billions of dollars in mobile payments, according to Juniper Research.""Most of the merchants, when they are designing their system, they're designing it in a way that when they get EMV, they are able to implement NFC inside of it,"" Drucker said.Another area of growth for Vantiv has been in the integrated payments space. For example, when a server enters an order into a restaurant's software system, Vantiv is embedded in that process. Plus, Vantiv is expanding into new verticals in the integrated payment category, including health care.Vantiv earns a near-best IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. Shares are trading 1%-2% below a cup-shaped base buy point of 53.46, with the stock retaking its 50-day line several weeks ago.Vantiv also has less exposure to the current volatile economic environment because of its concentration in everyday spending categories, including grocery stores and drug stores. The company doesn’t have much foreign exposure at this time, but in the long term, Drucker sees an international investment in the e-commerce space.And with the vast amount of information its transactions contain, Vantiv sees data analytics as a long-term growth driver as well.""Merchants and banks continue to be more interested in data analytics -- whether it’s banks using it to activate customers or see trends inside their base, or merchants using it to give a better customer experience, or to improve ticket sales that they have,"" Drucker said.

"
70,DFS,"Payment processors Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and PayPal (PYPL) sold off sharply on Monday, breaking key technical levels.Visa shares fell 4.3% to 78.38 on Monday, losing sight of a tight consolidation in recent weeks near the 50-day line. That also undercuts an earlier buy point of 81.83. Visa did manage to close just above its 200-day moving average after falling below that support level intraday.MasterCard pulled back 3.3% to 101.14 on Monday, falling in heavy volume below its 50-day line. The stock is in danger of a round trip from a late September breakout, but for now is still above the 100.10 buy point.Visa and MasterCard rose modestly before the opening bell on the stock market today.PayPal, which recently announced alliances with Visa and MasterCard, sank 3.2% to 38.81 on Monday, closing just above the 200-day line after undercutting it intraday. PayPal broke out of a consolidation on Oct. 21, a day after reporting quarterly results, hitting a new high. But shares have been retreating since then, undercutting the pivot point earlier this month and closing below the 50-day line on Friday.PayPal was flat before Tuesday's opening bell.Global Payments (GPN) and Vantiv (VNTV) also have retreated.It's unclear what it is hurting Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. They make their money from transaction fees, letting card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) get the risk and reward from customers' balances. With the yield curve steepening sharply in recent weeks and especially since Donald Trump became president-elect, card interest rates may rise. Bank stocks are soaring on widening yield spreads generally.IBD'S TAKE: While Visa and MasterCard slump, investors continue to rush into bank stocks. They're mostly extended from proper buy points, but you should pay close attention to this new leading group for entry points down the road.That could be why American Express (AXP), Capital One Financial (COF) and Discover Financial (DFS) are soaring. All three carry customers' balances. American Express rose 2.7% Monday to its best levels since November 2015. Capital One jumped 3.4% to its highest since July 2015. Discover Financial advanced 3.3%, hitting an all-time high intraday.Jefferies analysts said Tuesday that the sell-off in some payment stocks is unwarranted.""Major payments stocks including V, MA, PYPL, GPN and VNTV are off 5-10% in the four trading sessions since Election Day. We don't believe this is because of fundamental concerns on these stocks, but rather because of investor rotation into core Financials which have significantly lagged the payments stocks for years, but are now expected to benefit from rate and regulatory tailwinds under the Trump Administration.""Jefferies added that financial deregulation could repeal the Durbin limit on interchange fees and rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""If Trump's general plans for deregulating the financial services industry ends up including a repeal of the Durbin Amendment and a less-powerful CFPB, this should generally be a tailwind for the Payments industry, though impacts to PYPL/SQ/merchant acquirers may be less clear.""

71,DFS,"Capital One Financial (COF) didn't change its outlook despite an uptick in delinquencies, a day after Synchrony Financial (SYF) dragged card-issuer stocks lower when it warned of more debt write-offs over the next year.Capital One, which is among the biggest card issuers in the U.S., said its domestic May net charge-off rate was 3.99% -- up 60 basis points year over year, but down from 4.29% in April. The domestic 30-plus-day performing delinquency rate rose to 3.01% from 2.74% a year ago and 2.96% sequentially. The 30-plus-day performing delinquency rate for auto loans edged up to 5.48% vs. a year earlier.But while Capital One CFO Stephen Crawford pointed to “an accelerating increase in consumer debt” -- potentially even in subprime loans -- other financial metrics prompted the card-issuing giant not to change its loss forecast. Credit stability has held up in recent years as well.""The other side of that message is, there will be a turn,"" he warned at a Morgan Stanley financials conference. ""And one should just anticipate that that’s going to happen at some point in time.""On Tuesday, Synchrony, which issues private-label credit cards, said it expects a slightly higher net charge-off rate -- an indication of credit that a firm writes off as a loss because it no longer expects to be repaid -- over the next 12 months.Synchrony, which was recently spun off from General Electric (GE), said the rate was still ""historically low"" but that consumers this year have had a harder time paying off debt. Concerns have grown that debt from credit cards and auto loans, among other things, could be rising to less-comfortable levels.Meanwhile, Alliance Data Systems (ADS), which provides consumer and commercial lending and auto financing, said the delinquency rate within its card services segment rose to 4.4% as of May 31 from 3.9% a year earlier.Capital One shares ended trading up 0.3% on the stock market today, after diving 6.6% Tuesday. Alliance Data ticked down 0.5% to 207.95. Synchrony rose 0.2% to 26.50 after tumbling 13% Tuesday.Discover Financial Services (DFS) edged 0.3% higher to 53.12 Wednesday, following Tuesday's 4% drop. American Express (AXP) added 0.6% to 61.42, regaining some of the prior day's 4.1% slide.Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) do not issue cards but act as payment networks connecting businesses and banks. Visa lost 0.5% to 78.17. MasterCard dropped 0.8% to 93.34.

Small caps trailed, with the Russell 2000 retreating 0.3%. Volume in the stock market today was running sharply higher vs. the previous session.Blue chips were mostly up. Visa (V) led the Dow with a 1.5% gain in above-average volume. Non-Dow rival MasterCard (MA) added 1% in average turnover, and Discover Financial Services (DFS) crept 0.5% higher. Visa and MasterCard are 4% and 6% off their highs, respectively, while Discover is 15% off its high.Of the three, Visa has the best IBD Composite Rating, at 87. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 87 means the stock is in the top 13th percentile.Two top-rated stocks headed toward completion of a bullish pattern. At Friday's close, Domino's Pizza (DPZ)  and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) will have met the minimum length for a flat, base-on-base pattern.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, biomeds led the upside, and oil drillers led the downside. Neither the biomed group nor the oil drillers represent a market-leading performer.Crude oil declined as a Saudi official said it will freeze oil production only if other nations, including Iran, participate.

77,DFS,"The late-2013 data security breach at Target (TGT) was a game changer for American merchants, exposing 40 million debit and credit card accounts, costing the big-box retailer tens of millions of dollars and the CEO his job.

82,DFS,"Easing Out The 16 Digits

83,DFS,"That's a major change for certain, but a bigger one may be afoot. The 16-digit account number, once as much of a staple of credit cards as landlines were for telephones, is being phased out for online and mobile payments by the big payment card companies.

84,DFS,"Visa is among the companies that have begun using ""tokens,"" which substitute the 16-digit number with a randomly generated sequence of alphanumeric characters for each transaction. They make it more difficult for cybercrooks to steal identities.
"
85,DFS,"Moving American consumers from point-of-sale cash transactions to higher-tech digital sales, Visa is clearing the path. The Foster City, Calif.-based company has inked deals with Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Google (GOOGL) to deploy the tokenization tech.

"
101,DFS,"Visa has its challenges beyond hackers. Merchants have sued Visa, accusing it of unfairly charging excessive fees. Currently, Target, Amazon (AMZN) and other retailers are suing in federal court, asking for a $5.7 billion antitrust settlement to be vacated.
"
102,DFS,"They argue the settlement forces them to give up rights to sue over some of Visa's practices and policies. The merchants also claim that Visa and MasterCard fixed the fees they were charged each time customers used their cards. About 8,000 merchants opted out of the settlement, approved in 2013, and more than 30 lawsuits against Visa and MasterCard are still pending in that case.

107,DFS,"If you watched any National Football League games on television during the first week of the season, you could not have avoided the firehose of TV advertising for daily fantasy sports platforms DraftKings and FanDuel.Those two services spent an estimated $31 million combined on TV ads in just the last week, Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente said in a research note Friday.Daily fantasy sports are single-day fantasy sports contests for cash prizes. Industry heavyweights DraftKings and FanDuel make their money by taking a percentage of the fees that players pay to enter the contests, after the winnings are paid out.""Although perhaps a temporary phenomenon, we believe that growth in ad spend from (daily fantasy sports) could drive an incremental 40 to 60 basis points in third quarter Internet/media ad spend growth,"" DiClemente said. ""An incremental 50 basis points represents roughly a third of our estimated 1.5% year-over-year Q3 TV advertising growth assumption, with most benefits accruing to broadcasters of the NFL.""Fantasy sports TV advertising could exceed $150 million in the third quarter, DiClemente said. He forecasts DFS ad spending of $140 million to $175 million in Q3.Daily fantasy sports companies likely spent $50 million to advertise during the first week of the NFL season, with spending split 60/40 between TV and online.CBS (CBS) and Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ESPN are likely to reap the biggest sums of DFS ad spending, given their NFL and college football broadcasts.""ESPN is certainly positioned well given $250 million of ad spend guaranteed by DraftKings over the next three years,"" DiClemente said. ""CBS also is likely to capture a large share of the dollars spent.""Yahoo (YHOO), Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) are seen as top beneficiaries of Internet advertising from fantasy sports.""Yahoo, given its leading position in fantasy sports, likely provides some of the most valuable Internet ad inventory for DraftKings and FanDuel,"" DiClemente said. ""Yahoo could see about $10 million to $20 million of net revenue lift from DFS advertising.""We estimate that Facebook and Google capture the largest share of DFS Internet ad spend, however, their large revenue bases make the incremental revenue contribution less obvious.""Daily fantasy sports services have generated some controversy.""Questions exist regarding regulations around these services given nuanced differences between pay-for-play fantasy sports and gambling (i.e., should fantasy football be deemed a game of skill?),"" DiClemente said. ""There are also reports that a disproportionate amount of the winnings are accruing to a few players given algorithmic/machine-based player selection systems.""RELATED:For DraftKings, FanDuel, IPO Hopes Likely No Fantasy.

Visa and MasterCard do not issue credit.""We believe credit quality could remain much better than average for the industry as a whole until at least 2017,"" Napoli said.American Express had the industry's lowest delinquency rate at 1%, followed by JPMorgan Chase at 1.38%, Citigroup at 1.54%, Discover at 1.65% and Bank of America at 1.71% — all below the industry's weighted average of 2.17%.Credit-card loan growth picked up slightly in the the quarter, with U.S. Bank (USB), American Express and Capital One Financial (COF) reporting positive and accelerating portfolio growth, especially compared to relatively weaker trends at Discover, Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup.""Credit standards are being slightly loosened, credit lines are being increased, the economic and employment environment is improving and the consumer leverage ratios seem to be forming a bottom,"" Napoli noted.Shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Citigroup all rose 2%-3% near the market close, also buoyed by hawkish Fed minutes.

"
382,DFS,"Never mind the tricky logistics of debt collection. These are trying times for buyers and collectors of consumer debt.
"
383,DFS,"For one thing, delinquency rates on credit cards are near historic lows. And the price that debt buyers must pay to get their hands on the debt has soared as supply has shrunk.
"
384,DFS,"Many smaller players who had flooded the market earlier have left the business over the last year.
"
385,DFS,"The prospect of stricter new federal regulations on the sale of nonperforming loans to collectors has even caused major issuers JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) to curtail selling charged-off consumer debt to third-party buyers, at least for the time being.
"
386,DFS,"What's a debt buyer to do?
"
387,DFS,"Of those still standing, plenty, as it turns out.
"
388,DFS,"Take Portfolio Recovery Associates (PRAA), one of the top players in defaulted consumer receivables. Not only has PRA been buying more consumer debt from the still available supply, its success at collecting from debtors has been improving.
"
389,DFS,"""They are getting more efficient at collecting on the debt to counter that they've paid more on the debt,"" said First Analysis analyst Larry Berlin.
"
390,DFS,"Profit Collected
"
391,DFS,"Except for one quarter in early 2012, PRA's profits have grown in double digits for 13 straight quarters. And they are expected to keep growing at similarly healthy rates.
"
392,DFS,"Analysts see earnings growing 34% this year to $3.31 a share and 15% next year, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters.
"
393,DFS,"Investors have followed the money. The company's shares have been climbing since mid-2012. The stock is up 52% this year even with the recent market correction. The board approved a 3-for-1 stock split effective in early August.
"
394,DFS,"Meanwhile, the company continues to find new debt to fill its pipeline. It invested more than $200 million in debt portfolios in the second quarter, which had a face value of $3.2 billion. That was up from $125 million in investments in the year-earlier quarter and brought the total for the trailing 12 months to $717 million invested.
"
395,DFS,"While prices for debt are still high — Berlin says they're currently in the ""teens"" on face value — prices seem to be stabilizing, analysts say.
"
396,DFS,"During the recession, prices for consumer debt were about 5% to 6% of the face value of consumer debt, Berlin says.
"
397,DFS,"Investment capital to help fund portfolio purchases also had largely dried up.
"
398,DFS,"And as charge-offs fell, causing a supply crunch, prices started to rise, especially evident in 2011.
"
399,DFS,"""Supply was constrained and then the regulatory (environment) increased the cost of doing business,"" said analyst Sameer Gokhale of Janney Montgomery Scott.
"
400,DFS,"The ability to correctly price portfolios and determine how and who to collect from is crucial to debt buyers' success, analysts say.
"
401,DFS,"""The business itself has become incredibly sophisticated and analytical so the mom and pop operators and smaller, less efficient companies are not able to compete,"" Gokhale said.
"
402,DFS,"Formula For Efficiency
"
403,DFS,"A lot of a company's success turns on its ability to analyze data collected over years and the skill of call-center employees.
"
404,DFS,"The top three in the industry besides PRA are privately held Sherman Financial and Encore Capital Group (ECPG), which recently acquired receivables of another big rival, Asset Acceptance.
"
405,DFS,"Encore also entered the U.K. for the first time with the recent acquisition of a controlling interest in Cabot Credit Management. PRA works in the U.K. too, though its U.S. operations are much larger.
"
406,DFS,"Unlike Encore, which uses a lot of call centers in India, PRA's call centers are in the U.S.
"
407,DFS,"PRA's call-center employees ""keep learning and that makes them more efficient, which means the company is more efficient,"" Berlin said. ""There are a lot of people you don't bother with because there is very little chance they will pay you. You have to have very good statistics for people to figure that out.""
"
408,DFS,"PRA's CEO Steve Fredrickson has said the firm's operations are driven by ""best in class application of analytics.""
"
409,DFS,"PRA has also been expanding its legal staff, which enables it to take legal action that otherwise would have been ""prohibitively expensive,"" according to a company filing. 
"
410,DFS,"The firm's collection revenue keeps growing. Cash collections rose 28% in the second quarter vs. a year earlier to $296 million. Revenue in the quarter grew 24% to $183 million, consisting mostly of net finance receivables income.
"
411,DFS,"Total revenue is seen growing 21% this year to $715 million and 11% the next year.
"
412,DFS,"Gokhale expects banks that curtailed the sale of consumer debt, chiefly JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, to return to the market by the end of this year or early next as they become more comfortable with new regulations.
"
413,DFS,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has indicated it will increase oversight of debt-collection firms and hold banks responsible for third-party debt handling.
"
414,DFS,"PRA and other large rivals will benefit the most from the new supply, Gokhale says.
"
415,DFS,"If the economy keeps improving, underwriting standards on consumer debt may relax, he says. That would lead to more borrowing and the potential for more debt to buy.
"
416,DFS,"""Pricing will improve for debt buyers because there are fewer buyers and more supply. So there will be better profitability on those (debt) portfolios,"" Gokhale said.
"
417,DFS,"PRA sports a near-perfect Composite Rating of 98, out of a possible 99. It is the 11th largest company by market capitalization in the Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processing industry group, which is ranked 50th of 197 groups IBD tracks. The big names in that group are Visa (V), American Express Co. (AXP), Mastercard (MA) and Discover Financial Services (DFS).Never mind the tricky logistics of debt collection. These are trying times for buyers and collectors of consumer debt.For one thing, delinquency rates on credit cards are near historic lows. And the price that debt buyers must pay to get their hands on the debt has soared as supply has shrunk.Many smaller players who had flooded the market earlier have left the business over the last year.The prospect of stricter new federal regulations on the sale of nonperforming loans to collectors has even caused major issuers JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) to curtail selling charged-off consumer debt to third-party buyers, at least for the time being.What's a debt buyer to do?Of those still standing, plenty, as it turns out.Take Portfolio Recovery Associates (PRAA), one of the top players in defaulted consumer receivables. Not only has PRA been buying more consumer debt from the still available supply, its success at collecting from debtors has been improving.""They are getting more efficient at collecting on the debt to counter that they've paid more on the debt,"" said First Analysis analyst Larry Berlin.Profit CollectedExcept for one quarter in early 2012, PRA's profits have grown in double digits for 13 straight quarters. And they are expected to keep growing at similarly healthy rates.Analysts see earnings growing 34% this year to $3.31 a share and 15% next year, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters.Investors have followed the money. The company's shares have been climbing since mid-2012. The stock is up 52% this year even with the recent market correction. The board approved a 3-for-1 stock split effective in early August.Meanwhile, the company continues to find new debt to fill its pipeline. It invested more than $200 million in debt portfolios in the second quarter, which had a face value of $3.2 billion. That was up from $125 million in investments in the year-earlier quarter and brought the total for the trailing 12 months to $717 million invested.While prices for debt are still high — Berlin says they're currently in the ""teens"" on face value — prices seem to be stabilizing, analysts say.During the recession, prices for consumer debt were about 5% to 6% of the face value of consumer debt, Berlin says.Investment capital to help fund portfolio purchases also had largely dried up.And as charge-offs fell, causing a supply crunch, prices started to rise, especially evident in 2011.""Supply was constrained and then the regulatory (environment) increased the cost of doing business,"" said analyst Sameer Gokhale of Janney Montgomery Scott.The ability to correctly price portfolios and determine how and who to collect from is crucial to debt buyers' success, analysts say.""The business itself has become incredibly sophisticated and analytical so the mom and pop operators and smaller, less efficient companies are not able to compete,"" Gokhale said.Formula For EfficiencyA lot of a company's success turns on its ability to analyze data collected over years and the skill of call-center employees.The top three in the industry besides PRA are privately held Sherman Financial and Encore Capital Group (ECPG), which recently acquired receivables of another big rival, Asset Acceptance.Encore also entered the U.K. for the first time with the recent acquisition of a controlling interest in Cabot Credit Management. PRA works in the U.K. too, though its U.S. operations are much larger.Unlike Encore, which uses a lot of call centers in India, PRA's call centers are in the U.S.PRA's call-center employees ""keep learning and that makes them more efficient, which means the company is more efficient,"" Berlin said. ""There are a lot of people you don't bother with because there is very little chance they will pay you. You have to have very good statistics for people to figure that out.""PRA's CEO Steve Fredrickson has said the firm's operations are driven by ""best in class application of analytics.""PRA has also been expanding its legal staff, which enables it to take legal action that otherwise would have been ""prohibitively expensive,"" according to a company filing. The firm's collection revenue keeps growing. Cash collections rose 28% in the second quarter vs. a year earlier to $296 million. Revenue in the quarter grew 24% to $183 million, consisting mostly of net finance receivables income.Total revenue is seen growing 21% this year to $715 million and 11% the next year.Gokhale expects banks that curtailed the sale of consumer debt, chiefly JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, to return to the market by the end of this year or early next as they become more comfortable with new regulations.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has indicated it will increase oversight of debt-collection firms and hold banks responsible for third-party debt handling.PRA and other large rivals will benefit the most from the new supply, Gokhale says.If the economy keeps improving, underwriting standards on consumer debt may relax, he says. That would lead to more borrowing and the potential for more debt to buy.""Pricing will improve for debt buyers because there are fewer buyers and more supply. So there will be better profitability on those (debt) portfolios,"" Gokhale said.PRA sports a near-perfect Composite Rating of 98, out of a possible 99.

"
429,DFS,"Credit card debt is poised to rebound off its 10-year low, giving card firms like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) a boost, but consumers may not return quickly to their previous debt-fueled buying habits.Historic borrowing and spending patterns should return eventually, but stagnant incomes are holding them back, said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst for Bankrate.com.""It's not like the American consumer has gotten religion about paying down debt and saving,"" he said.In fact, a recent study from the Boston Federal Reserve estimates at least 60%-70% of the recent decline in mortgage debt is attributable to foreclosures, belying the deleveraging narrative of renewed frugality.The paper also suggests households may have even underspent relative to their income and net worth before the recession and have been overspending since.Shares of Visa, MasterCard, American Express (AXP) and Discover Financial (DFS) have risen in the last year, though that's due in part to growing acceptance of plastic overseas.Visa and MasterCard will report quarterly earnings on Wednesday, Oct. 31. Unlike smaller rivals, they don't carry card balances — issuing banks do. The card network giants make money off transaction fees.U.S. credit card debt hit a decade low of $672 billion in Q2, down 22% from its peak of $866 billion in late 2008, according to New York Federal Reserve data.The number of credit card accounts has risen slightly since collapsing after the recession but is still comparable to levels seen in late 1999 and early 2000.There are some signs credit cards are coming back. Outstanding revolving credit has seen a slight uptick in recent months.AmEx, which enjoys a more affluent customer base, has seen card spending grow, albeit at a slowing pace.But its credit card holders are also paying off loan balances, with the total down 73% from the peak in early 2010 despite having more customers.Purchase volumes on Bank of America's (BAC) credit cards have actually declined in recent quarters. Meantime, debit card purchases are up.Some consumers have indeed turned more frugal, but the deleveraging of credit card debt is mostly the result of banks tightening standards, said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.""There are a lot of people that banks no longer find worthy of consumer credit,"" he said.People with low credit scores have been largely shut out of the card market, in part by new regulations that limit fees. But the pendulum is ready to swing in the other direction.Consumers as a group appear to be done deleveraging, and those who still have access to credit are slowly ramping up debt as their incomes gradually improve, he said.Delinquency rates on credit cards are at four-year lows. Overall household debt payments as a share of disposable personal income fell to 10.69% in Q2 from 10.81% in Q1. That's the lowest rate since late 1993.Still, the debt bust's residual hangover has yet to completely disappear. Growth in the average dollar value of third-party collections has accelerated in the past year, even as the share of consumers in collection status has been mostly steady during that time.Lenders eventually will have to extend more credit to generate faster growth in their businesses, McBride said.But card companies like AmEx are now looking to prepaid cards targeted at lower-income people without bank accounts to drive up volume on their payment networks.Until incomes pick up more, people can't lean on the ""crutch of credit,"" he said. ""That's why consumer spending and the economy are stuck in first gear.""

656,DFS,"Payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) spun off from Midwestern regional bank Fifth Third Bank (FITB) in 2009 and has been shedding its provincial roots ever since.
"
657,DFS,"Vantiv went public in March, then completed a secondary offering in August.
"
658,DFS,"Cincinnati-based Vantiv handles payment processing for more than 400,000 merchant locations and 1,300 financial institutions in the U.S.
"
659,DFS,"Formerly known as Fifth Third Processing, Vantiv has been stepping up sales efforts to reel in customers beyond the Midwest.
"
660,DFS,"Its expansion focuses on small and midsize merchants and bank customers, where margins are typically higher for card processing service than large-scale clients.
"
661,DFS,"Vantiv still has plenty of national merchant customers, many from referrals from Fifth Third, including such Midwest-based chains as Kroger (KR) and Walgreen (WAG).
"
662,DFS,"Customer referrals from Fifth Bank account for more than 7% of Vantiv's revenue, analysts say.
"
663,DFS,"Though having a strong base of national merchants gives it scale, Vantiv's focus on smaller customers is paying off.
"
664,DFS,"Earnings Growth
"
665,DFS,"""Smaller merchants are typically more profitable,"" said JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang. ""That has helped them grow at above-average rates. It's pretty clear they are taking share.""
"
666,DFS,"In Q2, its first full quarter as a public company, Vantiv earned an adjusted 32 cents a share, with net income jumping to $23 million from $5.4 million a year earlier. Analysts estimate full-year profit will rise 16% to $1.37 a share.
"
667,DFS,"Net revenue, excluding network fees and other costs, rose 20% to $260.4 million. Management expects net revenue of $1 billion to $1.02 billion for the full year, for a 16% to 18% gain over last year.
"
668,DFS,"Vantiv works on behalf of merchants in two ways. First, it signs on merchants to help them accept credit and debit payments from card networks, such as Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA). Then it makes sure transactions using those cards are valid.
"
669,DFS,"Vantiv says it's the third-largest merchant acquirer in the U.S. and the biggest in PIN-debit volume.
"
670,DFS,"The company helps accept about 10% of all card payments in the U.S., says David Koning, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co.
"
671,DFS,"Koning says clients skew to selling everyday kinds of items, such as groceries and drugstore products.
"
672,DFS,"""It's spending people do on an ongoing basis in good and bad times,"" he said.
"
673,DFS,"In 2011, Vantiv handled $426 billion in bank card purchase volume at more than 400,000 merchant locations.
"
674,DFS,"Vantiv's average merchant customer takes in $2 million to $2.5 million in annual card volume, says analyst Andrew Jeffrey of Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.
"
675,DFS,"""That's the sweet spot of the market,"" he said.
"
676,DFS,"Vantiv boosted the number of small to midsize merchant customers with its acquisition of National Processing Co. in 2010.
"
677,DFS,"It's also been stepping up sales using direct reps as well as third-party agents and resellers.
"
678,DFS,"Two-thirds of Vantiv's revenue comes from merchants for processing their card transactions. The rest comes from financial institutions for providing them with debit, credit and ATM card transaction processing and other service, such as fraud protection.
"
679,DFS,"The firm's single, proprietary technology platform ""gives it economies of scale"" that most competitors don't have, said Jeffrey.
"
680,DFS,"Rivals include Heartland Payment (HPY), Global Payments (GPN) and privately held First Data, the largest independent domestic merchant acquirer.
"
681,DFS,"JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Chase Paymentech is another large player.
"
682,DFS,"Vantiv's bank customers include regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Regional PIN-debit networks also use Vantiv.
"
683,DFS,"Vantiv is following the same approach as in its merchant business by going after small to midsize clients. Unlike large banks, smaller financial concerns aren't as apt to bring processing in-house.
"
684,DFS,"And they don't have the scale to negotiate prices down.
"
685,DFS,"""By having more small and midsize banks in their customer base, Vantiv has less risk from in-sourcing and it has higher margins,"" Jeffrey said.
"
686,DFS,"Vantiv's new customer, Discover Financial Services (DFS), caused net revenue per transaction in the merchant segment to edge down in the second quarter.
"
687,DFS,"The reason: Its large scale gives it pricing advantages.
"
688,DFS,"But the added revenue from Discover ""more than offset"" last year's loss of another relatively large account, Sovereign Bank, Koning says.
"
689,DFS,"""Discover is a pretty big win this year,"" he said.
"
690,DFS,"While the year-old Durbin Amendment cut bank interchange fees on debit transactions by 50%, payment processors aren't necessarily passing on all the savings to their merchant customers, who pay the fees, analysts say.
"
691,DFS,"""The industry is selectively trying to keep some of those Durbin savings to themselves,"" Huang said.
"
692,DFS,"Bundled Packages
"
693,DFS,"Vantiv is one of several that keep at least some of the savings to themselves as part of their bundled packages, analysts say.
"
694,DFS,"Heartland, however, passes along 100% of Durbin savings to merchants, Huang says.
"
695,DFS,"""That is their guiding strategy on pricing,"" he said. ""It's a marketing message: We're the good guys, the merchant advocates.""
"
696,DFS,"Still, Heartland has a smaller share of the merchant market — 4% to Vantiv's 14% share, he says.
"
697,DFS,"Vantiv hasn't expanded to faster-growing payment markets overseas like some rivals. But management has indicated it plans to expand outside the U.S. one day. No timetable has been set.
"
698,DFS,"The company also plans to step up investment in mobile and e-commerce technology.Payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) spun off from Midwestern regional bank Fifth Third Bank (FITB) in 2009 and has been shedding its provincial roots ever since.Vantiv went public in March, then completed a secondary offering in August.Cincinnati-based Vantiv handles payment processing for more than 400,000 merchant locations and 1,300 financial institutions in the U.S.Formerly known as Fifth Third Processing, Vantiv has been stepping up sales efforts to reel in customers beyond the Midwest.Its expansion focuses on small and midsize merchants and bank customers, where margins are typically higher for card processing service than large-scale clients.Vantiv still has plenty of national merchant customers, many from referrals from Fifth Third, including such Midwest-based chains as Kroger (KR) and Walgreen (WAG).Customer referrals from Fifth Bank account for more than 7% of Vantiv's revenue, analysts say.Though having a strong base of national merchants gives it scale, Vantiv's focus on smaller customers is paying off.Earnings Growth""Smaller merchants are typically more profitable,"" said JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang.

First, it signs on merchants to help them accept credit and debit payments from card networks, such as Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA). Then it makes sure transactions using those cards are valid.Vantiv says it's the third-largest merchant acquirer in the U.S. and the biggest in PIN-debit volume.The company helps accept about 10% of all card payments in the U.S., says David Koning, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co.Koning says clients skew to selling everyday kinds of items, such as groceries and drugstore products.""It's spending people do on an ongoing basis in good and bad times,"" he said.In 2011, Vantiv handled $426 billion in bank card purchase volume at more than 400,000 merchant locations.Vantiv's average merchant customer takes in $2 million to $2.5 million in annual card volume, says analyst Andrew Jeffrey of Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.""That's the sweet spot of the market,"" he said.Vantiv boosted the number of small to midsize merchant customers with its acquisition of National Processing Co. in 2010.It's also been stepping up sales using direct reps as well as third-party agents and resellers.Two-thirds of Vantiv's revenue comes from merchants for processing their card transactions. The rest comes from financial institutions for providing them with debit, credit and ATM card transaction processing and other service, such as fraud protection.The firm's single, proprietary technology platform ""gives it economies of scale"" that most competitors don't have, said Jeffrey.Rivals include Heartland Payment (HPY), Global Payments (GPN) and privately held First Data, the largest independent domestic merchant acquirer.JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Chase Paymentech is another large player.Vantiv's bank customers include regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Regional PIN-debit networks also use Vantiv.Vantiv is following the same approach as in its merchant business by going after small to midsize clients. Unlike large banks, smaller financial concerns aren't as apt to bring processing in-house.And they don't have the scale to negotiate prices down.""By having more small and midsize banks in their customer base, Vantiv has less risk from in-sourcing and it has higher margins,"" Jeffrey said.Vantiv's new customer, Discover Financial Services (DFS), caused net revenue per transaction in the merchant segment to edge down in the second quarter.The reason: Its large scale gives it pricing advantages.But the added revenue from Discover ""more than offset"" last year's loss of another relatively large account, Sovereign Bank, Koning says.""Discover is a pretty big win this year,"" he said.While the year-old Durbin Amendment cut bank interchange fees on debit transactions by 50%, payment processors aren't necessarily passing on all the savings to their merchant customers, who pay the fees, analysts say.""The industry is selectively trying to keep some of those Durbin savings to themselves,"" Huang said.Bundled PackagesVantiv is one of several that keep at least some of the savings to themselves as part of their bundled packages, analysts say.Heartland, however, passes along 100% of Durbin savings to merchants, Huang says.""That is their guiding strategy on pricing,"" he said. ""It's a marketing message: We're the good guys, the merchant advocates.""Still, Heartland has a smaller share of the merchant market — 4% to Vantiv's 14% share, he says.Vantiv hasn't expanded to faster-growing payment markets overseas like some rivals. But management has indicated it plans to expand outside the U.S. one day. No timetable has been set.The company also plans to step up investment in mobile and e-commerce technology.

699,DFS,"PayPal's push into offline payments is going big time. Analysts say a deal that eBay's (EBAY) online payments unit inked in August with Discover Financial Services (DFS), as well as its other recent tie-ups with U.S. chain stores, primes PayPal to become a major presence at U.S. store checkout lines where consumers pay with smart cards and smartphones.

"
700,DFS,"American Express (AXP) is slated to announce second-quarter earnings Wednesday after the market closes, a bellwether for the credit card industry and consumer spending.The credit card and travel services company has continued growing this year despite uneven economic growth, rising competition from Visa (V) and smaller card issuers, and from other quarters including China UnionPay, that country's largest bank card payments processor, which is trying to go global.The 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect American Express to report a 6% rise in earnings to $1.22 a share. Revenue is forecast to climb 4.2% to $8.3 billion. That would be in line with AmEx's performance over the prior four quarters amid a still-sluggish economy.Overall credit card delinquencies and charge-offs are at longtime lows, while credit card and other revolving debt picked up in May.On June 20, American Express announced the appointment of Jeffrey Campbell as chief financial officer, effective in early August. Campbell joins from McKesson (MCK), the largest health care services company in the U.S.American Express carries a strong IBD Composite Rating of 82, meaning it's outperformed 82% of all stocks. It's traded above 50-day and 200-day averages for nearly all of 2013.After trading in a narrow range from January 2010 to late December 2012, it climbed 39% to a 77.85 close Monday in stock market trading.Visa is set to report fiscal Q3 results after the market closes on July 24. Wall Street expects the world's largest card processor to put up a 15% increase in EPS to $1.79. Revenue is predicted to climb about 13% to $2.89 billion. Visa shares fell 0.3% Monday.MasterCard (MA) is seen recording an 11.5% rise in EPS to $6.30 when in releases Q2 earnings results on July 31. Sales are estimated to rise about 10% to $2 billion. MasterCard slid 0.5%.Visa and MasterCard, unlike AmEx, Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One Financial (COF), do not hold their customers' credit balances — and risks. Those responsibilities are left with card-issuing banks such as Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C). JPMorgan reported Friday that credit card volume rose 10% to a new record. Citi said cards revenue was roughly flat. BofA is set to report Thursday morning.Capital One earnings are due Thursday afternoon, with Discover on tap July 23.

701,DFS,"The current market rally has been broad, with drugmakers, discounters and home builders among the leading groups. But technology companies in the S&P 500 also have been impressive, none more so than Apple (AAPL), the world's biggest enterprise by market capitalization. Here are the five top S&P 500 tech stocks, based on IBD's Composite Rating, with a secondary sort by EPS Rating.Apple shares fell 4.3% on July 25, a day after reporting a lower-than-expected 20% earnings per share gain. But since that time, the tech giant's shares have shot up 21.7% to a new high. That includes a 5.9% advance from Sept. 12, when it unveiled its iPhone 5. Pre-orders topped 2 mil units in the first 24 hours. So while gadget reviewers weren't overwhelmed, Apple still knows how to wow investors and consumers.Somebody forgot to tell Google (GOOG) that it's supposed to be finished. After a long slide and consolidation, Google shares are up 27% since June 14 and are at their best levels since the end of 2007.. The company's wireless operating system Android is by far the world's most popular. Google now owns Motorola. And it has its hand in many ventures, including its much-hyped driverless cars. But nearly all of Google's profit still comes from search.Salesforce.com (CRM) is a pioneer in providing cloud-based on-demand software, offering customer-relationship products to businesses. Salesforce shares sold off initially on Aug. 24 after reporting somewhat cautious guidance along with its earnings report, but the stock closed higher for the session.It's a good bet that Salesforce shares will react Thursday night, when Oracle (ORCL) — another highly rated S&P 500 tech — reports quarterly earnings results. Tibco Software (TIBX) — a smaller business software firm that's on the elite IBD 50 along with Apple and Salesforce — also reports after the market close that day.EBay remains a very successful e-commerce firm, while its PayPal online payments unit is aiming to break out into the real world. It recently inked a deal that will soon let customers use PayPal at brick-and-mortar locations that accept Discover Financial (DFS) cards. PayPal already had deals with Home Depot (HD) and many other major chains. EBay earnings per share have risen 17% in each of the last two quarters. That's solid, if not spectacular, but Wall Street was impressed. Shares shot up 13.2% and 8.6%, respectively, on the day after those reports. The stock has continued to trend higher the past two months to its best level since the start of 2005.Meanwhile, Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is the No. 1 provider of content delivery network services to media and entertainment companies. Its global server networks allow content to be closer — and faster — to customers. But Akamai is moving to expand into the cloud infrastructure field to expand revenue — and profit margins.Akamai's revenue growth has accelerated for the past three quarters, from 11% to 20%.

"
744,DFS,"Then she stepped down in 2002. Lublin believes that serial entrepreneurs should time their exit after building an organization and move on to the next project. When an organization's founder stays too long, others become discouraged because they're overshadowed by the founder and see they will never be promoted to CEO, she says.
"
745,DFS,"By leaving while on top, as Lublin did, another talented and passionate leader can inject new life into the organization.
"
746,DFS,"For DFS, the new CEO was Joi Gordon. A former New York assistant district attorney, she joined the board after hearing about the organization on TV and donating some suits. She was drawn to Lublin's passion for improving a woman's life one suit at a time. With 80% of clients being single mothers, thousands of children benefit indirectly as well.

In her book ""Zilch: The Power of Having Zero in Business,"" Lublin contends that profit-driven corporations have plenty to learn from not-for-profits in getting the most out of the staff to boost profits. She says business leaders can build a company and their brand with inspiration and values, more so than by hiring expensive consulting firms and dangling bonuses.

765,DFS,"She rallies her team in the summer as DoSomething.org plays kickball against DonorsChoose and other outfits in Central Park.
"
766,DFS,"Lublin makes Valentine's Day a company holiday and summer Fridays half-days. Employees compete in silly baking contests in which one day they make something square and on another day something with fruit. Sometimes a DJ plays music in the afternoon. Other times they sing.

"
767,DFS,"She gives staff — including interns and volunteers — business cards with empowering titles like Head Donor Strategist, Innovation Specialist and Team Builder. Lublin's title as CEO and ""Chief Old Person"" sets a light-hearted culture at the office.
"
768,DFS,"Upon entering the Union Square digs, she walks around and asks how everyone is doing. The layout is open, with no cubicles and an emphasis on staff communication. The way Lublin put it in her book, offices should convey transparency, with managers alongside staff to ""foster teamwork, shared knowledge and camaraderie.""

When an organization's founder stays too long, others become discouraged because they're overshadowed by the founder and see they will never be promoted to CEO, she says.By leaving while on top, as Lublin did, another talented and passionate leader can inject new life into the organization.For DFS, the new CEO was Joi Gordon. A former New York assistant district attorney, she joined the board after hearing about the organization on TV and donating some suits. She was drawn to Lublin's passion for improving a woman's life one suit at a time. With 80% of clients being single mothers, thousands of children benefit indirectly as well.""It was very attractive to be around somebody with that level of energy, enthusiasm and optimism,"" said Gordon, head of DFS since 2002. ""She was young, smart and quite frankly very courageous and very bold.""Lublin grew up in Hartford, Conn., where her father was a lawyer and her mother a housewife. She zipped through Brown and Oxford universities, then landed a law degree from New York University in 2000. Now 39, she lives in the city with her husband, entrepreneur Jason Diaz, and their two children, Sydney and Houston.In August 2003, a year after leaving DFS, Lublin took over failing social-activist group Do Something.The nonprofit had been co-founded in 1993 by Andrew Shue while he was still starring on TV's ""Melrose Place."" He and childhood friend Michael Sanchez got it started with hopes of making volunteering and community service cool among teenagers by giving them grant money to take on pet causes.Calling on Lublin, the nonprofit was $250,000 in debt. It had only $75,000 in the bank, and one staffer remained after cuts of 21 people.Do Something indeed.In half a year, Lublin transformed the old-school bureaucracy into a hip, Web-based firm and rebranded it DoSomething.org.She shut down its offices in multiple cities across the country and moved the headquarters to New York's Union Square.With offices also in Los Angeles, DoSomething.org now has a $3.5 million budget, with $6 million worth of donations coming in annually. Charity Navigator, which researches nonprofits, rates it four stars, the highest possible. The In CrowdAs a teen marketing and pop culture site, DoSomething.org says it reaches 11 million kids each year.""Our aim is to have 10% of the teen space as active members in less than three years,"" Lublin told IBD.In 2007, DoSomething.org produced the first televised award show honoring teens' charitable contributions. Three years later, it collaborated with hip-hop star Nelly in a ""Tackle Hunger"" campaign. Some 225,000 teens participated by holding drives in their neighborhood or school and delivering nearly 1 million pounds of food to soup kitchens.This year, Lublin's site partnered with retailer Aeropostale (ARO) in a ""Teens for Jeans"" campaign. Teenagers dropped off old denims at the store in exchange for a coupon to buy new jeans. The 500,000 used pants went to homeless shelters.Lublin's feats have won her numerous accolades, including Women of Worth plaudits from Glamour magazine in 2006 and recognition as one of the 100 most influential young leaders by the World Economic Forum in 2007.In TuneWhat sets Lublin apart? One way is how she treats her people.DoSomething.org's staff enjoys Lublin-sparked perks that cost the organization nothing yet boost morale, loyalty and productivity. In her book ""Zilch: The Power of Having Zero in Business,"" Lublin contends that profit-driven corporations have plenty to learn from not-for-profits in getting the most out of the staff to boost profits. She says business leaders can build a company and their brand with inspiration and values, more so than by hiring expensive consulting firms and dangling bonuses.She rallies her team in the summer as DoSomething.org plays kickball against DonorsChoose and other outfits in Central Park.Lublin makes Valentine's Day a company holiday and summer Fridays half-days. Employees compete in silly baking contests in which one day they make something square and on another day something with fruit. Sometimes a DJ plays music in the afternoon. Other times they sing. ""My favorite song for DoSomething.org staff karaoke is Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire,'"" Lublin said.She gives staff — including interns and volunteers — business cards with empowering titles like Head Donor Strategist, Innovation Specialist and Team Builder. Lublin's title as CEO and ""Chief Old Person"" sets a light-hearted culture at the office.Upon entering the Union Square digs, she walks around and asks how everyone is doing. The layout is open, with no cubicles and an emphasis on staff communication. The way Lublin put it in her book, offices should convey transparency, with managers alongside staff to ""foster teamwork, shared knowledge and camaraderie.""All the while, Lublin writes a column for Fast Company magazine, gives speeches and teaches ""The Business of Nonprofit Management"" at New York University.Class ActAs with her company staff, Lublin connects with her students. She shares her cellphone number and grades exams herself even though she has a teaching assistant — then takes all 30 in the class out to dinner at the end of the semester.James Elbaor took Lublin's course three years ago and has since joined DoSomething.org as a special projects manager.""She's a force of nature,"" the 26-year-old said. ""She has a very vibrant personality. She's an extremely engaged person.""Lublin says she plans to stick with the organization as long as she feels ""excited and useful to the goals of DoSomething.org.""""When I have a bad day,"" she said, ""I dream about opening up a gelato stand on the streets of Sydney, Australia. Doesn't everyone have a random escape fantasy?""

855,DFS,"Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) will release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26 after market close.Discover Financial has been witnessing consistent growth in card sales over the past several years, thereby adding to its revenue base. The same trend is expected to continue in the first quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for card sales is pegged at $30.5 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.8%.Although the company’s Payments Service segment has been underperforming over the past few years, it has nonetheless taken measures to reap profits from the same. Evidently, the segment’s decent performance in the last two quarters underlines the company’s efforts on this front. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s total transaction volume stands at $51.8 billion, translating into a 10% year-over-year rise.Other FactorsThe company is expected to witness further loan growth in the quarter to be reported, continuing with the previous trend, which is likely to favor the top line.Discover Financial’s frequent share buyback programs are expected to impact the bottom line positively by reducing the outstanding share count.However, the company’s extensive marketing and business development activities are likely to hurt its earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.In addition, rising level of debt resulting into increasing interest expenses, is anticipated to have put pressure on the bottom line in the first quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Discover Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Discover Financial has an Earnings ESP of -1.36%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise | Discover Financial Services Quote Zacks Rank: Discover Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.  We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the Finance sector that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this time around:Aflac Incorporated (AFL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.73% and a Zacks Rank #2.

856,DFS,"Investors who are skeptical about whether to keep their money in bonds or stocks, may bank on a key financial parameter — earnings yield. It is the inverse of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and can be used for finding undervalued stocks. Also, this ratio can be used for the comparative analysis of stocks with the market or fixed income securities.Earnings Yield can be calculated as (Annual Earnings per Share/Market Price) x 100. It is very useful in comparing a stock with other stocks as well as with fixed income securities. While comparing similar stocks, the one which gives high earnings yield should provide better returns.This ratio may also be utilized for comparing the performance of a market with the 10-year Treasury yield. When the yield of the market index is higher than the 10-year Treasury yield, stocks can be regarded as undervalued in comparison to bonds. This implies that investing in the stock market is a better option for a value investor.However, while T-bills are risk-free, investing in stocks always comes with a caveat. Hence, it would be wise to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while making comparison with the earnings yield of a stock or the broader market.The Winning StrategyWe have set Earnings Yield greater than 10% as our primary screening criterion, but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns. So, we have added the following parameters to the screen:Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S&P 500: This metric compares the 12-month forward EPS estimate with the 12-month actual EPS.Average Daily Volume (20 Day) greater than or equal to 100,000: High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity.Current Price greater than or equal to $5.Buy-Rated Stocks: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are four of the 31 stocks that made it through the screen:Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) is an automobile manufacturer in Europe. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has an expected EPS growth rate of 18.7% for the next 3-5 years. Based in Riverwoods, IL, Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) is a direct banking and payment services company in the United States.

The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FCFS has a P/B of 2.91.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DFS's Value grade of A and FCFS's Value grade of D.DFS has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than FCFS, so it seems like value investors will conclude that DFS is the superior option right now.

871,DFS,"Two major consumer loan providing companies — Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) and Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) — are slated to announce third-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, after market close. Let’s check out which stock is likely to report better earnings.Capital OneCapital One is projected to witness an improvement in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. This is likely to be driven by increase in net interest income (NII).Given the improving economy and purchase volume growth, credit card loans continued to rise during the quarter. This will aid Capital One’s credit card NII. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for credit card NII of $3.38 billion indicates a 2.7% rise from the last quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for commercial banking NII of $583 million shows 2.5% growth on a sequential basis. Nevertheless, NII for consumer banking division is anticipated to decline 3.7% from the prior quarter to $1.52 billion.Therefore, we believe Capital One will report an increase in total NII in to-be-reported quarter as rising interest rates will further support growth. Also, fee income will likely witness a rise mainly attributable to higher interchange fees.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $6.83 billion reflects 5.6% year-over-year rise.On cost front, operating expenses are expected to marginally trend upward. Specifically, marketing expenses should remain elevated with rising loan growth opportunities.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.15 shows 6% growth from the prior-year quarter. Also, our quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for Capital One as it has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read more: Card Interest Income to Drive Capital One Q3 Earnings?)Also, Capital One has a decent earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteDiscover FinancialDiscover Financial is expected to record a fall in revenues in the third quarter.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.87 billion shows 18.8% year-over-year decline.Revenue performance is mostly likely to be dismal due to its Payments Service segment, which has been a drag over the past several quarters. This quarter is expected to be no different. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its total transaction volume (in dollar terms) is $46.8 billion, down 6.6% from the last quarter.Further, card sales volume, which was a major revenue driver in the prior quarter, is projected to show a decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for card sales volume (in dollar terms) of $32 billion reflect a marginal decline sequentially. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for total credit card volume (in dollar terms) of $34.9 billion indicates an 1% fall from the prior quarter.Additionally, Discover Financial’s extensive promotional activities are likely to result in an increase in total expenses, thus impacting the bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.53 shows an 1.9% decline from the prior-year quarter.Also, our quantitative model predicts that the chances of earnings beat for Discover Financial are low. The stock has Earnings ESP of +1.24% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lower the predictive power of Earnings ESP. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.(Read more: Can Card Sales Drive Discover Financial's Q3 Earnings?)Discover Financial has an impressive earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise  Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise | Discover Financial Services QuoteOur TakeFrom both sales and earnings perspective, Capital One is well positioned to report better Q3 results.

872,DFS,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Discover Financial is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for DFS in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for DFS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.72% heading into earnings season.Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise | Discover Financial Services QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that DFS has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Discover Financial, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

873,DFS,"Total System Services, Inc.’s (TSS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results, scheduled for Jan 23, are expected to witness revenue gains from its Merchant segment on the back of its robust distribution network, product portfolio, channel diversification and fast-growing integrated channel. The acquisition of TransFirst (in April 2016) will also be accretive to the segment’s earnings in the form of higher processing volumes, product fees and processing fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment stands at $608 million, which translates into year-over-year growth of 67.5%.Total Accounts on File (AoF), a major revenue driver of the company’s Issuer Solutions segment, increased for the first nine months of 2017 and the fourth quarter is not expected to be any different. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AoF is 809 million, reflecting an increase of 7.6% year over year. Focus on new product initiatives, technology modernization and integration activities will further aid revenues in the segment.We also expect to see higher revenues from the company’s Netspend segment (acquired in 2013), which has been seeing revenue growth for many quarters in a row. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of this segment is $174 million, which reflects a year-over-year increase of 8.1%.We also expect the company to generate strong cash flow like it has been doing for the past many quarters.  Its bottom line will get an added boost from shares bought back during the quarter.Nevertheless, investments made to enhance the company’s infrastructure, longer-term product offerings and technological capabilities, should shoot up expenses and weigh on margins to some extent.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four reported quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.7%.Total System Services, Inc.

874,DFS,"American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.58, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.6%. Earnings witnessed a sharp 74% year-over-year improvement.Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by growth in card billed business, increase in total cards in force, higher Card Member spending at lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback. The company continues to witness strong loan growth and credit metrics, plus lower operating costs.The Tax ReformThe company saddled a charge of $2.6 billion on account of estimated taxes on deemed repatriations of certain overseas earnings. The remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities led to net loss of $1.41 per share compared with net income 88 cents per share a year ago.This charge has drained American Express’ capital ratio. In order to rebuild the same, the company has put on hold its share buyback plan until the first half of 2018, but has promised to continue paying dividend at the current level.Over the long haul the company, however, is sanguine about the tax reform and stated that it would invest up to $200 million more in 2018 than originally planned for customer-facing growth initiatives. It also plans to use the anticipated benefits from tax savings to provide more for its employees and shareholders.American Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteFull-Year 2017 ResultsEarnings per share were $2.97, down 47% year over year. Sans the impact of the Tax Act, earnings per share were $5.87. The company delivered better than its own expectations. It was in line with the guidance the company offered during its last results (earnings per share of $5.80 to $5.90) and higher than the initial guidance provided at the beginning of the year ($5.60 to $5.80).Revenues, net of interest expense, for the full year were $33.5 billion, up 4% year over year, driven by record billings and strong loan growth.Delving DeeperRevenues came in at $8.84 billion, 1.4% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.72 billion. Top line increased 10% year over year on higher non-interest income and interest received on loans.Provisions for losses totaled $833 million, up 33% year over year attributable to growth in the loan portfolio and an escalation in the lending write-off and delinquency rates.Total expenses of $6.2 billion decreased 1% year over year due to a decline in marketing cost, partly offset by higher rewards’ expenses.The effective tax rate was 24%, reflecting a fall from 29% in the year-ago quarter. The tax rate decrease primarily reflected the level and geographic mix of earnings as well as discrete tax items.Total expenses fell 1% year over year to $6.2 billion, primarily due to lower marketing and promotion and professional services expenses.Segment ResultsAmerican Express’ U.S. Consumer Services segment reported net income of $507 million, up 44% year over year. Total revenue, net of interest expense of $3.4 billion, was up 13% year over year, reflecting higher net interest income and Card Member spending.International Consumer and Network Services’ net income amounted to $199 million, up 137% year over year. Total revenue, net of interest expenses, climbed 7% (on a currency adjusted basis) year over year to $1.5 billion, primarily on the back of higher Card Member spending.Global Commercial Services’ net income of $580 million rose a good 52% year over year. Total revenues, net of interest expenses, increased 7% year over year to $2.7 billion, primarily reflecting higher Card Member spending.Global Merchant Services’ net income rose 12% year over year to $413 million in the reported quarter. Total revenues, net of interest expenses, increased 9% year over year to $1.2 billion on higher Card Member spending, partially offset by a lower discount rate.Corporate and Other reported net loss of $2.9 billion, which compared unfavorably with the net loss of $361 million in the year-ago quarter.2018 GuidanceThe company foresees 2018 earnings per share between $6.90 and $7.30, which represents 20% year over year increase (calculated at the midpoint).Zacks Rank & Key PicksAmerican Express carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Also, the bottom line improved 16.5% year over year.Nasdaq, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Nasdaq, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nasdaq, Inc. QuoteHigher revenues as well as growth across the segments — Market Services, Information Services and Market Technology — supported this upside. However, the improvement was limited by an increase in expenses.On a GAAP basis, the company’s net income jumped 31.2% year over year to $1.01 per share.Performance in DetailNasdaq’s revenues of record $607 million improved 3.8% year over year. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $599 million, primarily owing to organic growth of $15 million and a $7 million favorable impact on the back of changes in forex rates.    Adjusted operating expenses were $317 million in the reported quarter, remaining unchanged year over year. This represents a decline in organic expense, amounting to $4 million, offset by a $4 million unfavorable impact from changes in forex rates.Notably, the company increased the lower end of its 2017 non-GAAP operating expense to the range of $1.28-$1.29 billion from $1.26-$1.30 billion, guided earlier.Segment wise, net revenue at Market Services rose 4.3% from the year-ago quarter to $581 million. This upside was driven by improved revenues from European cash equities, higher volumes and pricing changes at NFX, increased customer demand for third-party connectivity, co-location and test facilities as well as a favorable impact from changes in forex rates.Revenues at Corporate Services slipped 0.6% year over year to $161 million. This was mainly due to a decline in in U.S. listings revenues due to the run-off of listing of additional shares fees, driven by implementation of the company’s all-inclusive annual fee. An increase in European listing services revenues partially offset the downside.Information Services revenues rose 9.5% year over year to $150 million. Higher shared tape plan revenues and audit collections, as well as higher assets under management in exchange traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes, drove the upside.Revenues at Market Technology increased 5.5% year over year to $77 million due to higher change request revenues, along with organic revenue growth in software as a service revenue and a positive impact due to changes in forex rates. However, lower software, licensing and support revenues partially offset the upside. Market Technology order intake totaled $66 million. The Nasdaq Stock Market witnessed 78 new listings during the third quarter, 34 of which were IPOs.Financial UpdateNasdaq had cash and cash equivalents of $530 million as of Sep 30, 2017, up 31.5% from 2016-end level. As of Sep 30, 2017, debt dipped 0.4% over 2016-end level to $3.59 billion.Dividend and Share Repurchase UpdateThe board of directors approved 38 cents per share quarterly dividend, which will be paid on Dec 29, 2017 to shareholders of record on Dec 15, 2017.During the third quarter, the company bought back shares worth $18 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had $255 million remaining under its buyback authorization.Our TakeNasdaq’s results reflect a decent performance. Growth looks encouraging as the company remains focused on expansion through acquisitions and organic initiatives that enable entry and open up cross-selling opportunities into new markets. The top line should also benefit from the company’s consistent focus on its strategy to accelerate non-transaction revenue base, including technology, listing and information revenues.Zacks RankNasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

877,DFS,"Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, after market close.The company is one of the major credit card issuers in the United States. It is creating an active card member base than solely relying on fund transfers at acquisitions, thus protecting the loan portfolio during times of lower balance transfers. Its Direct Banking business is a major revenue growth driver. Continuous growth in card sales and loans strengthen this segment. The company has been witnessing solid increase in card sales volume over past many years, benefitting its revenue base. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for total credit card volume and card sales are pegged at $35 billion and $32 billion, respectively, each reflecting year-over-year growth of 4%.However, the company’s Payments Service segment has been a drag over the past few years. Three pillars of this segment, Discover Network, Diners’ Club and Pulse Network has been continuously underperforming over past many years. This segment is likely to affect Discover Financial’s results in the third quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its total transaction volume is pegged at $46.8 billion, reflecting a sequential decline of 6.6%.The company has been taking steps to manage its debt level. The third-quarter margin is hence expected to be less drained by the cost of borrowings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Risk-based Capital ratio is pegged at 0.14 compared with 15.20 in the last quarter.Other FactorsDiscover Financial’s solid loan growth is also expected to be another contributor to top-line appreciation.The company’s frequently undertaken share repurchase programs, aimed at enhancing shareholders’ value, is expected to impact the bottom line positively by reducing the outstanding share count.Nevertheless, Discover Financial’s extensively undertaken promotional activities are likely to cause an increase in total expenses, thus impacting the bottom line.In addition, rising level of debt is likely to result in an increase in interest expenses in the third quarter, limiting the margin.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Discover Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Discover Financial has an Earnings ESP of -0.29%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise | Discover Financial Services QuoteZacks Rank: Discover Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies from the Finance sector that you may want toconsider as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Aflac Inc.

881,DFS,"Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.70%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterDiscover Financial is likely to witness solid revenue growth driven by strong loan growth which is one of its key focus areas.The company’s PULSE business is likely to continue its recent trend of modest growth.The recently launched Cashback Match program is expected to aid revenue growth by boosting sustained customer engagement beyond the promotion period.The company’s frequently undertaken share repurchase programs aimed at enhancing shareholders’ value, is expected to impact the bottom line positively by reducing the outstanding share count.Nevertheless, Discover Financial’s operating expenses have been showing a flat trend over past few quarters, but marketing expenses are likely to rise due to its extensively undertaken promotional activities.Also, surging medical costs for individual ACA (Affordable Care Act) compliant products might limit the margin.In addition, rising level of debt is likely to result in an increase in interest expenses in the second quarter, limiting the margin.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Discover Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Discover Financial has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.45. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Discover Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise | Discover Financial Services QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the Finance sector that you may want to consider as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.74% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is slated to report second-quarter earnings results on Aug 9.

884,DFS,"On Jan 4, 2018, we issued an updated research report on Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report). Driven by loan growth and strength in its credit card and online banking businesses, the company remains well positioned for top-line improvement. While, mounting expenses and deteriorating asset quality might hurt bottom-line growth, given a solid liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.The company’s price performance also looks encouraging. Its shares have gained 14.5% in the past year, outperforming 6.3% growth for the industry it belongs to.Further, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has also been revised 2.1% upward over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its earnings growth potential. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Capital One’s revenue growth looks promising driven by higher loan demand and acquisitions. In the last few years, it has acquired the online banking unit of ING Direct USA and HSBC Holdings Plc’s (HSBC  -  Free Report) U.S. credit card business, which has been largely driving revenues. In fact, the acquisition of Cabela's credit card portfolio further supports its growth prospects.Moreover, the company’s Domestic Card, which accounts for more than 85% of its Credit Card net revenues has shown solid loan growth and purchase volume growth. Given the domestic economic recovery, the company’s Credit Card segment should continue to show strength.A geographically diversified loan and deposit portfolio remains another positive for the company. Many of the company’s strategic decisions and inorganic expansion plans over the last few years have helped it counter economic challenges.However, elevated non-interest expenses remain a concern for Capital One. As the company continues to invest in franchise and grow inorganically, expenses are projected to remain elevated in the near term, thereby hurting bottom-line growth.Also, Capital One’s asset quality has been deteriorating over the last couple of years, with both provision for credit losses and net charge-off rates witnessing a rise.Other Stock to ConsiderA couple of other stocks worth considering in the same space are Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY  -  Free Report) and Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2.Ally Financial’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has remained stable over the last 30 days.

885,DFS,"The Fed came through as expected, but the markets seemed unimpressed. In fact, the markets appear to have been spooked by the Fed's action. Overnight reports about manufacturing weakness in China and Europe add to concerns about the U.S. growth outlook from the Fed statement.
"
886,DFS,"The fear is that all the major global economies are slowing down in a synchronized fashion. Having spent pretty much all of its firepower already, there is little that the Fed could do in the face of such a development.
"
887,DFS,"The Fed action turned out to be somewhat more aggressive than was expected, though many were skeptical of its effectiveness to begin with. The announcement of $400 billion in long-term treasury bond purchases over the next 9 months was bigger than what I wrote about the day before. These purchases will extend the duration of the Fed holdings by almost 2 years to 8 years.
"
888,DFS,"They also came out with more support for the mortgage market than was expected. The Fed came across sanguine on the inflation question, but its discussion of the growth outlook appeared to show a further downgrade from the last time around. 
"
889,DFS,"And it is this growth question that has the U.S. and global markets worried. The fact that we have weak reports about China and Europe today doesn't help the picture at all. China's September purchasing-mangers index (PMI), comparable to the U.S. manufacturing ISM report, fell below the prior month's level to 49.4. We also got a sub-50 PMI reading from the Euro-zone for the first time in almost two years.
"
890,DFS,"In the U.S., we got a sub-par outlook from economic bellwether FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and kind of an inline Jobless Claims reading. Weekly Jobless Claims dropped by a greater than expected 9K for the week to 423K 428K. The prior-week's tally was revised upwards to 432K from 428K. The relatively more stable 4-week average increased by 0.5K last week to 421K.
"
891,DFS,"The Jobless Claims numbers were not bad. But I don't think the market will be able to read anything into them. The focus will remain on the global economic slowdown, which gets an unhelpful helping hand from this morning's FedEx earnings report. FedEx met earnings expectations on a modest top-line beat, but provided weak guidance, citing slowing global economic growth.

898,DFS,"It will be a light week for economic data. The main focus of the official numbers will be on Housing, starting with the home builders index, followed by housing starts and building permits and finally existing home sales. The Fed is holding a meeting, but there will be no change in the Fed Funds rate. The language of their statement might provide clues about the potential for further unconventional easing steps that they might take.
"
899,DFS,"With few earnings and little data outside of housing, the focus of the market will likely continue to be on the other side of the Atlantic and the ongoing Greek drama....MondayThe National Association of Homebuilders Index is likely to remain unchanged at 15, which is a simply abysmal reading. This is a magic 50 index, so any reading below 50 indicates a poor outlook for the homebuilders.TuesdayThe Data on Housing Starts and Building Permits will provide the reason for the pessimism among the homebuilders. In July, housing starts were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 604,000. They are expected to decline still further to just 592,000 (I’ll take the under on that one). That is down from over 2.2 million at the height of the bubble. It used to be a rarity for housing starts to be below 1 million, but August will mark the 33rd consecutive month where starts have been below 1 million.The best leading indicator for housing starts is building permits. They ran at 597,000 in July and are also expected to be effectively unchanged rising to 598,000 (I’ll also take the under). The bubble peak was also over 2.2 million. Traditionally homebuilding has been the sector that has led us out of recessions. That locomotive is derailed and does not appear likely to get back on track anytime soon.WednesdayAll eyes will be on the Federal Reserve Board, even though everyone knows that the Fed Funds rate will remain in the 0 to 0.25% range it has been stuck in since December 2008. The Fed has pledged to keep it there until the middle of 2013. The Fed is deeply divided on if they should do more to try to support the economy by taking unconventional steps to further ease monetary policy, and the meeting was expanded to two days so they can hash things out. The language of the statement will be carefully parsed to see it they have come to any agreement. Last time there was a highly unusual three dissents to the statement. Watch to see if that changes.Existing home sales were running at an annual pace of 4.67 million in July. Very little change is expected, with the consensus looking for a slight increase to a 4.70 million rate. Since the sale of an existing home is simply the transfer of an existing asset, it generates very little economic activity (aside from realtor’s commissions). However, since people do tend to redecorate “new for them homes there is some activity that is generated. Still, the impact pales in comparison to new home sales, even though new home sales are just a small fraction of used home sales. The important thing in the report is the level of sales relative to inventory, or the months of supply on the market. That gives a very good clue as to the future direction of existing home prices. Housing equity is (or at least used to be) a vital repository of the wealth of the middle class. Since housing tends to be a very leveraged asset, relatively small changes in price can have a big impact on wealth. Also, being “underwater on a mortgage is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a foreclosure to happen. Six months supply is considered normal, and during the bubble, four months was the norm. In July it climbed to 9.4 months from 8.2 months in June, indicating continued downward pressure on housing prices.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They had a very nice decline early in they year, but have been recently in a trading range above 400,000. Last week they increased by 11,000 to 428,000. I would expect a small decline this week, but nothing big enough to really change the story of very weak job growth. The consensus is looking for 417,000. The 400,000 level is important psychologically in that it has historically been the inflection point, below which we tend to create enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate. The four-week moving average will stay above the 400,000 level, and might top 420,000. The week-to-week numbers can be very volatile, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on. The sharp rise in initial claims were an early warning of the weak jobs report for June. Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.Continuing claims have in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 12,000 to 3.726 million. That is down 765,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week. The consensus is looking for 3.730 million, a very small increase.  Some (most?) of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims rose by 10,000 last week to 3.608 million, but are down 1.352 million over the last year. Even extended benefits don’t last forever. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 7.144 million, which is down 25,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.066 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed (unlikely given the current Congress) then all extended benefits will end in January. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.FridayNothing of particular significance.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceACCURAY INC     ARAY       201106 ($0.41) $0.08  -75 20110919 AMC $5.26 LENNAR CORP -A  LEN        201108 $0.11  $0.16  75 20110919 BTO $13.85 ADOBE SYSTEMS   ADBE       201108 $0.44  $0.44  -4.76 20110920 AMC $26.12 ANALOGIC CORP   ALOG       201107 $0.44  $0.56  -9.3 20110920 AMC $45.98 AUTOZONE INC    AZO        201108 $6.97  $5.66  9.91 20110920 BTO $325.77 CARNIVAL CORP   CCL        201108 $1.63  $1.65  18.18 20110920 BTO $33.32 CARNIVAL PLC    CUK        201108 $1.62  $1.65  18.18 20110920 BTO $33.17 CONAGRA FOODS   CAG        201108 $0.31  $0.34  -2.08 20110920 BTO $23.63 FACTSET RESH    FDS        201108 $0.95  $0.82  0 20110920 BTO $87.64 FULL CIRCLE CAP FULL       201106 $0.21  $0.24  0 20110920 AMC $6.96 GENTIUM SPA-ADR GENT       201106 $0.14  $0.21  7.14 20110920 BTO $6.52 JEFFERIES GP-NW JEF        201108 $0.23  $999.00  -4.88 20110920 BTO $14.91 ORACLE CORP     ORCL       201108 $0.44  $0.39  5.8 20110920 AMC $28.95 AMER SUPERCON   AMSC       201106 ($0.08) $0.28  22.22 20110921 BTO $6.01 BED BATH&BEYOND BBBY       201108 $0.84  $0.70  16.13 20110921 AMC $59.36 COPART INC      CPRT       201107 $0.59  $0.43  1.43 20110921 AMC $41.23 FULLER(HB) CO   FUL        201108 $0.47  $0.38  8.7 20110921 AMC $21.03 GENL MILLS      GIS        201108 $0.62  $0.64  0 20110921 BTO $37.80 HERMAN MILLER   MLHR       201108 $0.33  $0.23  15.38 20110921 AMC $18.11 IHS INC-A       IHS        201108 $0.55  $0.62  1.59 20110921 BTO $79.37 RED HAT INC     RHT        201108 $0.19  $0.14  6.25 20110921 AMC $41.24 STEELCASE INC   SCS        201108 $0.17  $0.08  100 20110921 AMC $7.56 TEXAS INDS      TXI        201108 ($0.26) ($0.20) -119.23 20110921 AMC $38.77 CARMAX GP (CC)  KMX        201108 $0.51  $0.48  17.02 20110922 BTO $28.54 CINTAS CORP     CTAS       201108 $0.47  $0.40  11.36 20110922 AMC $31.59 COMTECH TELECOM CMTL       201107 $0.36  $0.73  20.51 20110922 AMC $28.17 DISCOVER FIN SV DFS        201108 $0.87  $0.47  51.39 20110922 BTO $26.19 FEDEX CORP      FDX        201108 $1.48  $1.20  1.74 20110922 BTO $77.08 FINISH LINE-CLA FINL       201108 $0.38  $0.31  0 20110922 AMC $20.50 NIKE INC-B      NKE        201108 $1.21  $1.14  6.9 20110922 AMC $88.04 RITE AID CORP   RAD        201108 ($0.18) ($0.18) 50 20110922 BTO $1.10 SCHOLASTIC CORP SCHL       201108 ($1.03) ($0.95) 17.11 20110922 BTO $27.08 SYNTHESIS ENRGY SYMX       201106 ($0.04) ($0.08) 36.36 20110922 BTO $1.60 TIBCO SOFTWARE  TIBX       201108 $0.16  $0.14  7.69 20110922 AMC $22.30 VAIL RESORTS    MTN        201107 ($1.50) ($1.16) 3.69 20110922 BTO $38.31 KB HOME         KBH        201108 ($0.17) ($0.02) -75 20110923 BTO $6.27

900,DFS,"Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.1 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. Also, earnings improved 14.6% year over year.The quarter witnessed strong growth in both top and bottom lines, fueled by strong transaction, higher cross border volumes and gains from the Vocalink acquisition.Behind the HeadlinesMastercard’s revenues of $3.1 billion exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.0% and were up 13% year over year. The upside was primarily driven by a 17% rise in the number of switched transactions to 16 billion along with a 14% increase in cross-border volumes. These were partially offset by higher rebates and incentives, mainly due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes. About 2.4 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards were issued as of Jun 30, 2017.MasterCard witnessed a year-over-year increase of 7% in total operating expenses to $1.4 billion owing to higher cost components like general and administrative expenses and advertising and marketing costs.Interest expenses increased a staggering 77% year over year to $39 million.Mastercard Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteFinancial UpdateAs of Jun 30, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $5.2 billion, down 22% from the year-end 2016 level.

"
901,DFS,"I'm sure we've all had the pleasure of waking one morning and seeing that a broker has upgraded one of our stocks. Usually that stock is in for a good day and likely several days or more after that.  
"
902,DFS,"Unfortunately, we've probably all had the experience of waking up and seeing one of our stocks downgraded as well. Usually that stock is in for a rough day, and probably more days to follow.  
"
903,DFS,"And while nobody can perfectly predict an upgrade or guard against a downgrade, it's important to know how the market reacts to these things so you can stay in your upgraded winners (or buy if you're on the fence) and consider getting out if a downgrade comes your way.  
"
904,DFS,"One thing I've been doing lately is screening for stocks that have recently seen a broker rating upgrade. This is because tests have proven that stocks with broker rating upgrades outperform those that don't get upgraded. Furthermore, they outperform even more against stocks that get downgraded.  
"
905,DFS,"By how much?  
"
906,DFS,"I created three screens and ran some tests over the last 10 years. And I applied all the below criteria to stocks trading at greater than or equal to $5 with an average daily trading volume of greater than or equal to 100,000.   
"
907,DFS,"In screen 1: I backtested only those companies with broker rating upgrades.  
"
908,DFS,"In screen 2: I tested companies with no rating change at all. Whatever the rating was, good or bad, there was no change.  
"
909,DFS,"And in screen 3: I screened only those companies that received broker rating downgrades. Results 
"
910,DFS,"The tests pretty much confirmed what I had already suspected  but the magnitude was a lot larger that I had anticipated.  
"
911,DFS,"The broker rating upgrades over the last 10 years showed an average annual return of 10.4%.  
"
912,DFS,"The ones with no rating change at all showed an average annual rerun of 6.1%.  
"
913,DFS,"And the stocks with broker rating downgrades actually showed a loss of -0.3%.  
"
914,DFS,"So the upgrades beat the ones with no rating change by nearly twice as much. And they outperformed those with downgrades even more. In fact, that was the difference between making money and losing money.  
"
915,DFS,"Below are 5 stocks that have all been upgraded within the last 4 weeks: VRUS Pharmasset, Inc.INSP InfoSpace, Inc.(DFS  -  Free Report) Discover Financial Services (MKTX  -  Free Report) MarketAxess Holdings Inc. HOTT Hot Topic, Inc.

917,DFS,"Industry Rank Analysis 8-17-11 
"
918,DFS,"Normally I like to look for either one very large industry that is doing particularly well or poorly, or a collection of smaller related industries that are. When a large number of very large related industries are also doing fairly well -- not topping the charts, but all in the top third -- it is also worth taking note of. 
"
919,DFS,"There are, however, some economic trends that cut across the conventional sector lines. That is particularly true if not all that long ago, the industry looked like a basket case.
"
920,DFS,"That is the case this week. We break the domestic banks down into six different groups -- five regions plus what we call the Major Regionals, but in the past might have been called the Money Centers. Perhaps a better current term for the group now would be the “Too Big to Fails (TBTF).
"
921,DFS,"Today I am highlighting the smaller regional banks, plus two very closely-related industries, the Savings and Loans and the Consumer Loan Companies. The TBTFs are squarely in the middle of the pack, with an average rating of 3.00.Zacks Industry Classifications
"
922,DFS,"The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 256 different industries tracked. It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well; a single firm with good news can propel a one or two firm industry to the top (or bottom) of the charts.
"
923,DFS,"It is interesting when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list. The same holds true for the bottom of the list. The definition of size that matters here is not the total sales or market capitalization but the number of companies in the ""industry.""
"
924,DFS,"Smaller Regional Bank Groups
"
925,DFS,"The Consumer Loan companies are the smallest of the seven “industries I am highlighting today, with 11 firms. That is still an above-average size for an industry. It is currently in 11th place, an improvement of one spot from last week, with an average rank of 2.36, unchanged from last week.
"
926,DFS,"The worst of the group is the second smallest at 12 firms, the Southwestern Regional Banks. It is in 80th place, an improvement of 3 spots from last week with an unchanged average rank of 2.83. Normally that would not attract my attention, but it does when all the other regional bank industries are also doing well.
"
927,DFS,"The other five are all huge in Zacks industry terms. Again, it is the number of firms in the industry, not the total market capitalization we are talking about here.
"
928,DFS,"The best of the bunch are the Western Regional Banks, in 19th spot, an improvement of 9 places from last week as the average rank dipped to 2.45 from 2.53. For an industry with 40 firms in it, that is an impressive performance.
"
929,DFS,"The Midwestern Regional Banks are in 35th place, improving seven spots with an average score of 2.58, down from 2.61 last week. That industry has 38 firms in it.
"
930,DFS,"The Northeastern Regional Banks are in 58th place, slipping one spot even though the average rank improved to 2.68 from 2.70 last week. It has 57 firms. Right on its heels are the Savings and Loans, in 59th place, down three spots on an unchanged average rank of 2.69.
"
931,DFS,"The largest of these industries is the Southeastern Regional Banks, with 75 firms. It is in 61st place, an improvement of 10 spots as the average rank dipped slightly to 2.75 from 2.76.A Multitude of Zacks Rank Buys
"
932,DFS,"All told, or the 290 firms in these industries, 39 (23.6%) of them hold the enviable Zacks #1 Rank, and an additional 69 (23.6%) have Zacks #2 Ranks. If the Zacks Ranks were random, then one would expect that 5% of the names in an industry would be #1s, and 15% would be #2s. This is by far the biggest total number of companies I have shown on these two lists in a very long time.
"
933,DFS,"The vast majority of the number ones and twos are very small firms, only two could plausibly be called large caps -- Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report) and SLM Corp, aka Sallie Mae (SLM  -  Free Report) -- and even they are more like mid-caps. Only eleven others on the two lists even break the $1 billion market cap level.
"
934,DFS,"On the other hand, twenty nine of them don’t even break the $100 million market-cap level. That does not however mean that they can’t be good investments. This is a case, though, where you might want to take a package approach -- buying five or six small positions rather than one or two large ones.
"
935,DFS,"The valuations are all over the lot, but for the most part reasonable. Particularly if you are willing to look out to 2012 earnings.  One Thing to Keep in Mind
"
936,DFS,"The biggest concern among the smaller banks has been the quality of the loans that they have made in the past. In bad economic times, people tend to default on their loans much more frequently than in good times. Many of the smaller banks have been very exposed to the real estate sector as well as to the consumer.
"
937,DFS,"Recently, though, the consumer credit picture has been improving as delinquencies have dropped. They are still at very high levels, but are at least moving in the right direction.
"
938,DFS,"Meanwhile, the basic business of a bank is to borrow money cheaply, mostly in the form of deposits, and then to lend it out at higher rates. The Fed has made clear that it is going to keep the interest rates that banks borrow at extremely low until at least the middle of 2012. The interest rates that consumers pay have come down as well, but not by as much.
"
939,DFS,"The banks then have to be able to collect what they are owed on the higher interest rate loans. That has been a huge concern over the last few years, but it looks like many of the smaller banks have made significant progress in working their way through the piles of bad debt. The lower loan loss provisions and write-offs have lead to some HUGE earnings estimate increase for both this year and next.A Final Caveat
"
940,DFS,"Most of these small firms are only covered by a handful of analysts. Thus, we might not see quite as many continued estimate increases as we do with better followed firms. One of the big reasons that an estimate in motion tends to stay in motion is that not all the analysts raise their numbers at the same time, and analysts playing “catch up help the mean estimate to continue to rise.
"
941,DFS,"That is less likely to be the case if there are just one or two analysts following the firm. Still, increases of over 50% for firms like Heartland Financial (HTLF  -  Free Report), Metro Bancorp (METR) and Encore Bancshares (EBTX) are nothing to be sneered at, particularly when they are matched with large increases for next year as well.
"
942,DFS,"If you are looking to put a bank in your portfolio, it might be a good idea to think small. These small banks, many with just a handful of branches, are not likely to be heavily exposed to things like bad European Sovereign Debt. If the bad domestic debt is being worked through, then the generosity of the Fed’s easy money policies should make the smaller banks very profitable.
"

"
944,DFS,"In evaluating the Zacks Industry Ranks, you want to see two things: a good overall score (low, meaning more Zacks #1 and #2 Ranked stocks than #4 or #5 Ranked stocks) and some improvement the relative position from the prior week. It is also helpful to understand exactly what the Zacks Industry Rank is.
"
945,DFS,"The Zacks Industry Rank is the un-weighted average of the individual Zacks ranks of the firms in that industry. It does not matter if the stock is the 800 lb gorilla that dominates the industry or some very small niche player in the industry -- they have the same influence on the industry rank.
"
946,DFS,"Also, that means that the bigger the industry in terms of number of firms, the less influence any given company has on the industry rank. It also implies that small industries, with just two or three firms, should be the ones found at either the top or the bottom of the list. After all, if there are only two firms in the industry, it is relatively easy to get a Zacks rank of 2.00 (i.e. one with a Zacks Rank of #1 and the other with a #3). Right now, that industry rank would be tied for 6th place among the 255 industries tracked.
"
947,DFS,"The same obviously goes for the bottom of the list as well. If there are 50 firms in the industry, and it ends up at one of the extremes, that means there has to be something pretty significant going on. Thus, I do not always focus on the very highest rated industries, but on the highest rated ones in which there are a large number of firms.

948,DFS,"Click here for the Zacks Industry Rank List: https://www.zacks.com/zrank/zrank_inds.php
"
949,DFS,"Industry Rank Analysis 8-17-11 
"
950,DFS,"Normally I like to look for either one very large industry that is doing particularly well or poorly, or a collection of smaller related industries that are. When a large number of very large related industries are also doing fairly well -- not topping the charts, but all in the top third -- it is also worth taking note of. 
"
951,DFS,"There are, however, some economic trends that cut across the conventional sector lines. That is particularly true if not all that long ago, the industry looked like a basket case.
"
952,DFS,"That is the case this week. We break the domestic banks down into six different groups -- five regions plus what we call the Major Regionals, but in the past might have been called the Money Centers. Perhaps a better current term for the group now would be the ""Too Big to Fails"" (TBTF).
"
953,DFS,"Today I am highlighting the smaller regional banks, plus two very closely-related industries, the Savings and Loans and the Consumer Loan Companies. The TBTFs are squarely in the middle of the pack, with an average rating of 3.00.Zacks Industry Classifications
"
954,DFS,"The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 256 different industries tracked. It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well; a single firm with good news can propel a one or two firm industry to the top (or bottom) of the charts.
"
955,DFS,"It is interesting when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list. The same holds true for the bottom of the list. The definition of size that matters here is not the total sales or market capitalization but the number of companies in the ""industry.""
"
956,DFS,"Smaller Regional Bank Groups
"
957,DFS,"The Consumer Loan companies are the smallest of the seven “industries I am highlighting today, with 11 firms. That is still an above-average size for an industry. It is currently in 11th place, an improvement of one spot from last week, with an average rank of 2.36, unchanged from last week.
"
958,DFS,"The worst of the group is the second smallest at 12 firms, the Southwestern Regional Banks. It is in 80th place, an improvement of 3 spots from last week with an unchanged average rank of 2.83. Normally that would not attract my attention, but it does when all the other regional bank industries are also doing well.
"
959,DFS,"The other five are all huge in Zacks industry terms. Again, it is the number of firms in the industry, not the total market capitalization we are talking about here.
"
960,DFS,"The best of the bunch are the Western Regional Banks, in 19th spot, an improvement of 9 places from last week as the average rank dipped to 2.45 from 2.53. For an industry with 40 firms in it, that is an impressive performance.
"
961,DFS,"The Midwestern Regional Banks are in 35th place, improving seven spots with an average score of 2.58, down from 2.61 last week. That industry has 38 firms in it.
"
962,DFS,"The Northeastern Regional Banks are in 58th place, slipping one spot even though the average rank improved to 2.68 from 2.70 last week. It has 57 firms. Right on its heels are the Savings and Loans, in 59th place, down three spots on an unchanged average rank of 2.69.
"
963,DFS,"The largest of these industries is the Southeastern Regional Banks, with 75 firms. It is in 61st place, an improvement of 10 spots as the average rank dipped slightly to 2.75 from 2.76.A Multitude of Zacks Rank Buys
"
964,DFS,"All told, or the 290 firms in these industries, 39 (23.6%) of them hold the enviable Zacks #1 Rank, and an additional 69 (23.6%) have Zacks #2 Ranks. If the Zacks Ranks were random, then one would expect that 5% of the names in an industry would be #1s, and 15% would be #2s. This is by far the biggest total number of companies I have shown on these two lists in a very long time.
"
965,DFS,"The vast majority of the number ones and twos are very small firms, only two could plausibly be called large caps -- Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report) and SLM Corp, aka Sallie Mae (SLM  -  Free Report) -- and even they are more like mid-caps. Only eleven others on the two lists even break the $1 billion market cap level.
"
966,DFS,"On the other hand, twenty nine of them don’t even break the $100 million market-cap level. That does not however mean that they can’t be good investments. This is a case, though, where you might want to take a package approach -- buying five or six small positions rather than one or two large ones.
"
967,DFS,"The valuations are all over the lot, but for the most part reasonable. Particularly if you are willing to look out to 2012 earnings.  One Thing to Keep in Mind
"
968,DFS,"The biggest concern among the smaller banks has been the quality of the loans that they have made in the past. In bad economic times, people tend to default on their loans much more frequently than in good times. Many of the smaller banks have been very exposed to the real estate sector as well as to the consumer.
"
969,DFS,"Recently, though, the consumer credit picture has been improving as delinquencies have dropped. They are still at very high levels, but are at least moving in the right direction.
"
970,DFS,"Meanwhile, the basic business of a bank is to borrow money cheaply, mostly in the form of deposits, and then to lend it out at higher rates. The Fed has made clear that it is going to keep the interest rates that banks borrow at extremely low until at least the middle of 2012. The interest rates that consumers pay have come down as well, but not by as much.
"
971,DFS,"The banks then have to be able to collect what they are owed on the higher interest rate loans. That has been a huge concern over the last few years, but it looks like many of the smaller banks have made significant progress in working their way through the piles of bad debt. The lower loan loss provisions and write-offs have lead to some HUGE earnings estimate increase for both this year and next.A Final Caveat
"
972,DFS,"Most of these small firms are only covered by a handful of analysts. Thus, we might not see quite as many continued estimate increases as we do with better followed firms. One of the big reasons that an estimate in motion tends to stay in motion is that not all the analysts raise their numbers at the same time, and analysts playing “catch up help the mean estimate to continue to rise.
"
973,DFS,"That is less likely to be the case if there are just one or two analysts following the firm. Still, increases of over 50% for firms like Heartland Financial (HTLF  -  Free Report), Metro Bancorp (METR) and Encore Bancshares (EBTX) are nothing to be sneered at, particularly when they are matched with large increases for next year as well.
"
974,DFS,"If you are looking to put a bank in your portfolio, it might be a good idea to think small. These small banks, many with just a handful of branches, are not likely to be heavily exposed to things like bad European Sovereign Debt. If the bad domestic debt is being worked through, then the generosity of the Fed’s easy money policies should make the smaller banks very profitable.
"

976,DFS,"In evaluating the Zacks Industry Ranks, you want to see two things: a good overall score (low, meaning more Zacks #1 and #2 Ranked stocks than #4 or #5 Ranked stocks) and some improvement the relative position from the prior week. It is also helpful to understand exactly what the Zacks Industry Rank is.
"
977,DFS,"The Zacks Industry Rank is the un-weighted average of the individual Zacks ranks of the firms in that industry. It does not matter if the stock is the 800 lb gorilla that dominates the industry or some very small niche player in the industry -- they have the same influence on the industry rank.
"
978,DFS,"Also, that means that the bigger the industry in terms of number of firms, the less influence any given company has on the industry rank. It also implies that small industries, with just two or three firms, should be the ones found at either the top or the bottom of the list. After all, if there are only two firms in the industry, it is relatively easy to get a Zacks rank of 2.00 (i.e. one with a Zacks Rank of #1 and the other with a #3). Right now, that industry rank would be tied for 6th place among the 255 industries tracked.
"
979,DFS,"The same obviously goes for the bottom of the list as well. If there are 50 firms in the industry, and it ends up at one of the extremes, that means there has to be something pretty significant going on. Thus, I do not always focus on the very highest rated industries, but on the highest rated ones in which there are a large number of firms.

981,DFS,"I'm sure we've all had the pleasure of waking one morning and seeing that a broker has upgraded one of our stocks. Usually that stock is in for a good day and likely several days or more after that.  
"
982,DFS,"Unfortunately, we've probably all had the experience of waking up and seeing one of our stocks downgraded as well. Usually that stock is in for a rough day, and probably more days to follow.  
"
983,DFS,"And while nobody can perfectly predict an upgrade or guard against a downgrade, it's important to know how the market reacts to these things so you can stay in your upgraded winners (or buy if you're on the fence) and consider getting out if a downgrade comes your way.  
"
984,DFS,"One thing I've been doing lately is screening for stocks that have recently seen a broker rating upgrade. This is because tests have proven that stocks with broker rating upgrades outperform those that don't get upgraded. Furthermore, they outperform even more against stocks that get downgraded.  
"
985,DFS,"By how much?  
"
986,DFS,"I created three screens and ran some tests over the last 10 years. And I applied all the below criteria to stocks trading at greater than or equal to $5 with an average daily trading volume of greater than or equal to 100,000.   
"
987,DFS,"In screen 1: I backtested only those companies with broker rating upgrades.  
"
988,DFS,"In screen 2: I tested companies with no rating change at all. Whatever the rating was, good or bad, there was no change.  
"
989,DFS,"And in screen 3: I screened only those companies that received broker rating downgrades. Results 
"
990,DFS,"The tests pretty much confirmed what I had already suspected  but the magnitude was a lot larger that I had anticipated.  
"
991,DFS,"The broker rating upgrades over the last 10 years showed an average annual return of 10.4%.  
"
992,DFS,"The ones with no rating change at all showed an average annual rerun of 6.1%.  
"
993,DFS,"And the stocks with broker rating downgrades actually showed a loss of -0.3%.  
"
994,DFS,"So the upgrades beat the ones with no rating change by nearly twice as much. And they outperformed those with downgrades even more. In fact, that was the difference between making money and losing money.

998,DFS,"Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) is one of the major card issuers in the United States and a leading innovator in the credit card industry.In the recent past, Discover Financial witnessed solid growth in its total loans — comprising credit card loans, personal loans and private student loans. It also saw improvement in credit quality trends. Management anticipates total loan portfolio to grow 5.5-7.5% by the end of 2017.The company's banking business has been performing well for the past many years. Within this business, the private student loan portfolio has grown significantly from $1 billion in 2010 to nearly $9 billion in 2016 followed by further improvements in 2017In the last six months, shares of the company have gained 26%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 13.7%.The stock price appreciation may primarily attributed to the company’s solid brand recognition, strong credit card business, continuous product innovation and customer acquisition strategies.Moreover, the company’s capital strength enables it to take up several capital deployment initiatives to enhance shareholders’ value. Notably, Discover Financial has received non-objection from the Fed for its proposed capital actions.However, the company’s bottom-line growth has been limited by increasing costs. Discover Financial incurs substantial expenses owing to marketing and business development. These apart, anti-money laundering program enhancements, infrastructure investments and high legal, regulatory and compliance costs have contributed to the escalating expenses.In addition, the company’s over dependence on debt has resulted in a continuous increase in the level of leverage. The rise in level of debt has also led to increase in interest expenses since 2012. This rising level of financial leverage has resulted in financial risk and increasing interest expenses that continue to weigh on the margins.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDiscover Financial presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Payments space can consider companies like Green Dot Corporation (GDOT  -  Free Report), Western Union Company (WU  -  Free Report) and Total System Services, Inc.

1000,DFS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Discover Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.1 as you can see below:This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at 21.4. If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock the current level puts Discover Financial’s current PE among its highs. This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its own historical levels.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Discover Financial has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 12.6 – which is faintly lower than the current figure. So it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Discover Financial stock in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, the company has a P/S ratio of about 2.5. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Discover Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Discover Financial a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the EV/EBITDA for Discover Financial is 9.2, a level that is lower than the industry average of 12.3. The EV/EBITDA multiple (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) is capital structure-neutral, as it takes into account the level of debt on a company’s balance sheet, not just its equity.What About the Stock Overall?Though Discover Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C. This gives DFS a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B.

The current year has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the next year estimate has seen six upward revisions and one downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current year consensus estimate has increased by 0.7% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has inched higher by 0.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Discover Financial Services Price and Consensus Discover Financial Services Price and Consensus | Discover Financial Services QuoteEven though Discover Financial has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineThe Finance – Consumer Loans industry is characterized by stiff competition that weighs on the individual companies’ financials. The adverse impact of currency fluctuation has also been hurting the industry. Also, the future success of this space is dependent on the companies’ ability to adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards, any failure in which might cause major decline in revenues.Currently the industry carries a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 23% out of more than 250 industries), which dims the sparkle on Discover Financial stock too. As you can see below, the industry has also widely underperformed the broader market over the past three years.Thus, value investors might want to wait for broader factors to favorable before investing in it.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1001,DFS,"Banking on three solid quarters of 2017, the board of Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) announced incremental capital deployment plans, thereby augmenting shareholder returns.In an attempt to boost capital efficiencies, the company hiked its regular quarterly dividend by 14% to 25 cents per share from the prior payout of 22 cents. The raised dividend will be paid on Feb 9, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jan 9.The increased payout takes the annual dividend to $1.00 from 88 cents paid in 2017. At the current price, the raised yearly dividend yields 0.7%, up from the prior yield of 0.6%.Alongside this hike, the board of Mastercard sanctioned a new share repurchase program worth $4 billion. Including $1.5 billion from the last approval, the company currently has $5.5 billion worth of shares available for buybacksSolid Capital DeploymentMastercard boasts a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility and continued cash generated (that has been increasing save in 2014) from operating activities since 2009. It generated $4.5 billion of operating cash flow in 2016, up 11% year over year. The same was up 8.5% year over year as of Sep 30, 2017.The company’s disciplined capital management strategy by way of share buyback and dividend payments remains impressive. Last December, the company announced a new share buyback program of $4 billion and increased its quarterly dividend by 16%.  Factors at PlayArmed with strong liquidity and cash flows, we believe Mastercard is well positioned to implement the latest capital plans. The improved outlook for card spending, cross-border volumes, gross dollar value and payment volume generation given the recent strategic alliances, improving global economies and rapidly growing digital payments are likely to improve financials, going forward.Notably, global spending through credit and debit cards has grown consistently, boosting cross-border volumes, which drives revenues for card giants. Given the onset of the holiday season, we also expect improved transaction volumes and digital payments as shopping and traveling will be in the cards for most global citizens.Moreover, numerous acquisitions made in recent years have further strengthened the company’s long-term inorganic growth profile, without risking its capital. These factors will likely lead to lucrative shareholder returns and retain market confidence.Share Price PerformanceSo far this year, the stock has returned 42.8%, significantly outperforming the 25.3% gain logged by the industry.Peer TakeOther players in the same space like Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) and American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) raised their dividend payments this year by 18%,16.7% and 9%, respectively. These companies have been generously returning excess capital through share buybacks as well.Zacks RankCurrently, Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1002,DFS,"Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) has inked a deal with YellowPepper, a mobile payments pioneer in Latin America. The agreement aims at accelerating the adoption of new payment solutions in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).Per the terms of this alliance, YellowPepper will help Visa issuers, acquirers and merchants implement solutions in order to offer customers new payment experiences. Notably, YellowPepper is also expected to provide assistance in project management services, UX design and services for the development and delivery of mobile applications.Visa has always made strategic partnerships in order to maintain its competitive edge. It makes up for almost half of credit card payments and three-fourth of debit card payments, thereby dominating the global electronic payments market.Previously, the company had partnered with PayPal in Jul 2016 to deliver significant benefits for Visa's issuing financial institutions. These included a significantly better experience for customers, more spending volume on their credit and debit cards, lower operational costs and improved security.Visa’s shareholders have viewed these moves favorably, which is evident from its stock’s performance. Year to date, the stock has gained 24.2%, whereas the Zacks categorized Financial Transaction Services industry rallied 20%. This new partnership is likely to result in further improved trading experience for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.YellowPepper is a certified Visa token service provider which enables it to have a standards-based approach and access to Visa’s broad network of tools and services, including the Visa Token Service, as well as integration, development and marketing support.Per the deal, YellowPepper’s digital payment platform will be clubbed with Visa Token Service to build digital payment experiences while protecting sensitive information. It will be combined with Visa Checkout to make online payment easier through mobile devices. It will also be integrated with Visa Direct, allowing consumers to transfer funds more conveniently.As the payments industry shifts from plastic to digital, along with other big players like MasterCard Inc (MA  -  Free Report), Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report), Total System Services, Inc (TSS  -  Free Report), Visa seeks to provide simple, convenient and secure payment solutions, regardless of the device being used.YellowPepper has the skill set and existing footprint in the region which would not only help Visa to further penetrate in new use cases and segments but also stay focused on its aim to collaborate with new technologies to deliver new user experiences. So the partnership is expected to provide a truly powerful hassle-free digital experience to consumers and businesses in LAC.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies  It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1003,DFS,"I'm sure we've all had the pleasure of waking one morning and seeing that a broker has upgraded one of our stocks. Usually that stock is in for a good day and likely several days or more after that.  
"
1004,DFS,"Unfortunately, we've probably all had the experience of waking up and seeing one of our stocks downgraded as well. Usually that stock is in for a rough day, and probably more days to follow.  
"
1005,DFS,"And while nobody can perfectly predict an upgrade or guard against a downgrade, it's important to know how the market reacts to these things so you can stay in your upgraded winners (or buy if you're on the fence) and consider getting out if a downgrade comes your way.  
"
1006,DFS,"One thing I've been doing lately is screening for stocks that have recently seen a broker rating upgrade. This is because tests have proven that stocks with broker rating upgrades outperform those that don't get upgraded. Furthermore, they outperform even more against stocks that get downgraded.  
"
1007,DFS,"By how much?  
"
1008,DFS,"I created three screens and ran some tests over the last 10 years. And I applied all the below criteria to stocks trading at greater than or equal to $5 with an average daily trading volume of greater than or equal to 100,000.   
"
1009,DFS,"In screen 1: I backtested only those companies with broker rating upgrades.  
"
1010,DFS,"In screen 2: I tested companies with no rating change at all. Whatever the rating was, good or bad, there was no change.  
"
1011,DFS,"And in screen 3: I screened only those companies that received broker rating downgrades. Results 
"
1012,DFS,"The tests pretty much confirmed what I had already suspected  but the magnitude was a lot larger that I had anticipated.  
"
1013,DFS,"The broker rating upgrades over the last 10 years showed an average annual return of 10.4%.  
"
1014,DFS,"The ones with no rating change at all showed an average annual rerun of 6.1%.  
"
1015,DFS,"And the stocks with broker rating downgrades actually showed a loss of -0.3%.  
"
1016,DFS,"So the upgrades beat the ones with no rating change by nearly twice as much. And they outperformed those with downgrades even more. In fact, that was the difference between making money and losing money.  
"
1017,DFS,"Below are 5 stocks that have all been upgraded within the last 4 weeks (for 4/28/11):

"
1021,DFS,"In spite of the global economic collapse that has left a trail of smoke and ash across the credit markets and severely dented consumer spending, consumers continue to utilize their credit cards as a measure of convenience and a source of short-term liquidity.
"
1022,DFS,"Credit Is Convenient
"
1023,DFS,"In the old days (80's and 90's), the infrastructure didn't yet exist to support the wide-spread use of non-monetary exchanges. But now, with credit swiping machines at every fast food restaurant and grocery store under the sun, pulling out the plastic saves time and money by avoiding the trappings of the insidious ATM machine, inconveniently located and overpriced. Why pay $2 for a $20 withdrawal when you can save time and money by passing along transaction costs to merchants? 
"
1024,DFS,"Credit Cards Drive Liquidity
"
1025,DFS,"Beyond convenience, credit cards have become a staple and relied upon source of short-term liquidity for the majority of Americans who live ""pay-check to pay-check."" With incomes and spending fluctuating wildly due to economic volatility, the credit card frequently becomes the option of first resort to satisfy short-term obligations. 
"
1026,DFS,"Credit Card Companies Not Created Equally
"
1027,DFS,"These structural changes have been a bastion of growth for the credit card industry over the last few years. But all credit card companies are not created equally, which brings us to the key point of this investment conversation, the difference between companies operating on a transaction basis and those that issue and subsidize consumer debt. 
"
1028,DFS,"Transaction oriented credit card companies have held up much better than their debt issuing brethren and look well positioned to prosper on a long-term basis with strong earnings and assets. Here is a more detailed look at the fundamentals associated with each respective group of card companies. 
"
1029,DFS,"Transaction OrientedMastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) does not issue debt, the company's revenue is derived on a transaction basis. This has been a feather in the companies hat as defaults continue to plague creditors. Mastercard's share price is down more than 50% over the last 9 months, but the good news is that estimates have stabilized, providing an opportunity to capture better value. Mastercard Snapshot Research Report.Visa, Inc., (V  -  Free Report) has also traded lower in the volatile market of the last 9 months, but the company's recent first-quarter performance was impressive, showing 35% earnings growth from last year. The next-year estimate is down a mere 10 cents in the last 3 months, pegged at $3.18 per share, an 18% earnings growth projection. Visa Snapshot Research Report.Buyer BewareAmerican Express (AXP  -  Free Report) is in the process of shutting down unprofitable business segments that were designed to capitalize on the credit frenzy. This has not been a profitable long-term strategy for the company, hurting its stronger core results. Shares of AXP continue to head lower in the credit tumult, dropping from $52 to a recent range between $11 and $12. Estimates have fallen in tandem, with the current-year sliding to $1.04 per share from $2.23 just 90 days ago. American Express Snapshot Research Report.Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) is projected to lose 3 cents per share in the current year, down from a gain of 93 cents just 90 days ago.

1051,DFS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Discover Financial Services has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.48, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.36. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Discover Financial Services’ current PE level puts it close to its midpoint over the past five years. Notably, the current level stands below the highs for the stock, hinting at some scope for entry.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Finance sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.78. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Discover Financial Services’ forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company’s share price as of now. We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Discover Financial Services has a P/S ratio of about 2.22. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.16 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this stands below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Discover Financial Services currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Discover Financial Services a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Discover Financial Services is just 1.11, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.48. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, DFS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Discover Financial Services might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘C’ and a Momentum score of ‘D’. This gives DFS a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘B’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to one upward revision, while the full year estimate has seen three down and two up in the same time period.This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 2.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Discover Financial Services Price and Consensus  Discover Financial Services Price and Consensus | Discover Financial Services QuoteIn light of these bearish trends, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which indicates that we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineDiscover Financial Services is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks categorized Finance – Consumer Loans industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

Also, earnings grew 23% year over year.Better-than-expected results were primarily due to higher switched transactions, increase in cross-border volume and gains from acquisitions.

1055,DFS,"Last week, the Federal Reserve published data showing credit card delinquencies reached 4.86% in the first quarter. This was the highest rate since the third-quarter of 2002.
"
1056,DFS,"Credit card charge-offs were above their historical average as well, reaching 4.7%. The last time charge-offs reached this level was during the fourth-quarter of 2005.
"
1057,DFS,"At the same time, use of revolving debt has increased. Revolving debt totaled $957.2 billion in March, a 7.9% increase. March marked the biggest annual increase in over a year.
"
1058,DFS,"The problems are not just limited to this side of the pond either. Standard & Poor's recently calculated increases in British credit delinquencies and charge-offs, at 5.88% and 6.51%, respectively.
"
1059,DFS,"The potential for a credit card crisis is a worry for some bears, and the concern is not completely unwarranted. The housing slump, rising food and energy prices and a weak labor market is forcing more people to rely on credit cards.
"
1060,DFS,"The data on the probability of a credit card crisis remains inconclusive, however:
"
1061,DFS,"Last week, Home Depot's (HD) CFO, Carol Tome, told Dow Jones that her company was tightening lending standards and raising interest rates on a co-branded card it offers with Citigroup (C  -  Free Report).
"
1062,DFS,"Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of U.S. operations for Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), has observed a decreased usage of ""credit as a form of payment"" since the third-quarter.
"
1063,DFS,"Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) recently released statistics showing delinquency rates falling to 3.9% in April, from 4.04% in March and 4.36% in January. The annualized net charge-off rate rose slightly, however, to 6.08%.
"
1064,DFS,"American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) experienced a rise in delinquency rates to 3.8% during the first quarter, up from 3.4% during the fourth quarter. The net write-off rate jumped to 5.5%, from 4.5%.
"
1065,DFS,"Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) saw its delinquency rate reach 3.93% and its charge-off rate reach 4.37% during the first quarter.
"
1066,DFS,"The trends are not positive, but neither do they suggest that another financial crisis is about to occur. There is speculation that people would sooner have their homes foreclosed on than give up their credit cards. This seems logical since a credit card gives a person spending power, regardless of their housing situation.
"
1067,DFS,"The biggest question is whether there will be more charge-offs and delinquencies over the next several months. Though above historical averages, the numbers for the first quarter are still well below the high water marks seen previously. For example, delinquencies stayed above 5% throughout 1991 and into 1992. Charge-offs nearly reached 8% during the first-quarter of 2002.
"
1068,DFS,"Still, the current situation is bad enough to give investors another reason to avoid financial stocks. The sector continues to account for a disproportionate level of negative estimate revisions and the rising level of credit card late payments is just another factor weighing on earnings estimates. (Full-year earnings estimates for both COF and DFS have been cut within the past 30 days.)
"
1069,DFS,"It should also be noted that many of the large credit card issuers, such as Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), also provide multiple other financial services. Therefore, while AXP, COF and DFS may be more reliant on their card businesses than most, the problems with the credit card delinquencies are more of a sector problem than an industry or company-specific issue.

GameStop is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Mar 18, before the start of trading.

Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Mar 20, before the start of trading.
"
1087,DFS,"First-quarter estimates have also been falling on Bear Stearns (BSC) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report). Given Friday's announcement about BSC's liquidity problems, the firm's financial status will be more important than its earnings announcement. GS has not missed earnings expectations since 2005, though the trend in estimate revisions suggests this streak is at risk of being broken.

1093,DFS,"September is going to end with a focus on housing. KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) will both report and August existing home sales and August new home sales data will be released. Housing data junkies will even get quarterly results from Bed, Bath and Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report) and August construction spending numbers.
"
1094,DFS,"Will the data be able to sustain the post 50 basis point rate cut euphoria? It seems doubtful given that even if the numbers point to a temporary bottom, the number of adjustable rate mortgages resetting will continue to climb. In addition, property taxes in many municipalities have also risen, meaning that even if homeowners are given a break on the severity of the interest rate resets, there will still be many who can't afford their homes. In other words, the housing slump is far from over.
"
1095,DFS,"The major equity indexes are trading back near their 52-week highs. The Dow is literally just two relatively good days from setting a new record high. Whether the market has enough upward momentum to continue rising is difficult to say. Third-quarter profits are expected to be decent, though oil seems to be sticking above $80 per barrel and the dollar is in the toilet. On the other hand, every euro dollar of profit earned is worth about $1.40 when translated back into U.S. currency, something portfolio managers will be keeping in mind when putting some end-of-quarter dressing on their portfolios.
"
1096,DFS,"Only 42 companies have been confirmed to report, eight of which are in the S&P 500. In addition to BBBY, KBH and LEN, Cintas (CTAS  -  Free Report), Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report), Jabil Circuit (JBL  -  Free Report), McCormick & Co. (MKC  -  Free Report) and Paychex (PAYX  -  Free Report) will providing quarterly results.
"
1097,DFS,"On the economic front, August existing home sales data and the Conference Board's September consumer confidence index will be released on Tuesday. Wednesday features August durable goods orders. August new home sales, final second-quarter GDP numbers and weekly initial jobless claims data will be published on Thursday. Friday brings August personal income and spending, August construction spending, the University of Michigan's final September consumer confidence index and the September Chicago PMI.

1098,DFS,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Sep 24 - 28TIBCO Software (TIBX) recently warned that non-GAAP fiscal third-quarter earnings would be in the range of four to five cents per share. CEO Vivek Ranadive said that he saw ""a large amount of potential business fall out in the last few days of the quarter"". The overwhelming majority of the covering brokerage analysts cut their forecasts in response, pushing the consensus estimate down by a penny to four cents per share. TIBX has missed for two consecutive quarters. TIBCO is scheduled to release earnings on Thursday, Sep 27, after the close of trading.

"
1104,DFS,"Key Points:First quarter season is over. Median surprise of 3.70% and surprise ratio of 3.03 for EPS, 1.32% and 2.23 for revenues. Solid growth of 17.1% (19.1% ex-Financials) reported. Slowdown from fourth quarter pace of 30.9%, mostly due to super financial company growth in 4Q. Growth ex-Financials as 19.8% in 4Q.Just a handful (26) of S&P 500 2nd quarter results in. Off to a strong start, with 20.1% year-over-year earnings growth, and 10.0% revenue growth. Median earnings surprise 5.61% and median sales surprise 1.88%. Remaining firms (474) expected to grow 9.65%, 12.2% growth expected, excluding Financials.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 jumps 45.9% in 2010, expected to rise 17.0% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 13.6%. Financials a major earnings driver in 2010. Excluding Financials growth was 27.8% in 2010, and expected to be 17.8% in 2011 and 11.7% in 2012.Total revenues for the S&P 500 rise 7.80% in 2010, expected to be up 5.84% in 2011, and 6.37% in 2012. Excluding Financials, revenues up 9.19% in 2010, expected to rise 9.97% in 2011 and 5.88% in 2012.Annual Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.39% in 2009 to 8.65% for 2010, 9.51% expected for 2011 and 10.21% in 2012.Margin Expansion major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.08% in 2009, 8.28% for 2010, 8.87% expected in 2011, and 9.36% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 0.87 for 2011, at 0.95 for 2012, both neutral readings. Sharp drop from recent weeks, but driven by old increases falling out, not new cuts. Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 1.09 for 2011, 1.07 for 2012, marginally positive readings. Total revisions activity near-seasonal lows.S&P 500 earned $544.3 billion in 2009, rising to $793.8 billion in 2010, expected to climb to $928.9 billion in 2011. In 2012 the 500 are collectively expected to earn $1.055 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.12 in 2009: $83.32 in 2010 and $97.46 in 2011 expected bottom up. For 2012, $110.70 expected. Puts P/Es at 15.9x for 2010, and 13.6x for 2011 and 11.9x for 2012, very attractive relative to 10-year T-note rate of 3.18%. Top-down estimates, $95.95 for 2011 and $104.01 for 2012.First Quarter Slower Growth, Still Strong
"
1105,DFS,"The first quarter earnings season is done. Net income growth was 17.12%. While that is down from the extremely strong 30.9% in the fourth quarter, it is still a very healthy growth rate. Almost all of the growth slowdown is from a failure of the Financial sector to repeat the massive growth they posted in the fourth quarter.
"
1106,DFS,"Growth excluding the Financials was 19.1%, down only slightly from the 19.8% growth posted in the fourth quarter. Before the first quarter earnings season started, it was expected that growth would be just 6.7% for the S&P 500 as a whole, and 10.2% excluding Financials.Second Quarter Earnings Season Beginning
"
1107,DFS,"We now have 26 S&P 500 firms that have already reported their second quarter results. We are off to a very strong start. Those 26 firms posted total net income growth of 20.1% over a year ago. That is down just slightly from the 21.9% growth that those same 26 firms posted in the first quarter.
"
1108,DFS,"The results were also much better than expected, with a median surprise of 5.61% and a 3.60 surprise ratio for earnings. Top-line results are also off to a strong start, with 10.0% year-over-year growth for the 26, actually up from the 9.45% growth they posted in the first quarter. If anything, the top-line surprises have been even better than the bottom-line surprises, with a median surprise of 1.88% and a massive 7.67 surprise ratio.
"
1109,DFS,"In the early going, though, the medians and surprise ratios can see very sharp fluctuations, so it is still a bit early to read too much into the results. For the vast majority (474) still to report, the rate of growth is expected to continue to slow in the second quarter, with total growth of 9.65% and growth of 12.18% if the Financials are excluded.
"
1110,DFS,"Note, however, that those year-over-year growth expectations are still higher than the expectations for the first quarter before the first quarter earnings season started. I would be very surprised if we didn’t end up with double-digit growth on both a total and ex-Financials basis. Normally about three times as many firms will report positive surprises as disappointments, and that in turn makes the initial growth projections very conservative.
"
1111,DFS,"Revenue growth for the remaining firms is also expected to slow to 5.60% among those yet to report, down from 6.28% they reported in the first quarter. All of the slowdown, and then some, is expected to come from the Financials. Excluding them, growth is expected to accelerate to 9.72% from 7.15% in the first quarter. Much of the strong revenue growth is coming from the commodity-oriented Energy and Materials sectors.Net Margin Expansion
"
1112,DFS,"Net margins continue to expand. The 26 that have reported have net margins of 8.44%, up from 7.73% a year ago. The remainder are expected to post net margins of 9.62% up from last year’s 9.14. The Financials continue to be the key drivers of overall margin expansion. If the Financials are excluded, net margins are still expected to expand, but just to 8.94% from last year’s 8.71%.
"
1113,DFS,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.39% in 2009. They hit 8.65% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.51% in 2011 and 10.21% in 2012.
"
1114,DFS,"The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.08% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.28% in 2010. They are expected to rise to 8.87% in 2011 and 9.36% in 2012.Full-Year Expectations
"
1115,DFS,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $793.8 billion in 2010, up from $544.3 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $928.9 billion, or increases of 45.9% and 17.0%, respectively. The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 Trillion mark to $1.055 Trillion.
"
1116,DFS,"That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $110.70. That is up from $57.12 for 2009, $83.32 for 2010 and $97.46 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding 2.92%, a P/E of 15.85x based on 2010 and 13.55x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 11.93x.
"
1117,DFS,"There has been a sharp decline in the ratio of estimate increases to estimate cuts over the last few weeks, with the Revisions ratio for 2011 falling to 0.87 from 1.09 two weeks ago. It was close to 2.0 for both years at the height of the last earnings season. For 2012, the ratio is down to 0.95 from 1.18 two weeks ago. Most of that decline has been due to old estimate increases falling out of the sample than due to a flood of new estimate cuts.
"
1118,DFS,"We are nearing the seasonal low point in estimate revisions activity. While the numbers are still firmly in the neutral zone, the sharp fall off is a bit of a yellow flag. If it continues to be lackluster as revisions activity picks up in a few weeks it will be a significant reason for concern.Fundamentals Remain Solid
"
1119,DFS,"The fundamental backing for the market continues to be solid. It is important to keep your eyes on the prize.
"
1120,DFS,"There is lots of news out there, and much of it is more dramatic than earnings results, but rarely does it have more significance for your portfolio. Earning are -- and are going to remain -- the single-most-important thing for the stock market. Interest rates are an important, but distant second. 
"
1121,DFS,"We certainly had an impressive week in the market last week, with the S&P climbing by almost 60 points or 4.67%. The rise through Thursday was just about enough to offset the losses earlier in the quarter and bring the second quarter to a nearly flat close.Greek Drama to Continue
"
1122,DFS,"The gains on Friday got the third quarter off to a strong start. The primary reason for the rally is that the Greek debt can was successfully kicked down to road. This is not the end of the Greek drama by any means. Soon enough they are going to find that the road is a cul-de-sac. The austerity programs that were imposed on the Greek economy as the cost of getting the loans are shrinking its economy.
"
1123,DFS,"It is extremely unlikely that Greece will ever be able to pay the money back, and the debt will be restructured (aka partial default). So is the whole exercise pointless? Perhaps not, if the European banks use the time to build up their capital so when Greece does default, they will not go under as well. Either Greece will be a perpetual charity case, propped up by mostly Germany, or it will leave the Euro and go back to a very much devalued Drachma. Unscrambling that egg will not be easy or painless.The Debt Ceiling
"
1124,DFS,"The big remaining worry is the debt ceiling fight on this side of the Atlantic. The difference between Greece and the U.S. is that Greece is unable to pay its debts. The U.S., if the debt ceiling is not raised, will simply be unwilling to do so. That would be entirely an unforced error.
"
1125,DFS,"The Government of the United States defaulting on its debt would likely have a much larger impact on the markets and the economy than the impact of Lehman Brothers defaulting on its debts. The nation would be shoved right back into recession, and one deeper than the one that followed the Lehman collapse. If that happens, then corporate profits would also collapse.
"
1126,DFS,"However, when push comes to shove, I find it hard to believe that even Congress could let that happen. While not the most likely case, the chance of no increase by the time the ceiling is hit is a very real possibility.
"
1127,DFS,"Over the long term we need to close the budget gap, but we need a balanced approach to it. In theory, both tax increases and spending cuts tend to slow an economy, but by how much varies a great deal depending on the nature of the tax increases and the nature of the spending cuts. Cutting tax subsidies for, say, ethanol is likely to be far less damaging than, say, cutting spending on infrastructure.
"
1128,DFS,"The most recent plan being discussed is a package of 87% spending cuts and 13% revenue increases, almost all of the revenue increases are from cutting spending that is embedded in the tax code, and which mostly benefits the wealthy. I think that is way out of balance already.
"
1129,DFS,"There is a good argument that what Obama should do is simply ignore the debt ceiling and issue debt anyway. There are substantial grounds that the debt ceiling is unconstitutional in Section Four to the 14th Amendment, but an equally strong argument based on Article One, Section Eight that doing so would have the Executive branch stepping on the Legislative branch’s turf. It could provoke a Constitutional crisis.
"
1130,DFS,"In the end, I find it almost impossible to imagine the debt ceiling not being either raised or ignored. The most likely scenario, and the one that the markets are clearly betting on, is that there will be a last-minute settlement....But What If...?
"
1131,DFS,"The chance of this game of chicken having a tragic ending is no longer trivial. That tragic ending would result in a huge market crash.
"
1132,DFS,"Taking out some insurance would make a lot of sense in here. My preferred way of doing so would be to buy some out of the money September puts. On the the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) the September 120 puts are only trading for $0.89. Obviously I hope that they would expire worthless, just as I hope that my life insurance policy does not pay off anytime soon. Still, it is insurance that would be well worth having.
"
1133,DFS,"On balance I remain bullish, and I think we will end the year with the S&P 500 north of 1400, but that does not mean we will have a smooth ride between here and there. Strong earnings should trump a dicey international situation and the drama in DC (provided it turns out to be just drama, and the game of chicken does not end in tragedy).
"
1134,DFS,"Valuations on stocks look very compelling, with the S&P trading from just 13.55x 2011, and 11.93x 2012 earnings. That is extremely competitive with the 3.18% yield on the 10-year Treasury note.    However, be prepared to move to the exits (or have some put protection in place) if it looks like the debt ceiling will not be raised.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseFirst quarter season done, and the second quarter season starting. So far, 26 (5.2%) S&P 500 reports in. Off to a strong start, with year-over-year growth of 20.1% -- a 3.60 surprise ratio, and 5.61% median surprise.Positive year-over-year growth for 20, falling EPS for 6 firms (3.33 ratio); 76.9% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Very early, the percentages and ratios will change dramatically over next few weeks.Construction and Finance lead in surprises (but just one report each).
"
1135,DFS,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front. Early on the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things. Pay attention to the percent reporting in evaluating the significance of the sector numbers.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise 4Q Reported Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction -65.00% 9.09% 75.00 1 0 1 0Finance 220.54% 1.25% 51.39 1 0 1 0Basic Materials 53.15% 4.35% 13.51 1 0 1 2Consumer Discretionary -3.37% 9.68% 8.21 3 0 7 1Retail/Wholesale 17.89% 16.67% 5.45 6 1 4 2Computer and Tech 14.32% 8.45% 1.90 3 3 1 0Transportation 33.17% 11.11% 1.74 1 0 4 0Consumer Staples 15.89% 11.11% 0.93 2 1 1 0Business Service 2.59% 5.56% 0.00 0 0 1 0Medical NA NA NA NA NA NA NAAuto NA NA NA NA NA NA NAIndustrial Products NA NA NA NA NA NA NAConglomerates NA NA NA NA NA NA NAAerospace NA NA NA NA NA NA NAOils and Energy NA NA NA NA NA NA NAUtilities NA NA NA NA NA NA NAS&P 500 20.08% 5.20% 5.61 18 5 20 6Sales SurprisesStrong revenue start, revenue growth of 10.0% among the 26 that have reported, median surprise 1.88% (very strong), surprise ratio of 7.67.Growing Revenues outnumber falling revenues by ratio of 4.20, 80.7% have higher sales than last year.Still too early to come to a conclusion, but we are off to a very good start.

"
1138,DFS,"The first table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. The second shows the largest declines. To qualify there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
1139,DFS,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.

1140,DFS,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2011, not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2011, even though I may call it 2011 in the report. All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.
"
1141,DFS,"Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) just charged into a new multi-year high, gaining traction on an impressive 51% Q1 earnings surprise. Estimates have since jumped higher, providing more upward momentum for this Zacks #1 rank stock. 
"
1142,DFS,"Company Description
"
1143,DFS,"Discover Financial Services, together with its subsidiaries, operates as a credit card issuer and electronic payment services provider primarily in the United States. The company was founded in 1986 and has a market cap of $14.4 billion.
"
1144,DFS,"DFS has been posting huge gains over the last 12 months in the improving consumer environment, with volumes jumping higher are credit losses falling sharply. That trend continued in late June when the company reported strong Q1 results that came in well ahead of expectations.
"
1145,DFS,"Record First-Quarter Results
"
1146,DFS,"Net interest income for the period was up 4% from last year to $1.2 billion. Revenue net of interest expenses came in at $1.74 billion, up 5% from last year. But earnings is where the real magic happened, coming in at $1.09, 51% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the company has an average earnings surprise of 49% over the last four quarters.
"
1147,DFS,"The good quarter was driven by declining delinquency rates, hitting a 25-year low of 2.79% while its net charge off rate fell to 5.01%. Payment Services was also a bright spot, with pretax income up 19% from last year to $43 million.
"
1148,DFS,"Buying Shares Back
"
1149,DFS,"Discover also announced that the Board of Directors had approved a $1 billion share buy back program for the next two years.
"
1150,DFS,"Estimates
"
1151,DFS,"We saw some very bullish movement in estimates off the good quarter, with the current year adding 74 cents to $3.48.
"
1152,DFS,"Valuation
"
1153,DFS,"But in spite of the gains, DFS still has tons of value, trading with a forward P/E of 7.7X, a nice discount to its peer average of 8.7X.
"
1154,DFS,"12-Month Chart
"
1155,DFS,"On the chart, shares recently rebounded from a long-term trend line and jumped into a new multi-year high on the good quarter. Take a look below.
"
1156,DFS,"Michael Vodicka is the Momentum Stock Strategist for Zacks.com. He is also the Editor in charge of the Zacks Momentum Trader Service. 
"
1157,DFS,"It has been nearly a month since the last Fed meeting. Since the Aug 8 meeting, the subprime rabbit hole has expanded and caused a climate of fear within the credit markets. Central banks have responded, with the Fed both cutting its discount rate and encouraging banks to use the discount window. The actions are an attempt to prevent the fear of rising defaults from turning into a scenario where credit is too tight. Numerous recessions have been caused by overly tight credit standards that often came in response to lending practices that were too lenient.
"
1158,DFS,"To date, the problems within the credit markets have affected the overall outlook for earning growth. The consensus earnings estimate continues to call for S&P 500 earnings to total $94.06 this year.
"
1159,DFS,"Nonetheless, it would seem logical that full-year forecasts for financial-related firms have been falling. To gage the trend, I compared the current consensus earnings estimate for 520 companies against the Aug 8 consensus estimate for the same firms. The results were not as clear cut as one might expect.
"
1160,DFS,"First the raw numbers. The average forecast was cut on 137 companies and raised on 78 firms. The average downward revision was -15.9% (a number partially skewed by American Home Mortgage) (AHMIQ) and the average upward revision was 10.7%. Excluding the three companies with the largest revisions from each group results in an average change of -9.5% and 3.9% respectively. The average change for all 520 companies was -2.6%.
"
1161,DFS,"Behind the numbers are more subtle changes. During the past four weeks, 170 full-year EPS forecasts have been raised and 260 estimates have been cut, a Zacks Revisions Ratio of 0.65. (For the entire Zacks Rank universe, the ratio is about 1.0). Out of the 170 forecasts that were revised upwards, approximately one-fourth were concentrated among just seven companies: Allied World Assurance (AWH), Royal Bank of Canada (RY  -  Free Report), Nasdaq Stock Market (NDAQ  -  Free Report), Apollo Investment Company (AINV  -  Free Report), Blackstone Group (BX  -  Free Report), International Securities Exchange (ISE) and Toronto Dominion Bank (TD  -  Free Report).
"
1162,DFS,"Not surprisingly, Finance-Mortgage and Related Services played a notable, negative role. Full-year earnings estimates have been cut on eight of the 12 companies within this group. American Home Mortgage is now projected to post a loss of $1.21 instead of the 90-cent profit it had been expected to achieve. Similarly, profit expectations for Countrywide Financial (CFC) have been cut to $2.37 per share from $3.06 per share, a 23% drop over the period of a month.
"
1163,DFS,"Brokerage analysts are also becoming less optimistic about Finance-Consumer Loans. Full-year forecasts have been cut on about half of the companies within this group, including credit card issuers Capital One Financial (COF  -  Free Report) and Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report). The consensus estimate calls for COF to earn $5.14 per share this year versus the month-old forecast of $7.05. Projections for DFS have been cut by four cents since Aug 8 to $1.61 per share.
"
1164,DFS,"The outlook for the regional banks is basically negative with scattered pockets of optimism at the company-specific level. Out of 261 companies within Banks-Midwest, Banks-Northeast, Banks-Southeast, Banks-Southwest and Banks-West, 54 have incurred cuts in their consensus earnings estimates whereas just 20 have been beneficiaries of positive revisions. Out of these industry groups, only Banks-Southwest has a seen an upward revision in the average forecast and this is solely attributable to Southside Bancshares (SBSI  -  Free Report). Both of the covering brokerage analysts raised their full-year forecasts after the East Texas bank topped second-quarter expectations by six cents.
"
1165,DFS,"Forecasts for the major investment banking firms had been holding up, in aggregate, until the past few weeks. Ahead of Goldman Sachs' (GS  -  Free Report) fiscal third-quarter report (scheduled for Sep 20 - two days after the next Fed meeting), five brokerage analysts have lowered their projections. The cuts mark a sharp reversal, since analysts had previously raised their full-year projections multiple times. The cumulative impact of the cuts has been 0.8% cut in the average forecast since Aug 8. Estimates have also been cut on Lehman Brothers (LEH) and Bear Stearns (BCS), two companies that are likely to report during the same week as GS. Full-year forecasts are down 1.8% for LEH and 7.8% for BSC, though expectations for the latter started falling after the disappointing fiscal second-quarter report. Overall, brokerage analysts lowered their projections on 13 companies within Finance-Investment Brokers and raised projections on just 10.

"
1168,DFS,"It's that time again. Every few months, I like running this screen to find the new Top Sectors. And now it's especially timely after the 6 week correction we've just come off of. 
"
1169,DFS,"And since roughly half of a stock's price move can be directly attributed to the group that it's in, it's important to stay on top of this.  
"
1170,DFS,"By definition, a strong Sector or strong Industry will have more of its companies moving higher than a weak Sector or weak Industry.    
"
1171,DFS,"If the majority of stocks are going down in an industry, it can't be a strong industry. If more stocks are going up, it is a strong industry.  
"
1172,DFS,"I've done some testing over the past, and what's interesting is that I've found just getting into an average stock in a strong group will often times outperform the best stocks in a troubled group.  
"
1173,DFS,"This doesn't mean you can just pick anything and make money. Far from it. But it illustrates how powerful the underlying group is to the success of your stock picking.  
"
1174,DFS,"There are several ways you can define the best Sectors or Industries.  
"
1175,DFS,"One of my favorite ways is to look at the percentage of stocks trading within 10% of their 52-week highs.  
"
1176,DFS,"Specifically, I'll calculate the number of stocks trading within 10% of their 52-week highs and then divide that by the number of stocks in their group to get a percentage. The higher percentage of stocks trading near their highs, the better the group will score.  
"
1177,DFS,"Some people like looking at the percentage price change over the last 12 or 24 weeks. And that's fine, but I don't think its sensitive enough.  
"
1178,DFS,"If a group has been outperforming over the last 12 to 24 weeks, but then has a significant correction, it might still be ranked a top group because the gains were so large in the first part of the 12 or 24 week period that even a large pullback over a span of many weeks can be lost within the larger run-up that preceded it.  
"
1179,DFS,"But by checking their position in comparison to their 52-week highs, a simple 10% pullback from their 52-week high will show up right away. And if more and more companies within that group are pulling back from their highs by more than 10%, it'll be reflected in that Sector's rating and alert the investor that something systemic might be happening to that group as a whole rather than something that's just stock specific.  
"
1180,DFS,"Groups with a higher percentage of stocks trading at or near their 52-week highs shows something positive is happening to the entire group for so many stocks to be trading near their highs.  
"
1181,DFS,"Currently, the top sectors (that's the top 50% of sectors out of 16 different sectors) are: 
"
1182,DFS,"1) Utilities - 49% 
"
1183,DFS,"2) Consumer Staples - 38%
"

1191,DFS,"Earnings Preview 6/17/11
"
1192,DFS,"Earnings season is over for the first quarter, and we are starting to see the early second quarter firms report, those with May fiscal periods.  Its still very light, with a total of just 36 firms are due to report, however, that includes 14 from the S&P 500.
"
1193,DFS,"The firms reporting this week include:  Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report), Conagra (CAG  -  Free Report), Discover (DFS  -  Free Report), Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL) and Walgreens (WAG).  That is a nice cross section of industry, and should provide some nice clues as to how the overall second quarter earnings season will go. 
"
1194,DFS,"It will also be a relatively light one for economic data.  The focus will be on housing with both new and existing home sales due out.  Of the two, New home sales are much more important to economic growth.  The level of inventories relative to sales is the key thing to look at with existing home sales since those give a good clue to the direction of existing home prices, which are extremely important.  We also get data on new orders for durable goods, and the final look at first quarter GDP, a very important measure, but very stale at this point.  Along the way the Fed is meeting and will probably do nothing with regard to either the Fed Funds rate or additional quantitative easing.  Analysts will however parse the statement closely, looking for any changes from the last one.
"
1195,DFS,"MondayNothing of significance.
"
1196,DFS,"TuesdayExisting Home Sales are expected to fall to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.78 million from 5.05 million in April.  What is more significant will be the level of inventories, and if the April months of supply rate of 9.2 months will continue to trend up.  While down from last summer, the level is still extremely high and has been rising again in recent months (it was 8.3 in March) and indicates strong downward pressure on home prices.  That really is what to watch in the existing home sales numbers, since the amount of economic activity generated by an existing home changing hands is not really that big a deal.   Home prices are a very big deal.  Unfortunately it looks like they are falling again. 
"
1197,DFS,"WednesdayThe Federal Reserve is universally expected to keep the Fed Funds rate in the 0 to 0.25% range it has been in since December 2008.  Of more interest will be the commentary at the end of the meeting and how it has changed since the last meeting.  I would expect that it will make more references to economic softness than the prior statement, but that it will continue to see the weakness as temporary.  They will also probably continue to reinvest the proceeds of the securities they have bought in the first two rounds of quantitative easing, but are unlikely to embark on a third round.  Essentially the Fed is going to be on hold for some time, at least through the end of the year if not longer.
"
1198,DFS,"ThursdayWeekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out.  They had a very nice decline early in they year, but then had a very rough month or so in April and May.  Last week they fell by 16,000 to 418,000.   A slight increase is expected next week, rising to 418,000.     The four week moving average will probably stay well above the 400,000 level, where it has been for the last eight weeks (and weekly claims have been above the level for 10 weeks now).  The sharp rise in initial claims were an early warning of the weak jobs report for May.  Robust job expansion is generally associated with initial claims below the 400,000 level.
"
1199,DFS,"Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 21,000 to 3.675 million.  That is down 910,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week.  The consensus is looking for a level of 3.680 million, a slight increase.   Some of the longer term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks.  Those however, dont last forever either.  Federally paid extended claims fell by 115,000 to 3.885 million, and are down by 1.410 million over the last year.    Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake.  They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 7.401 million, which is down 209,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not exactly match the change in the total).  The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.200 million below year ago levels.  What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity, finding a new job, and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits.  Given the differential between job growth and the decline in total people getting benefits, it looks like about 1 million people have simply run out of benefits, and have not found new work.  Make sure to look at both sets of numbers!  Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.New Home Sales are expected to fall to a 305,000 rate from 323,000 in April. That is simply a pathetic level, even if it is slightly off the record low set in January. The records go back to the Kennedy administration.  If we do come in at 305,000, that is still lower than any month prior to 2010.  Unlike used home sales, each new home sold represents a lot of economic activity.  Thus this is a very important report.  Normally, new home sales are what leads the economy out of recessions, but they have been a huge drag this time around.
"
1200,DFS,"FridayNew Orders for Durable Goods are expected to rise by 1.0% after falling 3.6% in April.  Previous months are often revised significantly for this data, and those revisions can be just as important as the current months data.   Much of the strength expected comes from the highly volatile transportation equipment segment (which was also a big factor in last months decline).  Since they are so high priced, a few orders for jetliners can really push around the total number, but the orders tend to be lumpy.  Excluding transportation equipment, new orders are expected to rise 0.6% partially reversing a 1.5% decline last month.
"
1201,DFS,"The third (and final) look at GDP growth in the first quarter is released.  Both of the earlier reads were a disappointing growth rate of just 1.8%, down from growth of 3.1% in the fourth quarter. The consensus is looking for no change in the number this time around.  That is an anemic rate, particularly coming out of a deep recession.  The composition of the growth rate is just as important as the overall growth rate itself.  Growth that comes from the build up of inventories for example is of much lower quality than business investment in new equipment and software.  We will provide a complete breakdown of which parts of the economy are adding to growth, and which are serving as brakes on economic growth, and how the contributions have changes since the first look at the numbers last month.
"
1202,DFS,"Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
1203,DFS,"Historically the best indicators of firms which are likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises.  Similarly a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks rank (4 or 5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.  Given the small number of firms reporting this week, there are not many candidates for potential positive or negative surprises, and so I will omit this section.  In the Earnings calendar below, $999.00 should be read as N.A.

1205,DFS,"This week brings the initial batch of third-quarter results. Seven early reporters from the S&P 500 - all of whom have quarters ending in August - will report: Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Pall (PLL). In total, we will see results from 20 companies.

1214,DFS,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises
"
1215,DFS,"One analyst just raised his fiscal third-quarter profit forecast on Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report). The revision pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate a penny higher to 28 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 32 cents per share. Though the software company has only matched expectations over the past 2 quarters, it did top during the previous 4 quarters. Adobe is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 15, after the close of trading.
"
1216,DFS,"Three analysts raised their fiscal second-quarter projections on Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) over the past few weeks. The changes have resulted in a Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents per share, a penny higher than the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is slightly more bullish at 42 cents per share. BBY has topped expectations for 3 consecutive quarters. Best Buy is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 15, before the start of trading.
"
1217,DFS,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) preannounced fiscal first-quarter earnings of 58 cents per share today. The number is well above both the company's guidance and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents per share. Fiscal second-quarter guidance also looks strong at a range of 65 to 95 cents per share. Though the surprise should be baked into the price, if reaction to the conference call is favorable, there is the possibility of additional upside. FDX is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 17, before the start of trading.
