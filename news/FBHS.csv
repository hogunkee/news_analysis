11,FBHS,"Planning to move into a new house or have your heart set on that long overdue kitchen or bath remodel? Either way, it’s going to be tough to avoid the products of Fortune Brands Home and Security (FBHS).With offerings in cabinets, plumbing, exterior doors, locks and safes, the 2011 spinoff from its eponymous former parent -- a company later renamed and absorbed by a Japanese firm -- has the home basics territory pretty well blanketed five years after staking its own claim. But no, Fortune doesn't sell blankets.Aided by the revival in new home sales and continuing strength in home remodeling and repair markets, Fortune has been on a roll. Last year's sales increased by 14% to $4.6 billion. Earnings rose to $1.88 a share from $1.64 in 2014. With special charges stripped, earnings totaled $2.07 a share.Executives have issued a rosy forecast for 2016, expecting sales to grow -- with a full year of revenue reflecting Fortune's 2015 acquisition of cabinet manufacturer Norcraft Companies -- by a healthy 10-12%.Kitchen and bath cabinets, along with plumbing products, are Fortune's biggest revenue producers. In last year’s fourth quarter, cabinets -- swelled by the Norcraft acquisition -- produced $608.1 million in sales. That was just under half of Fortune's $1.224 billion quarterly total.Plumbing, headlined by the Moen brand of faucets, contributed 29% of corporate sales. Security products, which include both the Master Lock and SentrySafe brands, chipped in just under 12%. Doors, featuring fiberglass and steel models by Therma-Tru, accounted for another 9%.Fortune is clearly a play on both new home construction and the repair and remodeling markets, all of which have rebounded from the housing scandals and meltdown of 2007-08. Last year, the home repair and remodel market grew by 5%, according to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.Kermit Baker, project director for Remodeling Futures at the Harvard center, expects a comparable spending expansion this year.""We’re seeing mid single-digit growth -- around 5% -- through the remainder of 2016,"" he said.Already, the repair and remodeling market has rebounded to the prior peak levels of 2007, he noted. Replacement parts for the likes of roofing, siding and doors have been in recovery for some time.But now discretionary kitchen and bath remodeling, hit hard when the housing bubble burst, are starting to come back, Baker says.This is certainly good news for Fortune, which thrives on kitchen and bath replacements and additions.In cabinets, Fortune is especially strong in selling to Home Depot (HD) and Lowe’s (LOW), which accounted for roughly 35% of the sector’s 2015 sales. The purchase of Norcraft in May 2015 strengthened its position among independent dealers.""There are higher margins in the dealer channel,"" noted Jim Barrett, analyst with C.L. King.The cabinet market peaked at $15 billion in 2005, according to Mike Wood, analyst with Macquarie Research. It pretty much collapsed after the housing bust, bottoming at $6.8 billion in 2011, he noted. But by last year, it had rebounded back to $10.2 billion.""We actually see cabinets as one of the fastest-growing verticals in building products,"" said Wood.Cabinets offer Fortune the broadest growth. But plumbing supplies bring the richest margins. While adjusted margins are 3.4% for cabinets, they’re 19.5% in plumbing, according to a recent research report by RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall.Fortune’s plumbing business benefits from ""long-term commitments with new home builders,"" said Tim Wojs, analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. Wojs added that plumbing ""can be a product that sells the home.""Moen faucets are the big seller but recently Fortune has promoted new offerings in a related line: garbage disposal units. One of the things Fortune has done well is expand related product categories, often by acquisition. Thus, for example, one buyout enabled Fortune to add bathroom vanities to its cabinet line.Analysts believe Fortune has the financial firepower to do more buyouts. Wojs estimates that Fortune will have $1 billion in free cash flow over the next three years. This, along with a relatively unleveraged balance sheet that can access new debt, will give the company a substantial war chest. Some of that can go into new deals.""The deal is the big swing factor for Fortune Brands,"" said Macquarie’s Wood. The big question is whether they can find complementary companies at an accretive price, said Wood. He notes also that some major Fortune shareholders would prefer a deal to share buybacks.""The shareholders would be disappointed with a huge share buyback as opposed to acquisition,"" he noted.One likely buyout sector, said Wojs, is plumbing. He sees an opportunity for some international expansion there. To this point, Fortune has been mostly focused on the U.S., with international sales accounting for just 15% of its revenues.For now, though, Fortune can ride rebounds in home construction and remodeling and enjoy the fruits of some well-executed recent expansions.Said C.L. King’s Barrett: ""It’s a company that has done a very effective job in capitalizing on the rebound in construction and remodeling as well identifying solid strategic acquisitions.""

17,FBHS,"Many retailers, especially those largely dependent on brick-and-mortar stores for sales and profits, are suffering through a rough patch, but home improvement chains such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) should do just fine, analysts say.Home Depot will report third-quarter results Tuesday, followed by Lowe's on Wednesday. Both are expected to log double-digit profit growth on sales gains in the mid-single digits.The home improvement sector marches to its ""own drummer"" — the housing market — ""and should be less impacted by the recent retail malaise,"" said analyst Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets in a client note.Private fixed-residential investment, viewed as a proxy for U.S. housing-related spending, was up 10.7% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth, he noted.Home Depot's earnings are seen rising 19% from a year ago to $1.32 per share on revenue of $2.18 billion, up 6%, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Lowe's is expected to earn 78 cents per share, up 32% from last year, on revenue of $1.43 billion, up 5%.While an unseasonably warm autumn can disrupt retail sales patterns, it might actually have benefited the two home improvement chains by extending the busy summer/fall selling season, he said.And he noted ""fairly positive"" commentary from vendors such as Sherwin-Williams (SHW), Fortune Brands (FBHS) and Whirlpool (WHR) during the third quarter.However, rural lifestyle chain Tractor Supply (TSCO) faced ""modest weather-related headwinds"" on heat-related products during the warmer-than-usual quarter. But overall, Tractor Supply benefited from the extended summer selling season, the analyst said.Shares of Home Depot, which tumbled 3% on Friday, closed up 0.7% on the stock market today. Lowe's finished 2.2% higher after losing 3.6% Friday.Home Depot and Lowe's both earn Composite Ratings from IBD of 82 out of a best-possible 99, based on metrics such as growth in earnings and stock, but that is down from the low 90s three months ago.Follow Marilyn Alva on Twitter @IBD_MAlva.

23,FBHS,"Whip out the shades. Acuity Brands' (AYI) fourth quarter shined brighter than Wall Street expected, easing worries about possible dimming as the LED-lighting-fixture company looked toward future smart street lights and interconnected systems.Shares recently faced pressure after rival Eaton (ETN) said at the Citi Industrials Conference on Sept. 17 that lighting had been weak since July, recalls Cowen & Co. analyst Jeffrey Osborne. But Acuity's 29% Q4 earnings growth to $1.63 a share and 14% revenue rise to $759.5 million pleased investors Wednesday, sending shares up 3.7%. Analysts had expected $1.62 on $754.9 million in Q4.For the year, per-share earnings grew 36% to $5.39, topping views by a penny. Revenue grew 13% to $2.71 billion, slightly ahead of consensus estimates of $2.7 billion.""I think investors went into the call with lower expectations of growth rates because of industrial peer commentary,"" Stifel analyst Sven Eenmaa told IBD. But Acuity showed ""very strong execution. That is clearly a positive. It looks like not a whole lot has changed in terms of market growth. Execution remains strong. They're executing on strategy.""Sales grew across most product categories and regions, with LED-based lighting solutions accounting for more than half of total Q4 net sales. And LED product sales grew ""by almost 50%"" this last quarter, CEO Vernon Nagel told analysts.Seven Years Ago: What's LED?Contrast this to seven years ago, when Acuity ""sold virtually no LED-based fixtures."" Nagel said the company invested ""significantly"" to become the digital-lighting market leader.He also noted that the key nonresidential construction market is still about 20% off its 2008 peak, while Acuity's net sales have grown 34% over that time. Acuity's business is split fairly evenly between new construction and renovation.""Our profitability and cash flow for the quarter and full year were records for Acuity, even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio ... a huge opportunity to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the Internet of Things,"" said Nagel.Interconnectedness is growing as ""smart"" homes and commercial buildings tap into the so-called Internet of Things.Buying Distech Controls, a building-automation and energy-management firm, ""makes a lot of sense"" for Acuity, said Cowen's Osborne. Distech integrates lights, HVAC, closed-circuit television and other energy efficiency systems.""The Holy Grail is to have a platform that can be the quarterback of that system,"" he said. ""Distech is one of the building blocks.""Management expects that its acquisition of Distech, completed in September, will be ""modestly accretive"" to the company in fiscal 2016. Acuity disclosed on Monday a partnership with Silver Spring Networks to co-develop a ""networked street-light control solution"" for cities, utilities and other networks, including ""smart"" street lights that can automatically dim or brighten depending on the weather.Internet Of Things Needs TimeAnalysts say Acuity's foray into the Internet of Things is mostly strategic and has yet to affect revenue, but the company could start to see material results in few years.""It remains a largely lighting and LED story, but they're sowing the seeds to drive growth here a couple of years (out),"" said Eenmaa.Acuity is a member of IBD's Building-Construction Products/Miscellaneous industry group, which ranks No. 21 out of 197 groups. Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS), Apogee Enterprises (APOG) and Mohawk Industries (MHK) are among its publicly traded peers in the group.Aside from Eaton, Acuity's competitors in the lighting space include Hubbell (HUBB), Philips (PHG), General Electric (GE) and several smaller companies.Lower-cost LED products have helped Acuity. Conversely, the trend has weighed on LED light-bulb maker Cree (CREE), which said in June that it would restructure its LED business to reflect overcapacity and downtrending prices.Cree shares are off 20% this year. Acuity stock is up 30% to 182.69.Strength In DiversificationAnalysts wonder about the August decline of AIA's Architecture Billings Index (ABI), a nonresidential building activity indicator. The index dipped below the key 50 mark to 49.1 from July's 54.7, though AIA's chief economist, Kermit Baker, said the ""minor dip should be quickly reversed.""Acuity is well-diversified enough to withstand August's downtick, said Stifel's Eenmaa.Acuity does not provide earnings guidance, but management highlighted the improving North American economy and consensus estimates for the region's lighting industry to grow in the ""mid- to upper-single-digit range"" for the company's fiscal 2016.Nagel expects its gross profit margin to ""improve over time.""Outpacing The MarketManagement is optimistic about its growth prospects.""Further, we expect to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve by executing our strategies to focus on growing renovation and tenant improvement projects, expand into underpenetrated geographies and channels, and grow from the continued introduction of new products and lighting solutions as part of our integrated, tiered solutions strategy,"" said Nagel.

31,FBHS,"The U.S. economy is picking up steam, yet the Federal Reserve is reluctant to put the brakes on its ultra-liquid monetary policy. How do these factors influence an investor's stock-picking strategy?Actually, not that much. Although second-quarter GDP growth (at 3.7%) is encouraging, and Wall Street economists see GDP strengthening in Q3 and Q4 this year, investors should focus on companies that are widely expected to post solid double-digit earnings increases not only in the current full year but in the next fiscal year.Today's Your Weekly Review offers a decent supply of choices to that end. Let's boil the list down further by focusing only on those stocks that are trading, say, only 5% below their 52-week peaks or less. That's far better than the maximum 15% level below the 52-week high as demanded by the screen.Nike (NKE) is building a base that is approaching six weeks in length.

75,FBHS,"Now that its $650 million merger with cabinet manufacturer Norcraft is a done deal, Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS) is looking for new acquisitions to build out its house of home products.It's big in cabinets, doors, faucets and security locks and safes.What's next on the company's to-do list?""We completed all the cabinet acquisitions we need; we're very well positioned there,"" Chief Financial Officer Lee Wyatt told IBD.Fortune Brands sells more than a dozen cabinet brands for kitchens and baths to thousands of small dealers as well as home center chains such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW). But its top faucet in North America, Moen, could use some company, Wyatt says.""The top 10% (in faucets) is luxury, the bottom 15% is private label. And 75% is everything in the middle, where Moen plays,"" he said.If Fortune Brands were, for instance, to add luxury faucets to its lineup, it could leverage its U.S. distribution channel and add a new brand to more than 1,000 of its Moen stores in China.""We're in talks with many potential targets,"" Wyatt said. ""Hopefully plumbing will be our next acquisition.""Fortune Brands is a lot of things, but one common theme is its acquisitive streak.A $1.1 Billion Spending SpreeSince it spun off from its consumer-brands namesake in 2011, leaving the Jim Beam liquor business with its former parent, now known as Beam Suntory, Fortune has spent $1.1 billion on acquisitions. It also spent $500 million on share buybacks and $200 million on dividends over that time.Robert Wetenhall, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, calls Fortune Brands a ""best in class"" home-products company, with brands that have leading market positions in all its four major categories: cabinets, plumbing, doors and personal security products.Beside Moen, it enjoys the leading share with MasterBrand cabinets, Therma-Tru entry doors and Master Lock padlocks.Moen has a 30% share of the faucet market in the U.S., followed by Masco (MAS), the maker of Delta faucets, with a share in the low 20% area, Wyatt says. Kohler is No. 3. In the more fragmented cabinet market, Fortune has a 20%-25% share, with Masco No. 2 and American Woodmark (AMWD) No. 3, Wyatt says.""In the cabinet industry, more than 50% of the market share comes from small local manufacturers,"" he said. ""We have multiple trade brands in cabinets, but brands are not as important as they are in plumbing. Many consumers don't recognize the (cabinet) brands.""Our real customer in the cabinet space is the kitchen designer who works in a dealer or home center,"" he continued. ""We don't advertise the brands as such. Roughly 6,000 small kitchen and bath dealers drive over 50% of the demand for cabinets. Home centers are the next biggest, about one-third of industry demand.""On the other hand, faucets and security products are marketed and advertised directly to consumers.Windows Out, Doors InFortune Brands said one reason it sold Simonton Windows last September was to focus ""more sharply"" on its Therma-Tru entry doors.Fortune Brands is well positioned to ride the ongoing recovery in new-home construction and home repairs and remodeling. Most of its business is in the U.S., but it also sells products in Canada, China (chiefly with Moen) and Europe (mainly with Master Lock).Residential building in China has slowed, but Wyatt says Moen stores have ""stayed strong"" as units in newly developed multifamily complexes are sold. Units aren't usually finished with plumbing fixtures.""As they sell out units, buyers come to our (Moen) stores. They could be coming to us for several years as units are sold.""In the U.S., Fortune Brands expects the U.S. housing market to return to a typical ""steady"" pace of 1.5 million home starts annually by 2018, including single- and multifamily units. That would be up from just 600,000 in 2011 and about 1.1 million this year.But an even bigger part of the market that Fortune Brands sells into is repair and remodeling, which accounts for about two-thirds of revenue. The company sees that market, which had been lagging in recent years, growing by 5% this year and then moving to a normal rate of 5% to 6% annual growth.""We've got a little more room to grow (in repair and remodeling),"" Wyatt said.Management expects U.S. home-product sales overall to see faster growth in the second half of the year than the first half, for full-year growth of 6% to 8%. But they expect the company to outperform the overall market. With Norcraft factored in, the company now sees 2015 net sales growth of 13% to 15%.In its Q2 report on July 22, Fortune Brands raised full-year earnings guidance on the low end, to $2.03-$2.10 from $2-$2.10 previously, including an expected 4-5 cents from Norcraft. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast earnings of $2.06, for an 18% year-over-year gain, and 22% next year. Revenue this year is seen by analysts rising 15% to $4.6 billion.Norcraft Spikes SalesThomson Reuters noted Q2 earnings of 59 cents beat consensus by 2 cents. The company reported second-quarter revenue up 13% to $1.17 billion. Cabinet sales jumped 18% to $550.9 million. Excluding the impact from Norcraft, which closed May 12, sales grew 8%.Norcraft increased Fortune Brand's presence in the dealer channel where, as analyst Kenneth Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets noted, there is ""higher-end buyer demand.""Plumbing sales rose less, 5% to $358 million, but those products come with higher margins than cabinets.Growth in door sales slowed from a year-ago, but margin on earnings before interest and taxes improved to 12.9% from 8.8% last year.Security sales jumped 28% to $138.6 million, driven by the acquisition of Sentry Safe last year.Top Ratings Among MidcapsDespite Fortune Brands' share-price gains since its Q2 report, RBC Capital Markets says the company ""remains our best idea"" for midcap investors who combine tenets of growth and value investing.Barclays is ""overweight"" on the name due mainly to ""a strong management team and a portfolio of industry leading brands."" KeyBanc Capital is also ""overweight."" JPMorgan is neutral.Fortune Brands is highly scored by IBD, with a Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99. Masco, which broke out on July 28 after a strong earnings report, has a Composite Rating of 96.Acuity Brands (AYI), a lighting supplier, has a 99 rating.

116,FBHS,"Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.
"
117,FBHS,"This approach is working. It has made his $9.7 billion Artisan Mid Cap Fund a top performer among the largest diversified U.S. stock portfolios.
"
118,FBHS,"In the 12 months ended Jan. 31, its 31.18% return topped 91% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its 16.94% average annual gain in the past three years topped 92% of its rivals.
"
119,FBHS,"Kamm, 40 years old, discussed his investment course with IBD from his office in Milwaukee.
"
120,FBHS,"IBD: In addition to Mid Cap, you run $906 million Artisan Global Opportunities and $1.7 billion Small Cap . How does managing different cap-size and style funds help you?
"
121,FBHS,"Kamm: Our team includes a group of analysts and five portfolio managers who work collaboratively to identify best ideas. We've been at this over 15 years. That level of tenure and trust is important.
"
122,FBHS,"We look up and down the market-cap scale and globally. That gives us broad perspective. We like to think we're better midcap investors because we know small-cap competitors and international emerging markets competitors that U.S. midcap companies increasingly face.
"
123,FBHS,"IBD: You divide your portfolio into three types of stocks. What's the advantage?
"
124,FBHS,"Kamm: The nomenclature we use is garden, crop and harvest.
"
125,FBHS,"Garden stocks are ones we believe are just emerging. We try to be early into them. We guard against risk by keeping garden positions small.
"
126,FBHS,"When a garden position turns out right and profit growth plays out, we allocate more into it and push it into our crop bucket or portfolio. Those are our largest positions and fewest positions. That's where we feel the profit cycle has been largely de-risked.
"
127,FBHS,"The third area is harvest, where we reduce positions.
"
128,FBHS,"IBD: How are you tweaking new buys to cope with the expected slow-growth economy?
"
129,FBHS,"Kamm: We've been focused on uniquely positioned franchises that are exposed to some strong growth trends. You see some signs, especially in the U.S., that the economy is getting better. Housing and jobs are examples. But emerging markets are struggling to grow at the same rates they experienced a few years ago.
"
130,FBHS,"We're focused on durable, high-quality franchises. We're less interested in high-commodity businesses and materials. And those business models are very cyclical, economy sensitive, but tend not to meet our franchise characteristics criteria.
"
131,FBHS,"IBD: What are some real-world examples, please, as of your latest disclosure?
"
132,FBHS,"Kamm: We're focused on innovation in health care. We're 10 years past the first sequencing of the human genome. Now we're seeing benefits in novel drug targets.
"
133,FBHS,"Regeneron (REGN) is an example. They have a drug called Eylea, which is a retinal drug for age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for the elderly. It was launched in 2011. In its second full year it sold $1.4 billion. It's a strong driver of company sales and profits.
"
134,FBHS,"Regeneron also has a diverse pipeline of additional opportunities to extend its profit cycle into the future.
"
135,FBHS,"They were all discovered in Regeneron's own labs, but primarily funded by Sanofi, a large French drug company, in return for the ability to market these drugs and share profits.
"
136,FBHS,"IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) recently gapped up after reporting strong results and guidance. Its 30% earnings per share growth was the second straight quarterly acceleration. What's your thesis?
"
137,FBHS,"Kamm: We think they're positioned for growth. They have a very strong brand associated with high-quality ingredients. They have a significant opportunity to grow their footprint of restaurants in the U.S., and ultimately internationally.
"
138,FBHS,"They're executing well. They're getting customers through serving lines quicker. They've enhanced menus. They're offering office catering. They're able to drive solid same-store comps year-over-year and make restaurants more profitable through higher volumes.
"
139,FBHS,"They've resisted increasing prices to the same extent that a lot of restaurants have. Instead, they're driving growth through higher volume and traffic.
"
140,FBHS,"IBD: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has had a great run and just gapped up the other day. What makes you think it still has room to run?
"
141,FBHS,"Kamm: It fits our innovation theme. Their sales and profits are driven by Solaris, a biologic drug that's approved for two ultrarare, very serious diseases, not just in the U.S. but globally.
"
142,FBHS,"They still have room to run because both uses of Solaris still have a lot of growth ahead of them. There's still a lot of opportunity to reach more patients.
"
143,FBHS,"Solaris is also being tested for three or four additional ultrarare diseases, where early clinical data are encouraging. In three or four years, there will be additional (treatment) approvals for Solaris.
"
144,FBHS,"They also have asfotase alpha (which targets certain bone diseases and tooth losses), which is expected to be approved later this year.
"
145,FBHS,"IBD: Is broker-dealer LPL Financial (LPLA) a play on a growing economy?
"
146,FBHS,"Kamm: They're the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. They've grown by attracting financial advisers away from big banks and wire houses, giving them independence to grow their practices in ways they see fit, and letting them keep a larger percent of their profits.
"
147,FBHS,"They continue to gain market share, and we like market-share gainers. We like companies that can outgrow the market in a sustainable way.
"
148,FBHS,"Also, LPL captures some of the float on cash balances that customers keep with them. (Float refers to earnings on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account.) While rates were low, there was not so much float to capture. But if rates rise as the economy improves, then LPL earnings will accelerate.
"
149,FBHS,"IBD: Where's the innovation in a stock like athletic wear seller Under Armour (UA)?
"
150,FBHS,"Kamm: The innovation is in new materials that deliver better performance, whether sweat-wicking or shielding athletes from heat or cold. Companies like Under Armour and Nike (NKE) and Adidas have been able to grow by innovating product lines and driving increased value to customers.
"
151,FBHS,"Under Armour has a great brand with athletes, especially young athletes, who are inclined to spend more. They're expanding into other categories, such as footwear via cleats. And that's translating into more traditional ware like running shoes.
"
152,FBHS,"They've been mostly a U.S. brand, but they're extending their brand internationally and driving additional growth outside the U.S. So we think they still have a long runway. They're in our bucket category.
"
153,FBHS,"IBD: Am I right in thinking you like Illumina's (ILMN) genomic sequencing advances?
"
154,FBHS,"Kamm: Gene sequencing is a transformational technology. In 2007 they launched a next-generation sequencing platform. Cost of sequencing began to fall, leading to big growth in the market. They launched (on Jan. 14) another new product (the HiSeq X Ten) that delivers the first $1,000 genome, a target that researchers have been fixed on for five or six years.
"
155,FBHS,"So they're the center of action in human genetic research and have significant growth opportunities as they make these tools even more affordable.
"
156,FBHS,"IBD: TripAdvisor (TRIP) has pulled back from its Nov. 15 high. And earnings per share fell in the most recent quarter. Why aren't you concerned?
"
157,FBHS,"Kamm: They're the leading review site for hotels and other travel destinations globally. They've moved toward a bidding model, where companies bid for placement on a TripAdvisor site. It's almost like bidding for Google (GOOG) search terms. Earnings have declined during this process because it is a transition. They're foregoing some older advertising measures as they move customers to the new bidding system. Until this new system starts to mature, their profits are lower.
"
158,FBHS,"This was expected. That's why it's a garden investment. It will move up as they get through the transitional period.
"
159,FBHS,"IBD: Cepheid (CPHD) has uptrended since June. Why has it shown so much volatility in quarterly earnings?
"
160,FBHS,"Kamm: This is a crop position. They make diagnostic systems that let hospitals easily identify molecular markers of disease in patients. That used to be a complex, time-consuming process that required highly trained staff. Cepheid made GeneXpert, which automated it. You put a blood sample into a plastic cartridge, which goes into the instrument, and you get the answer. So more hospitals can do molecular testing.
"
161,FBHS,"The company ran into manufacturing challenges, which hurt earnings. Over (the past year) they've addressed those issues, exited 2013 in a better place in terms of inventory and ability to provide test cartridges to customers. And they have a broad pipeline of new tests that they've brought to market. Now they have to leverage their new systems to do a broader range of tests.
"
162,FBHS,"IBD: Is Fortune Brands (FBHS) a play on the housing rebound?
"
163,FBHS,"Kamm: They're a leading housing-products company, and this is a crop position.
"
164,FBHS,"They have a leading position in fixtures for kitchens and bathrooms, cabinets, faucets and locks in what tend to be attractive segments. It became clear last year that the U.S. housing market was coming out of the depths of the downturn. Fortune has been gaining share in key markets. That's delivering strong margin expansion, and margins are still below the peaks of the last housing cycle, so it's reasonable to assume that margins can continue to rise.
"
165,FBHS,"IBD: The rate of growth of LinkedIn's (LNKD) earnings per share have declined for two quarters. You've added to your stake in several recent disclosures. What's your game plan?
"
166,FBHS,"Kamm: LinkedIn has transformed the recruiting and hiring market. The main advantage is that people update their resumes and profiles even when they're not actively looking for a job. People who are hiring can access a rich database of not just job-seekers but also of people who would be open to the right opportunity. That's valuable to corporate HR departments.
"
167,FBHS,"In recent years LinkedIn has been investing to improve its mobile smartphone and tablet tools and provide more content, more articles and experts who write on topics that are relevant. That brings people to the site more frequently and with a higher level of engagement. And that translates into more advertising dollars for LinkedIn. There's not only a growing number of recruiters who subscribe to the platform. There's also growing advertising business. All of this has a long way to run.
"
168,FBHS,"IBD: You began your current stake in Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) in September. Why do you like this particular casino stock?
"
169,FBHS,"Kamm: They're a leading casino operator in Macau and the Cotai Strip (in Macau), which is well known as a high-growth market, noticeably larger than Las Vegas. The subtle shift in the market in recent years is that the market is no longer driven primarily by high rollers, ultrahigh net worth individuals gaming in Macau. It is driven by the mass market today.
"
170,FBHS,"Melco's properties are well positioned to serve the mass market. And that part of the market is more profitable than the high-net-worth part. Melco is working to open new properties, which will expand its earnings potential.
"
171,FBHS,"Also, transportation to Macau is improving. And we're seeing changes that make it more attractive for destination travel, not just gambling demand.
"
172,FBHS,"IBD: Your stake in Tractor Supply (TSCO) has edged up.
"
173,FBHS,"Kamm: They're the leading supply store for recreational farms and the rural lifestyle. They have 1,300 stores today. We think they have potential for at least 2,100 stores. As they grow, they've done a good job of increasing productivity of existing stores. They've done a good job of understanding their business data.
"
174,FBHS,"They've done a good job with e-commerce to leverage their brand outside their physical stores. They've done a good job of laying in private label goods within the store to provide different price points and help expand their own margins. All of those drivers have potential in the coming years.Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.This approach is working. It has made his $9.7 billion Artisan Mid Cap Fund a top performer among the largest diversified U.S. stock portfolios.In the 12 months ended Jan. 31, its 31.18% return topped 91% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its 16.94% average annual gain in the past three years topped 92% of its rivals.Kamm, 40 years old, discussed his investment course with IBD from his office in Milwaukee.IBD: In addition to Mid Cap, you run $906 million Artisan Global Opportunities and $1.7 billion Small Cap . How does managing different cap-size and style funds help you?Kamm: Our team includes a group of analysts and five portfolio managers who work collaboratively to identify best ideas. We've been at this over 15 years. That level of tenure and trust is important.We look up and down the market-cap scale and globally. That gives us broad perspective. We like to think we're better midcap investors because we know small-cap competitors and international emerging markets competitors that U.S. midcap companies increasingly face.IBD: You divide your portfolio into three types of stocks. What's the advantage?Kamm: The nomenclature we use is garden, crop and harvest.Garden stocks are ones we believe are just emerging. We try to be early into them. We guard against risk by keeping garden positions small.When a garden position turns out right and profit growth plays out, we allocate more into it and push it into our crop bucket or portfolio. Those are our largest positions and fewest positions. That's where we feel the profit cycle has been largely de-risked.The third area is harvest, where we reduce positions.IBD: How are you tweaking new buys to cope with the expected slow-growth economy?Kamm: We've been focused on uniquely positioned franchises that are exposed to some strong growth trends. You see some signs, especially in the U.S., that the economy is getting better. Housing and jobs are examples. But emerging markets are struggling to grow at the same rates they experienced a few years ago.We're focused on durable, high-quality franchises. We're less interested in high-commodity businesses and materials. And those business models are very cyclical, economy sensitive, but tend not to meet our franchise characteristics criteria.IBD: What are some real-world examples, please, as of your latest disclosure?Kamm: We're focused on innovation in health care. We're 10 years past the first sequencing of the human genome. Now we're seeing benefits in novel drug targets.Regeneron (REGN) is an example. They have a drug called Eylea, which is a retinal drug for age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for the elderly. It was launched in 2011. In its second full year it sold $1.4 billion. It's a strong driver of company sales and profits.Regeneron also has a diverse pipeline of additional opportunities to extend its profit cycle into the future.They were all discovered in Regeneron's own labs, but primarily funded by Sanofi, a large French drug company, in return for the ability to market these drugs and share profits.IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) recently gapped up after reporting strong results and guidance. Its 30% earnings per share growth was the second straight quarterly acceleration. What's your thesis?Kamm: We think they're positioned for growth. They have a very strong brand associated with high-quality ingredients. They have a significant opportunity to grow their footprint of restaurants in the U.S., and ultimately internationally.They're executing well. They're getting customers through serving lines quicker. They've enhanced menus. They're offering office catering. They're able to drive solid same-store comps year-over-year and make restaurants more profitable through higher volumes.They've resisted increasing prices to the same extent that a lot of restaurants have. Instead, they're driving growth through higher volume and traffic.IBD: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has had a great run and just gapped up the other day. What makes you think it still has room to run?Kamm: It fits our innovation theme. Their sales and profits are driven by Solaris, a biologic drug that's approved for two ultrarare, very serious diseases, not just in the U.S. but globally.They still have room to run because both uses of Solaris still have a lot of growth ahead of them. There's still a lot of opportunity to reach more patients.Solaris is also being tested for three or four additional ultrarare diseases, where early clinical data are encouraging. In three or four years, there will be additional (treatment) approvals for Solaris.They also have asfotase alpha (which targets certain bone diseases and tooth losses), which is expected to be approved later this year.IBD: Is broker-dealer LPL Financial (LPLA) a play on a growing economy?Kamm: They're the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. They've grown by attracting financial advisers away from big banks and wire houses, giving them independence to grow their practices in ways they see fit, and letting them keep a larger percent of their profits.They continue to gain market share, and we like market-share gainers. We like companies that can outgrow the market in a sustainable way.Also, LPL captures some of the float on cash balances that customers keep with them. (Float refers to earnings on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account.) While rates were low, there was not so much float to capture. But if rates rise as the economy improves, then LPL earnings will accelerate.IBD: Where's the innovation in a stock like athletic wear seller Under Armour (UA)?Kamm: The innovation is in new materials that deliver better performance, whether sweat-wicking or shielding athletes from heat or cold. Companies like Under Armour and Nike (NKE) and Adidas have been able to grow by innovating product lines and driving increased value to customers.Under Armour has a great brand with athletes, especially young athletes, who are inclined to spend more. They're expanding into other categories, such as footwear via cleats. And that's translating into more traditional ware like running shoes.They've been mostly a U.S. brand, but they're extending their brand internationally and driving additional growth outside the U.S. So we think they still have a long runway. They're in our bucket category.IBD: Am I right in thinking you like Illumina's (ILMN) genomic sequencing advances?Kamm: Gene sequencing is a transformational technology. In 2007 they launched a next-generation sequencing platform. Cost of sequencing began to fall, leading to big growth in the market. They launched (on Jan. 14) another new product (the HiSeq X Ten) that delivers the first $1,000 genome, a target that researchers have been fixed on for five or six years.So they're the center of action in human genetic research and have significant growth opportunities as they make these tools even more affordable.IBD: TripAdvisor (TRIP) has pulled back from its Nov. 15 high. And earnings per share fell in the most recent quarter. Why aren't you concerned?Kamm: They're the leading review site for hotels and other travel destinations globally. They've moved toward a bidding model, where companies bid for placement on a TripAdvisor site. It's almost like bidding for Google (GOOG) search terms. Earnings have declined during this process because it is a transition. They're foregoing some older advertising measures as they move customers to the new bidding system. Until this new system starts to mature, their profits are lower.This was expected. That's why it's a garden investment. It will move up as they get through the transitional period.IBD: Cepheid (CPHD) has uptrended since June. Why has it shown so much volatility in quarterly earnings?Kamm: This is a crop position. They make diagnostic systems that let hospitals easily identify molecular markers of disease in patients. That used to be a complex, time-consuming process that required highly trained staff. Cepheid made GeneXpert, which automated it. You put a blood sample into a plastic cartridge, which goes into the instrument, and you get the answer. So more hospitals can do molecular testing.The company ran into manufacturing challenges, which hurt earnings. Over (the past year) they've addressed those issues, exited 2013 in a better place in terms of inventory and ability to provide test cartridges to customers. And they have a broad pipeline of new tests that they've brought to market. Now they have to leverage their new systems to do a broader range of tests.IBD: Is Fortune Brands (FBHS) a play on the housing rebound?Kamm: They're a leading housing-products company, and this is a crop position.They have a leading position in fixtures for kitchens and bathrooms, cabinets, faucets and locks in what tend to be attractive segments. It became clear last year that the U.S. housing market was coming out of the depths of the downturn. Fortune has been gaining share in key markets. That's delivering strong margin expansion, and margins are still below the peaks of the last housing cycle, so it's reasonable to assume that margins can continue to rise.IBD: The rate of growth of LinkedIn's (LNKD) earnings per share have declined for two quarters. You've added to your stake in several recent disclosures. What's your game plan?Kamm: LinkedIn has transformed the recruiting and hiring market. The main advantage is that people update their resumes and profiles even when they're not actively looking for a job. People who are hiring can access a rich database of not just job-seekers but also of people who would be open to the right opportunity. That's valuable to corporate HR departments.In recent years LinkedIn has been investing to improve its mobile smartphone and tablet tools and provide more content, more articles and experts who write on topics that are relevant. That brings people to the site more frequently and with a higher level of engagement. And that translates into more advertising dollars for LinkedIn.

It is now anticipating growth in the low-single-digit range versus mid-single digit predicted earlier. Also, on a P/E (TTM basis), the stock looks overvalued compared with the industry, based on respective tallies of 17.8x and 15.8x in the past three months.In the past three months, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 6% against the industry’s rise of 2.3%.Moreover, of late, the company has been suffering from higher costs and expenses, which weighed on margins in first-quarter 2018.  In the quarter, operating margin slipped 10 basis points. We believe that unwarranted rise in expenses might affect Fortune Brands’ performance going forward as well.Further, analysts have become increasingly bearish on Fortune Brands, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has trended down over the past couple of months, from $3.63 to $3.62, led by one downward estimate revision versus none upward.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Atkore International Group Inc.

228,FBHS,"We issued an updated research report on Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS  -  Free Report) on Jun 12.This security and safety service provider currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $8.4 billion.Let’s delve deeper and discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Aiding Fortune BrandsFavorable Operating Conditions: We believe that security and safety service provider companies are poised to benefit from the strengthening of U.S. economy and healthy growth prospects of the global market. Considering the domestic housing market, increase in housing starts, as well as higher demand for repair and remodeling activities, will spur demand for Fortune Brands’ products.For 2018, the company anticipates home products market in the United States to grow 5-7% while the global market is expected to increase 5-6%.To leverage gains from such favorable operating conditions, the company has been diligently working toward solidifying its product portfolio. The addition of brands like Shaws of England and Victoria + Albert to the Global Plumbing Group in 2017 is worth mentioning here. These assets are anticipated to generate combined revenues of $45 million annually for the company.Reward for Shareholders: Fortune Brands ardently believes in rewarding shareholders handsomely, especially through dividend payments and share buybacks. Over the last five years, the company’s annual dividend payment has grown from 30 cents in 2013 to 72 cents in 2017. After an 11% hike in the quarterly dividend rate announced in December 2017, the company’s annual dividend rate now stands at 80 cents.Also, in April 2018, share buyback program of $150 million was authorized by the board of directors. This program has two-year validly and shares can be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. This, along with $160 million left from the earlier $250-million program — which was authorized in December 2017 and is slated to expire on Dec 8, 2019 — allows the company to repurchase up to $310 million of its common shares.Growth Projections: Solidifying business of Global Plumbing Group, favorable pricing and its cost actions, as well as ongoing share buybacks, will benefit Fortune Brands in 2018. The company anticipates sales to grow by 6-7% in the year. Earnings per share (before charges/gains) are predicted to be $3.58-$3.70, higher than $3.54-$3.66 expected earlier. The mid-point of the revised forecast is well above the year-ago earnings of $3.08.Also, Plumbing, Doors and Security segments are anticipated to flourish in the year. For the Doors segment, sales are projected to increase in low-double digits, better than high-single digit to low-double digits expected earlier, on the back of the expansion in retail business. For the Security segment, sales are predicted to increase in mid-single digit while for the Plumbing segment sales will likely grow in the low-double digits versus high-single digit expected earlier.Factors Working Against Fortune BrandsPoor Share Price Performance and Valuation, Lower Earnings Estimates: In the first quarter of 2018, Fortune Brands reported weaker-than-expected results with earnings of 56 cents per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents by 5.08%. Also, net sales missed estimates by 0.4%. Revenues from the Cabinets segment were weak in the reported quarter, declining 3% year over year. For 2018, the company has lowered its sales growth projection for the Cabinets segment. It is now anticipating growth in the low-single-digit range versus mid-single digit predicted earlier.In the past three months, the company’s shares have declined 7.6% versus 6.6% decrease recorded by the industry. Also, on a P/E (TTM basis), the stock looks overvalued compared with the industry, based on respective tallies of 18.6x and 15.6x in the past three months.Moreover, earnings estimates on the company have been revised downward in the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.04 for the second quarter of 2018, representing a decline of 3.7% from its 60-day-ago tally. Also, the impact of three upward revisions in earnings estimates for 2018 was offset by two downward revisions, keeping estimates stable at $3.63 per share.Rising Costs & Expenses Raise Concerns: Fortune Brands is dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and operating expenses. Notably, the company’s cost of sales in the last five years (2013-2017) grew at 6.8% (CAGR) while its operating expenses went up 4.7%. The trajectory continued in the first quarter of 2018 as well, with the cost of sales and operating expenses increasing 5.5% and 8.1% from their respective tallies in the year-ago comparable quarter. We believe that unwarranted rise in costs and expenses will prove detrimental to the company’s margins and profitability.Long-Term Debt: Fortune Brands is a highly leveraged company. In the last five years (2013-2017), the company’s long-term debt soared 33.9% (CAGR) while grew roughly 2% sequentially to approximately $1.5 billion at the end of first-quarter 2018. Also, the company’s total debt/total equity has increased from 13.2% in 2013 to 58% in 2017. It stood at 80.1% at the end of first-quarter 2018. We believe, if unchecked, high-debt levels can inflate the company’s financial obligations and put pressure on margins.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report), MSA Safety Incorporated (MSA  -  Free Report) and Johnson Controls International plc (JCI  -  Free Report). While both Axon Enterprise and MSA Safety sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Johnson Controls International carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

230,FBHS,"We issued an updated research report on Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS  -  Free Report) on Mar 6. Strengthening segmental business, focus on acquisition, and product development and healthy rewards to shareholders will work in its favor. However, industry competition, and rising costs and expenses remain prime concerns.The company, with a market capitalization of approximately $9.5 billion, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Below, we have briefly discussed the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring Fortune BrandsSolid Business Portfolio: A well-diversified business structure has given Fortune Brands a competitive edge over some players in the industry. The company currently operates through four business segments — Cabinets, Plumbing, Doors and Security — largely minimizing its risks of loss from the poor performance of any group. Also, a vast customer base in various end markets is a boon.In 2018, the company anticipates Cabinets sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range. Sales in the Doors segment are estimated to increase in the high-single-digit to low-double-digits on the back of new products and retail expansion. Security sales are predicted to increase in mid-single digit. Growth opportunities are bright in international and commercial markets. Plumbing segment is likely to benefit from new brand additions in the Global Plumbing Group.Impressive Top- and Bottom-Line View for 2018: Fortune Brands delivered better-than-expected results in the last quarter of 2017, pulling off a positive 1.3% earnings surprise. The outlook for 2018 also looks bright, with positive momentum in the U.S. housing market anticipated to be the prime driving catalyst. The Home products market in the country is projected to grow 5-7% in the year, while the global market is expected to be up 5-6%.Fortune Brands anticipates its sales growth to be in the band of 6-7% in 2018, while earnings (before charges/gains) are projected to be in the range of $3.54-$3.66 per share. The bottom line forecast reflects 17% mid-point growth over the year-ago figure and it includes the positive impact of lower taxes for corporates.These positive sentiments are clearly reflected in the positive revisions in earnings estimates for the stock. In the last 60 days, seven brokerage firms have raised estimates for 2018, while three firms have increased estimates for 2019. Currently, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.63 for 2018 and $4.04 for 2019, representing growth of 4.6% and 4.7% from their respective tallies 60 days ago.Capital Allocation Strategies: Fortune Brands follows sound capital allocation strategies, under which it makes meaningful acquisitions for business expansion, invests for the development of new products and the improvement of services, and rewards shareholders handsomely.Brands like Shaws of England and Victoria + Albert were acquired by the company in 2017. These assets are anticipated to generate combined revenues of $45 million annually. Also, the company remains on track to generate roughly $2.5 billion revenues from its Plumbing business by 2020.In addition, the company is committed toward returning value to shareholders. In 2017, the company used $214.8 million to purchase treasury stocks, while paid dividends of $110.3 million. In December 2017, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 11% and also announced a $250 million share buyback program.Factors Working Against Fortune BrandsShare Price Performance and Poor Valuation: Last month, Fortune Brands’ shares have declined 0.4%, underperforming 2% growth recorded by the industry.Also, on a P/E (TTM) basis, the company’s shares look overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 20.2x and 13.7x in the last month. This makes us cautious about the stock.Rising Costs & Expenses, Huge Debts Raise Concerns: Fortune Brands is exposed to risks emanating from rise in costs and expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2017, its cost of sales before charges/gains grew 7% year over year while selling, administrative, and research and development expenses before charges/gains increased 3.1%. Also, its long-term debt was approximately $1.5 billion while exiting the quarter. We believe, if unchecked, rising costs and expenses, and huge debt levels can be detrimental to the company’s profitability in the quarters ahead.Threat From International Expansion & Industry Competition: Expansion of business in international arenas has exposed Fortune Brands to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies. Also, uncertainties in the economic growth of the countries served can severely impact the company’s businesses.Moreover, the company faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses. Also, difficulties or delays in research and development or production and services, apart from the failure of new products and technologies in the market, might hurt the company’s competitive edge.Some key players in the industry are Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report), Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. (ALRM  -  Free Report) and Brady Corporation (BRC  -  Free Report). While Allegion sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Alarm.com Holdings and Brady carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.In the last 60 days, earnings estimates for each of these stocks have improved for the current year and the next year. Also, average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters was 8.72% for Allegion, 55.94% for Alarm.com Holdings and 3.88% for Brady.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

232,FBHS,"Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, after market close.Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 80%. However, in the trailing four quarters, the company recorded an average positive surprise of 15.61%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAxon Enterprise is a renowned supplier of smart weapons and body-worn video cameras in the security and public safety space. Keeping with this trend, the company won a number of orders for its smart weapons from various police departments in the fourth quarter of 2017. Some of the company’s notable buyers in the fourth quarter include Arkansas State Police, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, North Carolina State Highway Patrol, North Las Vegas Police Department and more than a dozen of State Police Departments along with a few Federal agencies. Such a massive rise in orders is expected to boost sales.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $87.9 million, reflecting 7.1% annual improvement. Moreover, during the third-quarter earnings call, management at Axon Enterprise raised its sales growth expectation for 2017 from the range of 15-20% to 25%. This indicates solid sales growth in the fourth quarter as well.On the flip side, higher operating expenses have been weighing on the bottom line. Notably, management expects Axon Enterprise to incur $1 million in costs during the fourth quarter in relation to its migration from Amazon Web services to Microsoft Azure's governing cloud. Overall, the company’s fourth-quarter operating expenses are expected to rise 5-8% sequentially.Thus, we may expect Axon Enterprise’s upcoming results to reflect signs of deterioration in its bottom line. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter loss stands at 3 cents, representing a 125% year-over-year plunge.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Axon Enterprise this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, Axon Enterprise lacks both these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Axon Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the power of surprise prediction. However, a 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Axon Enterprise, Inc.

238,FBHS,"Protection safety equipment & services provider Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, after the market closes.In the last four quarters, the company delivered better-than-expected results, pulling off an average positive earnings surprise of 6.27%. In the last quarter, earnings of 83 cents per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.22%.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). In the last three months, the company’s shares have yielded 10.4% return, outperforming roughly 1.5% gain of the industry it belongs to.Let us see how things are shaping up for Fortune Brands this quarter.Factors to Affect Q4 ResultsFortune Brands will gain from the strengthening U.S. housing market in the quarter. Housing starts exhibited solid month-over-month gains in October and November but slipped 8.2% in December. Overall, housing starts in the fourth quarter were up roughly 6.7% from the previous quarter. Favorable population and robust labor market are likely to lead to new constructions while aging existing construction will raise demand for repair and remodelling services.In the fourth quarter, Fortune Brands anticipates Cabinets segment’s sales to grow in the mid-single digit range. This segment deals with manufacturing and selling of custom, semi-custom and stock cabinetry and vanities.The company’s Cabinets segment failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the first three quarters of 2017 while surpassing it in one. The segment’s sales in the fourth quarter are estimated to be $634 million, above $614 million generated in the last quarter. As reported by Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association, cabinetry sales in January-November 2017 grew 2.8% year over year, with stock cabinet sales and semi-custom sales increasing 3% and 3.5%, respectively. However, custom cabinet sales slipped 0.4%.Also, Fortune Brands anticipates sales in the Doors segment to increase in mid-single digits in 2017 while Security segment’s sales are predicted to increase in mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. The plumbing segment will benefit from new brand additions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Doors segment’s revenues stand at $130 million for the fourth quarter, below $138 million reported in the third quarter. The consensus estimate for the Security segment is $162, above $158 million recorded in the previous quarter, and for the Plumbing segment is $457 million, above $438 million in the third quarter.In addition, we believe that development of new products, addition of well-known brands through acquisitions and favorable impact of foreign currencies might be possible tailwinds in the quarter. On the flip side, headwinds like sudden inflation in raw materials price or supply shortage, industry competition and burden of high debt levels might affect results.Stocks to ConsiderOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

239,FBHS,"(0:30) - Warren Buffett Thoughts On Cyptocurrency(4:15) - Emerging Technology: Boom or Bust(8:30) - Buffett's 3 Ways The Market Could Keep Rising(11:45) - How To Play The Market Like Buffett(15:15) - Tracey's Top Picks: Old School Winners(22:00) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #77 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Recently, Warren Buffett gave an interview on CNBC where anchor Becky Quick asked him about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.He answered that he didn’t own any, wasn’t short any and would never have a position in them. Buffett then went on to say that they will come to a “bad ending” but he didn’t know when or how it would happen.As you can imagine, he immediately came under attack from those in the crypto community for being out-of-touch, too old, and ignorant.It’s nearly the identical response dot-commers had to his comments in the late 1990s.Picking Winners in Emerging TechnologiesWhen a new technology bursts on the scene, there are always dozens of competitors. After all, it’s seen as a gold rush and some people will get rich off of what is new.In the 1800s, there were hundreds of railroads in the United States. But now, there are less than 10 big commercial railroad companies.Similarly, there were thousands of automobile manufacturers and hundreds of domestic airlines when cars and airplanes came on the scene in the early 1900s.But, again, today, the “winners” have won the contest. There are only a handful of big names in those industries. They are the survivors.With cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, it’s so new, there’s no way of knowing who the winners may be. Buffett’s strategy, then, is to simply avoid those emerging technologies until winners can be determined.Investing in the Old-School WinnersWhy not invest in those that have become the winners in the older industries?These companies, some of whom have survived for nearly two hundred years, are clearly doing something right.1.      General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) is one of the original Dow Industrial components. Becky Quick asked Buffett about GE in their interview but he wouldn’t say, due to compliance issues, if he was buying now that shares have plunged. Is it even cheap enough? It still has a forward P/E of 18.3.2.     Masco (MAS  -  Free Report) makes plumbing parts like faucets, paints, cabinets and countertops. Founded in 1929, it now has a $14 billion market cap. Earnings are expected to rise 18% in 2018 after jumping about 29% in 2017.3.     Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS  -  Free Report) makes cabinets and plumbing, including the Moen brand, but it also makes doors and security devices such as padlocks by Master Lock.

240,FBHS,"We issued an updated research report on Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS  -  Free Report) on Jan 2. Strengthening business opportunities from investments toward new product development and improving services as well as benefits from acquired assets and priorities of rewarding shareholders handsomely will prove advantageous for the company. However, headwinds related to natural calamities, global uncertainties, rising costs and high debt levels might restrict its growth momentum in the near term.Fortune Brands currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $10.4 billion.Below we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring Fortune BrandsStrengthening Business Opportunities: We believe Fortune Brands’ business opportunities are increasing with the addition of meaningful businesses to its portfolio and investments done for the development of new products and improvement of services. In this regard, the acquisition of Canada-based premium showroom brand, Riobel and California-based luxury brand, ROHL in 2016 is worth mentioning. These assets are predicted to collectively generate revenues of $110 million.Also, investments made for the development of new products and improvement of services have been beneficial. The Global Plumbing Group, a strategic platform formed in 2016, has helped in accelerating growth opportunities in the company’s plumbing business. Also, new products launched by the company’s premium brands will help in expanding its market share.Shareholders-Friendly Strategies: Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders for Fortune Brands. Notably, the company used $173.7 million to purchase treasury stocks and paid dividends of $82.7 million in the first nine months of 2017. In December, the company gifted its shareholders with twin rewards — an 11% hike in the quarterly dividend rate and a $250 million share buyback program.The new share repurchase authorization along with $300 million left of the earlier program — authorized in March — gives the company a chance of repurchase up to $550 million of its common shares. Such shareholders-friendly strategies reflect its strong balance sheet, capital structure and free cash flow position.Promising Guidance for 2017 (Results Not Yet Released): For 2017, Fortune Brands anticipates the U.S. home products market to grow 6-7% while the global market is expected to rise 5-6%. The Cabinets segment’s sales are likely to grow in the mid-single digit range in the fourth quarter. Sales in the Doors segment will increase in mid-single digits in 2017. Security sales are predicted to increase in mid-single digits in the fourth quarter while register growth of 3% or more for the full year. Plumbing segment will benefit from new brand additions.In the last six months, Fortune Brands shares have yielded a return of 4.6%, outperforming roughly 6.6% decline of the industry.Factors Working Against Fortune BrandsPoor Valuation & Woes Rising From Natural Calamities: On a P/E (TTM) basis, Fortune Brands looks overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 22.9x and 18.1x in the last six-month period. Also, the stock is currently trading above the median P/E multiple of 22.1x. This makes us cautious on the stock.For 2017, the company has revised down its revenue growth projection to 6-7% from 6-8% predicted earlier. The revision was due to the impact of hurricanes on the company’s segmental businesses.Threat From Global Uncertainties: Fortune Brands’ businesses are highly dependent on the housing market, especially home improvement, repair and remodel, and new home construction activity levels in North America. Lower level of housing activities and difficult financial conditions in countries where the company operates, will adversely hurt its sales, earnings and cash flow.In addition, business expansion in foreign nations has exposed Fortune Brands to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geo-political issues.Increasing Costs and Huge Debt Levels: Fortune Brands is suffering from the risks of escalated costs and expenses. In the first nine months of 2017, the company’s cost of sales increased 5% year over year while selling, general and administrative expenses jumped 6%. We believe, if unchecked, rising costs and expenses can hurt the company’s margins in the quarters ahead.Also, a high-debt level can lead to heightened financial obligations, posing serious threats to the company’s financial health. Exiting the third quarter, the company’s long-term debt was approximately $1.5 billion.Earnings Estimates & Key PicksFortune Brands’ earnings estimates for 2017 (results not yet released) and 2018 remained stable in the last 60 days. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.07 for 2017 and $3.41 for 2018.Some stocks worth considering in the industry are Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. , Lakeland Industries, Inc. (LAKE  -  Free Report) and Ituran Location and Control Ltd. . While Net 1 UEPS Technologies sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Lakeland Industries and Ituran Location and Control carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Net 1 UEPS Technologies’ earnings for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 remained stable in the last 60 days. Also, the company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 5.34% in the last four quarters.Lakeland Industries delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 20.64% in the last four quarters.

(FBHS  -  Free Report) announced that on Dec 8 its board of directors approved an 11% increase in the quarterly dividend rate and authorized a $250 million share buyback program.Such disbursements reflect the company’s strong cash position and its commitment toward rewarding its shareholders handsomely.In the last three months, Fortune Brands’ shares have yielded 5.2% return, outperforming 2.7% decline of the industry.Details on the Twin RewardsAs revealed, the quarterly dividend rate was increased from 18 cents to 20 cents, marking the fifth consecutive year of double digit increase.

The company will pay the revised quarterly dividend on Mar 14, 2018 to shareholders on record as of Feb 23, 2018.Also, Fortune Brands noted that the authorized $250 million common share buyback program is valid for the next two years. It can repurchase shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. This program along with $300 million left of the earlier program — authorized in March and expires on Feb 28, 2019 — gives the company a chance of repurchase up to $550 million of its common shares. Our TakeWe believe that the rise in Fortune Brands’ profitability and a strong cash position will enable it to return higher value to its shareholders in the years ahead. Notably, the company’s net income jumped 10% year over year in the first nine months of 2017. Dividend paid during the period totaled $82.7 million. Net cash generated from operating activities in the period was $352.6 million while cash and cash equivalents exiting the period was $277.1 million.In the last four years (2013-2016), the company’s annual dividend rate has increased from 42 cents to 66 cents per share.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus for the stock has been pegged at $3.07 for 2017 and $3.41 for 2018. These estimates reflect year-over-year growth of 11.7% for 2017 and 11.1% for 2018.Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. Price and Consensus Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.

243,FBHS,"Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company reported in-line earnings. In the trailing four quarters, the company recorded an average positive surprise of 45.61%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Axon Enterprise is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Axon Enterprise possesses both of these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Axon Enterprise has an Earnings ESP of +12.50%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 6 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Axon Enterprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which along with a positive earnings ESP hints at possible surprise prediction. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderAxon Enterprise continues to witness strong quarterly demand for its body-worn video cameras. In line with its trend, in the third quarter also, the company won a number of orders for its smart weapons from various police departments. Some of its notable buyers in the to-be-reported quarter include Albuquerque Police Department, California Highway Patrol as well as more than a dozen of State Police Departments. Such order growth is expected to boost the company’s quarterly sales.To that end, during the second-quarter earnings call, the company said that it expects to record 55% higher revenues year over year in the third quarter. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $82.1 million, reflecting 14.2% annual improvement.On the other hand, operating expenses are projected to grow 4-6% sequentially, as the company continues to add customer facing roles, invest in R&D initiatives as well as expand into new international markets. Whereas, a sequential margin improvement is expected as the company projects to incur fewer nonrecurring camera hardware costs, improve hardware pricing, increase Weapons revenue and add users to the Axon platform.Per the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), third-quarter 2017’s firearm background checks dropped 6.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure, thus indicating a decline in demand for firearms in the soon-to-be reported quarter. This could in turn hurt sales growth for publicly traded gun manufacturers like Axon Enterprise.In the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is expected to reflect a 23.8% year-over-year plunge.Axon Enterprise, Inc.

The revision was due to the impact of hurricanes on the company’s segmental businesses.The company has revised its earnings guidance to $3.05-$3.11 per share from the earlier projection of $3.04-$3.12.On a segmental basis, Cabinets segment’s sales are likely to grow in the mid-single digit range in the fourth quarter. Sales in the Doors segment will increase in mid-single digits in 2017. Security sales are predicted to increase in mid-single digits in the fourth quarter while register growth of 3% or more for the full year.

245,FBHS,"Protection safety equipment & services provider Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes.In the last four quarters, the company delivered better-than-expected results, pulling off an average positive earnings surprise of 6.61%. In the last quarter, earnings of 92 cents per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.75%.In the last three months, the company’s shares have yielded 2% return, outperforming roughly 0.7% decline of the industry.Let us see how things are shaping up for Fortune Brands this quarter. Factors to Affect Q3 ResultsFortune Brands derives a major portion of its revenues from the Cabinets business segment. This segment deals with manufacturing and selling of custom, semi-custom and stock cabinetry and vanities. In July and August, stock and semi-custom cabinet sales in the industry inched up in low single-digits while declined for custom cabinets. We believe softer cabinet sales trend in the industry might hurt the company.The company’s Cabinets segment failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of four trailing quarters. The segment’s estimated sales for the third quarter are $646 million, below $653 million generated in the second quarter.Fortune Brands also faces risks associated with sudden inflation in raw materials price or supply shortage. These adverse happenings can impact the company’s operational process and margins. Also, if the burden of such expenses is transferred to the buyers, it might lower demand for the company’s products and subsequently its business share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fortune Brands’ Cabinet segment’s operating income in the third quarter is predicted to be $84 million. This prediction is lower than $89 million recorded in the previous quarter.In addition, impact of adverse movements in foreign currencies, stiff competition and a highly leveraged balance sheet remain major concerns for Fortune Brands. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Fortune Brands will be able to pull a surprise this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here for as you will see below. Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the stock is currently -0.58%.Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.

QuoteZacks Rank: Fortune Brands Home & Security’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum. Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the sector you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Kennametal Inc.

Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

However, headwinds related to international operations, rising costs and high debt levels might restrict its growth momentum in the near term.It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the last six months, Fortune Brands’ shares have yielded a return of 8.2%, outperforming roughly 0.2% decline of the industry.Despite the outperformance, the stock looks overvalued compared with the industry on a P/E (TTM) basis, with respective tallies of 21.3x and 16.4x in the same time frame.Growth DriversStrategic Initiatives: Fortune Brands remains committed toward making investments for the development of new products and improving its services. The company formed the Global Plumbing Group, a strategic platform in 2016. The group has helped in accelerating growth opportunities in the company’s plumbing business. Also, new products launched by the company’s premium brands like MasterBrand Cabinets, Moen and Master Lock, will enable it to expand market share.Inorganic Growth: Acquiring meaningful businesses have helped Fortune Brands to expand its product offerings and in turn, its profitability. Notably, the company acquired Canada-based premium showroom brand, Riobel and California-based luxury brand, ROHL in 2016. We believe that these assets, with collective revenue generating capacity of $110 million, will prove beneficial in the quarters ahead.Shareholders’ Return and Promising ’17 Guidance: Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders. Fortune Brands initiated $300 million worth share buyback program in March 2016 while in December, it hiked the quarterly dividend rate by 13%. In the first half of 2017, the company used $32.7 million to purchase treasury stocks while paid dividends of $55.3 million.For 2017, the company anticipates the U.S. home products market to grow 6-7% while predicts the global market to rise 5-6%. Sales growth is anticipated to be in a band of 6-8% in the year. Seeing positive momentum throughout the year, the company revised its earnings guidance to $3.04-$3.12 per share from the earlier projection of $3.00-$3.12, increasing the mid-point to $3.08 from $3.06 predicted earlier.Headwinds Marring Fortune Brands’ Growth ProspectsDiversification Woes: We believe Fortune Brands’ geographical expansion has exposed it to risks arising from foreign currency movements and geopolitical issues. Notably, the company derived roughly 15% of its net sales in 2016 from international operations. Uncertainties in the economic growth of the countries served or weakness in housing market activities will severely impact its businesses. Additionally, due to wide diversity of its products and the vastness of the markets it serves, the company faces stiff competition.Rising Costs and Debt Levels: Over time, Fortune Brands’ profitability suffered from higher costs and expenses. For instance, in the first six months of 2017, the company’s cost of sales grew 4.4% from the year-ago period while operating expenses rose 6.1%. Another issue currently faced by the company is its huge debt level, which was approximately $1.4 billion at the end of second-quarter 2017. We believe that, if unchecked, higher costs and operating expenses as well as rising debt levels will prove detrimental to its profitability.Others: In addition to the above-mentioned headwinds, we believe that failure of new products in the market and difficulties or delays in research and development may hurt the company’s competitive position. Also, sudden inflation in the raw material prices or supply shortage can hamper the company’s production process and thus, dent its margins.Stocks to ConsiderFortune Brands currently has $9.7 billion market capitalization. We believe that the above-mentioned positives and negatives clearly justify the stock’s Zacks Rank of 3.Some stocks worth considering in the same space are Pointer Telocation Ltd. (PNTR  -  Free Report), Allegion PLC (ALLE  -  Free Report) and Brady Corporation (BRC  -  Free Report). While Pointer Telocation sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Allegion PLC and Brady Corporation carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

249,FBHS,"Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 financial results on Aug 8, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 133.33%. In the trailing four quarters, the company has recorded an average positive surprise of 78.94%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAxon Enterprise’s body-worn video cameras are in strong demand with the company winning orders from domestic and international police departments during the second quarter. This quarter, the company also bagged a number of orders for its smart weapons from various police departments. Some of its notable buyers include California Highway Patrol and Alameda County Sheriff’s Office. During the first-quarter earnings call, the company said that it expects to record 25% higher revenues year over year in the second quarter. Operating expenses are projected to grow 4-6% sequentially, as the company continues to add customer facing roles, invest in R&D initiatives as well as expand into new international markets.Per the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), second-quarter 2017’s firearm background checks dropped 4.2 % from the year-ago quarter’s figure, thus indicating a decline in demand for firearms in the soon-to-be reported quarter. This could in turn hurt sales growth for publicly traded gun manufacturers like Axon Enterprise.In the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is expected to reflect a 42.9% year-over-year plunge, while sales are anticipated to surge 26.9% to $74.57 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Axon Enterprise is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

251,FBHS,"Protection safety equipment & services provider Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after the market closes.The company’s financial performance in the last four quarters was impressive, with better-than-expected results in each. Average earnings surprise was a positive 8.25%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of 53 cents per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.22%. We believe that a decent financial performance and growth prospects lifted investor sentiments for the company. In the last three months, the company’s shares have yielded 3.70% return, outperforming roughly 1.85% decline of the industry.Let us see how things are shaping up for Fortune Brands Home & Security this quarter.Factors to Affect Q2 ResultsFortune Brands Home & Security anticipates leveraging benefits from its attractive product portfolio, focus on innovation and development, operational excellence and strong capital structure. Notably, the Global Plumbing Group, a strategic platform formed in 2016, will help in accelerating growth opportunities in its plumbing business. Also, new products launched by the company’s premium brands, including MasterBrand Cabinets, Moen and Master Lock, in 2016 will enable it to expand market share.Also, a recovering housing market in the U.S. will drive the company’s profitability in the quarters of 2017, since its operations are highly dependent on the home improvement, repair and remodel, and new home construction activity levels. For 2017, the company anticipates the U.S. home products market to grow 6–7% while the global market is expected to rise 5–6%. Management predicts sales growth to be within 6–8% in the year.Per its capital allocation policy, Fortune Brands Home & Security remains committed toward returning value to its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. A large sum is allocated for making strategic acquisitions, keeping the best interests of its shareholders in mind. In 2016, the company acquired Canada-based premium showroom brand, Riobel and California-based luxury brand, ROHL. We believe that these assets will be strong sales drivers and will influence results in the second quarter.Despite such positives, Fortune Brands Home & Security’s exposure to risks arising from international operations, stiff competition, uncertain economic conditions in some foreign nations and a highly leveraged balance sheet remain major concerns. Also, risks associated with sudden inflation in raw materials price or supply shortage can impact the company’s operational process and margins in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Fortune Brands Home & Security will be able to pull a surprise this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here for as you will see below. Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the stock is currently 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 87 cents.    Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Fortune Brands Home & Security’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the sector you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +6.94% and a Zacks Rank #1.

253,FBHS,"Next week we will get some housing starts and permits data.  Of course the obvious play would be to load up on the home builders in front of the number if you believe that we will see good data.  There might be a better way to play the trend in increasing housing starts.
"
254,FBHS,"Supporting The Thesis
"
255,FBHS,"Here is a multi-year chart of recent housing starts.  I like to focus more on that number than the permits number as getting a permit does not ensure that there will actually be a house built.  For that reason, permits are almost always well ahead of starts on a pure volume basis.
"
256,FBHS," New Home Buyers Also Buy Furniture
"
257,FBHS,"People who purchase new homes tend to fill it with new furniture.  As a result we are seeing a number of the furniture stocks receiving higher earnings estimate revisions.  These higher estimate revisions have led the sector to have multiple highly ranked stocks.  The Zacks Rank is influenced to a great degree by these revisions.
"
258,FBHS,"Tempur Sealy (TPX  -  Free Report)
"
259,FBHS,"TPX is the lone Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock and recently posted a positive earnings surprise of 17.8%.  That big beat probably led analysts to raise estimates which helped the stock to reach the coveted position of a #1 rank.
"
260,FBHS,"Surprisingly, the competition for this stock, Mattress Firm (MFRM) is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and is the lowest rank in the home furnishings industry. 
"
261,FBHS,"Fortune Brands Home and Security (FBHS  -  Free Report)
"
262,FBHS,"Custom kitchens are nice additions to new homes, but most people really want some protection to the huge asset purchase that is a new home.  This is a company that makes steel doors, locks and the like. They recently broke a streak of earnings misses when they topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.  That beat helped analysts move up earnings estimates for this year and next.  The stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
"
263,FBHS,"Restoration Hardware (RH  -  Free Report)
"
264,FBHS,"This stock is also coming off a solid earnings beat, as consumers are buying more of the specialty items from this company.  Known for more of a high end product, RH now offers financing on purchases over $3000 when done on their credit card. RH is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)
"
265,FBHS,"Williams-Sonoma (WSM  -  Free Report)
"
266,FBHS,"Finally we have WSM, and they are on a hot streak of three earnings beats in a row.  Not quite as big as the steak at RH (5 consecutive beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate), but they did have a streak of more than 20 straight quarters of beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate dating back to 2008.  In fact you would have to go all the way back to The Year 2000.

"
293,FBHS,"With November soon coming to a close, I wanted to see what the month of December looked like for the market over the last 10 years.  
"
294,FBHS,"From 2003 thru 2012, 8 of those years (80%) saw the market up in December. The average return for those Decembers was 2.53%.  
"
295,FBHS,"Only 2 years saw the month of December down. The average move in those two December months was
"
296,FBHS,"-0.48%.  
"
297,FBHS,"The best December month was just a few years ago in 2010 with a 6.53% increase.  
"
298,FBHS,"Below is a table showing the Total Return for the S&P and the percentage change for each respective December. 
"
299,FBHS,"The above statistics makes me feel pretty good about being bullish going into the end of the year. 
"
300,FBHS,"But how best to take advantage of it?  
"
301,FBHS,"Conventional wisdom says small caps are the way to go. And in general, it's hard to disagree. But, over the last 10 years, large-caps, mid-caps and small-caps each had their day in the sun taking the leadership position over all the others.  
"
302,FBHS,"Small-caps have been the top performer so far this year with a YTD return of 33.6% vs. mid-caps at 31.99% and large-caps at 28.42%.  
"
303,FBHS,"But for the last 4 weeks, large-caps have beaten all the other classes with a 3.03% gain. Mid-caps and small-caps only did 1.47% and 1.46%, respectively.  
"
304,FBHS,"And I think the large-caps will be the victors again next month as well.  
"
305,FBHS,"A lot of portfolio managers are feeling forced to get fully vested in stocks for the end of the year and play catch-up to the market, given how many have been lagging the S&P. For this reason, I'm believing this money will pour into the larger, seemingly more stable equities.  
"
306,FBHS,"In fact, I think that has already begun and is being reflected in the above stats, showing the large-caps outperforming the small-caps by more than 2 to one last month. Screen

"
317,FBHS,"Retailers procure goods in large quantities directly from manufacturers or wholesalers and sell them in smaller quantities to customers through 
"
318,FBHS,"retail shops or online platforms. As consumer spending is the key to the viability of any economy, the health of the retail industry becomes an important economic indicator.
"
319,FBHS,"As a leader in the retail business, the United States provides ample growth opportunities for all types of retail companies. The retail industry covers everything in its scope, ranging from internet catalog sales, auto dealers, convenience stores, vending machines and clothing -- thus dividing retailers into numerous categories. Retailers of all sizes, including individual direct marketers or direct sellers, small- to medium-sized franchise unit owners, and large “big-box” store operators compete in the U.S.
"
320,FBHS,"From a growth perspective, the retail industry is among the dominant U.S. industries, and employs an enormous workforce. Retail sales represent approximately 30% of consumer spending.Correlation with the Economy
"
321,FBHS,"So far this year, the broader markets have showcased signs of a better pace of recovery and have thus infused hopes of a better economic 
"
322,FBHS,"scenario going forward. One could contest this economic outlook, but the stock market’s strong recent gains show clearly which way investors think the economy is headed. After strong gains this year, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are in record territory already and on the cusp of reaching milestone levels.
"
323,FBHS,"The stock market continues to soar given the Federal Reserve's stimulus program, wherein the central bank buys $85 million in bonds each month. Though the Fed Officials hinted to gradually roll back the program, however, the timing of the probable tapering of the program is still not certain.
"
324,FBHS,"Overall, most market participants expect the Fed to hold off on making any changes to its policy stance at least through April 2014.
"
325,FBHS,"An improved housing backdrop and gains on the labor market front have raised hopes of better times to come on consumer spending front. The recent rise in mortgage rates as a result of Fed taper fears has had some dampening effect on the housing sector, but overall activity level in the sector remains favorable. The last jobs report also indicated positive momentum in the labor market, though the data may not have been entirely reliable given effects from government shutdown.
"
326,FBHS,"However, consumer confidence appears to have taken a hit as a result of the fiscal discord in Washington DC.
"
327,FBHS,"The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell drastically to 71.2 in Oct 2013 following a small dip to 80.2 in September. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey shows similar weakness.Key Metrics
"
328,FBHS,"The key data in retail industry analysis is comparable-store sales (comps), as it excludes sales at newly opened and closed stores. An improving job market, lower gas prices and favorable weather boosted sales data.
"
329,FBHS,"Apart from this, the reopening of government offices boosted customer traffic to stores for buy-now and wear-now apparel. These positives aided retailers to generate healthy sales for the month of October with consumer spending gaining some pace. As a result, the key metric data for most retailers reflected growth for the month of October.
"
330,FBHS,"Among the retailers, clothing chain L Brands Inc. (LTD), a specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care
"
331,FBHS,"products, led the pack with an 8% rise comparable-store sales and an 11.4% increase in net sales. This was followed by drugstore operator Walgreen Co. (WAG), which posted a 5.8% rise in comps and a 6.1% increase in total sales.
"
332,FBHS,"Off-price retailer of apparels, footwear and accessories Stein Mart Inc.  was also on the list of best performers. The company registered a
"
333,FBHS,"5.4% rise in October comps, while total sales increased 6.9%. The Gap Inc. (GPS) posted a 4% rise in comps and a 5.7% increase in net sales to $1.29 billion for the month of October.
"
334,FBHS,"Apparel and accessories retailer, Cato Corporation (CATO) reported a 3% rise in comps with a 4% improvement in net sales. Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST), the warehouse retailer, also delivered comps growth of 3%. Meanwhile, net sales for October rose 6% to $8.15 billion from $7.66 billion in the year-ago period.The Buckle Inc. (BKE), a retailer of casual apparels, footwear and accessories for men and women, witnessed a 2.6% rise in comps when compared with Oct 2012 results. Net sales increased 2.8% to $86.6 million from $84.2 million in the prior-year period.
"
335,FBHS,"Drugstore chain retailer Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report) reported a 2.1% growth in comparable-store sales for Oct 2013, primarily driven by improved comps results at its pharmacy stores. Total drugstore sales climbed 2.2% to $1.961 billion for the month.
"
336,FBHS,"However, some retailers showcased soft performance. Washington-based retailer of sports-related teen apparel Zumiez Inc.  reported a 1.2% increase in comps, while net sales notched 10% higher to $46.3 million. Discount store operator Fred's, Inc. (FRED) witnessed marginal growth with only a 0.8% rise in comps, up from a 0.8% decrease witnessed in Oct 2012. Net sales for October increased 2% to $143.4 million.
"
337,FBHS,"However, the U.S. retail and food services sales data for Sep 2013 were disappointing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the retail and food services sales fell 1% sequentially but improved 3.2% year-over-year to $425.9 billion.Retailing - New Game, New Rules
"
338,FBHS,"The retail industry is rapidly evolving with a dramatic change in consumer buying habits. Satisfying customers and enriching buying experience require new strategies from retailers today. Modern retailing, interestingly enough, is a new game with new rules.
"
339,FBHS,"Despite the gradual rise in consumer discretionary purchases, the sluggish U.S. economy and continued weak in Europe cannot be ignored. Burdened with the lackluster scenario, retailers have largely concentrated on buyers’ needs and lured them with innovative products, attractive discounts, free shipping and the ease of shopping through smartphones and tablets. However, these strategies only helped in generating modest revenues.
"
340,FBHS,"Thus, retailers essentially need to come up with brilliant strategies, while incorporating technological advancements and utilizing their real estate portfolio to the optimum level. In short, they need to Experiment, Differentiate, Optimize and Transform. In doing so, most retailers today are adopting an “omnichannel” approach, utilizing all possible mediums to engage consumers, including brick and mortar stores, online, and mobile.
"
341,FBHS,"Banking on this new mantra, Staples Inc. (SPLS), the world’s largest retailer of office products and services and second largest online retailer, launched its first omnichannel stores, what it refers to as ""the future of retail.""
"
342,FBHS,"Simply put, through this omnichannel strategy, Staples hopes to integrate its retail network with enhanced digital capabilities. The company stated that stores will incorporate its .com and mobile assets. Alongside, the stores will feature Staples.com kiosks.
"
343,FBHS,"This new era store concept, with all its attractions could well prove to be a game changer in the long run for Staples. Providing shoppers the ease of shopping on their own terms and enriching their in-store shopping experience could be a crucial point of differentiation among other retailers.
"
344,FBHS,"In harmony with the evolving retail industry, department store operator Macy's Inc. (M) also adopted an omnichannel strategy. Despite macroeconomic challenges and cautious consumer spending, Macy’s continues to post healthy results. Management largely attributes the credit to its omnichannel strategy aimed at enhancing customers’ shopping experience.
"
345,FBHS,"Other notable retailers who are dancing to the tune of the omnichannel strategy include Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) and Chico’s FAS Inc. (CHS).Trends to Rule Going Forward
"
346,FBHS,"Some of the trends that are expected to rule the retail sector going forward include employing more technological solutions, incorporating customer feedback and targeting additional audiences with products and services.
"
347,FBHS,"With the growth of the .com era, shoppers have largely adopted new purchasing modes, using the Internet, mobile phones and tablets. Consumers today prefer to use their laptops or smartphones to compare prices of products they want to buy and place orders online, instead of visiting the company’s stores. This growing trend has guided major U.S. retail chains to downsize their physical retail operations, and in turn develop their e-Commerce and m-Commerce sites to attract customers.
"
348,FBHS,"Other traits that are expected to affect the retail industry are the growth of self-service options for processes such as checking out and finding items in stores. These offerings provide greater convenience and faster transactions, and they satisfy shoppers who prefer to visit brick-and-mortar locations for immediately purchasing predetermined items.
"
349,FBHS,"Of late, the store-within-a-store concept has been making headlines, though it's nothing new to retailers. J. C. Penney Company Inc. (JCP) is one such retailer which has been focusing on this business strategy for quite some time. The recent one to join the league is consumer electronic retailer Best Buy Company Inc. (BBY), which has been facing stiff competition from industry bellwethers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to increase its footfall, sales and profitability.
"
350,FBHS,"Best Buy is leaving no stone unturned to woo consumers and attain incremental revenue, and it was well evident from its strategic initiative of opening over 1,400 ""Samsung Experience Shops"" within its stores, announced in April. The model seems to be working for the retailer, which also has a dedicated floor area for Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) products.
"
351,FBHS,"Taking the initiatives further, Best Buy recently unveiled its partnership with Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) to roll out the “Windows Store” across its 500 outlets in the U.S. with an additional 100 in Canada. The electronics retailer come out with better-than-expected results for the October quarter, but warned about trends in its margins for the all-important holiday season quarter.
"
352,FBHS,"Further, retailers across the industry are identifying the need to know their customers better, to drive growth. In today’s retail world, where consumer is the king, companies are focusing on effectively using data and analytics to better understand consumers, as well as for branding, product management, and making better pricing decisions. Focused on leveraging large amounts of consumer-related data and providing personalized solutions to customers, retailers are adopting the technologies like Cloud Computing.Challenges and Some Remedial Measures
"
353,FBHS,"The retail industry is highly competitive and encounters significant challenges. Although the U.S. economy has started witnessing a recovery, we still believe that 2013 will not fully mark the resurrection. Consumers are slowly regaining confidence and cautiously increasing their spending.
"
354,FBHS,"Moreover, consumers remain sensitive to macroeconomic factors including interest rate hikes, increase in fuel and energy costs, credit availability, unemployment levels, and high household debt levels, which may negatively impact their discretionary spending and eventually adversely affect the growth and profitability of retail companies.Macroeconomic Conditions: Retail is no different from other U.S. industries, which is highly dependent on the economy to prosper. Such heightened dependence on the economy and factors like job growth and interest rates indicate that a speedy recovery of the economy is vital for the health of the retail industry. While the unemployment rate has decreased considerably over time, consumers are now beginning to draw out their savings to spend, anticipating some economic recovery.Changes in Consumer Needs, Attitudes and Behavior: The growth of modern retail is linked to consumer needs, attitudes and behavior. Adapting to the sluggish economic environment prevalent over the last few years, consumer behavior has shifted to being more conservative. This has now become the regular behavioral pattern of consumers as they remain budget conscious, seeking greater value. In the process, buyers are swiftly switching to the less expensive brands and consolidating shopping trips.
"
355,FBHS,"Moreover, people today prefer to cook at home instead of eat out. This shift in consumer behavior is inducing retailers to adopt various strategies to stay in the competition. Retailers are offering trend-right and well-designed assortments at compelling prices, without compromising on the quality, in order to drive traffic.Staging Stores: The waning popularity of brick-and-mortar store formats has made it essential for retailers to adopt new techniques like ‘staging stores’ to woo customers. Staging basically refers to the act of making the company’s stores attractive, where people like to spend their time. The idea behind this strategy is to make shopping interesting for consumers, so that they would want to walk into the stores, rather than shop online.Zacks Industry Rank
"
356,FBHS,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, Retail/Wholesale (one of 16 Zacks sectors) is divided into two categories -- Nonfood Retail-Wholesale and Food/Drug- Retail/Wholesale under the Medium (M) Industry Group and further sub-divided into 14 industries at the expanded level -- Building Products-Retail/Wholesale, Internet Commerce, Retail/Wholesale Auto/Truck, Retail-Apparel/Shoe, Retail-Consumer Electronic, Retail-Discount, Retail-Drug Store, Retail-Jewelry, Retail-Miscellaneous/Diversified, Retail-Restaurants, Retail-RGN Department, Retail-Supermarket, Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts and Retail/Wholesale CMP.

"
360,FBHS,"Analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for the constituent industries in this space, it is apparent that the overall outlook for the Retail/Wholesale sector is Neutral.Earnings Trends
"
361,FBHS,"The broader Retail/Wholesale sector portrays an impressive earnings trend. The third quarter 2013 results for the sector were disappointing in terms of both beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) and growth.
"
362,FBHS,"The earnings ""beat ratio"" was 52%, while the revenue ""beat ratio"" was 28%. Total earnings for this sector increased 6.2% year over year, reflecting an improvement over 7.3% growth registered in the second quarter of 2013. Total revenue grew 3.7% in the quarter versus 4.2% jump in the previous quarter.
"
363,FBHS,"Looking at the consensus earnings expectations for the rest of the year, the picture looks blurred with earnings expected to grow only 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2013, registering full-year 2013 growth of 7.2%. Going into the next year, however, earnings expectations look slightly encouraging, with projected earnings growth of 10.8% in the first quarter and 13.5% in the second quarter of 2014. Additionally, full-year 2014 earnings are expected to grow 17.0%.
"
364,FBHS,"For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our ‘Earnings Trends’ report.Conclusion
"
365,FBHS,"Retailers are trying to remain competitive primarily by shifting focus to the long-term horizon and finding innovative solutions to create value, reduce operating costs and mitigate risks throughout the enterprise.
"
366,FBHS,"Right-sizing inventories, enhancing efficiency and competence and bringing in technological advancements are the key agendas that retailers are focusing on. Moreover, cost-containment efforts and merchandise initiatives to improve margins are top priorities.
"
367,FBHS,"Retail, owing to its huge spectrum, remains a lucrative investment avenue for investors. The sector reflects consumer spending trends, an important parameter to gauge the health of the economy. Thus, identifying future winners from this sector would be a good investment decision.
"
368,FBHS,"We recommend few stocks in the sector at this point, as these companies are showing significant growth despite the secular headwinds. The stocks in our coverage with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) include, Best Buy Companies Inc., Rite Aid Corp., Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI), Quicksilver Inc. (ZQK), Builders FirstSource Inc. (BLDR), TravelCenters of America LLC (TA  -  Free Report), Netflix Inc. (NFLX), Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. (NUS) and Mohawk Industries Inc.

(HVT), Fortune Brands Home & Security Inc. (FBHS), The Kroger Company (KR) and Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS).
"
370,FBHS,"On the other hand, there are stocks that don’t hold promise in the near term, and carry Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). These include Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS), Hibbett Sports Inc. (HIBB), Staples Inc., Costa Inc. (ATX), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report), Coach Inc. (COH), Fred’s Inc., Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO), Crocs Inc.

"
371,FBHS,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, after the market closes.The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 5.87% over the preceding four quarters. Notably, Fortune Brands’ adjusted earnings per share in fourth-quarter 2017 came in at 80 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayInflation in labor cost is expected to have impacted Fortune Brands’ profitability in first-quarter 2018. In the prior quarter too, lack of skilled forces had escalated labor cost, consequently weighing over the bottom-line performance of the company’s cabinet business.Fortune Brands is making heavy marketing and promotional investments for augmenting brand awareness in the market. However, these expenses might drag down margins in the near term.We also fear that unfavorable government policies, recently-implemented plywood tariff, or bad weather might dent Fortune Brands’ profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.Furthermore, prevalent softness in some parts of the cabinet market (especially semi-custom cabinet business) might have continued into the first quarter as well, in turn thwarting the company’s top-line performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for first-quarter revenues of the Fortune Brands Cabinets, Plumbing, Doors and Security segments are currently pegged at $598 million, $416 million, $112 million and $138 million, lower than the respective tallies of $626 million, $469 million, $129 million and $159 million recorded in the prior quarter.Nevertheless, Fortune Brands believes continued growth in the U.S. home products market, strategic acquisitions and a strong innovation pipeline will help bolster its revenues in the quarter to be reported.The company is also poised to counter labor inflation with pricing actions and capacity-expansion moves.Earnings WhispersOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results. Per the model, a stock needs to have a combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for a likely earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterThat is not the case here as we will see below.Zacks ESP: Fortune Brands has an Earnings ESP of -1.46%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents is a penny higher than the Most Accurate estimate.Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Fortune Brands’ unfavorable Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), when combined with a negative Earnings ESP, makes surprise predictions inconclusive.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks that you may want to consider from the Zacks Industrial Products sector,  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. (ALRM  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +5.44% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. (BRSS  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +2.96% and a Zacks Rank #1.Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +4.07% and a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>
