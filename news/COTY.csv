8,COTY,"Beauty spending is up 20% from last year, according to Piper Jaffray's most recent semi-annual teen survey, as makeup and skincare continue to gain wallet share among young women across the country.The results bode well for Ulta Beauty (ULTA), indicated Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink in a note. But not so much for Estee Lauder (EL).MAC remains the No. 1 preferred cosmetics brand among both upper- and average-income young women, but its decreasing market share among those groups prompted her to downgrade MAC parent Estee Lauder to neutral.Specialty beauty stores are still on top: LVMH-owned Sephora dominates as the most-preferred beauty destination for affluent young women (41%), followed by Ulta (20%). Among average-income female teens, they're neck and neck, with Ulta at 29% and Sephora at 27%. Both gained share among the latter group.Broadly, teens are dedicating more and more of their allowance to cosmetics and skincare. Among young women, beauty products now occupy 11% of ""wallet share"" -- i.e. the proportion of annual spending on each category, per Piper Jaffray's definition -- up from 8.5% five years ago and 7% a decade ago.IBD'S TAKE: For a look at Amazon's struggle to elbow out specialty beauty retailers like Ulta and Sephora, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Separately, Wissink raised her estimates on Ulta following its investor day conference on Thursday, as she sees the beauty retailer becoming ""a much larger business with the potential to double earnings.""Piper Jaffray rates the stock overweight with a 290 price goal.Ulta upped its Q3 and full-year guidance Thursday, prompting an 11.4% surge that largely erased the slide that occurred after the company's last quarterly report, which topped expectations but offered slightly light guidance.Shares of Ulta fell 1.3% in the stock market today. Estee Lauder shares dipped 0.9%.Peer Coty (COTY) shares lost 0.6%.

9,COTY,"Procter & Gamble (PG), which has spent years paring down its sprawling consumer-products empire, is finally returning to growth mode.Organic sales — a measure that excludes the effects of currency exchange-rate fluctuations as well as acquisitions and divestitures — rose in all five of P&G's product divisions units last quarter, leading to a 3% gain companywide. And while total revenue still fell, it was the smallest decrease since 2014.The results signal that P&G's strategy of divesting nonessential brands to focus on its main household and personal-care businesses is starting to pay off. P&G completed the sale of more than 40 beauty brands to Coty (COTY) this month, a move that Chief Executive Officer David Taylor called ""the last major step"" in P&G's transformation of its portfolio. The company is now focusing all of its attention on categories where it holds leading positions, he said.Tuesday's results show the efforts are gaining traction.""P&G is making solid progress in improving share trends,"" Mark Astrachan, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., said in a note. He recommends buying the shares.Profit was $1.03 a share, excluding some items, in PG's fiscal first quarter, which ended Sept. 30. Analysts estimated 98 cents, on average. Revenue slipped less than 0.1% to $16.5 billion, Cincinnati-based P&G said in a statement Tuesday. That roughly matched analysts' projections.IBD'S TAKE: P&G has worked hard to stay above water in a tough global environment for consumer products firms. But it's a lot more profitable to work hard in a growth sector. New Oriental Education broke out to a new high Tuesday after the Chinese education firm reported solid earnings as enrollment jumped 31%.P&G shares rose as much as 4.4% to 87.77 on the stock market today, the biggest intraday increase in a year and trying to retake its 50-day line. P&G already had gained 5.9% this year through Monday.Organic sales advanced 3% in the grooming business, which includes Gillette shaving products. Sales by that measure climbed 3% in the beauty unit, which sells Pantene shampoo and Olay skin care products. The health care division, the maker of Crest toothpaste and Prilosec heartburn medicine, had the biggest organic sales increase at 7%.The fabric and home care unit posted a 4% organic sales gain, while the baby, feminine and family care business had a 2% advance.The companywide organic sales increase of 3% topped analysts' consensus expectation of a 2% gain, Astrachan said. Sales volumes rose 3%, marking the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014, he said.P&G maintained its forecasts that organic sales would grow about 2% and adjusted earnings would increase at a mid-single-digit percentage rate in its current fiscal year.

10,COTY,"U.S. stocks advanced confidently for solid gains Tuesday, closing near session highs.The Nasdaq rose 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6% and 0.7% respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running modestly higher but that was on an easy comparison. Volume declined for three sessions in a row through Monday.Monday night's uneventful presidential debate gave the market little reason to react in fear or greed. Economic news Tuesday and at least one technical factor might have been the bigger influences on the day's action.The PMI Services Flash survey came in at 51.9, up from August's 50.9 reading. Meanwhile, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index trampled the Street's 98.8 consensus estimate with 104.1 for September, which was higher than any estimate in the range.A technical factor also may have improved the market's mood. The put-call ratio closed at 1.08 Monday, a level that sometimes hints at a short-term bottom. The last time the ratio was in that neighborhood was Sept. 9 and 13, with readings of 1.14 and 1.11. The Nasdaq formed a bottom and began to rise around that time.If the presidential candidates managed to get through Monday night's debate without disturbing the market, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer also kept trouble at arm's length. Fischer spoke at Howard University on Tuesday and said he did not want to raise interest rates ""too much"" and added that he wasn't sure when it should happen. On Aug. 26, Fischer upset the market a bit when he suggested two rate hikes this year would be ""consistent"" with Fed Chair Janet Yellen's remarks.IBD'S TAKE: A diverse mix of gainers Tuesday was a good sign for the stock market. But there's nothing wrong with long-time big leaders: Facebook is retaking a buy point, at least intraday.Individual stocks were finding different reasons to advance Tuesday, a good sign. Catalysts varied from divestitures, regulatory approval and a new price target to earnings and industry conditions.For example, Procter & Gamble (PG) popped about 0.6% in very heavy volume. The company is close to wrapping up a deal to transfer 41 brands to Coty (COTY). Procter & Gamble has been divesting weaker units for the past two years. Analysts say the Coty move completes P&G's divestiture program. The Street expects P&G to grow EPS 6% in fiscal 2017 ending in June and then 9% in fiscal 2018. The 9% growth would be the best in 10 years.Abiomed (ABMD) gained Japan's regulatory go-ahead for the Massachusetts company's heart pump device. The midcap stock thrust 2% in above-average volume to a 52-week high. The Street expects Abiomed to grow earnings 38% in fiscal 2017 ending in March and then 54% the following year.Amazon.com (AMZN) rode 2% to a new high after JPMorgan & Chase raised its price target from 925 to 1,000 and kept shares at an overweight rating.Thor Industries (THO) gapped up 3.5% on quarterly results and a strong rating for the group. Volume was running more than 500% above average.RV shipments industrywide have been running strong. The tally came in at 35,946 in August, which was the best August total since 1977. The August total represented a 31% year over year gain, according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association.Other RV stocks also are doing well. Drew Industries (DW) bounced off its 50-day moving average line Tuesday, as the stock gained more than  3% in slightly below-average volume. Patrick Industries (PATK) rumbled more than 4% higher as it retook its 50-day line.

13,COTY,"The stock market today felt some early pressure from overseas, where weak manufacturing data left China's markets sharply divided and placed pressure on global commodities prices.

Output remained about the same as in March, with new orders stagnating and exports falling for a fifth straight month. Inflationary pressure crept higher, as input costs rose at the fastest pace since January 2013.The Shanghai composite advanced 1.9%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.9%.

It was Pfizer's second EPS gain in six quarters. Management raised its full-year earnings guidance above forecasts and lifted 2016 revenue guidance to the high end of expectations. A company statement said its “late-stage product pipeline is increasingly ready to deliver our next set of prospective growth drivers.” The stock ended Monday 2% below a 33.60 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Mylan (MYL) led the S&P 500, up 4% on a mixed first-quarter report.Among IBD 50 stocks, premarket gains were volatile, while losses were a bit more steady. INC Research (INCR) dropped almost 5% on a downgrade from Robert W. Baird. PRA Health Sciences (PRAH) also retreated 5%, after announcing a 5-million-share secondary offering after Monday's close.Big foreign banks were taking some early hits: UBS (UBS) dropped 6% after its Q1 report. Deutsche Bank (DB) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) tanked 5% each. Credit Suisse (CS) slumped 4%.Oil prices slipped more than 1%, with West Texas Intermediate trading just above $4 a barrel.

""This includes the actions we have taken and continue to take to drive improved performance in the North American business.""The company said it regularly reviews its business and operations options and takes into account shareholder opinion. It did not confirm or deny talks with Cerberus.The statement comes after a Wall Street Journal report late Thursday that Avon was in advanced negotiations with Cerberus Capital Management over the acquisition of its North American business.That same day, an investor group led by Barington Capital publicly called for the restructuring of the company, and urged against a sale of Avon's North American business on the reported terms.""We would oppose any sale of the North America business on terms that are disadvantageous to current shareholders or limit the options for a new senior management team to maximize long-term shareholder value,"" said Barington.Avon is ""significantly undervalued,"" said the letter, which criticized Avon's board and senior execs for mismanaging the company. The group, which includes NuOrion Partners AG, owns more than 3% of outstanding Avon shares.According to Barington, the cosmetics seller's failures include its 2012 rejection of Coty's (COTY) $23.25-per-share takeover offer, ""inopportune"" share repurchases, and ""poor choice of new CEO,"" among other things.The group said its plan, which includes cutting costs and reinvesting in operational improvements, would save Avon $500 million to $700 million annually and achieve 90 cents in per-share earnings.Shares of Avon jumped 5.8% to 4.22 in the stock market today after rising as high as 4.52.

184,COTY,"Before her first fashion job, the Austrian immigrant changed her name to Hattie Carnegie in admiration of wealthy Andrew Carnegie.
"
185,COTY,"""It was a tribute to someone who she really upheld,"" Nancy Deihl, director of New York University's master's program in costume studies, told IBD. ""It was also a career move, about becoming American, but also becoming a prominent American. It was kind of canny and sweet at the same time.""
"
186,COTY,"Carnegie (1889-1956) couldn't sew, cut or sketch.
"
187,COTY,"Yet her fashion and business savvy enabled her to turn a hat shop into a wholesale and retail clothing and accessory empire that set the standard for American high fashion for three decades.
"
188,COTY,"The tiny woman from the shadow of Europe's Alps adapted French haute couture for American tastes, helped establish fashion as a major American industry and helped turn New York City into the world's fashion capital.
"
189,COTY,"She trained superstars Norman Norell and Jean Louis and clothed Hollywood's Joan Crawford and Marlene Dietrich for their films.
"
190,COTY,"A tireless worker, she showed that a woman could successfully run a major company in a fiercely competitive business in an era when men called the shots.

"
192,COTY,"""We have the loveliest women in the world in this county, and wherever there are beautiful women there will be beautiful clothes,"" Carnegie once said. ""To show the American woman ... to (her) best advantage — that has always been my aim, and that is my real biography.""
"
193,COTY,"Carnegie was born the second of seven children in Vienna. After a fire destroyed their home, her father, Isaac, moved the family to New York in 1892.
"
194,COTY,"Isaac died when Hattie was 13. That forced her to quit school and help support her family with work in the millinery.
"
195,COTY,"""Her deal was millinery. She love hats,"" said Sheryl Farnan Leipzig, apparel and textiles program coordinator at Metropolitan Community College in Kansas City, Mo.
"
196,COTY,"In 1909, with friend Rose Roth, she opened a shop called Carnegie-Ladies Hatter. Roth made dresses; Carnegie designed hats and took care of customers.
"
197,COTY,"""Her father had tailoring skills, but Hattie wanted nothing to do with that,"" said Leipzig. ""Tailoring was not a glamorous profession. Neither was dressmaking. She wanted to be the boss. The boss didn't always get to be the creative one. The boss hires the right people to execute all the creative work.""
"
198,COTY,"In 1913, Carnegie and Roth incorporated with $100,000 in capital — worth $2.3 million today — and moved to New York's fashionable Riverside Drive. After World War I ended in 1918, Carnegie bought out her partner and founded Hattie Carnegie Inc., becoming president and the major stockholder.
"
199,COTY,"Carnegie imported French designs, produced custom style and sold other designers' ready-to-wear outfits. She also sold accessories, perfume, chiffon handkerchiefs, silk hose and cosmetics.

"
203,COTY,"Added Leipzig: ""Even though we think of her as a fashion designer, she loved retail. Retail was a lot different than it is now. Stores were decked out like palaces then. They created this royal-like environment to get women in the shop. She sold like crazy.''
"
204,COTY,"Carnegie's career began at a time when Americans looked almost entirely to France for direction on high fashion. In 1919 she made her first trip to Paris; over the next two decades she made as many as seven trips a year to the French capital.
"
205,COTY,"Rather than copy Paris fashion, she became a great interpreter of French high style. Blending that country's cutting-edge clothing with an American desire for comfort, she developed a sophisticated style called the Carnegie Look.
"
206,COTY,"""At these fashion shows she'd say, 'I can take this idea and make it into something much more marketable for Americans.'

208,COTY,"""(In the 1920s) American designers were ramping up with a great deal of originality and with a manufacturing system not matched anywhere.

And Carnegie was able to take French fashion and make it clean, crisp and American.""

"
210,COTY,"By 1929, Carnegie's annual sales had reached $3.5 million — worth $46 million now. Then came the Depression, which dragged down rich Americans to the point where they couldn't afford Carnegie's original designs. Adapting to the new market, she added a modestly priced, ready-to-wear line of clothing that became the most lucrative part of her business. ""She really knew the taste of the minute. She had a very keen sense of the market,'' Leipzig said.

"
213,COTY,"Not only did Carnegie make her name with elegant clothes, but she also trained a generation of designers. Norell, Louis and Claire McCardell learned the craft under Carnegie, who had an eye for gathering talented people and bringing out their best to create her look.

215,COTY,"Carnegie never sat down at a sewing machine or picked up a sketch pad. Her deal was the big picture, in spite of her label as a designer.

She was a pioneer in that in the American fashion industry.""
"
217,COTY,"In 1948, Carnegie received the coveted American Fashion Critics Award, sponsored by the cosmetics and perfume company Coty, for her ""distinguished contribution to the long-range development of good taste in dress in America.""
"
218,COTY,"When she died at age 76, Carnegie's business was worth $8 million, or $66 million today.

268,COTY,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) has been off investors’ radar for a while now, mainly due to persistent softness at its Consumer Beauty segment. In fact, strength at its Luxury and Professional Beauty businesses have not been enough to save this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock that has lost 26.2% in the past six months as against the industry’s 8.7% increase.Coty’s Consumer Beauty segment, which constituted nearly 46% of the company’s top line in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, has been posting soft organic sales for the past few quarters. The segment remained pressurized in the third quarter as well, wherein organic sales dropped 4.4%, which is much wider than a 1.3% dip recorded in the previous quarter. Consumer Beauty also witnessed a 19.9% plunge in adjusted operating income, which came in at $97.3 million.Results in the third quarter were hurt by weak brands and pricing actions undertaken in Brazil. Also, persistent softness in the global mass beauty market and intense competition have been significant deterrents. Talking of competition, the beauty products industry is highly competitive with the number of competitors and degree of competition varying widely from country to country.To this end, Coty faces competition from various products and product lines, in both domestic and international markets. Coty competes against products sold to consumers by other direct-selling and direct-sales companies and through the internet. It also contests against products sold through the mass market and prestige retail channels.Apart from this, the Consumer Beauty segment has been consistently witnessing underlying challenges in North America and Europe. As Consumer Beauty forms a significant part of Coty’s business, softness in this segment weighed on the company’s overall organic sales. Incidentally, organic sales of this cosmetic big-wig rose just 0.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as robust growth in Luxury and continued strength in Professional Beauty segment was countered by a modest fall in Consumer Beauty organic sales.Markedly, management has been undertaking solid efforts to improve the segment’s performance. In this regard, relaunch of various key brands like Clairol Nice 'n Easy has also helped the unit to some extent. While the segment is showing some signs of improvement, full recovery is likely to take time.Nervous About Coty? Check These Solid BetsInter Parfums, Inc.

269,COTY,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 11.9% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is COTY due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Coty's Q3 Earnings & Sales Beat EstimatesCoty posted third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the bottom line declined 13% year over year. On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of 10 cents per share compared with a loss of 22 cents in the year-ago quarter.The company generated revenues of $2,222.7 million, which advanced 9.4% year over year and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,187 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues increased 3.4%, driven by contributions from Younique and Burberry. Coty’s organic revenues inched up 0.2% including contributions from Younique. Organic revenues were also propelled by robust growth in Luxury and continued strength in the company’s Professional Beauty segment, partly offset by a modest fall in Consumer Beauty organic sales.Adjusted gross margin increased 100 basis points (bps) to 64.3% in the quarter, driven by strong performance in all its segments. Additionally, adjusted operating income jumped 9.4% to $227.8 million on the back of improved gross margins and stringent cost controls. These upsides were partly offset by enhanced marketing spend. Further, adjusted operating margin contracted 10 bps to 10.2%.Segment DetailsLuxury: Luxury net revenues rose 18.6% to $752.5 million (up 11.8% on a currency neutral basis). Currency-neutral revenue growth is attributable to a 6.1% rise in organic growth that was backed by success of fragrances from Tiffany (TIF) and Gucci as well as Chloe Nomade and CK One. It also includes 5.7% contribution from Burberry. Adjusted operating income for the Luxury segment grew 16.6% year over year to $100.4.Consumer Beauty: Consumer Beauty revenues advanced 3.3% to $1,021.7 million. However, sales in the segment declined 1.2% on a currency-neutral basis, thanks to 4.4% fall in organic growth stemming from wreak brands and pricing actions undertaken in Brazil. These were partially offset by growth in the ALMEA region. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer Beauty segment declined 19.9% to $97.3 million.Professional: Professional Beauty net revenues of $448.5 million improved 9.7% (up 1.9% on a currency-neutral basis). Currency-neutral sales were fueled by higher revenues from OPI, backed by growth in gel restage and lacquers. Adjusted operating income for Professional segment more than doubled to $30.1 million during the quarter.On a region-wise basis, net revenues increased 4% in North America, driven by gains from Younique and Burbery as well as strength in Tiffany and Gucci Bloom. However, the same was countered by weakness in U.S. color cosmetics. Sales in Europe improved 15.1% owing to success of Tiffany and Gucci Bloom fragrances.  Sales in the ALMEA region jumped 7%, courtesy of solid growth in fragrances and color cosmetics in China, partially countered by lower revenues in Brazil.Other Financial UpdatesCoty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $460.8 million and net debt of $7,470.4 million.During the quarter, the company used net cash from operating activities of $118.9 million, owing to increased working capital requirements. The company’s free cash flow was negative $205.4 million.Concurrently, the company announced a dividend of 12.5 cents a share, payable on Jun 14 to shareholders of record as on May 31.OutlookManagement is pleased with solid growth in the Luxury business and ongoing momentum in the Professional segment. Although performance in the Consumer Beauty segment has been uneven, signs of improvements keep management encouraged. The company is optimistic about its recent launches that have been yielding favorably. Also, the company has been streamlining its portfolio to focus on brands with high growth potential and drive long-term growth.Considering these factors and the year-to-date performance, Coty continues to expect modest net organic revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2018. Management expects healthy margin improvement over the second half, with maximum contributions coming from the fourth quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been seven revisions lower for the current quarter. Last month, the consensus estimate has shifted downward by 19.1% due to these changes.Coty Inc. Price and Consensus  Coty Inc. Price and Consensus | Coty Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, COTY has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was also allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C.

270,COTY,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for COTY broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 4.2% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for COTY stock.If that wasn’t enough, COTY isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 7 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for COTY.

273,COTY,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 9, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this leading beauty company will be able to pull a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive surprise of 33.3%. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 3.1%.Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coty Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Strategic Buyouts & Initiatives to Drive Coty in Q3Coty has been gaining from its focus on strategic buyouts, product launches and brand licenses to enhance the portfolio. The buyouts have been enhancing its portfolio, which is augmenting its top line. Notably, the company’s top line jumped 14.8% year over year in the last reported quarter, driven by contributions from ghd, Younique and Burberry. Additionally, revenues gained from robust growth in Luxury, and continued strength witnessed in the Professional segment.The company remains optimistic about the ongoing synergies from buyouts, which have been solidifying its portfolio. Also, innovations and e-commerce operations are driving results. Given these factors and the year-to-date performance, the company expects modest net revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2018. Management also expects healthy margin improvement over the second half, with maximum contributions from the fiscal fourth quarter.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2.19 billion reflects growth of 7.6% from the year-ago reported figure.Further, Coty holds a strong position in fragrances and color cosmetics, and has a solid regional presence in the skin & body care. Also, management keeps introducing new products in response to shifting consumer preferences, and market new and established products through strategic advertising and merchandising.Additionally, Coty is boosting its end-to-end digital-transformation efforts, including e-commerce across its divisions and regions. In the fiscal second quarter, Coty launched artificial-intelligence tools on boots.com in the UK and it also partnered with Amazon to launch “Let’s Get Ready” for the Amazon Echo Show. Apart from this, the buyout of leading online peer-to-peer social-selling platform, Younique, is a major evidence of Coty’s focus on connecting with customers through e-commerce initiatives.Possible Deterrents That Might Impact the QuarterHowever, Coty’s Consumer Beauty segment has been sluggish for the past few quarters. It has been struggling due to underlying challenges in North America, changing consumers’ preferences and a competitive environment. Evidently, organic sales at this segment dipped 1.3% in the fiscal second quarter on account of persistent softness in the global mass beauty market. Though the company is working toward improving the segment, the recovery is likely to take time. This remains a concern for Coty’s upcoming performance.Consequently, the stock has declined 12.3% in the past month, wider than the industry’s fall of 8.9%. This reflects a negative sentiment on the stock, ahead of the earnings release.Analysts polled by Zacks expect earnings of 12 cents per share for the to-be-reported quarter. Though consensus estimates have been stable in past 30 days, it reflects a decline of 20% from the year-ago quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Coty is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Coty has an Earnings ESP of -3.67% and a Zacks Rank #3. While the company’s Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat.United Natural Foods, Inc.

274,COTY,"Delta Apparel, Inc. (DLA  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 7. The manufacturer of comfort fabric apparel has a mixed earnings surprise record in the trailing four quarters. However, it topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter. Let’s see what’s in store for Delta Apparel this time around.What to ExpectThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 27 cents, which shows a 42.6% slump from 47 cents recorded in the year-ago period. The estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $100 million, down 3.8% from the year-ago period reported figure. Delta Apparel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Delta Apparel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Delta Apparel, Inc. Quote Factors Driving the QuarterDelta Apparel is likely to gain from its robust endeavors aimed at rationalizing business, enhancing operational efficacies and implementing marketing initiatives. These strategies, along with solid consumer demand helped the company deliver strong results in the last reported quarter. Further, management remains encouraged about expansion plans of Art Gun, Salt Life as well as Soffe. Art Gun’s focus on solidifying geographic reach, Salt Life’s strength across retail stores and e-commerce, and Soffe’s efforts to curtail costs and improve performance are likely to fuel Delta Apparel’s performance. All these factors bode well for the quarter to be reported.However, we remain cautious about the tough retail environment, that may weigh on sales and margins. Further, the company divested its Junkfood business toward the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which may hurt year-over-year comparisons this time. Apart from this, we remain apprehensive about higher raw material costs that weighed on the company’s gross margin in the last reported quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model doesn’t show that Delta Apparel is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Though Delta Apparel has a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Coty Inc.

275,COTY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report)) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 7. This provider of food and related products has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.1% in the trailing four quarters, with a beat in each quarter. Let’s see if Sysco can keep this positive streak alive this time around as well.Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation Quote U.S. Food Service Unit & Strategy for 2020: Major DriversWe expect Sysco to continue gaining from strength at its U.S. Foodservice segment as well as its focus on achieving growth via acquisitions. These factors and solid cost-savings efforts helped the company retain its robust past record in the last reported quarter. Notably, Sysco’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 results marked its fourth straight quarter of sales beat, whereas earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight of the past nine straight quarters. Results in the quarter were mainly backed by strength in the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations, wherein restaurant sales continued to grow and compensated for soft traffic. Further, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations rose 4.8% and total case volumes jumped 3.5%. Notably, local case volumes in this segment has been rising year over year for 15 consecutive quarters. Management expects a stronger second half, wherein it also anticipates favorable results from its International segment.In the third quarter analysts polled by Zacks expect sales from U.S. Foodservice and International units to grow 5.7% and 8.3% to $9,761 million and $2,739 million, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall sales is pegged at $14,382 million, up from $13,524 million recorded in the year-ago period.Apart from this, we also remain encouraged about Sysco’s focus on its strategy for 2020, as it gives out positive signals for the quarter to be reported as well. Sysco’s four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience; optimizing business; stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. In this regard, the company remains focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands. Further, to evolve with the changing consumer preferences, Sysco remains committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations. This is evident from the recent launch of its redesigned website, which is aimed at enhancing consumers overall experience. Moreover, it plans to improve supply chain, increase transparency, enhance deliveries and attain operational efficiency. Further, we commend Sysco’s focus on acquisitions, which are expected to drive sales and also enhance Sysco’s presence in international markets.Will Cost Hurdles be Offset?However, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year contraction in gross margin for the past two quarters. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company continued to bear the brunt of higher inbound freight costs, which stemmed from driver availability challenges in the industry. Segment-wise, the U.S. Broadline unit gross margin was marred by food cost inflation of 3.3%, owing to categories like meat, dairy and produce. The International segment was hurt by food cost inflation in the U.K., driven by higher product costs and currency movements.Also, the company incurred higher costs in Europe due to constant investments in transformation endeavors. Moreover, weakness in pound sterling resulted in acute food cost inflation in the United Kingdom, thereby hurting volumes and margins. Further, adjusted operating income for the International segment tanked 28.8% to $79 million. Persistence of these hurdles remains a threat to Sysco’s International performance.Nevertheless, we expect Sysco’s robust cost-saving initiatives and other growth endeavors to help offset these hurdles in the to-be reported quarter. Moreover, the company envisions annual savings of roughly $200-$300 million from the recent tax reforms, which is likely to fuel the bottom line by 9-13 cents in the second half. Given these factors, along with the progress of its cost-savings plan, Sysco remains well placed to deliver a solid third quarter. The consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 64 cents, which marks a solid 25.5% improvement from 51 cents recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model doesn’t show that Sysco is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Though Sysco has an Earnings ESP of +0.63%, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We usually caution against sell-rated stocks going into earnings announcement.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Coty Inc.

276,COTY,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

277,COTY,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.63%.In fact, this beverage giant delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 1.48%.A Look at Coca-Cola’s Revenue PerformanceCoca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets, and shifting consumer preferences. The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last 11 quarters, primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category, and structural changes.Last quarter, Coca-Cola’s revenues declined 20% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 26% impact on revenues. This time again, the company expects the same degree of adverse impact on net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items. Moreover, the first quarter will have one less day than the same period last year. However, the company expects currency to have a positive impact on quarterly net revenues by 2%. Again, revenues will be positively impacted by 1% from Accounting Standards Update 2014-09.That said, the company’s organic revenues grew across the board in the last reported quarter. Coca-Cola has been firing on all cylinders to rejuvenate its portfolio. It has ramped up its efforts to transform into a total beverage company with a broad, consumer-centric brand portfolio and an asset-light business model. Coca-Cola is pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.Coca-Cola witnessed solid growth in the preceding quarter in its developed markets, mainly in Europe and North America, buoyed by improving execution in recently refranchised territories, higher pricing, improved product innovations and packaging strategies. Although other emerging markets were more challenging in the first half of 2017, the company saw an improvement in the key markets like India, Argentina and Brazil as it moved into the second half.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coca-Cola’s total revenues stands at $7.43 billion, implying 18.6% year-over-year decline.Segment DiscussionNorth America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to witness solid growth in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues of $2.49 billion reflects growth of 96.5% from the preceding quarter and 4.1% sequentially.Latin America revenues are likely to witness 9.3% decline sequentially but 9.4% growth year over year. On the other hand, the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment revenues of $1.73 billion indicates a decrease from $1.75 billion in the last quarter but an increase from $1.63 billion a year ago. Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease to $1.1 billion from $3.9 billion a year ago and $1.1 billion last quarter. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 0.1% on a year-over-year basis and 17.3% sequentially.Cost Savings to Drive GrowthThe cola giant has been focusing on increasing efficiency and improving its margins amid tough business conditions. To that end, Coca-Cola’s strategy to refranchise its bottling operations facilitated improved margins by reducing its exposure to the capital-intensive bottling business. Refranchising efforts, though likely to hurt sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Coca-Cola’s adjusted EPS got a 5.4% and 2% boost in Q4 and Q3, respectively, from the year-ago level (after falling for nine consecutive quarters) despite weak revenues. The company’s earnings have topped the consensus mark in 13 of the past 14 quarters.The improvement was attributable to its ongoing productivity initiatives. Its adjusted gross margin expanded 480 basis points or bps in Q4. Comparable operating margin also grew 540 bps. The company’s plan to refranchise its low-margin bottling operations and transform into a capital-light business is helping to improve its margins. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Again, the company is on track to deliver annualized savings of about $3.8 billion by 2019 through its productivity programs. These include restructuring of its global supply chain, zero-based budgeting and streamlining its operating model.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s first-quarter revenues are likely to decline owing to structural changes. Nonetheless, pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line to some extent.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 46 cents, reflecting a 7% year-over-year increase.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Coca-Cola does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which are required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Coca-Cola is -0.34%.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

278,COTY,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 20, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.48%.In fact, this consumer goods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.11%.Factors to ConsiderWeak volumes and slowing market share growth have been hurting sales of Procter & Gamble for quite some time. However, the company has been witnessing improved sales environment and thereby earnings in the recent times, thanks to higher volumes driven by innovation, proficient distribution, and in-store activity.In the last reported quarter, sales grew 3%, increasing in 14 of the 15 largest markets and 8 out of 10 categories. Overall organic sales were up 2% comprising 2% volume growth. Market share trends are improving modestly, with Procter & Gamble holding or growing shares in 27/50 top category-country combinations (versus 22 last year). In fact, the company’s sales grew 2% in the first six months driven by 2% volume growth.We expect this improving sales trend to follow in the to-be-reported quarter as well, driven by growth in key markets, product categories, as well as e-commerce and in-store operations. Notably, the company’s premium offerings like Olay have been registering solid growth in China. In the fiscal second quarter, Olay in China achieved its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.That said, various top-line headwinds continue to persist. Overall, the soft category growth rate in developed countries and higher competition in the United States from brands like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s Razor in the male grooming category are likely to hurt the company’s razors and blades’ sales. Again, challenges in the baby care category, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category and higher commodity costs are added woes. Meanwhile, the Algerian government’s import ban on finished products and lower subsidies in Saudi Arabia are added concerns.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, Procter & Gamble reiterated its fiscal 2018 sales projection. The company expects organic sales growth in the range of 2-3% for fiscal 2018. All-in sales growth is expected about 3%.Overall, for the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $16.2 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.5%.Apart from the sales improvement, let’s take a look at the company’s margin story. Despite muted sales growth, the company has exceeded analysts’ expectations on earnings for the 11th consecutive quarter. Procter & Gamble has managed to post higher earnings despite tepid sales owing to productivity and cost-saving plans in order to boost margins, thereby lifting profit level.However, the company failed to expand margins in the last three reported quarters, as productivity savings were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, and product reinvestments. Then again, the company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs, and lowering its marketing and advertising spending has helped it in supporting its operating margins to some extent. The trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Overall, for the quarter to be reported, the company’s margins are likely to remain subdued due to higher input costs. The company expects higher commodity costs including pulp, kerosene, ethylene and propylene to adversely impact its profitability by $300 million in fiscal 2018.Again, unfavorable mix and lower pricing in the shave care category are likely to impact margins further. Procter & Gamble’s investing in price to drive sales of its razors and blades, due to increased competition from shave clubs, have affected its market share. Yet, productivity savings and share repurchases will partly offset these woes.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 98 cents, reflecting growth of 2.1% year over year.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Procter & Gamble does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP:  Procter & Gamble has an Earnings ESP of -0.58%.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

279,COTY,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report), a renowned name in the world of beauty and cosmetics, relies primarily on strategic buyouts to boost its portfolio and market presence. Also, stringent cost control, innovations and e-commerce operations are driving results.However, underlying weaknesses in the company’s Consumer Beauty segment have increased concerns for management, lately. In fact, organic sales in this segment dipped 1.3% in the second quarter, thanks to persistent softness in the global mass beauty market. Also, the segment has been persistently witnessing underlying challenges in North America. While results at the consumer beauty unit improved sequentially and management is working toward enhancing this segment, full recovery is likely to take time.On that note, lets delve into some of the strategic efforts undertaken by Coty that have helped sustain its position in the cosmetics realm and see if such growth drivers can help it tide over the aforementioned obstacles. Acquisitions: Vital Growth Agent  Improved consumer confidence has not only been favoring spending on food and beverage items but has led to higher expenses on personal care and cosmetic products. Such trends have been boosting Coty’s Luxury and Professional segments performance and encouraged the company to engage in business expansion through buyouts.Coty made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio. In this regard, the company concluded the buyout of the iconic Burberry brand in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which is likely to further solidify the Luxury segment. In fact, synergies from the ghd, Younique and Burberry brand drove the company’s top-line during the second quarter.  Other noteworthy buyouts of the company include Procter & Gamble’s Beauty business that has been favorably impacting Coty’s performance for a while. All said, management is optimistic about the ongoing synergies from buyouts which have been solidifying its portfolio.Strides in the E-Commerce RealmConsumers’ tech-oriented lifestyle drove Coty to undertake end-to-end digital transformation efforts, which includes e-commerce, across its divisions and regions. The company has been taking great strides in this regard, which helped it witness e-commerce sales growth in its segments. In the second quarter, Coty launched artificial intelligence tools on boots.com in UK and partnered with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to launch “Let’s Get Ready” for the Amazon Echo Show. Apart from this, the buyout of leading online peer-to-peer social selling platform, Younique indicates Coty’s focus on connecting with customers through e-commerce initiatives. Further, the company is making progress with COVERGIRL brand through its Custom Blend app. The app helps customers to take a digital, social and influencer-led go-to-market approach and personalize and customize it as per desire.Other Efforts to Drive EfficiencyIn addition to the aforementioned growth drivers, Coty is committed toward cost reduction and inducing operational efficiencies. In fact, the company targets to realize nearly $750 million of synergies driven by cost, procurement, supply chain and SG&A savings by 2020. Apart from this, Coty seeks to divest non-performing brands to focus and utilize its resources in other attractive opportunities.We expect such efforts to help Coty offset the challenges in the Consumer Beauty segment, which will raise further optimism among investors.

280,COTY,"Investors in Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the May 18, 2018 $11 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Coty Inc. shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Coty Inc. is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Cosmetics industry that ranks in the Top 41% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 13 cents per share to 12 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Coty Inc. right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

282,COTY,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this apparel manufacturer and designer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Hanesbrands has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.Hanesbrands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hanesbrands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc. Quote International Strength & Focus on Buyouts Remain DriversHanesbrands has been delivering top and bottom-line growth annually for more than a year now. Hanesbrands has mainly been gaining from its focus on buyouts and strength in its international division. These factors also fueled the company in third-quarter 2017, wherein Hanesbrands organic sales growth for the first time in eight quarters. This, in turn was backed by solid International sales that represented nearly 31% of the company’s top line.International sales were fueled by strength in Hanes Europe Innerwear; Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia, with global Champion sales growing 16% in the quarter. Notably, sales at the International segment jumped 14% on a currency neutral basis. Apart from the aforementioned factors, extensive online sales growth also bolstered sales improvement at the segment. Management expects the fourth quarter to mark another quarter of organic sales growth. Also, we expect the International segment to continue being a major driver in the fourth quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for International sales is pegged at $551 million, representing a 9.1% rise from the year-ago period.While these factors are likely to drive the top line, focus on Project Booster program should help the company generate cost savings and aid the bottom line. Notably, by 2019, this project is anticipated to produce nearly $150 million of annualized cost savings, out of which roughly $50 million will be reinvested in targeted growth avenues.Factors Raising ConcernsHowever, a tough retail landscape has been hurting Hanesbrands’ brick-and-mortar performance. Evidently, this marred Hanesbrands’ domestic sales in the quarter. Further, the company’s Innerwear segment has been delivering soft results for a while now on account of soft brick-and-mortar performance stemming from sluggish traffic. In third-quarter 2017, sales at this unit declined 5.2% in the quarter to $644.1 million, as the apparel category bore the brunt of a tough back-to-school retail landscape.Management expects the soft retail U.S. trends to linger in 2017, which raises concerns over its fourth-quarter performance. Incidentally, for the fourth quarter, the consensus mark for Innerwear sales stands at $594 million, down 2.8% from the year-ago period.  Also, the fourth quarter is likely to be impacted by additional marketing investments; the recently announced buyout of Alternative Apparel and effects of Sears Canada bankruptcy.Q4 Expectations in NumbersConsidering all factors, the company projects fourth-quarter net sales in a band of $1.63 billion to $1.65 billion, with the mid-point depicting an increase of nearly 3% on an organic basis. This outlook is based on a conservative view for the U.S. sales landscape; sales of roughly $15 million expected from Alternative Apparel and negative effects from Sears Canada bankruptcy. Adjusted earnings are envisioned in a band of 51 cents to 53 cents, while GAAP earnings per share are projected to range from 47-49 cents.The earnings estimate (both GAAP and adjusted) includes 5 cents from higher marketing investment, greater mix of International sales and the expected adverse impact from Sears Canada bankruptcy somewhat negated by greater-than-expected buyout synergies.  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 53 cents, which is in line with the year-ago period. This estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,631 million, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclude that Hanesbrands is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Unfortunately, Hanesbrands fails both the criteria, as the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has an Earnings ESP of -0.14%.

283,COTY,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this major tobacco player will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Unfortunately, Phillip Morris has lagged earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average miss of 5.4%.Philip Morris International Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Philip Morris International Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteHowever, the company is undertaking solid efforts to expand in the reduced risk products space, given the stringent regulations on tobacco products and consumers becoming more health conscious. Thus, let’s see if the company can reverse the dismal trend this time.Factors at PlayPhilip Morris has been bearing the brunt of lower cigarette volumes, which can be largely accountable to regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing, anti-smoking campaigns and higher excise duties. Apart from this, rising health consciousness among consumers also resulted in lower cigarette consumption globally. Together, these factors have been weighing on cigarette industry volumes. Incidentally, Philip Morris’ net revenues during third-quarter 2017 were hurt by 3.6% in combustible products. Total shipment volumes in this category also fell 4.1%. As a result, total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume dipped 0.5%.To make matters worse, the court recently issued an order which guides cigarette companies to put up self-critical advertisements circulated through television, newspapers, social media and store displays. Such headwinds plaguing the tobacco industry remain a concern for Philip Morris’ combustible products category performance. Well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter cigarette volumes is currently pegged at $207 million.Reduced Risk Products & Pricing – Major Growth DriversGiven the aforementioned industry conditions, Philip Morris diverted its attention to reduced risk products (RRPs) to propel growth. Evidently, Philip Morris launched the iQOS (in 2014), a smokeless cigarette, in approximately 31 markets globally and catered to more than 3.7 million consumers globally, excluding the United States. The company expects to gain from increased volumes in reduced risk tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, HeatSticks and iQOS products. Philip Morris has also been making several investments to expand the capacity of its heated tobacco products.Thanks to the growing popularity of such products, Philip Morris generated revenues worth $947 million from RRPs in third-quarter 2017, up from $212 million in the year-ago period. Also, revenues from RRPS, along with strong pricing more than offset soft cigarette volumes, helping Phillip Morris deliver year-over-year top and bottom-line growth in the third quarter. While, revenues declined in Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA), the same increased across Asia, and Latin America & Canada — largely fueled by greater revenues from RRPs. The consensus mark for net sales in Asia and Latin America & Canada is $6,648 million and $2,662 million, up from $5,517 million and $2,571 million, respectively.In fact, the company’s overall sales have been rising annually for more than a year now on the back of such efforts. Also, Phillip Morris enjoys a strong pricing power, which helps it maintain margins at the desired level. Though industry headwinds and unfavorable currency fluctuations remain the major killjoys for Phillip Morris, we expect the aforementioned growth initiatives to continue driving the company in the quarter to be reported.Q4 Estimates as a WholeThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.36, which represents nearly 24% growth from the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,372 million, up 20.1% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Philip Morrisis likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

284,COTY,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 5. We expect Church & Dwight to continue gaining from its stable portfolio of value and premium products, focus on innovations, benefits from buyouts and aggressive productivity programs. These factors have been driving Church & Dwight for a while now, with the Consumer International segment in particular.Consumer International to Remain a Major Driver Church & Dwight’s Consumer International business has been doing exceptionally well. Evidently, consistent strength at this segment has been driving the company’s overall organic sales growth for more than a year now. In the third quarter, organic sales in the consumer international segment jumped 6.2%, thanks to higher volumes. Also, overall consumer international sales surged 21.7% on the back of extensive sales of household and personal care items. Incidentally, sales at this segment received considerable impetus from FEMFRESH, OXICLEAN and STERIMAR in the export business, STERIMAR and ARM & HAMMER baking soda in Mexico, FEMFRESH in Australia as well as ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Further, the company is opening new offices to support increase in export business, and it continues to invest in the consumer international business to sustain its strong sales growth.Clearly, this segment holds immense potential and is likely to sustain its splendid trend this time around as well. Markedly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $154 million, reflecting a solid 20.3% upside from the year-ago reported figure.Growth Initiatives to Continue Driving Performance Further, Church & Dwight’s regular innovation helps in improving brand positions and market share in the consumer categories. Thus, management remains committed toward innovations in particular, as it believes that remains the biggest driver for its top and bottom-line growth in future. As for acquisitions, Church & Dwight has acquired a number of superior brands with high margin over time. These businesses boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004 to $3.5 billion in 2016. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in third-quarter 2017 and is on track with its integration.Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Quote Together, such strategic endeavors drove Church & Dwight’s results in the third quarter. Despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes, both top and bottom lines grew year over year and topped estimates. While this marked the consumer products giant’s fourth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise, sales have outpaced the consensus mark in 12 of the last 14 quarters. In fact, Church & Dwight’s strong record has helped it jump 10.58% in the past three months, crushing the industry’s 2% growth. Delving deeper into the results, we note that improved volumes drove organic sales by 3.2% — thereby retaining its long year-over-year growth trend. Apart from continued strength at consumer international, organic sales were also backed by growth in domestic sales and solid Specialty Products business improvement. In fact, broad-based growth across segments also helped the company to offset high promotional costs and generate bottom-line growth. A look at the consensus marks for sales for Church & Dwight’s other segment reveals that, Consumer Domestic segment is likely to deliver sales of $776 million (up from $695 million posted in the year-ago period), while consensus estimate for sales at the Specialty Products unit stands at $77 million (up 4.1% from the year-ago reported figure).Q4 & 2017 Expectations as a WholeAll, said we expect this New Jersey-based company’s broad-based strength to continue helping it overcome increased promotional and other expenditures this time around. Encouragingly, management expects reported and organic sales growth of 11.2% and 3.2%, respectively in the fourth quarter. International sales are anticipated to jump 6.2%, whereas sales of Specialty Products are expected to advance 7.5%, both on reported and organic basis.  Management also expects domestic volumes to gain 7% and lead to market share gains. All said, the company expects adjusted earnings of 50 cents in the fourth quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 14%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 50 cents, which represents more than 13% growth from the year-ago period. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,007 million, up 12.4% from the year-ago reported figure. For full-year 2017, Church & Dwight envisions bottom line to increase 8.5% year over year to $1.92, which is in line with the consensus mark.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Church & Dwight is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

285,COTY,"Sysco Corp. (SYY  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 5. The food products giant delivered positive earnings surprise in seven out of the past eight quarters, while sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for three consecutive quarters. Sysco’s strong record has also helped it to jump 22.8% in a year against the industry that dipped 0.2%.So, let’s see if this Texas-based company can keep its spectacular surprise streak alive this time too.Factors at PlayWe expect Sysco to continue gaining from its cost-saving and revenue-management efforts, which have been driving its performance for a while now. Incidentally, the company has been impressively managing expenses for the past few years, and is making progress in both SG&A and supply chain areas. In the supply chain area, the company is witnessing positive momentum from its productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements.Driven by these endeavors, the company remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately $600-$650 million through the end of FY18. This growth is expected to come from lower administrative costs and improving gross margin, which gives out positive signals for the quarter under review.Further, the company’s focus on acquisitions, new product developments, value-added services and improved e-commerce capabilities remains a growth driver. In this regard, the company’s recent acquisition of HFM Foodservice is likely to augment its top line, by boosting revenues of the U.S. Foodservice segment. Notably, Sysco expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions in the long term. Other than aiding sales growth, these acquisitions also enhance Sysco’s presence in international markets.Backed by these factors, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year growth in top and bottom lines for quite some time now, and we expect this trend to continue in the quarter to be reported.How Are Sysco’s Segments Placed?Taking a segment-wise look, we remain optimistic about the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations, which delivered a strong performance in the last reported quarter despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes. Notably, sales in this segment advanced 4% to $9,849.9 million, with local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations up 2.8%. Also, gross profit increased 3.8%, backed by the company’s focus on product management, efficient pricing and revenue management initiatives.Going forward, management expects its domestic business to be buoyed by increased consumer demand and traffic. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $9,561 million, which reflects 5.2% growth from the year-ago period.Moving to the International Foodservice Operations, this unit delivered improved sales too in the last reported quarter. However, results were partly hurt by softness in Europe, which is battling slow traffic. Moreover, weak UK currency resulted in food cost inflation, thereby leading to pricing pressure. These headwinds are likely to persist throughout the fiscal, though management remains focused on reducing the impact of such obstacles. Additionally, the company remains encouraged about the growth prospects in Latin America. Markedly, the consensus mark for International sales stands at $2,784 million compared with $2,626 million in the same year-ago period.The company also remains hopeful of growth in its SYGMA segment, for which the consensus estimate for sales is $1,613 million, up 6.1% from the year-ago reported sales figure.Q2 Expectations as a WholeSysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation QuoteGiven these factors and Sysco’s focus on its recently announced strategies for 2020, we believe that the company will continue with its top and bottom-line growth in the second quarter.Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 65 cents, which represents more than 12% growth from the year-ago period. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $14,186 million, up 5.4% from the year-ago reported figure.What the Zacks Model Unveils?To top it, our proven model shows that Sysco is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

286,COTY,"The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 2. We note that this cosmetics giant has delivered positive earnings and sales surprise for 13 and three consecutive quarters, respectively. The company has been gaining from focus on strategic acquisitions, sturdy foothold in the beauty space and robust online and travel retail network. Let’s see if Estee Lauder can keep its spectacular surprise streak alive this time too.Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Factors at PlayEstee Lauder has been witnessing year-over year top-line growth for more than two years now, while its bottom line depicted growth in the past three quarters. The cosmetics big-wig’s splendid past record and investors’ confidence in its prospects is well reflected by the 69.1% surge in its shares over a year. This also crushed the industry’s rally of 38%. Focus on Buyouts, Online & Travel Retail to Drive Q2 ResultsWe expect Estee Lauder to continue gaining from its robust brand portfolio across most categories, benefits from acquisitions and solid presence in emerging markets. Notably, the buyouts of BECCA and Too Faced (during first-quarter fiscal 2017) have strengthened Estee Lauder’s fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed significantly to sales growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Also, management expects these brands to contribute roughly 3 percentage points to the company’s overall sales growth in the second quarter. Also, the investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company is likely to aid beauty sales.Estee Lauder also has a strong online business and the company expects it to be a major growth engine for the upcoming years. Thanks to technological advancement and the growing popularity of social media, mobile sales constituted about 70% of the company’s online traffic in the last quarter and remains a major growth driver. Estee Lauder is also growing its sales in China through T-mall, the largest digital platform run by Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba. Estee Lauder remains focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.Prospects from China Bode WellWhile Estee Lauder has a solid presence in emerging markets, solid prospects from China appear bright, as sales in this region soared nearly 50% in the first quarter. This was driven by double-digit growth in all brands, with MAC, Tom Ford and Lab Series businesses nearly doubling year over year. Also, management stated that its makeup business doubled for the second straight quarter, whereas performance of its skin care and luxury fragrance business also remained favorable in the quarter. The company’s operations in China have been gaining from rising demand from millennials. Management thus envisions continued strength in luxury products in China, which keeps it encouraged about making incremental investments in the region. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from Asia/Pacific region is pegged at $763 million, depicting year-over-year growth of 15.8%.Skin Care & Makeup Categories Remain Major DriversAll these factors, along with growth in travel retail have been spurring growth at Estee Lauder and are most likely to sustain this trend in the quarter to be reported. Among all categories, Estee Lauder’s skin care and makeup categories have been performing particularly well for nearly a year. In the last quarter, skin care and makeup sales advanced 16% and 18% year over year, respectively. We expect these categories to remain major drivers in the second quarter as well.Turning to estimates for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for skincare and makeup sales is currently pegged at $1,434 million and $1,515 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of about 15% and 16%, respectively. Further, the consensus mark for fragrance and hair care sales is $553 million and $147 million, compared with the year-ago period sales of $497 million and $137 million, respectively.Q2 Expectations as a WholeClearly, Estee Lauder is expected to continue with its top and bottom-line growth trend in the second quarter. Incidentally, management forecasts net sales growth of 13-15% in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales are expected to improve 10-11%. Currency is expected to positively impact second-quarter sales by 3-4%.Further, the company envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $1.38-$1.41 per share for the second quarter. The earnings range marks an increase of 13% to 15% over the prior-year earnings. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings are expected to improve 8-10%.Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings witnessed an uptrend in the past 30 days, and is now pegged at $1.43, which represents more than 17% growth from the year-ago period. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,673 million, up 14.5% from the year-ago reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Estee Lauder is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

Robust demand has been favoring the performance of this segment, wherein revenues jumped 7% to $304 million in the last quarter. Incidentally, results were fueled by solid demand for systems and equipment that are used for food and pharma projects and engineered plastics. Also, increased demand for screening and separating equipment fueled segment revenues.Given these trends, the company has been focusing on capitalizing the opportunities provided by the process equipment market. In this regard, the acquisition of Coperion has also aided Hillenbrand’s pricing and productivity initiatives. Driven by such upsides, management expects Process Equipment unit to witness continued organic growth in fiscal 2018, supported by a robust backlog level.However, persistent softness at the Batesville business segment remains a hurdle. This unit has long been struggling with lower burial volumes in North America, as consumers depict a radical shift toward cremation. In the last quarter, segment revenues declined 4% to $139 million due to reduced demand for burial caskets which stems from families rising preference for cremation. Moreover, the performance of this segment remains challenged with higher commodity and fuel costs. Management expects these hurdles to linger and hurt revenues and margins in fiscal 2018, which remains a concern for the upcoming quarter.Nevertheless, we expect the flourishing process equipment business to tide over the aforementioned weakness and drive Hillenbrand this time around.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hillenbrand is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

288,COTY,"With acquisitions and efforts to boost online business rolled up in its sleeves, Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) seems well on track to augment market share in the world of beauty and cosmetics. In fact, these factors have been fueling the top line performance of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company for a while.However, a major obstacle in Coty’s growth path is the sluggishness in the Consumer Beauty segment. This has been denting the company’s organic sales performance. So, let’s see if Coty’s growth drivers can help the company to tide over obstacles and sustain its growth in the forthcoming periods.Acquisitions: A Vital Growth DriverImproved consumer confidence has not only been favoring higher spending on food and beverage items, but has also increased spending on personal care and cosmetic products. Such trends have been boosting Coty’s Luxury and Professional segments performance and have also encouraged the company to engage in business expansion through buyouts.In fact, Coty has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its rich line-up of brands. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s top line improved more than 100% year over year, mainly driven by contributions from the P&G Beauty business buyout and positive synergies from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. Other instances include the buyout of 60% stake in LLC and the takeover of international license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare.Other Efforts to Boost PerformanceFurther, Coty is boosting end-to-end digital transformation efforts including e-commerce across its divisions and regions. The company has been making great strides in this regard, which has driven e-commerce sales growth in Consumer Beauty and Luxury segments in the first quarter. Notably, through the peer-to-peer social selling platform Younique, Coty has been able to establish improved connectivity with customers. Further, the company is making progress with COVERGIRL brand through Custom Blend app. The app enables customers take a digital, social and influencer-led go-to-market approach as well as personalize and customize it as per desire.Additionally, Coty is committed toward enhancing cost structure. This is indicated from the fact that the company’s gross margin has been expanding for a while now. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the adjusted gross margin increased 280 basis points, courtesy of supply-chain efficiencies; procurement synergies and contributions from buyouts. Also, the adjusted operating income jumped 17% to $195.1 million, driven by Coty’s stringent financial discipline.Aided by such upsides, shares of the company have surged 32.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rally of 22.1%.Can Strategic Plans Offset Headwinds?Lately, persistent softness in Consumer Beauty segment has been a worry for the company. The segment has been struggling against underlying challenges in North America, thanks to changing consumers’ preferences and a highly competitive environment. Soft market trends in major cosmetics categories and reduced shelf space for few brands (in the United States and Europe) have been acting as deterrents for the segment. Evidently, organic sales in this segment tumbled 8% in the first quarter, following declines of 10% and 6% in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.Nevertheless, Coty’s strategic business expansion and efficiency-building endeavors have helped the company to develop a robust brand line-up. We expect such efforts to help the company overcome the aforementioned headwinds.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

289,COTY,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 23. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this consumer products company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Well the company has outperformed earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation Quote What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.55, which represents nearly 7% growth from the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4,591 million, up about 1% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayKimberly-Clark witnessed year-over-year growth in both top and bottom line in the last quarter, driven by higher sales at Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional (KCP) and Other segments, along with robust cost savings from its Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) program. Sales at the aforementioned segments gained from higher volumes backed by the company’s effective merchandising strategy. This also helped the company to witness marginal growth in organic sales at its overall consumer business, after a 3% drop in the first half of 2017. Region wise, organic sales remained flat in North America, grew 3% in emerging markets, while it dropped by the same rate in developed markets. Softness in the developed markets mainly stemmed from weak diaper sales in South Korea due to a considerably fall in birth rate.Moving to the company’s Personal Care Products segment, which constituted about 50% of Kimberly-Clark’s total sales, we note that sales remained soft owing to lower volumes as well as net selling prices. Well, lower net selling price remains a concern for the overall company, owing to intense competition and heightened promotional activities. In fact, North America remains particularly challenged due to these factors.Nevertheless, management expects Personal Care Products to deliver a better performance in the fourth quarter, backed by its brand initiatives and effective promotional strategy. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $2,261 million, reflecting a 0.6% rise from the year-ago figure. The consensus marks for sales at Consumer Tissue and KCP and Other units are $1,547 million and $791 million, depicting 2.8% and 1.5% year-over-year growth, respectively.Cost Savings Vs Input Cost InflationApart from these factors, Kimberly-Clark is also likely to gain from the successful implementation of its FORCE program, which generated cost savings of $125 million in the third quarter. However, input cost inflation remains a challenge, which the company has been battling for over a year now. For 2017, the company anticipates commodity costs inflation to be marginally higher than its previous estimate of $200-$300 million, primarily due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp and polymer resin.Nonetheless, management remains focused on curtailing discretionary spending during the year. Moreover, currency and lower effective tax rate are expected to favorably impact the bottom line. All said, we expect benefits from these factors and the FORCE program to more than offset rising input costs, and help the company witness earnings growth in the fourth quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Though Kimberly-Clark carries a Zacks Rank #2, its Earnings ESP of -0.84% makes surprise prediction difficult. Notably, the Most Accurate estimate of $1.54 is pegged a notch lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and a Zacks Rank #3.

290,COTY,"Coty Inc.’s (COTY  -  Free Report) has been steadily gaining from well-planned acquisitions and a strong foothold in the cosmetics industry, supported by leading brands. These factors have been fueling the top line of this cosmetics giant. The company’s shares have rallied 23.5% in the past three months, outpacing its industry’s gain of 17.3%.However, the company is struggling with soft organic sales in Consumer Beauty segment, which dented overall performance.So, let’s see if Coty’s growth drivers can help offset these obstacles and sustain the impressive momentum.Efforts Driving Business GrowthImproved consumer confidence has not only been favoring higher spending on food and beverage items, but has also increased spending on personal care and cosmetic products. Such trends have been boosting Coty’s Luxury and Professional segments performance and have also encouraged the company to engage in business expansion, primarily through buyouts. In fact, Coty has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its rich line-up of brands. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s top line improved more than 100% year over year, mainly driven by contributions from the P&G Beauty business buyout and positive synergies from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. Other evidences in this regard include the buyout of 60% stake in LLC (which forms part of the Consumer Beauty segment). Further, Coty is boosting end-to-end digital transformation efforts including e-commerce in its divisions and regions. The company has been making great strides, which has helped it witness healthy e-commerce sales growth in Consumer Beauty and Luxury segments in the first quarter.Additionally, Coty is committed toward enhancing cost structure. This is well reflected from the fact that the company has been witnessing year-over-year growth in gross margin for four straight quarters now.Consumer Beauty Segment: A Major Concern Unlike the flourishing Luxury and Professional business segments, Coty’s Consumer Beauty category has been sluggish. The segment has been struggling against underlying challenges in North America, thanks to changing consumers’ preferences and a highly competitive environment. Soft market trends in major categories and reduced shelf space for few brands (in the United States and Europe) have been acting as deterrents for Consumer Beauty segment. Evidently, organic sales at this segment tumbled 8% in the first quarter, following declines of 6% and 10% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.Bottom LineNevertheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to gain from strategic acquisitions and other business strengthening efforts. In fact, such efforts are likely to improve the performance of Coty’s Consumer Beauty segment and thereby aid the company’s growth trajectory.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

291,COTY,"Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) has lately fallen out of investors’ favor due to dismal earnings surprise trend. This can primarily be attributed to declining Active Representatives in the past few quarters. The company’s bleak prospects are evident from the dismal stock performance and recent fall in estimates. Further, the company now has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Stock Continues to DeclineShares of Avon declined 4.2% in the last three months, against the industry’s growth of 16.3%. Additionally, the stock has witnessed solid downside of 54.6% year to date. Moreover, the company’s dismal performance in the most recent quarter led the shares to fall 3.4% since Nov 2.Avon reported adjusted earnings per share of 3 cents lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth straight quarter. Results were hurt by decline in both Active Representatives and Ending Representatives across in various segments. Moreover, operating margins were hampered by higher bad debt expenses, increased Representative, sales leader and field expenses, all mainly in Brazil.Estimates Trend Down on Bleak ViewFollowing the dismal quarter, the company provided a bleak view for 2017, which led to a downtrend in estimates.The Zacks Consensus Estimate trended downward in the last 60 days. Notably, the estimate of 6 cents per share for the fourth quarter moved down by 7 cents per share. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 declined from earnings of 10 cents per share to a loss of 2 cents per share.

292,COTY,"The Cosmetics industry has been performing favorably, driven by consumers’ increased spending on personal care and beauty products. Evidently, shares of the industry gained 24.3% on a year-to-date basis, compared with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 22.8%.The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the preferred picks for investors with its 69.3% surge this year, crushing the industry’s performance. Notably, other cosmetic industry firms such as Avon products (AVP  -  Free Report) declined 53.4%. However, Helen of Troy (HELE  -  Free Report) and Coty (COTY  -  Free Report) gained 11.4% and 9.3%, respectively.Let’s look into the factors that have backed Estee Lauder’s bull-run and help the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company sustain the solid trend in 2018 as well. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Acquisitions: Vital Growth DriverEstee Lauder has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance portfolio. The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced (during the first quarter fiscal 2017) has strengthened its rapidly growing prestige portfolio and contributed to the reported sales growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Also, management expects these brands to contribute roughly 2 percentage points to the company’s overall sales growth in fiscal 2018. The investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company is likely to drive beauty sales in the forthcoming quarters.Progress in e-commerceEstee Lauder is focused on widening global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions. Evidently, the company launched more than 100 sites in first-quarter of 2018. Online sales during the said period improved 33%, driven by increased traffic, order size and conversions. Owing to technological advancement and the growing popularity of social media, mobile sales constituted about 70% of the company’s online traffic. Further, Estée Lauder is implementing new technology and digital experiences including online booking for each store appointment and omni-channel loyalty programs. These initiatives are expected to boost the company’s top line in the forthcoming periods.Sturdy Growth in Emerging MarketsThe company derives a significant amount of revenues from the emerging markets. Brazil is one of Estee Lauder’s fastest-growing markets, driven largely by M-A-C, DKNY and Tommy Hilfiger brands. The Middle East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific markets also offer extensive untapped potential for the company. Notably, the company has bright prospects in China, wherein sales soared nearly 50% in the first quarter. The company’s Chinese operations have been gaining from rising demand from millennials. Management envisions persistent strength in luxury products in China, which keeps it encouraged about making incremental investments in the region.The aforementioned factors also enabled Estee Lauder to retain solid surprise history in first-quarter fiscal 2018. This marked the company’s 13th consecutive quarter of earnings beat, while sales kept its positive surprise trend alive for the third straight time.Positive on the Road AheadEstee Lauder projects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is anticipated to grow 4-5% during the year. Additionally, acquisitions, better-quality products, innovation and improved market reach are likely to bolster sales during the year.Driven by such upsides, management expects net sales to grow in the range of 10-11% in fiscal 2018, compared with the previous expectation of 8-9%. The company also expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.04-$4.12 per share for fiscal 2018, compared with the previous view of $3.87-$3.94.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has risen from $4.14 to $4.16, respectively, over the past 30 days.Clearly, the strong fundamentals combined with the company’s encouraging outlook makes this cosmetics giant a favorable pick for investors in 2018.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

293,COTY,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 7.79%.This branded consumer foods’ company delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 1.74%.Factors to ConsiderGeneral Mills has been reporting dismal revenues for the last few quarters. Much like other U.S. food giants, General Mills too is having a tough time due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food.Although General Mills is making significant efforts to drive revenue growth through consumer-focused innovations and marketing initiatives in its key businesses, the company is expected to witness muted sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This is due to continued volume declines in North America.Although the company expects organic sales to improve in the second quarter sequentially, we believe that the company needs time to register growth. The company expects product innovations, promotions during key seasons for soup and refrigerated dough, and investments in compelling media campaigns to strengthen its brands, will bring in improvements.Sales and profits at the North America Retail segment, accounting for about 65% of the company’s total sales, have been soft due to lower demand amid weak food industry trends and changing consumer preferences.Again, lower volumes and higher input costs are creating pressure on margins despite having profound cost-cutting initiatives to boost margin amid soft sales. General Mills’ adjusted gross margin contracted 230 basis points (bps), while its adjusted operating margin plunged 210 bps year over year in its last reported quarter. The downside was mainly due to continued decline in volumes, higher input costs on imported products, increase in advertising media expenses, and unfavorable mix that offset the benefits of its cost-saving plan.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects the factors to turn favorable. Primarily, General Mills anticipates its volume to improve, banking on innovation in brand building. Hence, the rate decline of the company’s adjusted operating margin is expected to lessen in the second quarter (Read more: Will General Mills Witness Improved Margins in Q2?).Overall, an expected decline in volumes, primarily in North America, higher promotional expenses, as planned for the second half of fiscal 2018, and rising input costs are likely to remain a drag on its bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Then again, General Mills’ focus on reducing its cost of goods sold through its margin-improvement plan along with lower share count is anticipated to give support for its EPS growth to some extent.For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a decline of 3.2% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.06 billion, implying a 1.2% decline.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.General Mills does not have the right combination of ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increase the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for General Mills is -1.93%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.   Zacks Rank: General Mills carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.General Mills, Inc.

294,COTY,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 9.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is COTY due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Coty Q2 Earnings & Sales Beat Estimates, Increase Y/YCoty posted second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein adjusted earnings of 32 cents per share jumped 6.7% year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 15 cents per share, up significantly from 6 cents recorded in the year-ago period.Quarter in DetailThe company generated revenues of $2,637.6 million, which advanced 14.8% year over year and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,473 million. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 10.3%, driven by contributions from ghd, Younique and Burberry.  Excluding the impacts from ghd, Younique and Burberry, Coty’s organic revenues rose 2.8% on a constant currency basis. This, in turn was backed by robust growth in Luxury and continued strength witnessed in the company’s Professional segment, partly offset by a modest fall in Consumer Beauty organic sales.Adjusted gross margin contracted 20 basis points to 61.6% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income jumped 12.8% to $347.5 million on the back of higher revenues and stringent cost controls. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 13.2%.Segment DetailsLuxury: Luxury net revenues surged 13.9% to $951.2 million on a reported basis (up 9.1% on a currency neutral basis). Currency-neutral growth was attributable to an 8.1% rise in underlying sales that was backed by success of new fragrances from Tiffany (TIF) and Gucci, improvements in Chloe and 1% contribution from Burberry. Adjusted operating income for Luxury surged 28.6% year over year to $125.4 million.Consumer Beauty: Consumer Beauty revenues advanced 13.7% to $1,138.6 million on a reported basis. Sales at the segment jumped 9.8% on a currency-neutral basis, courtesy of 11.1% contribution from Younique, somewhat offset by a 1.3% dip in underlying revenues. The latter stemmed from weak performance by various U.S. oriented brands. Adjusted operating income for Consumer Beauty advanced 19.4% to $131.9 million.Professional: Professional Beauty net revenues of $547.8 million improved 19.1% and the same ascended 13.6% on a currency-neutral basis. Currency-neutral sales were fueled by 11.6% gains from ghd and 2% rise in underlying business. Adjusted operating income for Professional tumbled 9.8% to $90.2 million.On a region-wise basis, net revenues increased 6.1% in North America, driven by gains from Younique and strength in Tiffany and Gucci Bloom, somewhat countered by weakness in U.S. Consumer Beauty. Sales in Europe improved 13.7% thanks to ghd’s contributions, success of Tiffany and Gucci Bloom, and mass fragrances and retail hair.  Sales at the ALMEA region jumped 30.9% on a reported basis, courtesy of solid growth across all segments.Other Financial UpdatesCoty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $400.1 million, long-term debt (net) of $7,145.8 million and total shareholders’ equity of $9,429.1 million (excluding non-controlling interests).The company generated net cash from operating activities of $307.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2018. During the quarter, the company generated free cash flow of $195.9 million.Concurrently, the company announced a dividend of 12.5 cents a share, payable on Mar 15 to shareholders of record as on Feb 28.On Dec 14, 2017 the company paid dividend of 12.5 cents per share for a total cost of $93.7 million.OutlookManagement remains pleased with the solid growth at its Luxury business, ongoing momentum at the Professional segment and improvement at its Consumer Beauty segment. The company remains optimistic about the ongoing synergies from buyouts, which have been solidifying its portfolio.

295,COTY,"oty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) has long been struggling with soft organic sales at its Consumer Beauty segment. Despite the prevalence of this headwind in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the segment improved on a sequential basis. Also, management has been taking several efforts to revive the Consumer Beauty unit, which forms vital part of Coty’s overall revenues.These endeavors helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock rally about 20% in the past six months, while it underperformed the industry’s 24.7% increase. So, let’s delve deeper into all aforementioned aspects and see what’s in store for the Consumer Beauty segment. What’s Hurting Consumer Beauty?Coty’s consumer beauty segment has been grappling with underlying challenges in North America, mainly due to consumers changing preferences and a highly competitive environment. Notably, Avon Products (AVP  -  Free Report), a cosmetics player also bearing the brunt of dismal sales in North America, was compelled to exit the region.Coming back to Coty, the company’s Consumer Beauty unit remained troubled in North America during the second quarter on account of distribution losses from the previous year, along with inventory wind downs ahead of the company’s planned relaunches. Moreover, the global mass beauty market remained sluggish in the quartet.Consequently, organic sales at this segment dipped 1.3% year over year. Nevertheless, this marked a significant improvement from an 8% drop recorded in the first quarter. Prior to that, organic sales declined 6% and 10% in the third and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively.Strategic Efforts Bearing Fruit: A Revival in the Cards?Well, the improved trends at Consumer Beauty depict that the company’s strategic efforts including its focus on enhancing market execution, undertaking brand initiatives and having consumer-focused communications is yeilding results. Incidentally, results improved in Europe, courtesy of a stabilized business. Also, management remains impressed with Consumer Beauty’s performance in the ALMEA region, especially Brazil that has been depicting robust results for a while now.Well, management has long been focused on reviving the performance of this unit, which accounted for nearly 43% of Coty’s top line in the second quarter. Evidently, the company has been taking steps to make innovations, and enhance product development and communication processes to address the evolving consumer demands and provide on-trend products.Progressing on these lines, Coty announced the relaunch of COVERGIRL brand last year and has solid plans for various other brands like Max Factor and Clairol among others for the second half of fiscal 2018. Management plans to relaunch the Clairol brand in the second half of fiscal 2018.These efforts are aimed at reconnecting these brands with the consumers, building on their existing strong brand equity.Apart from this, Coty is making considerable efforts to speed up end-to-end digital transformation and boost e-commerce development. While these growth strategies make us hopeful about seeing continued improvements at Coty’s vital Consumer Beauty segment, management stated that full recovery is still expected to take some time. Until then, investors can count on the following better-ranked stocks from the same sector.2 Consumer Staples Stocks in the SpotlightEstee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) with a long-term growth rate of 12.9% carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

297,COTY,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading beauty company will be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Last quarter, it delivered a positive surprise of 42.9%. However, the company has a mixed record of surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings miss of 9.4%.Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coty Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Strategic Buyouts & Initiatives to Drive Coty in Q2Coty has been making several strategic acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio, which have been augmenting its top line. Notably, the company’s top line surged more than 100% year over year in the previous quarter driven by contributions from the P&G Beauty business buyout. Contributions from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique also aided sales growth. In this regard, the company also concluded the buyout of its unique international license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare recently, which should further boost its performance.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2,473 million reflects growth of 7.7% from the year-ago reported figure.Further, Coty holds a strong position in fragrances and color cosmetics, and has a solid regional presence in the skin & body care. Also, management keeps on introducing new products in response to shifting consumer preferences, and market new and established products through strategic advertising and merchandising. In this regard, the company’s major introductions of Gucci Bloom and Tiffany’s debut fragrance in the fiscal first quarter are noteworthy. It also launched new campaigns for HUGO BOSS and Marc Jacobs Daisy in the same time period.Additionally, Coty is boosting its end-to-end digital transformation efforts including e-commerce across its divisions and regions. To this end, the company is making progress with COVERGIRL brand through its Custom Blend app, which helps customers to take a digital, social and influencer-led go-to-market approach and personalize and customize it as per desire.Coty also remains committed toward enhancing its cost structure as well. This is quite evident from the company’s year-over-year growth in gross margin for four straight quarters now.Possible Deterrents That Might Impact the QuarterHowever, Coty’s Consumer Beauty segment has been sluggish for the past few quarters. It has been struggling due to underlying challenges in North America, changing consumers’ preferences and a competitive environment. Evidently, organic sales at this segment tumbled 8% in the first quarter on account of persistent softness in the global mass beauty market along with weakness in some brands like retail hair. Though the company is working toward improving the segment, the recovery is likely to take time. This remains a concern for Coty’s upcoming performance.Analysts polled by Zacks expect earnings of 24 cents per share for the impending quarter. Though the consensus estimate has been stable in the past 30 days, it reflects a decline of 20% from the year-ago quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Nevertheless, our proven model shows that Coty is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

298,COTY,"Avon Products, Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) has underperformed the industry in the past year owing to its dismal earnings surprise history. In fact, third-quarter 2017 also marked the company’s fifth straight quarter of earnings miss. The company has been witnessing declining Representatives for the past few quarters as well.Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have plunged nearly 66.4% in a year, as against the industry’s growth of 14.2%.  Why the Downside?Avon has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 98.7% in the trailing four quarters. In the third quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings of 3 cents per share that lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents.Meanwhile, the comapny has been struggling with waning Active Representatives and Ending Representatives. Evidently, Active Representatives declined 3% year over year and Ending Representatives dipped 2% in the quarter.Furthermore, operating margin has been under pressure for quite some time. Operating margin contracted 70 bps to 6.3% in the third quarter owing to higher bad debt expenses along with increased Representative, sales leader and field expenses, all mainly in Brazil.Though Avon expects modest growth in fourth quarter due to improving trends witnessed in various markets, results are likely to lag expectations in 2017.Additionally, Avon faces intense competition from cosmetics products retailer like Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) in domestic and international markets. Changing market trends and evolving consumer preferences might also weigh upon the company’s performance and hurt its overall profitability.Estimates Trending DownwardsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has moved down from 9 cents to a loss of 2 cents in the last 30 days. Also, the estimate for 2018 has declined by 9 cents to 18 cents. Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc.

The plan mainly focuses on investing in growth, enhancing cost structure and improving financial flexibility. Crossing more than the half-way mark of the plan period, the company has roughly $25 million outstanding to achieve its savings target for 2017.Bottom LineThough Avon has been striving hard to drive growth through innovations, solid team execution, improving Representative experience, recent dismal performances suggest trouble down the road.Meanwhile, you can count upon some better-ranked cosmetics stocks such as The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

303,COTY,"Coty Inc (COTY  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 9, before the opening bell.The company has been undertaking several efforts to augment its portfolio and transform its brands. Such initiatives led to higher fixed and operating costs, which are weighing on the company’s profitability. The company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 27.7%.Also, these factors have caused Coty’s shares to decline 15.5% in the past six months, as against the industry’s increase of 8.2%.  With these aspects in mind, let’s look into some factors that are likely to impact the company’s first-quarter results.What to Expect? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable in the past 30 days at 7 cents per share. The estimated earnings figure reflects a decline of 69.6% from the year-ago figure of 23 cents. However, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,224 million for the first quarter, a substantial increase from the prior-year reported sales of $1,080 million.Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coty Inc. Quote Factors Impacting the Quarter Product launches are expected to continue driving Coty’s performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The company consistently introduces new products in response to shifting consumer preferences and makes use of strategic advertising and merchandising skills to market new launches. In this regard, the company made several launches during fiscal 2017 including products like Hugo Iced, Boss Tonic and Chloe Love Story Eau Sensuelle. Additionally, Coty is expected to benefit from its ongoing repositioning and reinvention of the COVERGIRL brand.Furthermore, Coty continuously evaluates strategic acquisitions and new brand licenses to enhance its portfolio. In this respect the company has been significantly gaining from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. Positive synergies from the company’s acquisitions and licensing agreements are expected to benefit first-quarter fiscal 2018 results as well. The company has also been undertaking digital transformation efforts to augment its e-commerce offerings.While we expect such efforts to positively impact the company’s top line, the bottom-line performance is anticipated to remain challenged due to enhanced marketing expenses. Although the company’s acquisitions, product launches and brand transformation efforts have strengthened its portfolio, such efforts have led to increased marketing spending. Moreover, the company expects increased fixed costs and operating expenses during the first half of fiscal 2018, owing to higher marketing investments.Further, the company has been facing several headwinds in its Consumer Beauty segment, especially in North America. Weak market trends across some of its categories and reduction of shelf space for a few brands like Astor has been dragging the segment’s performance lately. These trends are also expected to affect the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Coty is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

304,COTY,"In an effort to enhance makeup standards and give a unique touch to beauty, Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) recently decided to reinvent its iconic makeup brand — COVERGIRL. The reinvention of this brand satisfies the vision of “I Am What I Make Up”, with an opportunity of expressing oneself and personal transformation.The COVERGIRL multifaceted redefinition covers all areas of the brand, with packaging, designing, in-store look, tagline and logo. Also, this focuses on the outer appearance of the products, including tone and feel, across all communications, that begins with a long-form film — Made in the Mirror — and continues its roll-out for the balance of 2017 and into 2018.On the part of its customers, this redesigning of the brand will help them reveal their unique personalities with a new makeup version. In fact, with this latest invention, COVERGIRL brand rejoices its diversity and genuineness, simultaneously avoiding impractical and idealized standards.In fact, the film, Made in the Mirror, featuring six known personalities as COVERGIRLs, is likely to inspire women and help understand the new parameters of beauty. Going forward, Coty will provide a new definition to beauty with its redesigned products, and, in turn, better serve consumers.Being one of the leading beauty companies in the world, we believe this action is much required by Coty for the moment. The company has been witnessing persistent weakness in its Consumer Beauty division for quite some time, unlike the Luxury and Professional Beauty segments. Evidently, Consumer Beauty declined 10% organically, reflecting continued pressure on COVERGIRL, Clairol, and Sally Hansen, during fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.In fact, the company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 27.7%. In the reported quarter, operating income declined due to higher marketing spending and interest expense. The quarter also witnessed higher investments to support acquisitions. Furthermore, mounting competitive pressure and changing consumer preferences have been hurting Coty’s growth. Unfavorable currency impacts also remain major deterrent for the company.Consequently, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have declined 8.2% year to date, as against the industry’s gain of 6.8%.Though Coty has been making strategic acquisitions and new brand licenses to enhance its portfolio and improve performance, this will take time. Further, we expect COVERGIRL’s transformation to boost Coty’s top line and overall profitability.Looking for Promising Stocks?

In addition, Gucci Guilty Absolute, which was launched in the end of March 2017, also witnessed strong growth.Further, the company is repositioning some of the brands, including COVERGIRL, Max Factor and Sally Hansen, in order to reconnect these brands with consumers.

306,COTY,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 9.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Coty Misses Q4 Earnings Estimates on Higher ExpensesCoty posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues beat the same.The company posted break-even adjusted earnings in the quarter, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents. Adjusted earnings also declined from the year-ago earnings of 13 cents due to a decline in adjusted operating income related to higher marketing spending and higher interest expense.Quarter in DetailThe company generated revenues of $2.24 billion in the fourth quarter beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17 billion by 3.1%. Revenues surged 108.4% from the prior-year quarter, driven by the positive contribution from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5%.Excluding acquisition impact, net revenues of the combined company of Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business declined 3% on a constant currency basis. This also includes the benefit of approximately 1% from pre-shipments to customers prior to the termination of transition services for Europe under the Transition Services Agreement (TSA) signed on July 1.Adjusted gross margin expanded 420 basis points to 62.1% in the fourth quarter driven by the addition of the higher gross margin P&G Beauty and Younique businesses. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 480 basis points to 4.0% in the quarter due to higher marketing investment to support the momentum in the business as well as higher fixed costs.Fiscal 2017 Results     The company posted adjusted earnings of 63 cents in fiscal 2017, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents by 16%. Adjusted earnings also declined 54% from the year-ago earnings.Revenues reported were $7.650 billion in fiscal 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.58 billion by 0.9%. Revenues also surged 76% compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior year, driven by the positive contribution from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. The acquisition of Brazilian product line Hypermarcas S.A. (February 2016) also provided an impetus to the growth. On a constant currency basis, revenues of the combined company grew 1%. Excluding the positive impact of acquisitions, the combined company organic net revenues declined 5% on a constant currency basis due to flat performance in Professional Beauty, a modest decline in Luxury, and continued underlying challenges in Consumer Beauty.Segment DetailsLuxury: Luxury net revenues grew 61% to $648.0 million on a reported basis. Revenues grew 5% organically, supported by strong performance at Hugo Boss, Gucci, Chloe and philosophy brands. Adjusted operating income for Luxury declined 66% to $10.0 million in the quarter.Consumer Beauty: Consumer Beauty increased 85% to $1.126 billion on a reported basis and declined 10% organically, reflecting continued pressure on COVERGIRL, Clairol, and Sally Hansen. Adjusted operating income for Consumer Beauty increased 37% to $64.9 million.Professional: Professional Beauty net revenues of $467.3 million increased from $63.6 million in the prior year and increased 3% organically, driven by growth in Wella and System Professional and moderating declines in OPI brand. Adjusted operating income for Professional declined 14% to $15.2 million compared with Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period.Other Financial UpdatesCoty ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $535.4 million, total debt of $7.2 billion, and total shareholders’ equity of $9.3 billion.Net cash provided by operating activities was $757.5 million compared to $501.4 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior year reflecting improved working capital for the combined company, partly offset by an increase in cash acquisition related and restructuring costs. Free cash flow in fiscal 2017 of $325.2 million decreased from $351.3 million in the prior year, reflecting a significant increase in capital expenditures associated with the P&G Beauty Business integration.The company also paid a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share for a total of $93.4 million in June.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more downside. There has been one move higher compared to two lower in the last 60 days. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 71% due to these changes.Coty Inc.

307,COTY,"Of late, the Consumer Staples sector has been witnessing rising consumer confidence, backed by improving economic and labor market conditions as well rising GDP numbers.  This has further triggered an increase in consumers spending power. Apart from purchasing essential items such as grocery, food and beverage products, consumers are also seen to spend heavily on apparel items, personal care and beauty products.  Moreover, luxury spending is also aided by the increasing preference for e-commerce.While such trends have been benefiting cosmetics companies like The Estée Lauder Companies Inc (EL  -  Free Report) and Nu Skin Enterprises Inc (NUS  -  Free Report), other companies in the industry are still struggling with competitive pressures. One such company is Coty Inc (COTY  -  Free Report). We observed that Coty’s shares have declined close to 14% since it announced its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 22. Moreover, the company’s shares have declined more than 9% in the past six months against the industry’s gain of 11.3%.Headwinds Impacting the Company                                   Although the company’s strategic acquisitions, including ghd and Younique, have aided its top-line expansion, such measures have also increased the company’s marketing spending and have led to an increase in its fixed cost structure.In addition to increased operational expenditures, Coty’s segments have not depicted growth during fiscal 2017. In fact, its Consumer Beauty segment has remained sluggish since the past few quarters. The segment has been consistently witnessing underlying challenges, especially in North America, driven by a combination of weak market trends across several of its categories and some reduction of shelf space for few brands like Astor.Additionally, increasing competitive pressure and changing consumer preferences have been hurting the company’s performance. In particular, declines in the retail nail, color cosmetics and hair color categories in the United States and mass fragrance in Western Europe and in the domestic market are expected to impact business. Dismal Earnings Trend & Estimate Revisions We note that Coty has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 27.7%. Sales have also lagged estimates in two out of the past four quarters.Estimate revisions have also been down trending owing to ongoing challenges. Estimate for the forthcoming first-quarter fiscal 2018 has declined 18 cents to reach 7 cents, in the past thirty days, while the same for fiscal 2018 has also gone down 22 cents to reach 69 cents.  Coty’s ScorecardSome of the key financial ratios of Coty are also observed to be weaker than the industry, as depicted in the scorecard below.Final ThoughtsAlthough Coty has been working towards improving its segments and achieving a turnaround from its sluggish performance, the transition is expected to take time. Further, Coty carries a VGM Score of D and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating that the stock is currently not a safe pick for investors.Looking For Consumer Staples Stock?

308,COTY,"The consumer staples sector has been in investors' good graces of late, buoyed by an improving economy, strong labor market and continued hiring, improved GDP numbers as well as a resurgent housing market. These factors hint on rising consumer confidence in the months ahead and suggest that the economy is in good health.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, also plays a major role in the upward revision. It grew 3.3% in the second quarter, compared with the government’s earlier estimate of 1.9%.Though Hurricanes Harvey and Irma storms along with North Korea’s back-to-back nuclear tests on Japan have spurred global tensions and unnerved investors, we believe these short-term headwinds can be overlooked as we can see signs of continuing strength in consumer confidence, which in turn will lead to higher consumer spending and fuel growth in the near term.The increase in consumer spending has also triggered growth in the cosmetics industry, particularly in the luxury arena and in makeup. Apart from buying essential and non-durable goods ranging from everyday grocery, food items, beverages, tobacco and other household essentials, consumers started spending on beauty and personal care products, on top of larger purchases such as apparel and footwear and personal accessories.The rise of e-commerce and social media has further aided the fastest-growing beauty channels. In fact, per media sources, the U.S. beauty sector is expected to reach $90 billion by 2020, and the majority of the growth will come from premium beauty products and services.How Is the Cosmetics Industry Placed?We note that the Zacks Cosmetics industry is currently placed at top 31% out of the 265 Zacks Industries. The industry has also been outperforming the S&P 500 market lately. In the last six months, the industry recorded around 10.1% growth, well above the S&P 500 Index’s growth of 5.4%. However, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #7 (out of 16), placing it at the top 44% of the Zacks Classified sectors.That’s why it may be a good idea to invest in cosmetics stocks at this juncture, as signs of surging consumer confidence and economic recovery is making the industry attractive. Despite of industry gaining momentum, there are still some stocks in the cosmetics market that have been delivering sluggish results and are expected to continue to remain weak in the near term.Given this backdrop, investors may want to reshuffle their portfolio and include those cosmetics stocks which have been doing well for quite some time and have the potential to deliver returns in the coming months. Also, investors should consider avoiding those cosmetics stocks, which are not capable of delivering desired returns.How to Pick Viable Stocks?We have narrowed down our search to the following two stocks based on their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These stocks also have positive estimates revision and their share prices are trending higher than the industry as well as broader sector’s average.2 Prominent PicksThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report)Estée Lauder is a leading global manufacturer of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. The stock has been on growth trajectory backed by a diverse portfolio, well-planned acquisitions and notable progress in e-commerce.These attributes have aided this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s earnings to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 12 straight quarters. The stock currently has a long-term growth rate of 12.2% and has a beta rating of 0.67, which means the stock is also less volatile than the market average.Evidently, shares of the company have surged 27.4% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10.1% as well as the broader Consumer Staples sector’s improvement of 2.9%. In fact, shares of the company have gone up almost 11.6% since it posted upbeat fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 18. The Zacks Consensus Estimates have also gone up 2.6% and 1.6%, respectively, for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 over the last 30 days.Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report)Another Zacks Rank #2 stock is Nu Skin Enterprises, which is engaged in the development and distribution of consumer products, offering beauty and wellness solutions under its Nu Skin personal care, Pharmanex nutrition brand and ageLOC anti-aging category brands in over 50 markets worldwide. The Provo, UT-based firm has a VGM Score of A and has a long-term growth rate of 8.7%.On Aug 2, the company posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In fact, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four out of last six quarters, with in-line results in one.Moving forward, this skin care and nutritional products retailer remains focused on boosting its customers and sales. Nu Skin also plans to launch ageLOC LumiSpa product in the fourth quarter of this year, which is expected to generate roughly $100 million in revenues. Further, for fiscal 2017, management raised its guidance for earnings which is now projected in the band of $3.2-$3.3 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimates have also gone up 4.2% and 2.1%, respectively, for 2017 and 2018 over the last 60 days.Evidently, shares of the company have surged around 17% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10.1% as well as the broader Consumer Staples sector’s improvement of 2.9%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimates have also gone up 2.6% and 1.6%, respectively, for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 over the last 30 days.2 Stocks to AvoidThe below mentioned stocks from the industry have been underperforming since past many quarters and have also witnessed decline in share price in comparison to the industry as well as the broader sector. We suggest avoiding these stocks, which also carry Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell), possess a negative surprise trend and have witnessed downward estimate revisions.Coty, Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) at the moment is not a valuable stock. Based in New York, Coty presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and a VGM Score of D. The Zacks Consensus Estimates have significantly declined 24.2% and 15%, respectively, for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 over the last 30 days.This manufacturer and global marketer of beauty products has posted negative earnings surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters, making an average negative surprise of 27.65%. This signals that the company has been witnessing headwinds in the near term, which have pulled down the shares over the last six months period. The stock has declined 13.1% in the last six months, as against the industry’s growth of 10.1% as well as the broader sector’s gain of 2.9%.We note that sluggishness in the consumer beauty segment, increasing competitive pressure, and changing consumer preferences have been the major deterrents for the company. In fact, declines in the retail nail, color cosmetics and hair color categories in the United States and mass fragrance in Western Europe and the United States are expected to continue to impact business. The company also remains exposed to unfavorable foreign currency translations as it has a considerable international presence.Another stock which is underperforming is Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report), which currently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). This global direct-selling beauty company offers cosmetics, fragrances, toiletries, jewelry and accessories and has reported negative earnings surprise of 150% in second-quarter 2017, which were negatively impacted by strong comparisons with the prior-year quarter.Also, weak Active Representatives growth has been denting the results over the past few quarters. The company has lagged earnings estimates for four consecutive quarters, with an average miss of 90.7%. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has declined 55% in the last 60 days and around 23% for 2018.Moreover, the stock nosedived 43.9% in the last six months, as against the industry’s growth of 10.1% as well as the broader sector’s improvement of 2.1%.

309,COTY,"The consumer staples sector has been drawing investors’ attention lately, as an improving economy and rising consumer confidence is doing the trick for this sector. Labor market optimism, strong GDP numbers and a resurgent housing market have played crucial roles in raising buyers’ confidence and suggest that the economy is in good health.However, North Korea’s latest nuclear test has spurred global tensions and unnerved investors, who seem to remain unsure of Trump’s policies.

310,COTY,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in COTY.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen eight estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 91 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 69 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Coty Inc. has seen six downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 7 cents a share from 25 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 17.7% in the past month.Coty Inc.

311,COTY,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) has not been able to gain investor confidence this earnings season. Although the recent acquisitions make them hopeful, higher marketing spend and fixed costs weigh on its earnings. Shares of the company have declined approximately 17.7% since its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results announced on Aug 22.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has underperformed the industry over the past six months. Its shares plunged 16.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 8%. So what are the factors that derailed Coty? Let’s delve deeper.Increasing Costs Weighs on EarningsDuring the fourth quarter, Coty witnessed higher marketing investment to support acquisition-related momentum in the business as well as increased fixed costs. Consequently, adjusted operating margin contracted 480 basis points to 4.0% in the quarter. Management, however, claims that rise in marketing expenditures will aid revenue momentum in the forthcoming period.Dismal Consumer Beauty Segment The company’s Consumer Beauty segment has been sluggish for the last few quarters. Organic net revenue from the segment declined 10% for both the fourth quarter as well as for fiscal 2017. Also, the segment’s organic sales declined 6% in the third quarter due to negative price and mix impact.We note that the segment has been consistently witnessing underlying challenges, especially in North America, driven by a combination of weak market trends across several of its categories and some reduction in shelf space for a few brands like Astor. Though the company is working on improving the segment, the transition may take time.Other Headwinds To add to the company’s worries, the beauty segment is witnessing increasing competitive pressure and changing consumer preferences. In particular, declines in the retail nail, color cosmetics and hair color categories in the domestic market and mass fragrance in Western Europe and the United States are expected to impact business.Bottom-Line Although Coty has been gaining from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique, synergies from the same have not been sufficient enough to offset the increase in operating expenses. Moreover, the company’s organic revenues have remained under pressure owing to less significant segmental growth. As a result of the greater negativities impacting the stock, Coty is currently not a favorable pick for investors.Still Interested in the Consumer Staples Space?

315,COTY,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) is slated to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 22, before the opening bell. This leading distributer, manufacturer and marketer of beauty products surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 27.1%.With this in mind, let’s look into some factors that are likely to impact the company’s fourth-quarter results.Which Way are Estimates Treading?A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter declined by a penny to 9 cents in the past 30 days, while the same for fiscal 2017 has remained stable at 75 cents. We note that the estimated earnings for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2017 depict a year-over-year decline of 27.8% and 45.4%, respectively.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.17 billion for the fourth quarter. Revenues for the fiscal year are anticipated to be $7.58 billion.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Coty is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) as well as a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Coty has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 9 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coty Inc. QuoteFactors Impacting the Quarter Coty has been undertaking acquisitions to boost sales and enhance its brand portfolio. This is evident from the positive contributions during the third quarter, from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique, carried out in Nov 2016 and Feb 2017, respectively.  In Apr 2017, Coty agreed to acquire the exclusive long-term global license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare. The deal is expected to enhance the company’s premium offering in the prestige fragrances and cosmetics categories within the Luxury portfolio.Coty is also trying to boost its end-to-end digital transformation efforts including e-Commerce, across its divisions and regions.  The company has been making great strides in China, when it comes to e-Commerce, which accounted for over 20% of Consumer Beauty revenues during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In its direct-to-consumer efforts, the company through its Custom Blend app, is making progress with COVERGIRL brand. Additionally, it also seeks to divest its non-performing brands in order to focus and utilize its resources in other attractive opportunities.Though strategic acquisitions have benefited sales in the Consumer Beauty segment by more than a 100% during the third quarter, sales declined 6% organically. This was primarily reflecting a negative price and mix impact. We note that the Consumer Beauty segment has been consistently witnessing underlying challenges, especially in North America. Moreover, excluding Younique and ghd, the company expects the constant currency net revenue trends in the fourth quarter to weaken sequentially.Increasing competitive pressure and changing consumer preferences are also hurting the industry. In particular, declines in the retail nail, color cosmetics and hair color categories in the United States and mass fragrance in Western Europe and the domestic market are expected to negatively impact business, where recovery might take some time. Such headwinds are well reflected in the company’s share price performance. The stock has declined 29.4% in the past one year, wider than the industry's loss of 15.1%.Other Favorable Picks Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Churchill Downs Incorporated (CHDN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.23% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaries,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>
