On Tuesday, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hit the 3% level for the first time since 2014, bolstering expectations the Federal Reserve will now raise interest rates four times this year.Reflecting the upward trend, the 13 ETFs in the accompanying table all posted one-month gains well ahead of the S&P 500.SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) came out on top based on a 5.9% year-to-date return through Tuesday, according to Morningstar Direct, vs. a 0.9% deficit for the S&P 500.

2,SCHW,"Despite several heavy down days in the stock market last week, leading growth stocks continue to perform well in the stock market today — including top stock TD Ameritrade (AMTD).Earnings season is in full swing, so investors should be vigilant about potential earnings results.

Square was a huge winner in 2017 as well.In addition to Square, TransUnion (TRU), Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) all showed bullish action, blasting gains of 2% to 10% or more.Schwab continues to work on a new base, while eTrade is now extended after recently retaking a 56.10 entry point in a six-week cup without handle.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond continued to soar, rising to as high as 2.94% and practically eclipsing the Feb. 21 year-to-date high.

Volume was lower from Thursday's level, according to preliminary data. At 7138, the leading index still clung to a weekly gain of roughly 0.5% and is up 3.4% since Jan. 1.So the tech-centered index was still up for the week, but closed below the key 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF fell 1.6%. It too slipped mildly beneath the 50-day moving average for the first time in nearly four weeks.Hand tools, shoes, paper, and numerous defensive industry groups paced the downside.The S&P 500 saw its weekly gain slim down to 0.5%. In the prior week, the large-cap benchmark rallied 2%.Turnover climbed roughly 14% higher vs. the same time on Thursday on the NYSE. Overall, though, trading volume has been holding below the 50-day average on the Nasdaq for at least two straight weeks.

Shares retreated just a fraction to 177.01. Volume was 10% below usual levels.Home Depot, the DIY home improvement chain, has been in correction mode since striking a new high of 207.61 on Jan. 29. That peak came right before the first of this year's intermediate market corrections. The stock hasn't fallen much, though, losing just 18% of its market value. That's well within range of a normal decline within, say, a cup with handle base or a saucer base chart pattern, which is common among Dow industrials-type issues.Home Depot has pounded out steady if not rip-roaring profit growth.

So it's due for a rest, but keep watch for a base to complete itself.As noted in a new Click tech blog post, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty trimmed her price target on the consumer electronics and digital services firm to 200 from 203, citing concerns on iPhone sales. However, Huberty also reportedly advised clients to buy shares on any price weakness after Apple reports its fiscal Q2 sales (for the March-ended quarter) on May 2 after the close.A 3-point slice of the price target does not amount to much in terms of market value. At 166, the stock's market value is $841 billion. Apple has 5.07 billion shares outstanding.Google operator Alphabet (GOOGL) lost just 1.1% to 1,077.32 in weak turnover and still managed to post a stout weekly gain of nearly 4%.

The middle peak between the stock's first and second lows is 1,178.16. If the stock can continue rebounding, it could set up a potential breakout at 1,178.26, 10 cents above the middle peak.Alphabet is expected to increase first-quarter profit 20% to $9.29 a share. That follows EPS gains of 7%, 28%, 27%, 32% and 28% in the prior five quarters.Among the 11 names currently in Leaderboard, new entrant Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) cooled off a second straight day in normal fashion.

On Friday, the stock gapped up at the open and jumped 10%. Shares got as high as 67.32, easily surpassing a 59.72 buy point in a shallow cup with handle.The base is better viewed as a flat base with an entry at 61.52, 10 cents above the left-side high. In this case, TransUnion was within proper buy range right at the open price of 64.03, 4% above the flat-base entry.The expert in consumer financial data posted a 36% jump in first-quarter earnings to 57 cents a share, spanking the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate by nearly 10% and issuing the biggest year-over-year increase in five quarters. Revenue grew 18% to $537 million, marking a third quarter in a row of accelerating top-line growth. TransUnion also announced the acquisition of U.K.-based Callcredit.Skechers (SKX) got body slammed, gapping down more than 27% and finishing the session at 30.70. That sell-off wiped out five months' worth of gains.Volume soared past 27 million shares, more than one quarter of its total float of 94 million shares. The stock's 50-day average turnover is 2.4 million shares per day.The company reported a 13% rise in Q1 earnings to 68 cents a share, sharply undercutting Wall Street's expectations. Sales rose 17%, easing from a 27% Q4 top-line increase, but moving at a faster pace than the year-ago quarter's weak 10% rise.Net margin edged 20 basis points lower to 8.6%.

20,SCHW,"When a company posts high pretax margins year after year, the situation points to two realities.The first reality is that the company is doing something right. The second is that the company might be operating in a space where high profit margins are the rule, not the exception.Take a look at three stocks that have appeared recently in the Big Cap 20 with the best pretax margins.The three are Mastercard (MA), E-Trade (ETFC) and Charles Schwab (SCHW).See a trend? Yes, the money businesses are places where high margins are commonplace.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn that situation, how should an investor respond? Should the investor buy shares and then sit back and watch the stock price rise?If only it were that simple.When weighing stocks with high pretax margins, the investor should ask two questions.How do those margins look vs. companies in the same industry group? (Maybe in that context they are not so high after all.)And how do the margins compare to the company's history? (In some cases, margins may be declining.)Mastercard posted a pretax margin of 53.6% in 2017.In the eight previous years from 2009 to 2016, Mastercard's average pretax margin was 51.9%.The highest was 55.1% in 2013. The lowest was 44.1% in 2009.Within the credit payment processor group, only one stock in 2017 had a higher pretax margin than Mastercard — Visa (V), which had a 64.7% pretax margin last year.E-Trade Financial pegged a 45.9% pretax margin in 2017. In three of the previous eight years, the company lost money. The average pretax margin in the remaining five years was 25.7%.Does that sound like a problem? It isn't. Pretax margin stepped up in each of the past five years — 17.2% in 2013 and then 25.3%, 36.6%, 41.4% and 45.9%.Within the brokerage group, two stocks had a higher pretax margin than E-Trade — Interactive Brokers (IBKR) (pretax margin 54.4% in 2017) and MarketAxess (MKTX) (50.9% in 2017).Charles Schwab achieved a pretax margin of 42.4%. This represented the fifth consecutive year of increasing pretax margins.The average pretax margin over the previous eight years was 31.8%.In the brokerage group, the three aforementioned brokerages did better than Schwab on pretax margin — Interactive Brokers, MarketAxess and E-Trade.Although profit margins are important, the full range of CAN SLIM criteria should be considered before buying a stock.In some cases, a strong stock may have thin margins. Amazon.com (AMZN) had a pretax margin of 2.1% in 2017. Netflix (NFLX) delivered a pretax margin of 4.2% last year. Yet, both companies had strong revenue growth in 2017.RELATED:Oil Driller Offers High Dividend YieldP/E Ratio? Forget About ItHow To Find The Next Big Winner In Stocks

Japan's Toyota (TM) was not yet active but fell late Wednesday.As for other overnight movers, Williams-Sonoma is the latest upscale retail brand to rally on strong earnings. NetApp fell on weak guidance, after fast-growing upstart Pure Storage failed to impress earlier in the week.The Dow Jones rose 0.2% in Wednesday's stock market trading, erasing losses on China trade concerns as Fed minutes signaled a relatively dovish stance on inflation. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite 0.6%. The major indexes have been trading in a tight range over the past couple of weeks.Even leading stocks tend to follow the general path of the major stock market averages. Even without looking at the S&P 500 index, looking at a chart of Apple, Nvidia, Splunk, Charles Schwab or Microsoft at investors.com or Marketsmith would give a general idea of the bench mark index's recent performance. That's because the charts include the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.As the stock market drifted, Apple pulled back into buy range from its double-bottom breakout. But on Wednesday, the IBD Leaderboard stock rose 0.6% to 188.36, just above the 5% chase zone from its 179.04 entry. Investors shouldn't buy an extended stock because of the higher risk of a pullback. It's possible that Apple could dip back into the entry area.Apple nudged higher in the premarket though.Hot chipmaker Nvidia also has retreated into the buy zone from a double-bottom breakout, and at one point appeared poised to test the 239.35 entry. But Nvidia, an IBD 50 stock, rose 2.1% on Wednesday to 247.54. Nvdia stock rose a fraction early Thursday.Charles Schwab, which cleared a cup base on May 9 in low volume, has held in that range ever since. Schwab stock did fall 1.1% to 58.93 on Wednesday, modestly above its 58.21 entry. Schwab was not yet active Thursday morning.Splunk broke out on May 7, and briefly undercut that entry, but the data analytics standout is back in the buy area. Shares climbed 2% Wednesday to 116.65, vs. its buy point of 112.76. Splunk reports earnings on Thursday but was not yet trading.Microsoft finally closed above its 97.34 flat-base entry on May 10, but soon pulled back. This week Microsoft stock has been back in the buy zone. Shares rose 1.2% to 98.66 on Wednesday, after falling as low as 96.32 intraday. The stock got a price target hike for Microsoft's cloud computing strength.Microsoft was little changed early Thursday.While investors want to see their stocks surge every day, sideways action isn't bad. The volatile stock market has led to sloppy stock patterns. So tight action could be positive. Apple, for instance, could form a bullish three-weeks-tight pattern if it continues to consolidate tightly. Go a little longer and these stocks in buy range could provide base-on-base formations.However, there is a risk with a stock hovering just in buy range. While you're waiting for the stock to take off again, something bad could happen. It could be earnings or some other stock-specific news. Or it could be sector or market related. Oil stock breakouts are struggling as crude futures back off multiyear highs somewhat. Sometimes a stock will hold up for a while and then fade, such as Workday (WDAY) in recent sessions.The Dow Jones and other major averages have formed handle-like formations in recent weeks.

25,SCHW,"Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is no stranger to the annual IBD Best Online Brokers survey. It popped into the five best brokers overall two years ago and returned this year, helped by its reputation for low-cost trading and technological prowess.X The company caters to self-directed individual investors, registered investment advisors and other institutional clients. It welcomes investors of all experience levels, but doesn't aggressively market to the beginners. It's found a highly profitable niche focusing on active traders who don't need a lot of hand-holding.Interactive Brokers scored high in this year's survey (see broker survey methodology) when it comes to Low Commissions & Fees, Trade Reliability and Mobile Trading Platforms. It also ranked among the best brokers in Low-Cost/Free ETF Trading, Options Trading Platform, Site Performance and Equity Trading Tools.Interactive Brokers' trading fees are so low that it was basically able to watch from the sidelines in the first quarter of 2017 when a price war broke out among major brokers like Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Fidelity. After the dust settled, Fidelity and Schwab were at $4.95 a trade, with Ameritrade a bit higher at $6.95.Interactive Brokers is still well below the competition with a base rate of U.S. fixed 0.5 cent per share per trade. High volume trades have a lower per-share fee. Several exchange traded funds (ETFs) are also available commission-free.  For ETF investors, IBKR's Mutual Fund/ETF Replicator finds ETFs whose performance replicates a specific fund's objective with generally lower fees.Improvements aren't always just about cost. With 483,000 client accounts in 201 countries, IB also recently expanded its mutual fund offerings to include offshore funds for overseas customers.The company's technology expertise is one of the main reasons it can keep costs low.""The vast majority of our executive team has some sort of programming background,"" said Steve Sanders, executive vice president of marketing and product development, who's been with the company for 17 years. ""We're basically a technology company that happens to be in the trading business.""Founder, Chairman and CEO Thomas Peterffy got his start in the financial markets in the late 1970s when he bought a seat on the American Stock Exchange and became an individual market maker in equity options. T.P. & Co. soon formed and eventually morphed into Timber Hill. In 1983, Timber Hill immediately gained an edge on the competition by becoming the first company to use handheld computers for trading.Peterffy did not have years of education in computers. He basically taught himself when he emigrated to the U.S. from Hungary in 1965. His first job was architectural draftsman for an engineering firm. The story goes that a new computer was purchased at the firm, but no one knew how to program it. Peterffy, with no programming experience at the time, volunteered to do it. The rest, as they say, is history as the experience helped spark his interest in programming and technology in general.In 1993, Interactive Brokers was incorporated as a U.S. broker-dealer, making Timber Hill's intercontinental electronic network and trade execution services available to customers. Last year, Interactive Brokers sold its Timber Hill options market-making business to Two Sigma Securities. Terms weren't disclosed.Interactive Brokers went public in May 2007. According to Sanders, the company was founded on three competitive advantages that Interactive Brokers still embraces after more than 10 years as a publicly traded company: Low costs, a wide range of products with access to markets around the world and a relentless focus on technology.Interactive Brokers' technology prowess is a big reason why it was the first online broker to offer trading in Bitcoin futures. The company said it took many man hours to make it happen, but the technology infrastructure was already in place.According to a company news release, Bitcoin futures contracts started trading on the CBOE (CBOE) the evening of Dec. 10. By 9:15 a.m. the next day, 201 Interactive Brokers accounts had placed 1,240 trades totaling 1,429 contracts, representing about 50% of exchange-recorded volume.""We launched Bitcoin futures in response to client requests,"" Sanders said. ""It was in keeping with our philosophy to make products available at the best possible price.""Trading in Bitcoin futures isn't a huge revenue generator for Interactive Brokers at this point, but it's hard not to see trading in the cryptocurrency market contributing to daily average revenue trades (DARTs) for the company. DARTs are a key metric for online brokers, representing the total number of trades each day that generate revenue.In December, DARTs totaled 699,000, up 18% from December 2016. Total customer accounts jumped 25% year over year and new accounts surged 78% to 8,900. ""Our DARTs are much higher than the competition,"" Sanders said.Total option contracts came in at 24 million, up 10%. Future contracts grew 11% to 9.8 million.At the end of 2017, client equity (the value of clients' accounts) jumped 46% from the year before to $124.8 billion, while customer margin loan balance surged 52% to $29.5 billion.The company's recently launched IB Debit Mastercard, the first product of its kind. The card lets clients borrow against their accounts at an extremely low interest rate. It is available as part of a new integrated financial management account that lets users invest, borrow, spend and earn from one account. Annual percentage rates range from 1.41% to 2.66%.Account holders can take advantage of Interactive Brokers' stock yield enhancement program, where clients lend out their shares for short sales and split profits 50/50 with IB. ""In cases of hard-to-borrow stock, it can be lucrative,"" Sanders said.Longtime IB customer Klaus Kraemer, likes the broker's Trader's University, which offers webinars, educational videos and trader apps as well as live global trading commentary. Also, he said. ""I was always impressed by the fact that the company took the best bid/ask prices from the various exchanges, information only available to brokers at the time, and eventually gave it to individual investors.""For less experienced investors who want more direction, Interactive Brokers'  Investors' Marketplace is an area where users can search for an advisor, hedge fund or other provider of investment services.Want to read more about the other top brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

26,SCHW,"Amid the stock market's shift into an uptrend under pressure — according to the Big Picture — energy and retail industries continue to outperform. Top retail stock Best Buy (BBY) is approaching a potential buy point in the stock market today.Earnings season remains in full swing, so investors should be vigilant about potential earnings results. Earnings releases usually result in volatile price changes, so ensure you have a decent profit cushion — at least 5% to 10% or more — to withstand any downside moves. Meanwhile, better-than-expected results can lead to breakaway gaps.Best Buy saw double-digit top-line growth in the most recent quarter — at 14% — for the first time in years. Meanwhile, year-over-year quarterly earnings growth is averaging 25% over the last three quarters.

They might have better brand recognition, but recent earnings and sales growth at Interactive Brokers has been impressive. Strong execution and technology expertise are two big reasons why.The company on Tuesday reported another strong quarter. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 85% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue vaulted 52% to $621 million.Interactive Brokers was a beneficiary of increased market volatility in the first quarter.

Customer accounts rose 27% to 517,000, while customer equity increased 33% to $129 billion.But Interactive Brokers had rallied quite a bit into the report so investors took the opportunity to sell on the news. Interactive Brokers popped above a 74.21 buy point ahead of the results, but shares reversed lower Wednesday, slumping 3% in higher volume.The good news is that the stock's technical picture is still intact, with a relative strength line still near highs. Interactive Brokers has not flashed a sell signal from the 74.21 entry. That means the buy point is still in play.

38,SCHW,"The people best qualified to judge the best brokers for online trading — their own customers — have named their winners.X From thousands of reader responses, IBD's sixth annual Best Online Brokers survey finds which firms are serving their clients best, how they're doing it and where even some of the best stock brokers are falling short. That's quite an account from the ones on the inside, and their reviews can help investors compare and shop for new brokers.For the fourth year in a row, Fidelity Investments earned the top Customer Experience Index rating — and it seems to be just  getting better. Fidelity has increased its overall customer experience score almost every year of the best brokers survey.Also recognized in the top five in IBD's 2018 Best Online Brokers list based on their high customer experience scores are Charles Schwab (SCHW), TradeStation, TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR).What does it take to be one of the best brokers? In part, it's the bread-and-butter functions such as excellent trade execution, websites that never crash and commissions that are attractive.Low Commissions & Fees, Trade Reliability and Site Performance were crucial performance categories to investors in the survey. But investors identified other broker features that were also important — 14 categories in all.The survey identified the five best brokerage firms in each category. So a beginning investor can scan the lists to find the best brokers that are especially strong in, say, Educational Resources and Customer Service. An active, self-guided trader might look for the best Equity Trading Tools or Options Trading, while another investor might seek the best brokerage account for Low-Cost/Free ETF Trading and Investment & Retirement Planning Tools.Not surprisingly, the top-scoring brokerages did well in most of the categories.Fidelity's overall customer experience score this year is the highest achieved by any of the best stock brokers since IBD started polling readers. The company's customers also crowned Fidelity with the top score in nine categories and gave it ratings that put it among the best brokers in all the categories.Charles Schwab, a pioneer in discount brokerage, also placed among the Best Online Brokers in every category.TradeStation came out in the top three overall, after earning Honorable Mention in 2017. Its customer experience number was the company's highest in the best brokers survey's history. TradeStation earned one of the highest ratings for Site Performance, and it fared best in Equity Trading Tools. Its score not only paced the field, but the brokerage has repeatedly beaten its rivals in this category.TD Ameritrade, whose services include the analysis-packed thinkorswim trading platform, separated itself from rivals in the Options Trading category. It's an area where TD Ameritrade has pulled away from the competition year after year.Interactive Brokers earned especially high marks for Low Commissions & Fees. The firm uses a two-part commission structure in which fixed-fee trading is a half-cent per share (or 50 cents if you're buying a typical lot of 100 shares), or customers can use a volume-based pricing system. That's helped Interactive earn the highest score in the category every year of the survey.While customers don't hop from broker to broker much, it's becoming more common. Competition to retain customers' brokerage accounts and attract new ones is fierce.This year 25% of survey participants said they switched brokers within the past five years. In the first year of the survey, only 18% had switched brokers in that time frame.And why did they switch? Nearly 40% said it was costs, far more than any other reason.Besides their usual rivals, even the best brokers face a new wave of competition from services such as Robinhood that let investors trade stocks, ETFs and sometimes options for free. No-fee trading platforms are popular with millennials, who also tend to give traditional stock brokers lower scores than older investors do.Last year saw the industry break out into a price war. Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade and E-Trade slashed commissions from about $8 to $10 per trade to $5 to $7.In fact, Fidelity and Schwab saw sharp improvement in their commissions ratings in the latest survey.Many brokerages also offer certain ETFs that customers can trade at no charge. That's assuming trades are done online. If you call a broker, a stock, ETF or mutual fund purchase can cost you 10 times more than if you trade online.Investor's Business Daily and its polling partner, TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, surveyed 5,052 investors for this year's best brokers special report. The research started last summer with a Phase 1  survey to determine which broker attributes mattered most to investors. In a Phase 2 survey in the fall, readers were asked to rate their main brokerage for its performance in the 14 categories that comprised the study.This year's report includes one new category, Trade Ideas. Customers gave their brokers low scores in the category across the board, indicating an area where stock brokers may seek to improve in the future. In fact, asked what actions they'd like their broker to take in the next year,  investors put better buy lists third on the list, following lower fees and better research.Two categories were relabeled in this year's best brokers survey. ETF Choices was renamed Low-Cost/Free ETF Trading. Mobile Platforms/Mobile Trading Opportunities was renamed Mobile Trading Platforms.The typical investor in the IBD survey is not a high-frequency trader. Only 15% said they average more than 25 trades in a month, and more than half trade no more than 10 times during an average month. Nearly 10% made no trades at all in the month they answered the survey.Stocks are the overwhelming choice of the best stock brokers survey participants, with 93% owning equities. More than half (55%) own ETFs and 48% mutual funds. Options are a smaller market for these investors, with 30% owning stock options and 10% index options. And 4% own cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.Want to read more about the top five brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

39,SCHW,"Commission costs, trade reliability and site performance rank highly for online investors. That's why they get such a strong weighting year after year in IBD's Best Online Brokers survey. But active traders expect more from their brokers than a place to hold shares and execute trades. They want the best trading platform with cutting-edge features. Many of the tools active traders cherish weren't around even to institutional investors a decade ago.X Active traders carry weight with online brokers. They are prime providers of daily average revenue trades (DARTs), a key metric for brokers' earnings. Tools ranging from idea creation to trade execution speed the buy and sell process for active traders. That can lead to more trading and make the money spent on advanced platforms pay off for brokers. Here are a few of their offerings:Many investors shy away from complex charts. But technical analysis done on charts is key for active traders. Advanced platforms tend to give traders more ways to customize charts. That ranges from time period and chart type to how you lay out charts on multiple screens. That's just the start. The library of indicators is ever expanding, from the basics to proprietary metrics. Traders don't need all the indicators all the time, but want their favorites fast.TradeStation earned the top rating from customers for stock trading tools in IBD's latest investor survey (see best brokers survey methodology), and its robust database is a large reason why. Hundreds of indicators and studies can be applied to over 40 years of data. TradeStation's  EasyLanguage lets investors do their own coding. With a little programming, traders can back-test strategies to see how they would perform at different points in history.Fidelity also scored high in its Equity Trading Tools. Most of its tools were developed in-house. For technical analysis, Fidelity tapped third-party Recognia, which made a name for itself with chart pattern recognition features. It includes spotting classic patterns, short-term patterns and patterns on indicators.Many brokers also offer screening tools and alerts. They help find buy and sell points based on selected indicators or patterns.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) scored the highest for its options trading platform tools in the survey. TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim platform, acquired in 2009, is the backbone of the firm's options prowess.Options bring new concepts and terms to digest and often scare beginners. But brokers have harnessed technology to shorten the learning curve. Swim Lessons on thinkorswim is a good place for investors to dip their toe in the options waters. It offers daily analysis of options strategies, often using setups in the current market. Lessons also walk you through tools like profit/loss graphs and probability analysis. They show how profits may change through time as the stock price changes.Beginning lessons also show how with a single click on an option chain, over 15 preset option strategies are available. Can't remember the details of a multi-leg strategy? A prefilled order ticket gives you a start and then you can adjust expiration dates and strike prices.At some point, most active traders feel the frustration of putting in a trade and watching it sit there while algorithms jump ahead by a penny or less.  If you want to make the machines work for you rather than against you, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is among brokers offering algorithm trading that can help get your order through. For instance a time weighted average price (TWAP) algorithm can disperse your order over a set amount of time.Sometimes just getting your order in quickly is more important. Fidelity's advanced platform, Active Trader Pro, allows for staging of up to 50 orders. Do your homework ahead of time and set up the trades. Then you can execute orders one at a time as targets are hit. Or, if you are waiting for an event, you could place staged orders all at once.That's not to mention all the conditional orders that brokerages offer. If you can't be at your computer or phone at all times, conditional orders and alerts can help. First, set up predetermined conditions like profit targets or loss-cutting levels. Then your trades execute without any further action on your part. Not quite comfortable letting the machines run amok? Alerts with similar conditions let you know something needs your attention. After you check out the trade, you can make the final decision.Sometimes you need to go beyond the individual trades to improve on your entire portfolio. Advanced trading tools can help with this as well. If you're getting a false sense of security from your diversification, portfolio analysis tools can dispel your myth. Correlation analysis, like that offered by Interactive Brokers, tells you if your assets aren't as spread out as you thought.Maybe you need to perform a post-analysis on your trades to see where you can improve.

Homing on what you're doing right and identifying where you are going astray can be critical to improving your own trading decisions.A little overwhelmed by the choices?

41,SCHW,"Mutual funds make perfect sense for most investors, but especially the busy or novice investor. But do you really know how to buy mutual funds to meet your objectives, or for that matter, how to sell mutual funds?By investing in a fund, you get professional management and access to a diversified portfolio of stocks and/or bonds at a reasonable cost. Funds also increase the likelihood of reaching your retirement or other financial goals.But mutual funds come in all shapes and sizes, so you need a way to pick the best funds for you.  A few quick steps will put you in a portfolio of funds custom-designed for you.You can take these steps with the help of a financial advisor or with guidance provided by brokerages and major mutual fund companies, including Fidelity, Charles Schwab (SCHW), T. Rowe Price (TROW), Vanguard, American Funds, Franklin Templeton (BEN), JPMorgan Chase (JMP) and BlackRock (BLK).Your advisor, fund company or broker provides forms where you fill in your age, current assets, expected retirement and income needs and risk tolerance. Not sure about your risk tolerance? Don't worry, the questionnaires will suss it out. The details of your investor profile will help guide you to the funds appropriate for your portfolio.Your profile will include a time horizon, or when you need the money and how long you have to invest. You want to buy a car next year, a house within five years, get the kids in college in 16 years and retire at 66? Obviously, you can have more than one goal, so you should construct portfolios with each in mind.Your age also affects your investment horizon. For example, you wouldn't invest for retirement when you're 20 the same way as when you're 55.Your investor profile will help you zero in on your target allocation between stocks and bonds, and domestic and foreign securities. This is the asset mix you will achieve in the selection of mutual funds for your portfolio. Generally, the younger you are, the longer your investment horizon and the more risk you can tolerate.Stock funds, though they provide higher returns over time, tend to be more volatile than bond funds. So the younger you are the more aggressive you can be investing in stocks, as any temporary declines will be made up as the stock market recovers and moves on to new highs. When you're nearing or in retirement and less tolerant of volatility, your investor profile becomes more conservative and will guide you to greater allocation to bond funds.How many will you need? That could range from one to more than a half-dozen.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYour selection work will be over if you choose target-date funds. You'll only need one because it invests in a diversified mix of mutual funds, each itself diversified across a broad array of stocks and bonds. Major fund families offer these funds, which change their asset mix as time goes on to suit your evolving risk tolerance.For example, if you plan to retire in eight years or so, you could chose Vanguard Target Retirement 2025 (VTTVX), which happens to be the largest target-date fund, at $39.83 billion. It invests in four Vanguard funds. According to Morningstar Direct, its top weights are 38.2% of funds invested in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX), 25.7% in Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund (VTBIX), 25.2% in Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTSNX)  and 11% in Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund (VTIBX).T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, American Funds, JPMorgan and Principal Funds are also big players in target-date funds.If you work with a financial advisor or a broker, he or she will build your investment profile and then present you with an appropriate portfolio of funds.If you want to build your own, you can either build your portfolio exclusively or mostly at one fund company with many funds, or with funds from many fund companies.If you choose to have your portfolio at one company, you can open the account at any of the major fund companies. If you pick and choose the best funds from several fund companies, then you'll do that through your brokerage account at Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade or any of the other brokers that have a platform for investing in funds.The traditional breakdown for an average risk tolerance is 60% equities and 40% bonds. The percentage of equities can be 80% for younger people and those with more aggressive risk tolerance, and be 20% for those closer to retirement and with lower risk tolerance.You and your advisor will fine-tune the asset mix.""For the average investor, on the equity side, 65% should be in U.S. stocks and the rest should be in international,"" said Ed Kohlhepp, CEO of Kohlhepp Investment Advisors, a registered investment advisor (RIA) , in Doylestown, Pa. ""Of the U.S. stock funds, 65% should be in large cap and the rest split between small- and midcap funds.  Of the international funds, two-thirds in developed country funds and the rest in emerging markets.""Most advisors recommend your large-cap stock fund be an index fund that tracks the S&P 500, such as the Vanguard 500 Index (VFINX). And look for active funds in the small and midcap areas.Kohlhepp said that with interest rates rising, investors should favor bond funds with shorter durations, which means their prices, or NAVs, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. He suggested buying at least one fund each that invests in U.S. Treasuries, corporates and high-yield bonds. He said foreign bonds should not be more than 15% of your bond allocation.When you start your search, you want to look for funds that have outperformed their benchmarks over a range of periods, because they are more likely to have proven investment strategies than those that don't. The winners of the IBD Mutual Funds Awards are a good place to start. IBD Weekly's Fund & Personal Finance section runs screens of top-performing funds (with daily screens covering several categories appearing online under Funds & ETFs at investors.com/ibd-data-tables).Morningstar Inc. and Lipper Inc. are two prominent fund-ranking services that feature risk-adjusted ratings.However, performance isn't the only criteria when picking a fund.Eric Aanes, the president of Titus Wealth Management, an RIA in Larkspur, Calif., said his three criteria for choosing a mutual fund are manager tenure, expenses and, finally, performance.Some advisors insist on a long record. ""We also want to see longevity of a fund manger,"" said Al Martinez, managing director at Hightower Advisors Boca Raton, an RIA in Boca Raton, Fla. ""We are trying to find managers that distinguish themselves in an up market, but protect in down markets.""Martinez looks at the manager's tenure and whether it's an individual or a team approach. He prefers a team. He then wants to see if the managers ""eat their own cooking. Do they invest in their own fund?"" Third, is the fund allowed to hold cash? This is important, because ""it will smooth out and provide protection when a downturn ultimately comes."" This also allows the manager to make purchases when opportunities arise.The most important thing you need to know about how to sell mutual funds may be when you should get out of a fund. A fund that underperforms its benchmark badly or for a prolonged period should be put on review for replacement. Also pay attention to manager changes.Marina Gross, executive vice president of portfolio research and consulting at Natixis Global Asset Management in Boston, said it's important to tag an investment with a purpose and hold it accountable to that role in the portfolio. If it fails to deliver on that objective, that's a reason for selling it.""Assign a purpose or a role to the asset in the portfolio,"" Gross said. ""If your equities are meant to drive returns then that is the key criteria; if the utility value is risk mitigation then that's the basis by which you measure your funds.""""The reasons for selling a fund are situational,"" said Roger Young, senior financial planner at fund giant T. Rowe Price. These include changing your allocation or risk level, rebalancing the portfolio, feeling stock values are too high and wanting to reduce exposure, favoring another opportunity, or you need the cash.A version of this article originally was published April 3, 2017.You  Might Also Like:Here's The 2018 List Of The Best Mutual Funds Award Winners By CategoryHow To Invest Like Fidelity Stock Gurus Will Danoff And John RothTips For Keeping Your Retirement Plan On Track — Read Our Full ReportView Profiles Of Top Performing Mutual Funds

Both stocks are consolidating above their 50-day moving average lines.Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Lam Research (LRCX), which broke through their key support levels Tuesday, initially fell but rebounded to rise modestly.Leading brokerage firm Charles Schwab (SCHW) jumped 0.7% to 42.91, building upon yesterday's breakout attempt above a 42.71 cup-with-handle entry.Among analyst actions in the stock market today, Nvidia (NVDA) rose nearly 3% after Mizuho raised its price target to 170 from 145. The graphics chip maker has been consolidating sideways since a nasty reversal three weeks ago.Meanwhile, online travel site Expedia (EXPE) was upgraded to buy from hold at Citi. Shares traded 1.1% higher, and remains extended from its 132.27 cup-with-handle buy point.Among companies reporting earnings, KB Home (KBH) showed solid results late Tuesday, causing shares to climb 3.2% in early trading.

CEO Jeffrey Mezger said, ""The housing market recovery continues on a steady path, supported by favorable industry fundamentals.""Shares are well extended from a 17.48 flat-base entry.Within the IBD 50, RV-maker Winnebago Industries (WGO) rallied over 3%, while regional bank East West Bancorp (EWBC) moved up 2%.

43,SCHW,"The Nasdaq composite led the stock market lower Tuesday afternoon, though the selling certainly wasn't limited to that index.The Nasdaq was off 1.1% after semiconductors and other technology stocks sold off, including the FANGs. Netflix (NFLX) fell nearly 4% and slid right back below the 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 lost 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.2% as indexes traded near session lows. The small-cap Russell 2000 was down 0.4%.Volume was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Monday. Losers led winners by 9-to-7 across the board.Chip stocks and related industries, such as contract manufacturers of electronics, were in full retreat. Those group were down 1.7% to 2.3%.Three tech stocks fell below the 50-day moving average, and in each case it was the first time they violated that price indicator in many months.Lam Research (LRCX) this week is closing below the 50-day line for the first time since November. Applied Materials (AMAT) dipped below the 50-day line for the first time since the September-November basing period. Coherent (COHR), a laser technology company, had not fallen below the line since November also.None of the moves amounted to a sell signal, and they came in mild volume. Nonetheless, they mark a change in the stocks that may lead to a longer change in direction.In the internet sector, Grubhub (GRUB) triggered a sell rule after it fell more than 8% below the buy point. The stock has not been able to shake off sellers that swarmed after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock Monday.Biotechs also contributed to the Nasdaq's slide. ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotech (BIB), an ETF that doubles the performance of its underlying index, dropped nearly 4% and was one of the most active stocks in today's market.Financials were doing better, as were energy and some other industry groups in the lower reaches of the performance table.Charles Schwab (SCHW) broke out past the 42.71 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. But volume was merely average, and the relative strength line has yet to make a new high.On the IBD 50, also keep an eye on another broker, Lazard (LAZ).

46,SCHW,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose strongly Tuesday morning while Dow futures jumped about 240 points while Bitcoin and other digital currencies plunged on renewed talk from South Korea about banning trading.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings early Tuesday. Citigroup (C), , CSX Corp. (CSX), Comerica (CMA) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) all report today.X Citigroup and Dow component UnitedHealth Group closed Friday near buy points, with caveats. CSX is the first rail operator to report this week, while Interactive Brokers precedes Charles Schwab (SCHW) on Wednesday. Citigroup and super-regional Comerica kick off a new wave of big bank earnings.S&P 500 futures were 0.5% above fair value. The dollar's recent weakness continued vs. major rivals, hitting a 2-year low vs. the Chinese yuan. Dow futures popped 1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.7% against fair value.Bitcoin fell 9% to $12,335.19, according to CoinDesk after falling as low as $11,182.71. South Korea's finance minister stressed that banning cryptocurrency trading is on the table. Ethereum lost 14% and Ripple 20% vs. 24 hours earlier, according to CoinMarketCap. That follows further signals from China to crack down on Bitcoin mining in that country.The No. 1 U.S. insurer reported before the opening bell Tuesday. UnitedHealth earnings rose 23% to $2.59 a share, beating views for $2.50, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue climbed 9.5% to $52.06 billion. UnitedHealth also raised its 2018 EPS forecast.UnitedHealth rose 2.7% to 234.78 before the opening bell on the stock market today. That suggests a move above a 231.87 buy point from a flat base.But the relative strength line, with tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the end of November, actually hitting a consolidation low on Thursday.Ideally, a stock's RS line (the blue line in the charts below) should lead or confirm a breakout.A strong breakout could push the RS line to at least a short-term high over its pseudo-handle.  Flat bases do not have handles, and this brief pause was not long enough to qualify as a handle in any other pattern, but it's still something for the RS line to try to top.UnitedHealth also is the first managed-care company to report for the latest quarter, with several in or near buy zones. Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) moved into a buy zone Friday, joining Humana (HUM), though none of the breakouts came on impressive volume and their RS lines continue to lag. Aetna (AET) and WellCare Helath Plans (WCG) are near buy points but with lagging RS lines.Citigroup reports early Tuesday as well. EPS should edge up 4.4% to $1.19, with revenue edging up 0.5% to $17.09 billion.Citigroup has a flat base that's a half-step above a prior flat base, which was just above yet another flat base. The buy point is 78.02. Shares rose to 76.84 on Friday.But Citigroup, which outperformed the RS line from early June to early October and generally outperformed rival banks over that span, has had a declining RS line since then.Citigroup follows bank earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) on Friday. Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report later this week.Comerica also reports Q4 earnings early Tuesday, with analysts forecasting a 31.5% EPS jump to $1.21 billion with revenue climbing 13% to $819 million.Comerica shares have risen 7.2% in January and are well extended from any buy point. The stock's RS line has been rising for the past four months.Rail giant CSX delivers Q4 results after Tuesday's close. Analysts expect a 14% advance to 56 cents even as revenue slides 5% to $2.88 billion. This is the first report after CSX named James Foote CEO in December following the death of veteran railroad exec Hunter Harrison.CSX's stock is modestly extended from a 55.09 buy point. Shares briefly tumbled on news that Harrison was taking a leave of absence followed quickly by his death, but shares didn't fall quite enough to invalidate the buy point. Also, shares found support at their 200-day line and never closed below their 50-day.CSX's RS line initially confirmed the Nov. 30 breakout. But the RS line hasn't made headway since then, and has generally been lagging for more than six months.Later this week, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) will report quarterly results. Canadian Pacific is in a buy zone while Kansas City is near a flat base buy point, but both have lagging RS lines.Interactive Brokers reports will issue results late Tuesday. Revenue should more than double to $399 billion with earnings sprinting to 39 cents  a share vs. 7 cents a year ago.Shares cleared a short consolidation last week, hitting new all-time highs.

But this is why breakouts matter.TD Ameritrade also ranks among IBD 50 stocks, with its RS Line signaling outperformance of the broad market.Earnings per share will rise 72% to $3.05 in 2018, according to Zacks, with a 24% jump to $3.79 in 2019.Shares of TD Ameritrade fell 0.7% to 59.48 Wednesday after advancing 3.1% Tuesday.

52,SCHW,"Take it to the bank — investors who use discount brokers grasp the impact of costs on their portfolios. And investors showed they value low costs by ranking Low Commission & Fees as the most important of 14 key traits they weigh in assessing which brokerage to use.X The preferences come from IBD's sixth Best Online Brokers report in which investors were asked to rate the importance of 23 brokerage traits.So, what are the online brokers that scored best in the Low Commission & Fees category of IBD's annual Best Online Brokers survey doing to distinguish themselves, to earn those votes from investors? And are fees about to sink lower?Low cost is a key weapon for winning and holding on to customers. You can even get free trades from some brokers, depending on the size of your transaction, how often you trade and the size of your account balance.But commissions vary a lot. Among the five highest ranked brokers in this category, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) has a regular commission of a low $1 minimum on trades of at least 1,000 shares of a U.S. stock. Two rivals — Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab (SCHW) — battle for customers with their $4.95 commissions. TradeStation parries with a $5-per-trade levy. And Merrill Edge's standard levy is $6.95 per trade.There's a similar range in prices for options trades.And some Best Online Brokers offer even bigger discounts to customers who qualify.At Interactive Brokers, if your monthly volume is more than 100 million stock shares, Interactive's commission plummets to 0.05 cent per share, with a minimum fee per order of 35 cents.Merrill Edge customers can get 100 free stock and ETF trades per month if they're in Merrill's Preferred Rewards Platinum program. That requires having a Bank of America (BAC) checking account. You've also got to maintain a three-month average combined balance of $100,000 in a Bank of America savings account and/or a Merrill investment account.TradeStation offers special deals too. You can choose between its $5 per trade levy and tiered pricing as low as 0.6 cent per share for each share in excess of 500. Investors who trade 5 million or more shares a month pay just 0.2 cent per share, with a minimum commission of 50 cents per trade. Depending on which exchange an investor like that uses, TradeStation will relay additional exchange execution fees or rebates, if any, on to the investor.Still, to get the best prices you might have to jump through hoops.TradeStation customers using tiered pricing risk triggering a $99.95 per month service fee unless their account balance is large enough or their trading volume high enough.And check out no-load mutual funds. Each of the top brokers in the Low Commissions & Fees category offers them. But some brokers charge a transaction fee on some of their no-load funds.Then there is research. It's mostly provided without additional fees by the top-ranked online brokers. Interactive Brokers, whose focus is low-cost, high-volume trading, offers freebies including blogs, newsletters and Fox Business News and other news sites. Investors can buy additional a la carte information including research like Thomson Reuters Stockreports+ for $2 a month up to Slingshot Insights for $725 per month after a free 30-day trial.Yet as fierce as competition is in this arena of commissions and fees, all customers do not gravitate solely to the lowest prices. Why not? In a word: Service.""As far as competing at zero commission, I don't feel we have to match brokers that do that,"" said Gregg Murphy, senior vice president of brokerage products at Fidelity. ""The breadth and overall value of our overall operation is significantly greater than what some other firms with lower costs offer.""Free research, a user-friendly platform and detailed information about a customer's price improvement on trades are just some of Fidelity's services.Price improvement reflects the difference between the maximum price a buyer says he will pay and the actual asked price that the broker obtains. For sellers of securities, it means they got more than the bid price on average.Merrill Edge voices a similar theme based on being part of Bank of America. David Poole, head of Merrill Edge advisory, client services and digital capabilities, said, ""We look at the full suite of our combined offerings — money market funds, low mortgage refinancing rates, bank accounts. It's tough for smaller players to compete with us on price and the whole gamut of offerings, which are a significant benefit.""And what about the future? Six of the seven top-ranked brokers in the Low Commissions & Fees category lowered some key fee during 2017. Are more fee cuts coming soon?Interactive Brokers, which touts its low prices, says more fee cuts aren't imminent. ""It's unlikely,"" said chief market analyst Andrew Wilkinson, whose firm's break point for its lowest stock trading commission is 100 million shares. ""We're for professional traders, not people who are relatively docile. And our customers value our services other than raw pricing too, such as price improvement and order routing.""In contrast, Fidelity touts its price improvement, which averaged $13.09 per 1,000-share market order between Jan. 1, 2017 and Nov. 30. Industrywide, the average is $2.02, Fidelity says.Merrill's Poole says robo-advisors cause more price pressure than cost-lowering mobile apps do. Yet robo-advice's impact is mainly restricted to investors who are super focused on low-cost products like ETFs, he says.And Fidelity's Murphy says lower fees from small rivals won't prompt new cuts from big shops. ""The majority of brokers offering zero commissions just have a trading app,"" he said. ""That limits trading functionality. Not even close to our level of overall offerings.""Murphy's colleague Scott Ignall, senior vice president of brokerage customer experience, adds, ""Our scale also gives us cost savings that we can pass through to our customers.""Ignall's advice to cost-conscious investors is simple: Don't look just for the lowest commission. Keep your eyes peeled for hidden costs as well.""There's a small set of competitors that have very low commissions and margin rates,"" he said. ""But look behind the covers. They charge you for market data, for adjusting orders when you want to cancel an order. Some require large account balances. Look at the details in fees. Look for a quality overall experience.""Want to read more about the other top brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

53,SCHW,"Tuesday's new-high list delivered an ample supply of top-rated growth stocks, although many gave back early gains, following the trend of the broad market.Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO) hit a new high Tuesday, but the biotech ended near its session low after trying to clear a base with a 21.20 entry. Shares edged 0.3% higher to 20.94.Elsewhere, chip stocks outperformed early but gave back early gains along with the Nasdaq composite.

The tech services firm ended  just above a 119.28 entry.

It's been a low-volume breakout so far over a 57.91 buy point.Charles Schwab (SCHW) faded an early gain as shares slumped nearly 2% to 56.68.

58,SCHW,"The exchange traded fund universe is still in growth mode as the number of products proliferate and money keeps flowing into ETFs.Exchange traded fund assets grew 10% to nearly $2.8 trillion year over year in Q1, according to industry researcher Cerulli Associates, taking in a record $133 billion during the quarter.What began as a single offering in 1993, with State Street's (STT) SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), has blossomed into an industry with nearly 100 providers and some 2,000 ETFs, according to Morningstar Inc., an independent investment research firm.But most of the biggest players have been stable. The top four providers in terms of assets held the same spot in March as they did a year ago.BlackRock (BLK) iShares led with nearly $1.1 trillion in assets under management, Morningstar data show. Vanguard came in second with $681 billion, while State Street and PowerShares followed with respective AUMs of $537 billion and $121 billion. Charles Schwab (SCHW) rounded out the top five with $69 billion.BlackRock, which attracted $53.3 billion in Q1, boasts 336 U.S.-listed iShares funds. The first iShares ETFs, WEBS (World Equity Benchmark Shares), date back to 1993. Morgan Stanley and Barclays Global Investors launched the ETF series, later renamed iShares MSCI Series, in response to State Street's launch of SPDR S&P 500 the same year. BlackRock bought iShares in 2009.IShares began rolling out its Core series in 2012. ""IShares' lower cost Core Series has been highly popular as investors have sought moderately priced asset allocation products,"" Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research at CFRA, told IBD. ""In addition, they have a strong presence in the fixed-income ETF market and adoption of such products have been popular with retail and institutional investors.""Vanguard saw nearly $39.9 billion in inflow during the quarter. Though the Valley Forge, Pa.-based company didn't launch its first ETFs until 2001, it has quickly moved up the ranks. It now offers 55 ETFs.State Street Global Advisors took in $11.5 billion in Q1. PowerShares attracted $4.1 billion during the quarter.IBD'S TAKE: SPDR S&P 500, the first exchange traded fund listed in the U.S., remains the biggest to this day. Read this recent article for further details on the ""Spider"" ETF.Charles Schwab, which moved up a spot from Q1 2016, took in nearly $6.8 million in inflow. The online broker's ETF portfolio consists of 21 funds. Schwab has been coming on strong recently as it starts to gain ground on Vanguard, which has long been known as the key low-price leader.""Similar to iShares, Schwab has benefited from a shift to lower-cost passive allocation products,"" Rosenbluth said. ""While their lineup is smaller than others in the top 10, we think they will continue to gather assets. However, gaining share is a challenge as investors will see some similarities to their fees to what iShares and Vanguard are charging.""The top three players account for the lion's share of total assets, about 86%. BlackRock's market share was almost 39%, followed by Vanguard at 24% and State Street's 19%. PowerShares held a 4% share and Schwab, 2.5%.Not all of the top 10 ETF providers saw positive inflow in Q1. WisdomTree (WETF), the No. 7 player (down from No. 5 in March 2016), had $58 million in outflow during the quarter. It got hit with $7.15 million in outflow during the past year.""WisdomTree has a relatively high exposure to funds with a currency hedged international focus,"" said Rosenbluth. ""Investors have focused on more traditional international equity funds this year. The firm's other products are much smaller and thus are dwarfed by the flows to or away from WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ) and WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity (DXJ).""While the ETF industry is still in growth mode, there are some signs of maturity. More than 200 new U.S.-based ETFs launched in 2016, but the 128 closures was a record.That's a sign that the industry is growing in a rational manner, Rosenbluth says.Mature, maybe, but not moribund. After ETFs took in the record $133 billion in Q1, inflow continued in April, with equity ETFs pulling in $24.13 billion and fixed-income ETFs raking in $10.72 billion in new investments, according to State Street Global Advisors, citing Bloomberg Finance data.RELATED:S&P 500 ETFs Eye Record Highs As Earnings Fuel Health Sector's RiseDividend Growers To The Rescue As Stocks Retreat And Volatility Ticks Up

60,SCHW,"Until recently, socially responsible investing has been a backwater in the investing world. But investors — particularly activist groups — now demand more environmental, social and governance (ESG) responsibility from corporations.X According to a survey by Brown Brothers Harriman and ETF.com, 51% of investors say ESG carries some level of importance, up 14 percentage points from last year. There are 169 ESG mutual funds and 56 ESG ETFs, according to Morningstar.""It's definitely being driven by investor feedback or the appearance that you want to be ahead of the game on this,"" said Scott Sacknoff, chief executive of SerenityShares, which manages the ESG-focused SerenityShares Impact ETF (ICAN). ICAN, which launched in April, has $4 million in assets and an expense ratio of 0.5%.ESG's increasing popularity has raised questions about whether stock and bond index fund managers could and should be doing more to use proxy votes to steer companies in the indexes toward higher ESG standards.Morningstar recently published a paper examining the issue, ""Passive Fund Providers Take an Active Approach to Investment Stewardship.""The paper found that while European managers have been active for years through the two stewardship tools of engagement with corporate management and proxy voting, index managers in the U.S. and Japan have only recently begun this process.Of the five U.S. fund managers surveyed, BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street Global Advisors, and Fidelity Investments said they were increasing their engagement efforts, despite the costs. Only Charles Schwab (SCHW) said it would not.""While we don't meet with individual companies, we do engage with issuers in a systematic way through our proxy voting,"" a Schwab spokeswoman told IBD. ""We have yet to see evidence that with a portfolio as large as ours (by number of companies), direct engagement would provide measurable improvements for shareholders.""The Morningstar paper addresses the main issue: ""It may be tempting to assume that (since) index managers are passive owners (they) have little incentive to devote resources to monitoring companies; after all, they tend to compete on fees and their primary objective is to match the performance of indexes.""Another issue is that since index managers have no choice in the stocks they hold, why should they care what the companies do?""That's why we say they have a duty to influence these companies to promote better ESG policies,"" said Hortense Bioy, Morningstar's director of passive fund research in Europe and the report's co-author. ""Because they are stuck with these companies. They are long-term investors, and they own everyone in the market. So they have a unique responsibility to change these companies for the better. That is the whole argument. As opposed to active managers, who if they disagree with the way a company is run, they could just divest it and not care, and only invest in the ones they believe will outperform the market.""While for the most part, index managers vote with corporate management, sometimes their huge shareholdings can result in visible change. In 2016, a shareholder proposal asking ExxonMobil (XOM) to be transparent and disclose its risk to climate change wasn't backed by BlackRock. Instead, BlackRock held private discussions with the oil company's management asking for the same thing as the activists. But it saw no results, so in 2017, when shareholders put forth the same proposal, BlackRock publicly voted for it, helping it pass.""BlackRock believes that engagement is the best way to drive change on important environmental, social and governance issues,"" said BlackRock spokesman Ed Sweeney, adding the firm has been doing this since 2011. ""As a long-term investor, we are willing to be patient with companies when our engagement affirms they are working to address our concerns. However, our patience is not infinite — when we do not see progress despite ongoing engagement, or companies are insufficiently responsive, we will vote against management. We view a vote against management as a sign of a failed engagement, not as the start of the process.""While large asset managers are favorite targets of activist groups, their pressure doesn't always bear fruit. In November, an activist shareholder group proposed that Vanguard Group divest itself of PetroChina (PTR) and Sinopec Shanghai (SHI), two Chinese energy firms doing business in Sudan. The group accused the companies of genocide. Vanguard recommended its shareholders vote against the proposal. The proposal failed.But what about returns?""ESG started not to improve the world, it was started by big banks to get a handle on risk,"" said Janet Brown, president of FundX, a San Francisco RIA, and manager of the FundX Sustainable Impact Fund (SRIFX).""Research shows higher ESG scores lead to more efficient, better earning companies,"" Brown said.  ""About 2,000 academic studies show a positive correlation between higher ESG and positive returns."" She was citing a study in the Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment published in 2015.It's not just academic studies. A 2017 survey by State Street found that more than 68% of institutional investors reported that integrating ESG into their process had ""significantly improved their returns.""RELATED:Sexual Harassment Screens Making It Into ESG World

64,SCHW,"After a year of cutting prices, expanding advisory services and  launching trading platforms with new capabilities, Charles Schwab (SCHW) turned in a strong showing in the latest IBD Best Online Brokers survey and remained among the five best brokers.X IBD's sixth online brokers survey, like the previous ones, asked investors which broker features are most important to them and whether their primary broker did a good job in each of those categories. Schwab brokerage again showed strength across the board, ranking among the best brokers in every category this year.In the crucial Low Commissions & Fees category — the most important attribute to brokerage customers in the survey and the No. 1 reason  they switched firms — Schwab answered investors' call.Amid a price war among brokerage firms in online trade commissions, Schwab lowered its fees for U.S. stocks and ETFs to $4.95, down from $8.95 the prior year. The result? Schwab's Customer Experience Index rating for Low Commissions & Fees jumped sharply from last year's survey.Meanwhile, in early 2017, Schwab brokerage customers gained access to the new Schwab Intelligent Advisory, an advisory service that blends trained professionals and advanced technology to make investment planning more accessible. The service comes with an annual advisory fee of 0.28% of assets.The advisory service is designed for investors who are focused on keeping costs low and understand the importance of developing a personalized financial plan.Also on the cost side, Charles Schwab ranked No. 2 in the Low-Cost/Free ETF Trading category. Schwab's ETF OneSource — the firm's commission-free ETF platform — has expanded to 254 funds after an addition of 12 ETFs in early 2018. That helps address an investor need that Charles Schwab perceived, says Heather Fischer, vice president of ETF and mutual fund platforms and client solutions strategy.""Trading ETFs without commissions or other fees continues to grow in importance for investors,"" Fischer said.The ability to place trades quickly and reliably is an important quality, according to investors.

In February 2017, the company announced a Satisfaction Guarantee for clients that will refund any related commission, transaction fee or advisory program fee if a Schwab client is not completely satisfied.According to Charles Schwab President and CEO Walt Bettinger, ""Today's consumers expect great value, a great experience, and a refund if they aren't satisfied.

86,SCHW,"After a strong rebound since March 2, the stock market took a rest on Tuesday. The major indexes took losses of 0.6% to 1% in heavier turnover vs. Monday. Several top-rated stocks, meanwhile, continue to hold above or close to recent buy points.While Broadcom (AVGO) is receiving tons of media attention on news that President Trump ordered to block a potential megamerger with Qualcomm (QCOM), industry-mate Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) has quietly broken out of a 15-week double-bottom base that features a 124.54 buy point.In a good double bottom, the second sell-off must undercut the first initial decline. Monolithic certainly did that: The base's second low of 103.14 went below the first low of 105.01.The stock found solid support at the 200-day moving average, and the base features symmetry. A third positive trait: The overall decline in the base is a mild 18.7% from head to toe.Monolithic, an expert in mixed-signal circuits including DC converters, LED drivers and audio amplifiers, holds a 97 Composite Rating as seen in IBD Stock Checkup in IBD's fabless semiconductors industry group. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 33% to 77 cents a share in the first quarter of 2018.Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO) is trying to clear a cup base that shows a 21.23 entry. This base is unique, particularly on a daily chart. For starters, the nine-week pattern has elements of a double bottom. Yet the stock has a volatile streak, so the jagged price action can generally be treated as a cup.Second, as seen only on a daily chart, it formed a tight handle, starting with a down day on Feb. 28. That produced a 20.42 entry, a dime above the handle's intraday high. Volume on the breakout from that early buy point was light.San Diego-based Halozyme specializes in recombinant human enzymes for the drug delivery, encrinology and oncology fields of medicine. It turned profitable in recent quarters. The small-cap firm posted earnings of 2 cents and 85 cents a share in Q3 and Q4 last year, respectively.The Dow Jones transportation average outperformed on Tuesday, rising 0.5%. Airlines gave the sector index a nice push up. Ryanair (RYAAY) is building a cup base that appears to have made two handles. The most recent handle has a 125.32 entry.The Irish discount carrier is one of the highest-rated companies in IBD's airline group, which has moved from 88th to 34th over the past six weeks in terms of six-month performance. Ryanair, a large cap with a $29 billion market value, has posted four straight quarters of profit growth, averaging 28% per quarter. Q1 profit is seen climbing 27% to 28 cents a share.Meanwhile, real estate data provider Zillow (Z), highlighted in this column on March 5, has now rallied 17% past a breakout from a solid cup with handle and a 48.59 buy point.

87,SCHW,"Stock market bulls had their day in the sun Friday as the Nasdaq composite scored an all-time high, cheered by a strong jobs report and tame wage growth in February.X With about one hour remaining in the session, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed gains of around 1.5%. The S&P 500 reclaimed its 50-day moving average. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Thursday's levels at the same time of day in the stock market today.Chevron (CVX), JPMorgan (JPM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) outperformed in the Dow, with gains of 2.5% to 3%.Nonfarm U.S. payrolls surged 313,000 in February, well above the Econoday consensus estimate of 205,000. Wages rose a tame 2.6%, also below expectations. Investors moved out of bonds and into stocks on the news, sending the 10-year Treasury yield higher by 3 basis points to 2.89%. According to the CME Group FedWatch tool, the market has pretty much baked in a quarter-point hike at the March 21 Fed meeting. That would lift the federal funds rate to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%.Friday's session yielded a healthy supply of breakouts, good to see alongside robust gains for the major stock indexes.Rising bond yields helped the cause of financials, including a couple of online brokers. Charles Schwab (SCHW) added nearly 3% to 57.44, good enough for a breakout from a base with a 56.35 entry. E-Trade Financial (ETFC) showed similar action, rising 3% to 56.94. It cleared a base with a 56.10 entry.Goldman Sachs (GS), meanwhile, is near the top of a flat base with a 273.89 entry. Shares rose 1% to 269.66. The stock was unfazed by a Wall Street Journal report that CEO Lloyd Blankfein could step down as soon as the end of this year.Trucking stocks were among the day's best performers as the group rose more than 3%. Small-cap Saia (SAIA) jumped above the 50-day moving average, rising 4% to 75.47. Its current consolidation shows an 80.35 entry.Heavy-volume gainers included steel producer Tenaris (TS). While several other steel producers lagged Friday, Tenaris — which makes oil pipes and has some operations in the U.S. — bucked the trend, rising nearly 3% to 37.18. It cleared a long base with a 36.44 buy point.President Trump on Thursday announced steel and aluminum tariffs, as expected, but excluded Mexico and Canada.

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.2%, falling under its 50-day line for the first time since late April. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined over 2%.

91,SCHW,"Drugmakers and financial services firms look like attractive investments after years of being beaten down, said Charles Pohl, a manager of the Dodge & Cox Balanced Fund (DODBX), during a panel session Thursday at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago.Financial services are the $15.8 billion mutual fund's largest sector, with 29% of shareholder money as of March 31.That mutual fund is exposed to foreign financials, including ADRs of Netherlands-based Aegon (AEG), which provides insurance, pension and asset management. It also hold bonds from the U.K.'s Barclays (BCS), which provides banking and other financial services, as well as France's BNP Paribas.Still, the fund's financial services exposure is mainly U.S. based, though those holdings do business globally. The fund's top four holdings are U.S. stocks Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Capital One Financial (COF).In the panel discussion occurring on the conference's first full day, Pohl said rising rates in the U.S. are a tailwind. So are gradually easing regulatory burdens abroad.Noriko Chen, a manager of $63.3 billion American Funds New Perspective (ANWPX), agreed, pointing out that political pressures beating down on financials globally have created buying opportunities.Swiss-based insurer Chubb (CB) is a top-25 holding. So is Hong Kong-based AIA Group, which provides life insurance and other financial services.An aging population is a key factor in making pharmaceutical companies attractive.Among pharmaceuticals, ADRs of France's Sanofi (SNY) and Switzerland's Novartis (NVS) are in the top 10 of Pohl's fund. Britain and Sweden's AstraZeneca (AZN) is also a holding.Chen said she also likes certain state-owned enterprises (SOEs) whose home-country governments mandate that the firms pay relatively hefty dividends. Some of those dividend yields in China and Brazil are 25% or higher, she said.Forty-two percent of her fund's assets are foreign stocks. Fourteen percent are domiciled in the Asia/Pacific region.Panelist Amit Wadhwaney of Moerus Capital Management, another value-oriented investor, said he likes British-based Coats Group, the world's largest manufacturer of thread. He likes its pricing power and elastic demand. Shares have climbed 113% the past 12 months vs. 14% for the S&P 500.His firm's taste for stocks with strength and staying power is reflected in its name, the first word of which is a Latin reference to a city's defensive walls.

92,SCHW,"X The stock market was mixed in afternoon trading, but trading off its early intraday lows. The Nasdaq shrugged off early weakness to edge slightly higher, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average remained 0.2% in the red. Volume was tracking solidly lower across both exchanges vs. the same time Thursday. Among the other Dow industrials, Apple (AAPL) paced the advancers, rising 1.3% to fresh highs after several analysts raised their price targets on the iPhone maker. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and McDonald's (MCD) followed up with gains of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.On the downside, General Electric (GE) lagged with a more than 3% drop in heavy volume that is running nearly 100% above usual levels, while Merck (MRK) and Cisco (CSCO) both fell over 1%. General Electric was downgraded to sell by Deutsche Bank, who believes that GE is ""overvalued given weak earnings quality.""Other analysts actions include Nvidia (NVDA), which moved up 0.9% after its price target was hiked at Canaccord Genuity and RBC Capital Markets. The graphics chip maker remains barely extended above a 121.02 potential entry.Nvidia is also making strong strides in the emerging artificial intelligence, data center and self-driving auto technology markets. Recent IPO Trade Desk (TTD) roared almost 29% higher after a late Thursday earnings release came in well-above analyst expectations. Shares are extended sharply above a 46.31 cup-base buy point.Financial stocks underperformed in the stock market today. Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) dropped 0.9%, while retail brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW) fell 1.4% after finding resistance at its 50-day line earlier this week.Within the S&P 500, casino operator Wynn Resorts (WYNN) led the way with a 3.3% rise, while retailers continued their precipitous falls. Nordstrom (JWN) plunged more than 9% despite beating Q1 earnings and sales estimates late Thursday. Nordstrom's same-store sales were weaker than expected. Shares of fellow department store J.C. Penney (JCP) reached a record low, down more than 10%, as revenues and same-store sales fell more than forecast early Friday.Action within the IBD 50 was mixed as leading growth stocks as weakness among financials offset strength in technology names. On the upside, Momo (MOMO) notched a new high, up 4.3%, while fiber-optic stock Lumentum Holdings (LITE) moved up 1.9%.On the downside, chip name Ichor (ICHR) dropped nearly 4% but bounced off intraday lows after reporting earnings that fell short of the Street's estimates, while regional bank Citizens Financial (CFG) and private mortgage insurer Essent Group (ESNT) fell 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively.Ichor is currently trading above its 50-day moving average, a sign of strength.RELATED:Apple Hits Record High On Bullish Wall Street ReportsThese 5 Red Flags On GE Send Stock To 15-Month LowNordstrom Comp Sales Miss But Off-Price Brand Nordstrom Rack SurgesGraphics Chip Maker Nvidia Gets Fresh Price-Target Hikes

94,SCHW,"U.S. stocks were little changed in midday action Wednesday, despite President Trump's disruptive plan regarding Jerusalem and a Senate committee's backing of a partial rollback in Dodd-Frank.X The Nasdaq crept 0.1% higher, while the S&P 500 was just barely above flat. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%, while the small cap Russell 2000 fell 0.1%.Volume in the stock market today was below the previous session's pace.Trump is expected to announce that the U.S. is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This would make the U.S. the first country to do so. The U.S. would then eventually move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.On a quieter note, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee approved a bipartisan rollback to parts of the Dodd-Frank law in a 16-7 vote Tuesday. Four Democrats on the panel voted with the majority. The rollback has the support of nine Democrats in the Senate, and initial support from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and Yellen's replacement Jerome Powell.The bipartisan legislation doesn't involve a full repeal.The bill would raise the trigger for more intense regulation of financial firms from the current $50 billion in assets to $250 billion, thus easing the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions. This would benefit firms such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), which rose five sessions in a row before pulling back Tuesday and so far Wednesday; SunTrust Banks (STI), which rose six sessions in a row before its pullback; and American Express (AXP), which advanced six sessions in a row, going into Wednesday's session.Major money centers such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) would not get a break. At midday, all three were down slightly.Bank stocks, including the big players, have benefited on the belief that the Federal Reserve will crank interest rates at least a quarter point after the Fed meets Dec. 12-13. CME Group's FedWatch Tool estimates the odds of a rate hike at 100%. The only difference is between those who expect a quarter-point hike (90.2%) and those who see a half-point increase (9.8%).A half-point increase would be a bold move, and the Ben Bernanke/Janet Yellen Fed isn't known for boldness.In recent sessions, the chipmakers, chip designers and chip-equipment makers have fallen 9% to 14% off their highs. As of Tuesday's close, the chip sector fell to No. 8 among 33 sectors — its worst ranking of the year.Speculation among market watchers swirls around two views: Either chip stocks will offer a buying opportunity when they stop falling and rebound or their leadership position will be turned over to some other sector such as banks and financials.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, solar and steel producers led the upside. Oil-related stocks led the downside.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, a gauge of consumer confidence, decreased in December. The overall reading dropped to 51.9 from 53.6 in November.""It's worth noting that the tax reform package President Trump championed and is nearing passage hasn't led to a jump in optimism,"" said Terry Jones, IBD's commentary editor.Despite the drop in December, the optimism gauge remains in positive territory. The index has held above the neutral level of 50 for 15 months in a row.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?New Highs: Are Stocks Pivoting To New Leadership?

97,SCHW,"The Morningstar Investment Conference 2018 (MIC) for financial advisors shifted into high gear with keynote addresses by Kunal Kapoor, CEO of Morningstar, and Charles Schwab (SCHW) CEO Walt Bettinger on Monday afternoon.Their sessions followed a warm-up series of presentations by Morningstar experts on a range of topics, many introducing new tools by Morningstar.The crux of Bettinger's presentation was that advisors — who form the bulk of more than 2,000 attendees at the MIC — must work hard to help clients and to build their own practices. Advisors are basically active managers when it comes to serving clients' needs, Bettinger said. The key to serving clients' interests, Bettinger said, ""is getting to know and serve other people.""Bettinger illustrated his point by confessing that in his own earlier days as a student he had failed to ace a final examination that he had gone into with high confidence. It turned out that the instructor asked a single question. What was the name of the classroom building's cleaning lady? Bettinger did not know her name was Dottie. He described his oversight as the result of focusing on his own interests rather than the interests of hardworking people around him. Bettinger's point was that advisors also should put their clients' interests ahead of their own.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSimilarly, many individual investors do not know the fine points of what makes someone a fiduciary, he said. But they do know they want ""someone they trust like a fiduciary,"" he said.Bettinger's presentation was mostly a question-and-answer session, moderated by Tricia Rothschild, chief product officer for Morningstar.Preceding Bettinger, Kapoor sounded a similar theme. ""Great advice is personal, efficient and innovative,"" he said.By personal, Kapoor meant that service must serve the real interests of clients. That may differ from ideas that clients hold. Some clients, for example, want to imitate neighbors who brag about owning a stock that is hot. Instead, Kapoor said, their role model should be their neighbor who is in fact a millionaire but also frugal.Advisors should also learn how to cater to clients who, for instance, want their investments to reflect their personal goals and ideals. For millennial clients who want to invest in low-carbon footprint companies, advisors should learn more about ESG (environmental, social, governance) investing, Kapoor said.RELATED:Morningstar Investment Conference 2018: News From Gathering For Financial AdvisorsAmazon Who?

Since at least 2017, the ETF has corrected no worse than 10% and it's maintained a moderate uptrend since the November 2016 election sparked a rally in financials and other sectors.So far this year, iShares Broker-Dealers is up 10%, beating the S&P 500. The average annual returns (as of May 31) are 35.1%, 16.8% and 18.8% over the past one, three and five years.The portfolio breaks down into three parts.

Shares of those two institutions remain near the lows of their current price consolidations and underperform other holdings.There's been multiple factors influencing the brokerage and exchange companies this year. Rising interest rates have expanded net interest margins — something noted in Morgan Stanley's Q1 earnings report. The regulatory environment has been easing for banks and other financials. Higher market volatility has resulted in more trading activity — and commissions — for brokers.But financials are lagging several other sectors this year, including software, apparel, health care and semiconductors.To its credit, iShares Brokers-Dealers and Exchanges has a number of solid stocks. Charles Schwab is up about 25% from a breakout to new highs in November. Nasdaq shares are up about 20% from a November buy point.

101,SCHW,"Robinhood trained its sights at crypto trading app Coinbase as well as the likes of TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) Thursday with the move to let investors buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum for no extra fee.X But Bitcoin and crypto-related stocks retreated broadly on the news that some of the largest banks are cracking down on credit-card purchases of these volatile virtual assets, as well as signs that the Securities and Exchange Commission may seek to regulate sales of new digital tokens, known as initial coin offerings or ICOs.Here is the latest on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency news and trends:Robinhood, the millennial- and smartphone-friendly app for trading stocks, will allow customers in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire to trade cryptocurrencies for no commission fee starting in February.The zero fee compares with reported 0.5% to 4% fees on Coinbase, a popular crypto-focused trading app.But Robinhood is already offering certain crypto services to all customers. Starting today, its customers can monitor market data and create custom price alerts for 16 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple.Announcing Robinhood Crypto, the company said it will allow users to invest commission-free in cryptocurrencies alongside stocks and ETFs, billing itself the first major online brokerage to support cryptocurrency trading.""We believe that cryptocurrencies have the potential to fundamentally reorganize the way money works from the ground up, putting power previously held by financial institutions directly in the hands of the people,"" the company said.The ability to trade Bitcoin on the Robinhood platform will take place in stages across U.S. states. The later debut of trading is ""to add a level of predictability to the market and not catch the market by surprise, like others have done,"" it added.Robinhood has more than 3 million users and has seen more than $100 billion in transactions on its platform.Brokers such as Interactive Brokers (IBKR), TD Ameritrade and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) allow clients to trade Bitcoin futures, but not the digital currencies themselves.

103,SCHW,"XCharles Schwab (SCHW) reported a top- and bottom-line beat, as well as the highest number of new quarterly accounts in 17 years, but shares reversed modestly lower Tuesday morning.Profit rose 34.5% to 39 cents a share on 18% revenue growth to $2.08 billion, topping views for 36 cents EPS and $2.06 billion.""Clients opened more than 100,000 new brokerage accounts per month during the quarter, putting total new accounts at 362,000, the highest quarterly total in 17 years excluding acquisitions,"" said CEO Walt Bettinger in a statement.New retail brokerage accounts grew 44% to 235,000 during the March-ended quarter for a total of 7.2 million accounts. That growth occurred in the midst of an online brokerage pricing war and continued postelection market rally that saw the Dow Jones industrial average climb above 21,000 for a time.The discounting battle between Schwab, Fidelity Investments, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) resulted in Fidelity and Schwab each slashing stock and ETF trading commissions to $4.95, and TD Ameritrade reducing its trading free to $6.95.

Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Monday's levels.The stock market held up relatively well amid sharp losses in London and Paris overnight. The Paris CAC 40 swooned 1.6% amid uncertainty about the outcome of France's presidential election.

Goldman Sachs (GS) slumped 5% to around 214. It could be poised for a test of its 200-day moving average, currently around 203. Bank of America (BAC) reversed lower after a strong start. Shares were down 0.8% after rising 1.5% early.Charles Schwab (SCHW) had a lot of good news in its earnings report, including earnings and sales beats, as well as the highest number of new quarterly accounts in 17 years, but the headlines didn't help the stock much as shares fell 1%.Cardinal Health (CAH) crashed 11% after the company announced plans to buy some of Medtronic's (MDT) medical supply units for $6.1 billion.

105,SCHW,"Many mutual funds share the same holdings as TCW Select Equities, but most haven't performed nearly as well as this mutual fund under Craig Blum's management.The $907 million fund (TGCEX) is up 12.62% so far this year vs. returns of 6.07% for the S&P 500 and 8.63% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. In the past 10 years, the fund returned an average annual 8.20% vs. 7.40% for its peers and 7.08% for the S&P 500.How do Blum and his investment team produce such results? Their investment approach sounds similar to some other funds, so the difference must be in the execution.Part of that comes from the fund's concentrated portfolio. It holds only about 30 stocks and has about half of the fund's assets invested in the top 10 holdings. Top holdings as of March 31 were Alphabet (GOOGL) at nearly 7% of assets, Facebook (FB) 6% and Visa (V) 6%. Alphabet's stock has risen 12% this year. Facebook is up 27% this year and 13% above a cup-with-handle base buy point of 129.37. Visa is up 18% and 9% above a flat-base buy point of 84.06.Despite the heavier-than-average weightings, the mutual fund has a relatively low turnover rate of 14% vs. a norm of near 100% for stock funds.Blum's team selects quality large- and midcap stocks with the ""most unique and extraordinary growth opportunities available that are fundamentally misperceived by the market, and for that reason mispriced longer term,"" Blum explains.Underpinning stock holdings' potential are long-term revenue opportunities that flow from potentially huge addressable markets. Blum also looks at the business model for ""some sort of unfair advantage that puts a wide competitive moat around the business,"" he points out.TCW Select Equities focuses on fast-growing companies, but valuation matters. ""Valuation is the third pillar of what we do. It is best to avoid overpaying for a business,"" Blum said.He finds that deep and efficient markets are good at pricing-in consensus expectations and extrapolating near-term experience. ""What markets get wrong all the time are addressable revenue opportunities,"" he said. ""So markets misjudge how large an opportunity can be for a business, and they often misjudge competitive advantage.""A case in point is the story of Salesforce.com (CRM), which the fund started buying in 2005 and is now its fifth-largest holding. ""People thought it was never going to be anything more than sales force automation, Oracle (ORCL) is going to kill them, PeopleSoft is going to kill them,"" said Blum. ""Well, it wasn't just sales force automation. It was marketing and another segment of the service business, it was artificial intelligence and the predictive cloud. The entire software industry became the end market.""That said, the fund is not immune to volatility and significantly underperformed the market and its peers in 2016. TGCEX lost 8.07% last year vs. gains of 3.23% by its peers and 11.96% by the S&P 500.Among the culprits were a heavy exposure to the health care sector since early 2016 and the markets' favoritism of high dividend-paying stocks. In addition, Blum points out that there was asymmetry in the market in that it did not reward much for a strong fundamental story, yet any hint of chance of bad news would send otherwise-healthy stocks significantly lower. Also, the fund had little exposure to the postelection reflationary trade sectors such as financials, energy, materials and industrials.But as 2017 rolled around, markets started to realize that President Trump's proposals for pro-growth reforms may not happen as quickly as expected. ""You started to see the Trump reflation trade unwind,"" Blum said.In addition, the U.S. economy proved to be more robust to tolerate a Fed tightening, compared with a year ago. And markets became more comfortable pricing quality fundamentals and growth, he said, ""which is our wheelhouse.""""And so, you're seeing sectors like IT and health care, that were punished so heavily last year, begin to outperform,"" he said.One of the strong performers has been Mobileye (MBLY), a developer of software for camera-based advanced driver-assistance systems, which is being acquired by Intel (INTC). Mobileye's stock has jumped 62% this year.Blum says Mobileye is a good example of a business where Intel saw value whereas public markets didn't. ""They're the share leader in vision-based systems in your car. ... They're winning upwards of 90% of all business out of the auto OEMs.""Another stock he likes is Priceline Group (PCLN), of which the fund holds more than 4%. ""North of 70% of profits come from their European brand, which is Booking.com. Priceline is a dominant and proven online travel agent.""Blum says that the global online travel market is still only 11% to 12% penetrated, so there's a lot of runway for growth. Priceline's stock is up about 23% in 2017.One of the better plays on higher bond yields is Charles Schwab (SCHW), points out Blum. ""We still think it's sort of misunderstood as a high-quality business and asset-gathering machine, that also gives you lots of upside if we do successfully bring interest rates higher over the next two-three years.""Only about 15% of Schwab's revenue comes from trading commissions, while approximately 45% of the business is made up of fees from the asset management branch and another 35% to 40% from net-interest margins, Blum explained. ""So, it's a business that operates a very plain-vanilla bank as well.""Schwab's stock is up a just 1.6% this year and has been nearing its 50-day average in recent days.ServiceNow (NOW), a developer of cloud-based IT software, has gained 19% year to date and is a stock that Blum has been buying since 2014. ""This is another one that's poorly understood, we believe, by a lot of folks out there. It's a rapidly growing business. ... They're driving better results at dramatically lower cost for the end user.""Blum says that the number of use cases has expanded to not just IT service management, but also operations management, security management and many other tools. ""The reason it's performed well — it's because investors are slowly beginning to understand that the total addressable market that faces the company is much larger than once thought.""RELATED:This Top Mutual Fund Exploits Market Inefficiencies.

108,SCHW,"The S&P 500's solid 19% return in 2017 is likely to entice millennials and other new investors to try their hand at building wealth in the stock market. If so, they'll be choosing a path that is in many ways superior to bonds and other investments.X You can often start with as little as $50, and you can do it in your spare time, on a laptop at your favorite waffle shop, or even over your phone.While internet trading permits you to be as casual as you like, those who succeed in the stock market tend to be the ones who get the most serious about the challenge of trading stocks. New investors will want to learn some important steps in order to avoid costly mistakes.To be sure, with the age of the internet, getting to your first trade has become a deceptively simple process. You can set up a trading account this afternoon and transfer money from your bank account. When the funds arrive, generally within one to three days, you are set to jump in.Special Report: 2018 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2017 Stock Market ReviewAs a first step, determining which broker with which to set up a trading account deserves at least modest basic research. Most of the established online brokerages offer trustworthy banking services and competitive trading tools. Check some of the comparison reviews online to find the best fit for you, or look at IBD's Annual Broker's Survey — which provides a detailed rundown of brokers ranked highest by consumers. Brokers recently ranked among the top are Fidelity, Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).Once you have the account and are ready to go, how much do you invest, in which stocks and for how long?Being brave and bold can be effective traits for some investors. For others, being wary and meticulous works best. In either case, such intrinsic traits become much more effective once investors develop some serious market knowledge and skills.Investors who take the process seriously generally aim to save time and to reduce the risk that comes from experimentation by adopting a trading system.A broad array of educational programs are available to investors, from groups like the American Association of Individual Investors to brand names like The Motley Fool. The best way to find a good fit is to be clear on what it is you want to accomplish.Investor Business Daily's CAN SLIM trading methodology, developed by company founder and legendary investor William O'Neil, is a perfect fit for investors interested in minimizing risk and protecting capital, while pursuing high-quality growth stocks.One of the best ways to begin to wrap your head around the CAN SLIM system is to learn first the most fundamental rule: cut your losses at a maximum of 7% to 8%, with no exceptions.""Even being right three or four times out of 10 should yield a person a fortune if he has the sense to cut his losses quickly on the ventures where he has been wrong,"" said financier and philanthropist Bernard Baruch, quoted in William O'Neil's How To Make Money In Stocks.The absolute sell rule provides the most critical survival tool for an investors' capital, especially early in the learning process. Next on the list of priorities, you must make sure the market is moving in the direction you want to go.""To be highly accurate in any pursuit, you must carefully observe and analyze the object itself. If you want to know about tigers, watch tigers — not the weather, not the vegetation, not the other animals on the mountain,"" O'Neil wrote in The Successful Investor.One clear way to do this with the stock market is to read IBD's daily Big Picture market roundup, which breaks down the day's market action. It also keeps a clear bead on market direction through the Market Pulse, which gauges whether the market is in a confirmed uptrend, uptrend under pressure or market in correction.The first two indicate green and yellow lights for investors to make purchases. Market in correction means it's a risky time to place capital in the market.Knowing those two overriding rules frees you to begin the basics of locating and timing your first stock purchase. You can do this by searching for and reading IBD Investor's Corner articles on these basic steps toward your first trade.As you run through these basics, you can also familiarize yourself with the broader CAN SLIM trading stratagem by reading O'Neil's How To Make Money In Stocks. And remember, don't expect it to be quick or easy. You are not likely to get rich in your first 10 or 20 trades. But after 20 trades you should be on your way to building the confidence, knowledge and skills that are the basic building blocks to becoming a highly profitable investor.RELATED:With Tech M&A Seen Rebounding, Here Are Companies, Sectors To WatchStocks Edge Higher As Wall Street Eyes New Leadership In 2018 2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearWhat Will Warren Buffett Do With $109 Billion In Cash?

109,SCHW,"The advent of robo-advisors and other services have made saving for retirement easier than ever — at least to start. Plug into an investment profile form a few figures on income and assets along with information about investment goals and risk tolerance, and you're on your way.X But add in homeownership, a mortgage, college debt, a family and health care and the complexity of wealth management can quickly grow beyond your expertise.So before deciding to go it alone, first ask yourself whether you have the time, skills and discipline to do so.No? Then the next step is to find professional help.Anyone can call themselves a financial advisor or financial planner. But beware of those who just want to sell you an insurance policy or a mutual fund or promise above-average returns without providing a detailed financial plan based on your investment goals and risk tolerance. And beware of cold calls over the phone.Special Report: 2018 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2017 Stock Market ReviewYou want a professional advisor who takes your whole financial picture into account and acts on your behalf as a fiduciary. Such pros can help you save, invest and manage your assets with a future goal in mind all the while acting in your best interest at all times.When looking for a financial advisor, considering these three key principles — fiduciary standard, compensation and level of service — will help ensure a good fit.1. Fiduciary standard. There is a real difference between a broker from a big Wall Street firm who is only held to a suitability standard, and a financial planner who acts as a fiduciary 100% of the time. A stockbroker can sell investments that are merely considered suitable or appropriate for you at the moment of recommendation, but those offered by a fiduciary need to be in your best interest at all times.Now, anyone can call themselves a ""financial planner"", but that doesn't mean they always adhere to the fiduciary standard.""Advisors actually aren't required to be fiduciary at all times. They may be fiduciary on certain accounts ... whereas when they're giving you advice around insurance, they may not have to act as a fiduciary, so that in itself is a conflict of interest,"" said Devon Klumb, financial planner and co-founder at RhineVest. ""What people need to look for is someone who's fiduciary because their job is to make sure that their advice to you makes sense all the time, ongoing as your life changes.""The easiest way to find a fiduciary advisor is to look for a Certified Financial Planner or an Investment Advisor Representative, or IAR.CFPs have completed rigorous training and adhere to a strict code of ethics including fiduciary duty. The easiest way to find one is to search on websites such as LetsMakeAPlan.org or PlannerSearch.org, which feature CFP-only advisors. Another source is NAPFA.org, the website of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, the nation's leading association of fee-only advisors, who renew a fiduciary oath every year.An IAR is also held to the fiduciary standard. An IAR representative usually works for a Registered Investment Advisor, or RIA, firm. These investment management firms must register and make filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or with state security regulators. They function under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.2.  Compensation. It is important to understand whether you're dealing with a fee-only advisor or one that also collects commissions from the investments he or she recommends. When a commission is involved, chances are that the advice will be biased toward the highest-paying investment vehicles, which may not be in your best interest.""When people ask a true financial planner 'What do you charge?', the answer should be very simple and clear and specific,"" says Jason Howell, CFP, president and fiduciary wealth advisor at Jason Howell Co. A fee-only, fiduciary advisor will be transparent with the fee structure he or she charges. The fastest way to screen for a fee-only advisor is through NAPFA.org.3. Level Of Service. With the proliferation of robo-advisors, people have more choices today than ever before. Let machines do the thinking and calculation, as well as the buying and rebalancing of your portfolio. This option may be suitable for new investors who can either go to large firms such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Vanguard, or turn to specialized players such as Betterment, Personal Capital or FutureAdvisor.The next level up is a one-time consultation or a periodic portfolio review. This could mean a free or flat-fee consultation, and subsequent pay-as-you-go meetings. You'll still be in charge of your portfolio, but the advisor will give you specific investment recommendations.Many financial planners take a holistic approach. They will review all your assets and create a financial plan that is specifically tailored to your needs and wants. This is usually what a CFPs or other fiduciary will do when building a long-term relationship with their client.Finally, portfolio management involves the full management of your investments and transactions, whereby you're paying a fee on the total assets under management. Often, this level of service starts at higher dollar amounts of assets, such as $200,000 or more.IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.Other elements to consider when picking a financial advisor are whether he or she has the technological platform for data aggregation, planning and reporting. It's also always best to ask friends, people you trust or a respected organization for a referral. ""Never work with someone who calls out of the blue and asks to meet with you,"" Klumb said.And make sure you have rapport with the prospective advisor. ""They should be patient enough to allow you to go through the process: meet a couple of other advisors and then come back and say that they were the right fit,"" he said.Before securing the services of a professional, make sure you have your ducks in a row regarding your current financial situation. Having outstanding consumer debt such as credit cards, not having six to 12 months in emergency funds and not maxing out your retirement contributions at work may not make it worthwhile to go to a financial planner just yet, says Jill Schlesinger, Senior CFP Board Ambassador, CBS News Business Analyst and host of ""Jill on Money"" radio show.""Generally speaking, many people are seeking advice before they accomplish the basic principles,"" she said. ""Ask yourself the big question, do I know where my money goes? A financial advisor or a CFP will actually want that information.""RELATED:How To Find An Advisor Who Focuses On ETFsCan Tech Tools Help Millennials Avoid A Looming Retirement Crisis?Money Managers Lure Millennials With Low Minimums, Live Advice

110,SCHW,"Financial advisors are going to school the week of June 11 in Chicago. They'll be attending one of their industry's biggest annual teach-ins: the Morningstar Investment Conference 2018 (MIC) Monday through Wednesday at McCormick Place Convention Center. Advisors will hear presentations about building their practices, learning new ways to enrich clients and discovering how to milk income for clients from a low-rate world.Keynote speakers at this 30th annual edition of the MIC 2018 will include Charles Schwab (SCHW) Chief Executive Walt Bettinger; Daniel Kahneman, winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics; Ariel Investments President Mellody Hobson; and GMO co-founder Jeremy Grantham.In addition, industry notables appearing on various panels include David Herro, portfolio manager and chief investment officer of international equity at Harris Associates; and Diana Strandberg, director of international equity at Dodge & Cox.Herro and Strandberg's panel, on Wednesday morning, is titled ""Global Equity Investing in a World of Blurring Borders.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIBD'S TAKE: Read more in IBD about the Morningstar Investment Conference 2018.The three-day Morningstar Investment Conference 2018 will feature more than 60 speakers in formal sessions, with additional presentations taking place in informal side appearances, which are not on the official agenda.""The financial services industry is at an inflection point given the increasing role of technology, a hunger for best-interest solutions, and a younger generation of investors on the horizon,"" Morningstar CEO Kunal Kapoor said in a release.He added, ""This year's conference features timely themes such as the drivers of investor success, taming technology in the modern advisor landscape, the future of diversification, the role of machine learning in asset management, and more.""On Monday, several Morningstar experts will speak on such topics as data that can help shareholders choose a mutual fund and sustainable investing.The conference shifts into high gear on Tuesday.One breakout session is titled ""The Bond-Pickers' Guide to Fixed-Income Strategies."" Scheduled panelist Elaine Stokes told IBD before the conference that economic stimulus in the form of tax cuts and government spending on infrastructure should extend the cycle.Stokes, who is co-manager of seven Loomis Sayles funds, including $12.4 billion Bond Fund (LSBDX), said, ""Investors should skew to short and short-intermediate bonds.""She added, ""The other thing you can do is be more flexible. Instead of buying long high-quality U.S. bonds, which are very affected by (Federal Reserve rate) moves, look at convertibles, emerging-market debt or other non-U.S. bonds.""""Manager Selection From A Practitioner's Perspective"" is a panel devoted to practice-building. Speakers are slated to discuss how an advisor should select a money manager. Panelist Phil Huber, chief investment officer of the Chicago area's Huber Financial Advisors, told IBD that he looks for mutual fund managers whose expenses are in the lowest third of their universe. Second, he prefers managers with a track record of at least five years. Third, in fixed income, he wants managers whose rolling three-year returns outperform their benchmarks 80% of the time. Fourth, in stock funds, he wants managers whose five-, seven- and 10-year records top their categories about 60% of the time.Bank of America's Anna Snider, another participant on the manager-selection panel, told IBD that you can run computer screens to identify managers who meet various objective criteria, but don't overlook ""the human element in selecting managers.""Snider said, ""At the end of the day, you want to trust them and trust that they are communicating what's going on in a portfolio — what the risk is, positioning, changes that might be happening on the management team."" Nothing does that as well as human judgment, says Snider, who is head of due diligence for the chief investment office of the bank's Global Wealth & Investment Management division, which includes Merrill Lynch and US Trust.Snider added, ""Make sure the client understands the role of each portfolio manager. ... The client should know how the parts (of an overall portfolio) fit toward the client's overall goal.""Participants in the panel, ""Defensive Equity Investing,"" are slated to talk about where advisors and their investor clients can look for yield without excess risk at a time when interest rates are rising.Darby Nielson, head of Fidelity Investments' equity quantitative research team, told IBD that one solution for many investors is to find acceptable yield from dividend stocks that are not treated like bond proxies.The strategy that an investor chooses depends on his or her priority. ""When I think about choosing a defensive equity strategy, it depends on whether you want yield income or low volatility,"" Nielson said.Additional Tuesday panels include ""On the Cutting Edge of Retirement Research,"" ""Smart Plays in Developing Markets"" and ""Making Sense of the Multitude of Multi-Factor ETFs.""Also, panels devoted to ""Crypto, Blockchain, and Lamborghinis, Oh My!"" and ""Show Me the Income"" are on the curriculum.Wednesday sessions include a panel scheduled to discuss whether growth strategies are poised for a comeback and another about how advisors should make decisions about investing in new technologies.James Murphy, manager of $5.6 billion T.

120,SCHW,"Finding the best mutual fund to protect and grow your hard-earned retirement savings can take a little skill and, it might sometimes seem, a lot of luck. Do you put your trust in the latest hot stock picker or seek out superior long-term returns?The IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards, just released for 2017, let you look for both at one time. The awards recognize top-notch funds that beat benchmark indexes in both short- and long-term comparisons. To make the cut, a mutual fund had to outperform in each of the last one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, through Dec. 31, 2016.Whether you're looking for a new fund for your retirement plan or wondering how the funds you now own stack up, the list can help you create and maintain a high-performance portfolio.The top five funds in each category ranked by 10-year performance are singled out for special recognition.Being a four-time winner is a herculean task. Among 2,813 mutual funds of all kinds that met the criteria of having at least $100 million in assets and 10 years of operation, only 410 beat their benchmark in each period.
"
121,SCHW,"Of 1,104 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in business for the entire decade tracked by Morningstar Inc., only 44 prevailed as four-time winners.Among 470 growth mutual funds, nine emerged as award winners.The S&P 500's 11.96% gain in 2016 was a difficult hurdle for actively managed growth funds. Many funds' investment styles didn't play well during the early-year sell-off spawned by worries about a sputtering economy, or later during the June Brexit vote sell-off or November election volatility.Blend funds and value funds made big improvements. Blend funds turned in 22 winners vs. 10 last year and value funds paraded 20 funds in the winner's circle vs. three last year.In some categories, beating the benchmark was easy. Out of 428 international stock funds, 129 beat their benchmark, the MSCI EAFE. That was a 30% victory rate. The subdued performance of the EAFE index in 2016, which gained just 1%, made for a low bar for managers to clear.Whether you are looking for mutual funds to strengthen your current portfolio or just starting out, the IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards list is a great place to begin. You can pick among the funds to build core positions in your diversified retirement portfolio. International stock funds, sector funds and bond funds can help you add weight to parts of your portfolio where you want extra emphasis.Before buying remember to check which choices make the best fit in terms of your investment horizon and risk tolerance.You can build your investment profile using a financial advisor or forms provided by major fund companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price (TROW) as well as brokers such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), and E-Trade (ETFC). You can get key fund information from fund prospectuses, quarterly reports and manager commentaries.What if a fund you own is not one of the award winners?You may decide to keep it if it's a perfectly good fund run by competent portfolio managers and it fits a unique need of your portfolio. Consider whether it outperformed its benchmark in most periods but narrowly missed in one or two.Some 135 U.S. equity funds came close to winning IBD Best Mutual Funds Award status. They failed to outperform in just one of the four time periods.This year's winner lists differ a lot from last year's. Many great new funds surfaced. Quite a few relatively new funds made their mark this year.Fourteen younger U.S. equity funds topped the bogey over one, three and five years but weren't old enough to have 10-year records. Ninety-two funds in all categories that were less than five years old outperformed in one and three years.It was tough for funds from last year to repeat as winners. Take the U.S. diversified stock fund category. Last year, 101 funds beat the S&P 500 in all four time periods.Of the 49 that managed that feat this year after a tough 2016, a mere four are repeat winners.Some categories were especially hard hit. Growth funds, value and small caps each had zero repeat winners. Midcaps and muni bond funds each managed to return just a single champ to the award winners' ranks.Blend, international stock and international bonds funds each managed to squeak just two 2016 winners to this year's lists.U.S. bond funds had the most success in returning titleholders to the award winners roster. One hundred fifty-nine of them distinguished themselves as four-time winners. And 14 of those were winners last year too. Their benchmark is the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.The stumbling block that prevented so many funds from returning to the best-of-the-best lists and kept many funds from making their debuts was the topsy-turvy 2016 market.This year's winners had to be nimble enough to avoid stumbling in last year's wild and woolly steeplechase.Just because last year's winners didn't earn awards this year doesn't mean they no longer deserve to stay in your portfolio. Take a good look at the funds and see how much they underperformed their benchmark. Find out if there has been a change in fund managers or investing strategy. Watch to see if their relative performance improves.What's the secret to consistent outperformance? For Gary Miller, lead manager of $8.2 billion Victory Sycamore Established Value Fund (GETGX) — this year's top winner in the value category — one key was unwavering focus on bottom-up stock picking.To beat the benchmark, you can't imitate it. ""This means emphasizing the merits of the company-specific dynamics and the willingness to build a portfolio that looks considerably different from the benchmark,"" Miller said.And then have the market move in your favor.The market in 2017 will produce a new crop of best performers. Whether or not the latest winners will repeat, many by virtue of their proven ability to perform over the long term could be excellent choices for your retirement account.Take $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor (PARWX), the No. 1 fund in our U.S. diversified equity category.

124,SCHW,"A mishmash of industries helped guide the key indexes higher, and the Dow Jones industrial average indicated that demand for large-cap names may still be undiminished. Meanwhile, new-issue Zayo Group (ZAYO) broke out sharply.The specialist in leasing dark fiber and building cellphone towers shot up more than 5% to 34.77 and rallied past a 34.11 buy point in a five-month cup with handle. The base shows an example of fine institutional support at the important 200-day moving average during a test on Feb. 10. At least nine names in the 30-component Dow industrials rose 1 point or more, including tech services play IBM (IBM) and insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH).IBM, expected to report Q1 results after the close on Tuesday, rallied more than 10% after it cleared a 164.76 saucer-with-handle entry in early December, but the stock has now faded below the 10-week line for more than five weeks. Analysts see profit flat at $2.35 a share and just rising 1% to $13.78 a share for the year.UnitedHealth, up 1.4% to 167.18, is making its third general test of the 50-day line since January. The managed care firm broke out of a flat base at 144.58 once in October, then again on Nov. 10 in strong volume.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9%, just a nose ahead of the nearly 0.9% gain in the S&P 500. The Nasdaq composite was up almost 0.9% while the Russell 2000 gained 1.2%. Volume fell on both main exchanges, according to early data.Top-performing industry groups included wireless telecom services, diversified operations, movies, travel booking and internet-based retail. But money-center, tobacco, car retail and computer-systems stocks also flourished, with groupwide gains of 1% or more.The U.S. dollar wilted. Near-term U.S. crude oil futures sank more than 1% to $52.61 a barrel.Returning to Zayo, the Boulder, Colo., member of IBD's Computer-Networking industry group has lost money every year since 2010. But last year the net loss shrank to 31 cents a share, and Wall Street expects Zayo to earn 35 cents in 2017 and 57 cents in 2018.Revenue jumped 28% to $1.72 billion in 2016, accelerating from a 20% gain in 2015.The 5% buy zone in shares of Zayo following the breakout goes up to 35.82.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Snap (SNAP) continued to slump after a promising rebound in late March gave the stock the appearance that it could work on the right side of its very first base pattern. While the market rose, Snap shares fell 1.3% to 19.93 and could close below 20 for the week for the first time since the week ended March 17.Despite some rosy comments by some Wall Street analysts, the Snapchat operator must deal with the primary challenge of proving to investors it can in fact make money in the long haul. Analysts have cut their estimates, and the company is expected to lose 55 cents a share in 2017 and 33 cents in 2018.These expected net losses are substantial, given that Snap has 1.16 billion shares outstanding. The float is 364 million.Fundamentally, one critical issue is whether Snap can rein in its ballooning operating costs. Revenue jumped a magnificent 590% to $404 million in 2016, but research and development costs more than doubled to $184 million, while sales and marketing expense rocketed 357% to $124.4 million.Full-year operating losses came to $520.4 million, up from a $382 million operating loss in 2015.The Street sees Snap losing 20 cents a share in the first quarter of this year.Snap's RS Rating of 9 is meaningless because this rating is based on 12-month relative price performance. So, for now, watch to see if institutions come in and shore up support for the stock near 20. It came public March 2 at 17 a share.Key earnings results on Tuesday include a batch of financial firms, such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) (earnings per share seen up 28% to 37 cents), Bank of America (BAC) (EPS seen up 25% to 35 cents, following an 11% drop and gains of 8% and 48% in the prior three quarters), and Goldman Sachs (GS) (EPS up 98% to $5.31).Traders will also be eyeing data on U.S. housing starts for March on Tuesday and the Federal Reserve's beige book survey of regional economic activity on Wednesday.RELATED:The Income Investor: Should You Own These 4 Dividend-Rich Utilities?Stock Market Today: Is It Time To Hold These Dow 30 Stocks Longer?Inside The IBD 50: Which Names Hold Terrible Accumulation Ratings?How To Invest Like A Pro: Lessons On Focus On Risk Control From A Master Race PilotWhich Sectors To Invest: The Top 3 Among 33 Broad Sectors Are All From Tech Land

142,SCHW,"Dow Jones futures rose solidly Monday morning along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. Apple (AAPL) skyrocketed last week, pushing the Nasdaq composite above its 50-day moving average, with the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index closing in on that key level. BP (BP), Abiomed (ABMD) are also top stocks breaking out along with Apple, while  Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Red Hat (RHT) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) are near buy points.The 50-day moving average is traditionally an important support level for the S&P 500 and other major averages — as well as individual stocks — but in recent months it's been a resistance area. Friday was only the fourth day since March 21 that the Nasdaq composite has closed above the 50-day line. The Dow Jones has only been above its 50-day in nine sessions since Feb. 2.So the stock market rally is at a key juncture. Is this another short-lived Nasdaq foray above its 50-day line, or will the Dow Jones and S&P 500 join it in a sustained advance? Apple and BP are among many top stocks clearing buy zones in recent days. Many more top stocks are on the cusp, such as Nvidia, Microsoft and Red Hat. But if they are going to be real winners, the broader stock market move higher.Dow Jones futures today climbed 0.4% vs. fair value. S&P 500 index futures advanced 0.4%. Nasdaq 100 futures rose almost 0.7%.

The stock pulled back to its 50-day line this week before hitting a new 52-week high Wednesday.Snap (SNAP) jumped over 30% after topping Q4 earnings and sales targets late Tuesday.

147,SCHW,"A robust trading platform, desktop and mobile. Relentless innovation. These are just some of the elements that have helped keep TD Ameritrade (AMTD) a top favorite among investors in the latest IBD Best Online Broker survey.X Other factors are expanding research functions as well as a level of web-based and person-to-person service that satisfies sophisticated customers, including professional advisors.Judging by the broker's latest accomplishments and progress on integrating a historic merger with another industry giant, Scottrade, the Omaha, Neb.-based TD Ameritrade shows no signs at all of resting on its laurels.In this year's results, TD Ameritrade again finished among the top five, which it has consistently done the past five years. Plus, among the 19 online brokers explicitly listed in IBD's extensive questionnaire, TD Ameritrade received the most respondents, even more than Fidelity and Charles Schwab (SCHW). This alone provides another layer of proof that the decades-old company draws a group of investors who are passionate about investing and trading with success.The firm is not the lowest-cost broker, but it ranked among the five best brokers in 12 of the 14 categories in IBD's annual investor survey. And in an industry war of low commissions that began two years ago with brokers like Charles Schwab, Ameritrade has reduced its fees over time. Commissions have dropped to $6.95 per one-way trade from $9.95.Ameritrade earned the highest Customer Experience Index rating for its Options Trading Platform for the second straight year. Other categories where Ameritrade ranked highly included Investment Research as well as Site Performance, Equity Trading Tools, Research Tools, Mobile Trading Platforms, Educational Resources and Trade Ideas.TD Ameritrade strives to stay on the cutting edge of options-related services by going as far as providing specific option trade recommendations. TradeWise Advisors, an affiliate, sends recommendations to a customer's inbox; the emails include details on analytical methods that veteran floor traders apply when making such recommendations. Qualified TD Ameritrade clients may also direct the broker to execute the trade automatically through the Autotrade service.Over the past year or so, Ameritrade also has worked hard to ""further bridge the gap between mobile and desktop trading."" How? For starters, it's successfully added event icon overlays on its mobile charts, including earnings information and stock splits. It's added ""Market Maker Move,"" which allows clients to set and edit complex order conditions on their mobile devices, as well as the ability to view order history on trading activity.In a move to boost account security, Ameritrade recently launched ""2-factor authentication"" for its customers in Singapore, and plans to expand this into the U.S. in the near term. Also on the mobile side, the company debuted a function that automatically locks the application when a user leaves his or her Web-enabled device and requires either a password or touch ID after the ""Request Authentication"" interval set by the user has expired.Mobile trading is becoming a significant chunk of Ameritrade's business. In 2017, it saw 331,000 average daily mobile users, up 24% vs. 2016, and enabled 126,400 mobile trades on average per day, up 33%.""As we continue to invest heavily in our platforms, we are not only focused on delivering new functionality but also enhancing existing tools and features to improve the client experience,"" Melissa Matson, a spokeswoman at Ameritrade, told IBD in an email exchange.Here is a list of other head-turning new innovations:TD Ameritrade is also big on ongoing education.The company notes that it houses more than 200 instructional videos, tutorials and investing publications. Then you have the live webinars. For instance, on Jan. 17, Scott Thompson, an options expert, led an evening session entitled ""Volatility, Vega, and VIX Option Strategies"" to help customers ""understand the critical role volatility plays in determining an option's value, and consequently in choosing option strategies,"" the company said on its website. TD Ameritrade held the session as part of its advanced level ""Active Trader"" presentation series.Over the past month, TD Ameritrade also held events, all of which are archived, to discuss the topics of swing trading (Jan. 9), sector rotation and intermarket analysis (Jan. 10) and discerning the differences of growth, value and income (Jan. 11). Also on Jan. 11, it held three separate sessions titled ""Portfolio Management: Enhancements and Protections,"" ""Active Trading: Complex Options Strategies,"" and ""Getting Started with Futures.""Ameritrade's merger with longtime rival Scottrade last year has led to significant gains in average trading volume. In the fiscal first quarter ended in December, Ameritrade chalked up an average 726,000 trades per day across all securities, up 49% from a year earlier.Total client assets jumped 48% to $1.2 trillion.Want to read more about the other top brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

148,SCHW,"Millennials have built a certain reputation for making unconventional life choices. They pick experiences over material goods. They choose vacations based on Instagrammability. And when it comes to investing, they sometimes pick an online stock broker based not just on commission rates, but on the people who work there.X ""I was deciding between TD Ameritrade and Fidelity, and I thought it was cool that Fidelity has a woman CEO and that she was wanting to get more women in the industry,"" 29-year-old Jodie Navarre told Investor's Business Daily. ""I thought that was neat.""The Denver resident, who works in software sales, recently flew the broker coop, so to speak. Most of her family, including her, had held Raymond James accounts with the same advisor, but Navarre — one of the 232 millennials who participated in IBD's 2018 Best Online Broker survey — wanted to take the reins over her trading decisions.That prompted her to look for a new brokerage even though she ""loved"" her advisor at Raymond James. Fidelity's executive management nudged the scales in its favor.See, the thing is: as much as millennials make headlines for their (purported) affinity for things like avocado toast and Unicorn Frappuccinos, the next generation of investors might actually be more exacting than most when it comes to which broker gets the pleasure of holding their money.Navarre's interest in what lies behind the curtain doesn't appear unusual. It's a mindset that extends to the way millennials invest in funds and equities, and brokers are taking notice.""There's no question you're seeing (the) emergence of a lot of environment, social, ESG-related portfolios,"" Head of Merrill Edge Aron Levine told Investor's Business Daily, referring to environmental, social and governance investing, a philosophy that looks for value beyond a company's financials. That could mean paying attention to its attitude toward carbon emissions, philanthropy or labor practices.""I think ourselves and many others have either rolled (out ESG products) or are in the process of it, because there's no question there is a demand,"" he said, adding that Merrill Edge has seen ""huge receptivity"" for its research tool's new ESG-scoring feature.Younger investors also harbor curiosity about up-and-coming brokerage firms.Of the 18- to 34-year-olds surveyed by IBD and polling partner TechnoMetrica (4.6% of the 5,052 respondents), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) were the most popular picks, with one out of four respondents calling either company their main broker.But a solid 10% of surveyed millennials rely primarily on Robinhood for their trading needs — significant market share for a free-trading brokerage app launched in 2013 by two Stanford roommates. (Contrast that with the 1% of 45- to 54-year-olds and 0.4% of 55- to 64-year-olds who call Robinhood their main trading squeeze.)""Most of my friends are more familiar with Robinhood than traditional brokers,"" said 34-year-old Brian Schleiker, a survey participant from the San Diego area who works in medical device sales and has been investing for the last decade or so. ""I think they've done a really good job promoting themselves to millennials.""As for his own preference in brokerages, Schleiker has pretty much tried them all at one point or another, holding accounts with E-Trade, TD Ameritrade and Fidelity over the years. He even had a Charles Schwab (SCHW) account for about a week, in an effort to sample all the online brokers' different features.For the last two-plus years he's been happy with Interactive Brokers, but also has a ""small account"" with Robinhood and a presence on Acorns, the millennial-friendly app that rounds up credit card purchases to the next dollar and invests that spare change in the market.Heavyweights in the online brokerage industry might want to watch where the young money in search of the best online brokers is going: a full 16% of millennials chose ""other"" — possibly platforms such as Acorns — when asked about primary brokers.That means they're not trading on TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, E-Trade, Schwab or any of the 19 mainstream options provided on the survey. Only 9% of Gen Xers in the 35- to 44-year-old category and 3% to 4% of the 45-and-up respondents are trading through lesser known brokers.The next question, then, is how legacy players are stacking up in satisfaction levels.Across the board, millennials were collectively less satisfied with their brokers than their baby boomer peers, and almost always less satisfied than Gen Xers, in the 14 areas including commissions and fees, trade reliability, site performance, customer service, research tools and investment and retirement planning tools. They were slightly less likely to rank their brokers ""excellent"" or ""very good"" and slightly more likely to rank them ""fair"" or ""poor"" out of the five-scale rating system vs. their older counterparts.Some exceptions: millennials were just as likely as 35- to 44-year-olds and 45- to 54-year-olds to rate their main broker's mobile trading platform ""excellent"" or ""very good"" (58%), and in fact the 35- to 54-year-olds were slightly more likely to register dissatisfaction with broker apps, ranking them ""fair"" or ""poor.""That translates to less loyalty and fewer word-of-mouth recommendations. IBD survey data point to millennials and young Gen Xers (35- to 44-year-olds) being less likely to recommend their primary brokers to friends than their older counterparts. Both groups also were about equally likely to have switched brokers one or more times in the past five years, with over half citing cost as the main reason for straying. Older investors were more likely to have stayed put.Still, brokerage firms can take some solace in knowing that more than three of five polled millennials (63%) and young Gen Xers (62%) said they had not changed up their primary broker during that time frame, and only a little more than one in four are currently looking to find a new one.Thirty-three-year-old urologist and self-taught investor Christopher Taylor has investments through Schwab, Fidelity and to a lesser extent, TD Ameritrade. He likes Schwab the best — ""Fidelity's mobile stuff is a little bit buggy"" — but says customer service at both ""has been really good.""To switch to a different broker, ""I would have to be upset with Schwab and Fidelity for some reason,"" he said. ""The fees can't get much lower.""Most of the survey participants IBD interviewed had one thing in common: they were pretty much the only ones in their social circles who invested or were particularly interested in investing.That the majority of 20- and 30-somethings aren't rushing to plunk down money in the stock market isn't exactly news. Only one in three millennials invests in stocks, says an oft-cited Bankrate.com study; a big part of that comes from thinking they don't have enough cash to spare.""Both my parents taught me a lot of about investing money, and the power of letting your money grow in stocks and mutual funds and things like that,"" said respondent Navarre. ""But I know a lot of my friends live paycheck to paycheck and (that's) not something they could think about doing. Or they might have a 401(k) account with their company and that's kind of about it.""Others thought that a lack of knowledge — or fear of risk — might also be the culprit.Brian Heitzman, a 29-year-old who works at Wells Capital Management and studied finance in school, feels ""fortunate"" that he understands financial concepts.Looking back on a conversation with a friend not long after graduating from college, Heitzman described his pal as ""kind of scared of stocks. He didn't want to just put money into something that'll lose value.""""And I'm thinking about it — you're 22, 23, you're not going to be retiring for 40 years, that's the place to be,"" he said. ""So I guess I just feel that a lot of millennials don't see the value or they're scared to take that type of risk, when in my mind, it's a bigger risk not to invest than put your money in equities for the long run.""Even millennials who have money in the market are pretty cautious, though.""When they do start investing and they are investing, they tend to be playing it safe, overall,"" said Merrill Edge's Levine, calling the generation ""a bit risk adverse.""He attributes the collective hesitation to younger investors having witnessed parents and grandparents struggling during the financial crisis.At the same time, they are reportedly feeling more self-sufficient. Merrill Edge's own semiannual survey found that 66% of the affluent millennials polled said that they expect to depend on their own savings (including 401(k) and equity investments) in 20 years, an increase from previous years, says Levine. Gen Xers were most likely to cite just their 401(k) accounts (71%) and baby boomers were likeliest to look to their pensions (54%) as their primary bedrock two decades from now.Younger folks are also investing and saving their money for different reasons.""Retirement is really being redefined,"" said Levine. ""This idea that a millennial's going to save some huge nest egg — that at the age of 65, I have X amount of dollars that allows me to leave the workforce completely and spend the next 20 years, you know, doing other things? I don't think that's real.""Instead, he says, that traditional notion is giving way to the idea that financial freedom is significant. Millennials are open to working different jobs when they get older, but they're not necessarily bent on leaving the workforce altogether.Levine said the question millennials are more likely to ask themselves is: ""How do I get to a level of freedom where I can choose what I might want to do in a second or third career, and how do I give more, how do I contribute to the community more?""Want to read more about the other top brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

150,SCHW,"What do the CEO's of Charles Schwab (SCHW), Hyatt Hotels (H), Guidewire (GWRE) and Vail Resorts (MTN) have in common? They all addressed investors at Baron Fund's annual conference in New York recently.Getting insights from the chiefs of companies Baron has a keen interest wasn't the only treat. Of the 5,000 attendees, those who are investors in the firm's flagship Baron Partners Fund (BPTRX) are seeing a year-to-date return of 31%. Investors with $25,000 in any of the company's funds are invited to the annual conference held at one of New York's premier institutions, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, which also features top shelf entertainment for lunch as well.XThe theme of this year's conference held Nov. 10 was ""Disruption.""""Disruption upends the status quo,"" said Ron Baron, chairman, chief executive and founder of Baron Funds, from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. ""The Chinese word for disruption is made up of two characters: danger and opportunity. Disruptions create opportunity. It's hard to see the opportunities when you live through disruptions, but believe me they're there.""Baron, 74, said the prosperity of the 1950s came from the disruption of the Great Depression and World War II. And that the disruption of the 1960s and '70s set the stage for the strong economic growth and strong stock market of the 1980s and 1990s.In addition to managing the Partners Fund, which has $2.06 billion in assets under management, Baron is also the portfolio manager of Baron Growth Fund (BGRFX), up 23.7% year to date, and Baron Focused Growth Fund (BFGFX), up 25.4%, compared with the S&P 500's return of 17.2%.Baron said the U.S. is currently in another period of disruption. ""Between 2000 and 2017, we've had one BAM! after another: two stock market bubbles burst, two wars and now a disruptive president.""Yet, amid this millennial disruption we are experiencing unbelievable achievements, such as SpaceX's relandable rockets, he said. Advances in technology have always been disruptive, but not at this pace. ""Amazon is disrupting a new industry every day.""""People are dismissive of disruption until BAM! Then it's too late to catch up,"" said Baron. ""But, our outlook is positive. We believe the millennial disruption has set the stage for accelerated growth.""And while it may seem like there is an app for everything, he said only people analyzing companies can identity competitive advantages that algorithms and apps cannot.""Apps can't assess character, judgment, curiosity and trustworthiness,"" Baron said. ""Apps can't imagine what a business will becomes.""But Baron fund managers can, judging by investment returns. Some of the managers were brought to the stage to talk about their views for the year.Jeffrey Kolitch, the portfolio manager of  Baron Real Estate Fund (BREFX), up 26.3% year to date, said, ""This isn't 2010 when everything was on sale, but if you look at the overall market and dig deep, there are tremendous opportunities.""""We are very excited about India,"" said Alex Umansky, the portfolio manager of Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund (BFTHX) and Baron Global Advantage (BGAIX). ""We had no investments in India a year ago, but now India makes up 9% of our portfolio.""The CEOs Baron introduced to his investors head companies he feels are taking advantage of the disruptions in their industries. Schwab president and CEO Walt Bettinger heads a company that fits the bill.Mark Hoplamazian, the president and CEO of Hyatt Hotels (H) said Airbnb was a big disruption to the hotel industry because people want to experience interpersonal human connections.""People want experiences over things and there is a huge momentum for a desire to travel,"" he said.Another interesting company was Guidewire Software (GWRE), which makes easy-to-use software for the property and casualty insurance industry. Chief executive and co-founder Marcus Ryu said the software typically improves a company's operating margin by 2.5 to 4.5 percentage points.Rob Katz, the chief executive of Vail Resorts (MTN) said the ski resort company shifted the paradigm away from waiting for the weather and disrupted how the company was positioned for its investors. It's now the best performing stock in the travel sector, jumping 422% in five years.RELATED:

151,SCHW,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were little changed Wednesday morning.X Charles Schwab (SCHW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) and Extreme Networks (EXTR) were top-rated stocks clearing buy points Tuesday, at least intraday, as the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials all hit record highs.Charles Schwab, Ollie's Bargain Outlet and Extreme Networks all have Composite Ratings above 95 out of a possible 99. All-time winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big runs. Palo Alto Networks has an 87 Composite Rating. That CR is rising quickly as its Relative Strength Rating rebounds to a still-meh 67 to complement a best-possible 99 EPS Rating.S&P 500 index futures were a fraction higher vs. fair value. So were Nasdaq 100 futures. Dow futures climbed 0.1%.That's despite Salesforce.com (CRM), HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) falling in the premarket following their late Tuesday earnings, with HPE CEO Meg Whitman stepping down as well. Farm equipment giant Deere (DE) rose after topping quarterly earnings estimates early Wednesday.A slew of economic data is due Wednesday morning ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. Friday's session will be shortened, with stock markets closing at 1 p.m. ET.Charles Schwab rose 2.1% to 46.08 on Tuesday, rising as high as 46.33 intraday and briefly clearing a 46.31 flat-base buy point. Volume was 22% above normal, which is pretty good in this holiday week.Schwab shares rose a fraction to 46.25 before the open on the stock market today.One troublesome sign: Schwab's Relative Strength line, which tracks the stock vs. the S&P 500 index, has made a series of slightly lower highs since peaking in late January.Meanwhile, Schwab rival E-Trade Financial (ETFC) is closing in on its own breakout, while TD Ameritrade (AMTD) is already in a buy zone.The cybersecurity software firm topped earnings and revenue targets late Monday, sending shares up 4.8% to 149.40 and gapping above their 50-day line. Palo Alto rose as high as 156.85, a nine-month best and briefly topping a 153.45 entry. Volume was very heavy in the post-earnings session. But the stock closed near session lows.Ollie's Bargain Outlet rose 0.75% to 47, closing exactly on a 47 buy point. It was the closeout retailer's third straight gain in accelerating, above-average volume after reversing higher from an intraday low of 42.36 last Friday. Ollie's hit a record 47.20 intraday Tuesday.Extreme Networks shot up 7.25% to 13.91 in double average volume, easily passing a 13.30 buy point from a short consolidation and hitting its best levels in nearly 16 years.RELATED:The Big Picture: Tech Stocks Underscore Their DominanceThese Five Top Stocks Are Carving This 'Super Growth' PatternWhy Wal-Mart, Cisco And GM Are The New 'Growth' StocksBullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy Point

152,SCHW,"The stock marked turned in another bullish performance Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 hitting new highs.Apple (AAPL) was a solid gainer in the Dow, up just shy of 2%. The stock shrugged off a note from Rosenblatt Securities that talked about shorter delivery wait times for the iPhone X. But Rosenblatt also said that the phone's high price tag could be keeping customers away.The Nasdaq composite led the way, up nearly 1.1%. The Russell 2000 picked up 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and Dow added 0.7% each. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in higher than Monday's levels in the stock market today.Earnings reports were in focus again. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) gapped up sharply at the open on strong earnings, but a 10% intraday gain was halved by the close. Shares rose nearly 5% to 149.40.Home-improvement chain Lowe's (LOW), meanwhile, recovered nicely off lows. Shares fell 1% to 80.59 early despite quarterly results that showed better-than-expected earnings and sales growth and a 5.7% rise in same-store sales. Lowe's continues to work on a cup-with-handle base with an 82.84 buy point.Staying in the retail space, Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) rose  for the third straight session in strong volume. Shares rose nearly 1% to 47 as it vies for a breakout from a later-stage base with a 47 buy point. Earnings at the fast-growing discount retailer are due Dec. 6 after the closeIn the financial sector, Charles Schwab (SCHW) closed near the top of a flat base with a 46.31 buy point.

"
153,SCHW,"Conviction is vital to the managers of Parnassus Fund (PARNX). Ian Sexsmith and Robert Klaber, along with lead portfolio manager Jerome Dodson, have guided the fund into the upper echelon of large-cap growth funds by taking big stakes in relatively few stocks.They take above-average bets on each stock, particularly in their top 10 holdings. So they better have done their homework and have high confidence that their picks will pan out. Top holdings as of Jan. 31 include Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Micron Technology (MU).The Parnassus approach is working fine. The average annual returns of Parnassus and its stablemate Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) have surpassed the S&P 500's in the past year, as well as the past three years, five years and 10 years -- by enough to earn them both IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards.Parnassus Endeavor took top honors for being among the top five winners ranked by 10-year average annual return in three categories: overall U.S. diversified equity, as well as growth and large-cap funds. Parnassus Fund was among the top five in growth and large cap.The $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor owns just 26 stocks, while its $950 million stablemate Parnassus Fund holds 36 stocks. The larger fund, which Dodson has managed alone since 2005, has 48% of its assets invested in its top 10 holdings. Parnassus, which has been around since 1984, has 38% embedded in the top 10.Many growth funds hold 50 to 100 stocks in smaller position, seeking to control volatility with greater diversification. Not Parnassus.""We are a high-conviction fund,"" Klaber said. ""We have high active share and are bottom-up stock pickers."" Active share is a measure of how much a portfolio's holdings differ from its benchmark index.Aside from its focused approach, another way the funds stand out is their mandate to invest in good corporate citizens. ""We have no exposure to the energy or utility sectors,"" Sexsmith said. ""We are looking for companies that are best-in-class from an environmental perspective, a social perspective and a governance perspective."" In addition, Parnassus Endeavor's holdings must offer outstanding workplaces.As a multicap fund, the Parnassus team has the flexibility to invest wherever it sees opportunity. ""It is a go-anywhere domestic stock fund,"" Klaber said. ""We have no market-cap restrictions, so it gives us a pretty broad playing field."" Though Parnassus does have more than Endeavor in small and midcaps, 29% vs. 25%, Parnassus still favors large caps with 64% of its assets. Meanwhile, large-cap-oriented Endeavor has 86% in big caps.Some funds aim to control risk by veering only so far from benchmark-index sector weightings. Parnassus' conviction-investing results in some heavy over- and underweighting in sectors. As of Jan. 31, Parnassus Fund had 23% in financials vs. the S&P 500's 16%. Parnassus Endeavor was close to the benchmark in tech with 18%, but had outsize bets of 38% in tech vs. 19%, and 31% in health care vs. 14%.Klaber notes that a long-term focus has been key to the fund's success. Both funds have turnover rates 42% or lower. ""We are a bit more contrarian than other Parnassus funds,"" he said. ""We're willing to accept a wider range of outcomes in the short term.""Indeed, a direct line between top holdings and current fund performance isn't always clear. Some of the two funds' recent top holdings show signs of struggling, including Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Allergan (AGN), off 33% and 14% from their 52-week highs.Parnassus screens all potential holdings for relevance. ""We are looking for companies that are becoming increasingly relevant for the products or services they offer,"" Klaber said. ""We want to own companies that are gaining share in their sector or industry. The focus on relevance helps us to avoid value traps."" In value traps, investors are attracted to a stock by its low valuations, but after investors buy, the stock fails to rise.Wide moats are a hallmark of portfolio holdings. ""We seek companies with sustainable competitive advantages,"" Klaber said. ""We feel that provides protection during down markets because there is stored value.""Another important consideration for Parnassus is efficient capital allocation by companies it invests in. ""We go back five years and analyze how management has allocated capital in the past,"" Klaber said. ""We then project how we think they will allocate capital in the future to understand whether they are good stewards of capital.""The Parnassus team creates a three-year forecast with base, bull and bear scenario analyses for potential new stock buys. ""We are looking for asymmetry,"" Klaber said. ""We want companies with moderate to low downside risk and significant upside. An asymmetric risk to reward ratio is a common feature across all of our holdings.""""Historically, the Endeavor Fund has had a tech bias,"" Klaber said. ""As of the end of last year, more than 40% of the fund was invested in tech.""As of the end of January, two sectors accounted for approximately half of the Parnassus Fund. ""From a sector perspective, one of the sectors we have been most overweight is financials,"" Sexsmith said. ""The pro-growth agenda of the new administration has been a tailwind for these firms.""Parnassus is weighted 22.9% in financial service stocks. It added Progressive (PGR) in the first-quarter of 2015. Endeavor also has a stake in the auto insurance company. Sexsmith sees the company's online sales strategy as a disruptive force. ""There aren't many companies that are going to gain market share for as long as we can see,"" he said. ""When we see opportunities like that we are going to invest in them. Every year, Progressive chips away and gains market share. Its market share now is around 9% of the U.S. auto insurance market. That's going to keep going up over time.""Progressive shares have gained 11.4% since the beginning of the year and 19.1% from a year ago.Parnassus is weighted 27.3 in technology. ""In technology, we own a collection of wide-moat businesses with strong growth profiles that trade at attractive valuations,"" Klaber said.Klaber cites eBay (EBAY) as a prime example of a company with a wide moat. It is owned by both Parnassus and Endeavor. ""The source of its moat is a strong network effect where more sellers bring more buyers and vice versa,"" he said.Shares of eBay are up 12% year-to-date and 37.9% over the past year. They broke out of a cup-with-handle base in February, ran up 4%, but have since eased to near the breakout point.IBM (IBM) is a top tech holding in both portfolios. ""It is trading at 13 times earnings, about a 25% discount to the market, with a 3% dividend yield, so expectations are low,"" Klaber said. ""We think its server business will do better than expectations and its strategic initiatives group will continue to see growth accelerate.""IBM has climbed 7.1% so far this year and 24.9% over the last 52 weeks.The Parnassus team sees a lengthy runway for Allergan. The pharmaceutical company is the top holding of Parnassus and a top five holding of Endeavor. ""It has a dominant position in many therapeutic areas,"" Klaber said. ""It's a stock we have owned as a firm since the end of 2013, when it was in the high 80s. We were also buying it aggressively toward the end of last year. This is a company that has six drugs either in phase three or entering phase three in 2017.""Allergan shares have jumped 14.8% in 2017.The Parnassus crew exhibit the kind of patience with Allergan that many growth investors do not. While the company's earnings have grown at a 24% annual rate the past three years, Wall Street analysts see growth slowing to 19% this year and 11% next year. The stock's Relative Price Strength Rating from IBD is just 50.RELATED:Contrarian Pin Oak Equity Rises To The Top

Boosted by that demand, the stock is now around 25% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared in September.Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) and software and analytics leader Adobe (ADBE) both came in just shy of the $1 billion mark, getting investments of approximately $982 million and $932 million, respectively.The IBD 50 screen identifies the top growth stocks that are strongly displaying the key traits typically shared by the biggest stock market winners.Seven of the names on this month's list of new buys by top funds are also currently on the IBD 50, including Applied Materials, Adobe, Abiomed (ABMD), Lam Research (LRCX) and S&P Global (SPGI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn addition to BofA, seven other bank stocks made the list, joined by six financial sector companies, including Charles Schwab, which was named one of the best online stock brokers for 2018.Leading portfolio managers also continued to pick up shares in semiconductor stocks, including the aforementioned Intel, Applied Materials and Lam Research, as well as Microsemi (MSCC) and KLA Tencor (KLAC).Portfolio managers also showed a healthy interest in medical stocks, with five companies from that sector joining Abiomed and Abbot Laboratories on the list, including Express Scripts (ESRX) and Cantel Medical (CMD).Just because mutual fund managers have been buying a stock doesn't mean it's time for individual investors to pick up shares, especially given that the overall market has come under selling pressure recently. Be sure to run all your stock ideas through a buying checklist and do additional research before making any investment decisions.On Tuesday, Applied Materials cleared a 58.83 buy point in a later-stage, and therefore riskier, double bottom. Its relative strength line has been trending sharply higher and is just shy of new high ground.Lam Research is also working on a late-stage double bottom, and has now climbed within 5% of the 218.58 entry.Scanning and tracking solutions leader Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) leapt past a buy point in January, but pulled back as the stock market fell sharply in early February. But on Feb. 22, Zebra soared on its Q4 earnings report and is now 27% above the initial 112.49 entry.Adobe also launched a successful breakout in January and has now climbed 14% above the 186.37 buy point.IBD 50 member SVB Financial (SIVB), which owns Silicon Valley Bank and was just featured in the IBD Stock Analysis, broke out past a 263.19 entry on Tuesday, but is now testing support at the buy point after the resignation of Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn rattled the market.Despite being among the top new buys this month, Boeing topped the list of stocks being sold, with 42 net sellers (123 funds selling minus 81 buying).American Express (AXP) was second, with 40 net sellers (90 funds selling minus 50 buying).Managed care provider Humana (HUM) and Motorola Solutions (MSI) also saw a significant number of net sellers.You May Also Like:What Are Today's Fastest-Growing Companies?Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsVideo: How To Quickly Find Top-Performing Mutual Funds

159,SCHW,"Riding the broad stock market's modest rally in April, many of the best mutual funds clawed their way up last month. Market volatility has increased amid growing signs that interest rates will keep rising. Stocks, bonds and the mutual funds that invest in them are in for more of the same in the months ahead, according to experts at Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Ameriprise Financial (AMP).That market scenario points to opportunities in growth stocks, says Omar Aguilar, Charles Schwab Investment Management's chief investment officer of equities. ""The market will recognize growth in earnings as a key driver,"" he said. ""Companies that are using extra cash from tax reform and generating capital expenditures, investing in innovative products and ideas, those companies will benefit. Companies that are more yield sensitive will have a harder time being attractive.""But Ameriprise chief market strategist David Joy warns not to count on leadership from the growth stocks that have been highfliers for the past year or more. Many familiar growth names have grown pricey, he cautions.The S&P 500's 0.38% April advance reclaimed some of its 2.54% setback in March. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds fought through weakness late in the month to scratch out a 0.27% gain for April after falling 0.93% in March.Small-cap value funds' 0.81% April gain led the meager rally by U.S. diversified stock funds.One key hurdle for stock funds in April was the rise in yield on the 10-year Treasury. Late in April, the yield briefly topped 3%. ""That offered investors increasingly decent income with lower risk (than stocks), so it drew investor money away from equities,"" Aguilar said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFear of a trade war also contributed to stocks' downward volatility. ""But that fear was greater in March,"" Aguilar said.In addition, many investors were concerned that the U.S. economy isn't growing fast enough. First-quarter GDP growth was 2.3%, slowest in a year. Yet that beat the widely forecast expectation of 2%.""Corporate earnings, stock valuations, overall economic growth — all ended up being positive,"" Aguilar said. ""And we're still just in the early stages of seeing benefits from fiscal stimulus. But all of those positives were clouded by high yields in fixed income.""World equity funds' slim 0.12% advance lagged the modest gain by U.S. diversified stock funds. Yet that was an improvement on their 0.85% loss in March. India region funds' 3.06% April gain led foreign stock fund categories.Natural resources funds paced sectors, gaining 8.58% last month, fueled by the uptrend in oil prices.Taxable bonds funds, many of them filled with older bonds, were hurt by climbing rates on average. Treasury funds fell 1.37%. High-yield funds were among the few categories to gain ground, rising 0.44%.Tax-exempt bond funds also retreated.Going forward, Aguilar likes companies that are investing in innovative products and ideas. ""Consumer discretionary, technology and health care are sectors where you find many companies like that,"" he said.Take a look at $10.4 billion Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth Fund (POAGX), a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Seven of the fund's top 10 stocks as of Dec. 31 were either tech or health care names.Among Odyssey's tech names: memory-chip maker Micron Technology ()

160,SCHW,"The premise for this Retirement Planning Guide 2018 is straightforward. Plan for a retirement that lets you do what you want, when you want. That might entail not working at all, working less in the same field or striking out in a whole new dream career.But how do you go about it? And perhaps most important, how can you afford your dream?The short answer is start early and save heavily. While you're saving and investing, come up with a comprehensive plan that will carry you to a comfortable retirement, whichever form it takes.IBD's Retirement Planning Guide 2018 helps you answer those questions in more detail. Stories in this retirement planning guide cover such issues as how to create the best retirement plan. You'll also find an estate planning checklist and coverage of the best places to retire, working after retirement and how to deal with Social Security.""Many articles advise, now that you're retired, you should do something exciting,"" said Natalie Choate, an attorney with the Boston law firm Nutter McClennen & Fish. You should get out of your comfort zone by skydiving or buying a motorcycle or taking a jungle safari. Or so they say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChoate, whose classic book, ""Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits,"" is in its 7th Edition, has a different message and a different method. Before stepping out of that airplane, run through your estate planning checklist. These list items will include a will, living trust, power of attorney and advance health care directive.""Take a minute or a rainy weekend and do something boring,"" she said. ""Find and organize all your retirement plan records. You can save yourself and your heirs a lot of trouble (and money) just by doing some paperwork.""Such paperwork can indicate how far along you are in lining up the funds for your retirement. ""Retirees have more responsibility now,"" said IRA expert Ed Slott, founder of IRAhelp.com. ""In the past, more people had pensions. Now people have 401(k)s and IRAs, which they must manage to last for a long retirement.""Now that 401(k)s and IRAs have largely replaced traditional private-sector pensions, it's a new era when it comes to retirement.  And that takes new thinking. It's no longer automatic to plan to retire at 65, receive Medicare and Social Security benefits, and live on income from investment interest and dividends.In 2018, the retirement age spectrum stretches from the 40s to the 70s and even beyond. With so many opportunities, it all depends on how you want to shape your life.Never before have there been so many tools at your disposal to build a financially independent life, as early as you want. Retirement vehicles include 401(k)s and IRAs — both regular and Roth versions — annuities and separate accounts. You can get referrals or search online for a financial advisor to help you plan for retirement.Your employer's 401(k) plan likely offers education on how to get started, build up your savings and maintain your nest egg in these tax-advantaged accounts. Fund companies and award winning stock brokers like Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab (SCHW), T. Rowe Price (TROW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and TradeStation offer tons of educational material. Their associates offer various levels of assistance in opening accounts and setting up a financial plan.But it all begins with savvy retirement planning, and this Retirement Planning Guide 2018 has the information you'll need for a personalized notes-to-self memo.The actions you take today will have a critical, lasting impact on how you live in retirement. It starts with a plan and a knowledge of how to put that plan into action to achieve your financial goals.Smart investment planning underpins having enough money in retirement. Investing on a regular schedule, especially through automatic withdrawals into a tax-deferred retirement account such as a 401(k), can create an effective and effortless strategy to build up retirement savings.Today's investment scene presents some daunting challenges. Stocks are near record levels, raising fears that we could see a repeat of the retreats investors experienced in 2000 and 2008.Such pullbacks can put stocks ""on sale,"" as they have in the past, for investors with many years before retirement. Millennials — investors now in their 20s or 30s — might do especially well if they can overcome their fears (and their student loan debt) to stick with stocks.But people who are near or just starting retirement are at greater risk from a steep market pullback in the next year or two. Decades' worth of savings could be wiped out and never fully replaced, if they are drawing down their portfolio.Near and new retirees can avoid this risk by switching to cash, but yields are puny now. Taking a middle ground might be prudent.""During bull markets, like the one we have been experiencing, clients often forget the importance of holding fixed income in their portfolios,"" said certified financial planner Robert Westley, a vice president and wealth advisor at Northern Trust in New York. He added that retirees should have enough fixed income to support their spending needs for a number of years in the event of a market drop.An allocation to fixed income may help to keep retirees from having to sell equities at depressed values, so they can ride out a market downturn. ""Investors should utilize prudent asset location planning when determining where to hold their target equity and fixed income exposure,"" Westley said.""Asset location planning consists of considering the different tax characteristics of asset classes and the vehicles or accounts where they are held in order to gain a better after-tax rate of return,"" said Westley, who is a CPA/PFS and serves on the AICPA's Personal Financial Specialist Credential Committee. For example, corporate bonds and corporate bond funds that generate ordinary interest income are best held in a tax-deferred retirement account while municipal bond holdings that pay federally tax-free income work better in a taxable account.The more things change, the more they stay the same. That includes perennial worries about the future of Social Security.Meanwhile, the dependence of many retirees on Social Security also remains the same. With sub-3% yields on 10-year Treasury notes now, annual cash flow of, say, $25,000 from Social Security equals more retirement income than $800,000 of those Treasuries. With favorable taxation and inflation protection as well as lifetime payouts, Social Security still addresses key retiree concerns, so it's well worth the effort to keep up with tactics to boost benefits.What's more, the rules on mixing earned income with Social Security benefits have been eased. Our story about working after retirement shows you how to pick up extra income or pursue a dream career yet still get a full payout from Uncle Sam.For many people, retirement equals relocation. This special report's article on where to live after retirement explores what you need to know about where to call home, from staying put (familiar surroundings) to moving within the U.S. (retirement communities) to living abroad. These days, smart technology that uses sensors, cameras and Bluetooth is helping retirees keep their homes but at the same time increase their mobility.What's more, as Slott, a CPA in Rockville Centre, New York, put it, ""Taxes are the single biggest factor in how much you can spend in retirement."" The recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 increased the tax pressure to cross state lines for many retirees.Previously, taxpayers might have been able to deduct all of their state and local tax (SALT) from their income, on federal tax returns. Now SALT deductions are capped at $10,000 a year. This limit may cause many people, especially retirees who aren't work-bound to high-tax states, to go where they can reduce their SALT outflow.""The new tax law also affected IRAs,"" Slott said. The impact will be felt when people convert tax-deferred traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs, which eventually may deliver tax-free cash flow. The low tax rates in the new law can reduce the tax from such conversions.But Roth IRA conversions can't be undone, as they have in the past. ""The IRS recently explained that conversions from 2017 can be reversed, completely or partially, until this Oct. 15,"" said Slott. A reversal might make sense if the IRA owner doesn't want to pay the full amount of the tax, say, or if the account has lost value.""From now on, this type of recharacterization won't be allowed,"" Slott said. So Roth IRA conversions might be best implemented late in the year, when they may be calculated to qualify for a relatively low tax rate.The new tax law also increased the federal estate tax exemption to about $11 million. Thus, fewer retirees will have less to worry about in estate tax planning.That said, this special report's estate planning checklist story goes over what documents you need in order to make your assets transfer as intended.Attorney Choate urges retirees to make sure retirement plan and other beneficiary designations are up to date. ""Review them with your estate planning lawyer and make sure you and the plan administrator agree on who is the beneficiary,"" she said.Your assets generally will flow to the beneficiary of record, even if your will says otherwise.Therefore, this Retirement Planning Guide 2018 offers a powerful lineup that can help you make a smooth transition from workforce to work-free or work less.There's also an article describing what IBD's CAN SLIM investment program can do for your retirement account before and after you retire. And check out the Q&A with prominent financial advice expert Ric Edelman.From start to finish, this special report will help you create and maintain a financial plan that can help to ensure your financial success, even after the paychecks stop.RELATED:Are Stocks Going Up?

Morgan Stanley (MS) climbed 1.8%, also still within buy range of a cup-with-handle base with a 48.59 buy point.Two bank breakouts included Northern Trust (NTRS), up 2%, and SunTrust Banks (STI), up 3.15%.Charles Schwab climbed 2.7% to 48.42. Schwab is just within range of a 46.31 buy point of a flat base cleared on Tuesday. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) climbed 1.7%, now extended.Several factors appeared to be driving the rally in financials.The GOP's tax-cut plan on Tuesday cleared the Senate Budget Committee along party lines, moving the bill closer to a full vote in the chamber. A full Senate vote could come this week.The bill, which would slash the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, is likely to contain a tax-raising mechanism that would kick in if the benefits from the tax cuts don't pan out as expected, easing concerns about the debt.But other GOP lawmakers are opposed to that mechanism. The Senate bill also still needs to be fused together with the House's.Jerome Powell, who President Trump has chosen to succeed Janet Yellen as head the Federal Reserve, said at his confirmation hearing Tuesday that ""the case for raising interest rates at our next meeting is coming together"" while also stressing that he sees no sign of economic ""overheating."" The next policy meeting takes place on Dec. 12-13.When the Fed raises the rate on overnight loans that banks make to each other to meet financial quotas, banks pass the higher costs on to consumers, often through raising rates on their own loans. The higher rates help improve banks' financial results.Meanwhile, Powell hinted that he favors relief on financial rules. While not a surprise, the combination of steady of monetary policy and regulatory relief is positive for banks.The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose Wednesday. That rate also influences the rates on credit that banks offer to their customers.Wall Street has been concerned about the flattening of the yield curve, a gauge of inflation expectations that tracks the difference between short-term and long-term government debt. Earlier this month, the gap between the short end and long end of that curve was at its narrowest in a decade, raising concerns about a weaker economy. The yield spread widened slightly on Wednesday.The short end of that curve has crept up as the Fed raises rates. When Wall Street expects the economy to be stronger in the years ahead, the long end of the curve rises, as future economic growth raises prices and investors demand a greater return on their bonds to make up for the declining buying power of the dollar.Rising yields were definitely a factor Wednesday. Dow financials JPMorgan, Goldman and American Express (AXP) rallied, but Visa (V) fell sharply. Visa doesn't hold credit balances, so higher rates don't offer a benefit.The U.K. and the EU are reportedly coming closer to agreeing on what the island nation will pay to get out of the bloc. The payment could run into the tens of billions of euros, according to CNN. The pound jumped on the breakthrough, which mean the U.K. and EU can now address their post-divorce trading and regulatory relationships.The pound tanked last year after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. Concerns were also raised about U.S. banks that use London as a launchpad into the rest of Europe to do business.Wall Street is dumping highflying tech stocks on Wednesday, from Netflix (NFLX) to Lam Research (LRCX) to Chinese internets.

168,SCHW,"With a portfolio featuring leading stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as of Dec. 31, $1.9 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) is going strong after having outperformed both its Morningstar large-cap blend category and the S&P 500 in four of the six most recent full quarters.Its 0.79% gain so far this year going into Thursday — after the market's recent volatility — is also ahead of the big-cap bogey and its peer group.X The fund owes its portfolio firepower to a double-barreled management approach. The fund is run by two groups of managers, who work independently of each other. That doubles their opportunities to generate investment ideas. One group consists of subadvisors Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, who focus on value-oriented stocks for the fund. The second team works for USAA Asset Management, and they focus on growth stocks.""Using two managers with different approaches can potentially provide more consistent returns over the long term,"" said USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the teams running the two sleeves.Currently, Barrow Hanley runs about 40% of fund assets, with the balance run by the USAA team. Parent firm USAA maintains that ratio by allocating new inflows.Although the Barrow Hanley team's mandate is to focus on value stocks, their portfolio sleeve still includes leaders like E-Trade and UnitedHealth, which happen to have several traits of top-notch growth names, such as IBD Composite Ratings of 99 and 94 as well as SMR Ratings of A and B respectively.Amazon and Schwab are in the fund's growth sleeve. Amazon sports a red-hot 99% three-year annual earnings per share growth rate. Its three-year sales growth rate is 26%.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with news and analysis of Amazon at IBD's web page devoted to the e-commerce and cloud-computing colossus.Schwab's three-year annual EPS growth rate is 22%. Its EPS is expected to grow 45% this year.And if ups and downs in the stock market today presage additional volatility in the near term, the fund's blended approach should serve it well, says Mark Giambrone, head of the Barrow Hanley team. The value sleeve has ""traditionally outperformed (the overall market) during weaker periods in the market,"" Giambrone said.Still, Giambrone blames recent market volatility on program-trading by index funds. Fundamentals are still sound, in his view. ""We have a positive economic backdrop for corporate earnings and cash flows and consumer confidence and spending,"" he said.E-Trade shares are up 46% in the past 12 months. Giambrone's sleeve has owned E-Trade for several years. As a value investor, he seeks to buy stocks when temporary ills have dropped their share prices. He bought his current E-Trade stake when it was trading below book value due to investors' concerns about its portfolio of home-equity loans, he says.Those loan woes have been cleared up, he says. ""They're garnering market share,"" he said. ""They're benefiting from rising rates (which allows its net interest margin to expand on clients' cash in its custody). And we expect consolidation among online brokerage firms.""Dow Jones industrial giant UnitedHealth is the Giambrone sleeve's largest nonbank position. He sees the firm as a health care technology and services provider. Half of its earnings, he says, come from its Optum unit, which provides pharmacy benefits management and technology services and also runs clinics and doctors' offices.Optum's data cache enables UnitedHealth to lower its own costs and its charges to customers. ""Optum is an incredible growth engine and differentiator for UNH,"" Giambrone said. ""It helps current healthcare clients and non-healthcare clients lower cost trends through technological advances. It is a key driver of the investment thesis.""Overall, UnitedHealth has great cash flow and a reasonable valuation. ""It's mostly a U.S. business, so it's helped by recent tax law changes, which can help raise its earnings,"" Giambrone said.Giambrone also likes Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL). Shares in the multi-cruiseline operator are up about 35% in the past 12 months.Royal Caribbean should benefit from expansion of destinations and markets in China and Cuba, Giambrone says. At the same time, industrywide supply of ships shows only modest growth. Giambrone says earnings should grow for years.He added, ""The company has not benefited from tax reform. But once the market settles and focuses on long-term benefits (of tax reform) rather than short-term reform, the company will benefit meaningfully.""Giambrone says regional bank KeyCorp (KEY) benefits from healthy loan growth. ""Credit (risk) is fairly stable, and tax reform will have a big positive impact on the bank,"" he added. KeyCorp's 2016 acquisition of First Niagara should provide economies of scale, he says.He added, ""We think the regulatory environment should get better for banks. The 'SIFIs' threshold may rise to $250 billion, which would make it easier for them to expand.""SIFIs threshold refers to the asset level at which banks are deemed systemically important financial institutions, triggering much stricter oversight, including higher capital buffers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

169,SCHW,"For years, independent advisors often marketed themselves as fiduciaries — emphasizing their commitment to work in the client's best interest. That message resonated with consumers.X Today, however, large financial services companies such as Vanguard and Charles Schwab (SCHW) label themselves fiduciaries as well. So how do advisors who run small practices continue to differentiate themselves?In a world where many big securities brokerage firms hype their status as fiduciaries, advisors are left rethinking their marketing strategy. Their options include specializing in underserved niches, lowering their fees and harnessing the latest tech tools to engage clients in new ways.""It's still important to be a fiduciary,"" said Minna Burns, director of marketing at the Carson Group, an advisory firm in Omaha, Neb. ""But I don't think it's as much of a differentiator. Advisors have a real opportunity to differentiate themselves by explaining the value they bring to the client and to personalize their message to appeal to their demographic target.""To attract younger investors who are just starting to accumulate wealth, some advisors are investing in technology that brings clients closer to their money. Examples include providing online portals for clients to open new accounts, track their assets, rebalance their portfolio and analyze their projected financial performance under a range of planning scenarios.Burns, whose firm partners with advisors to offer marketing services, coaching and other services, says that millennials — those born in the 1980s and 1990s — expect customized features and resources that help them understand and monitor their personal finances. Advisors who produce a steady stream of rich social media content can also stand apart.The big players — giant financial services companies — are unveiling tech platforms to meet the needs of different market segments. But advisors who operate on a smaller scale can differentiate themselves by pursuing more defined niches.Todd Sensing, a certified financial planner in Miramar Beach, Fla., launched his firm in 2016 with a focus on serving families with special needs. The father of two sons on the autism spectrum, he applies his personal experience to help other parents facing similar challenges.""My niche is one of my key differentiators beyond my fiduciary status,"" he said. ""To stand out in a world full of options, you must be able to provide a compelling argument whether it be your knowledge, pricing or something else.""Marketing becomes easier if you can set yourself apart with your credentials, life experience and specialized focus. That way, you need not rely on your role as a fiduciary as the primary way to differentiate your business.Sensing notes that there are not many certified financial planners who are also chartered financial analysts who specialize in special needs planning for families. He further differentiates himself by highlighting his own experience raising two children with special needs.""My case is not the norm but does highlight the added advantage of developing a niche business,"" he said. ""You could say I speak both the language of autism and finance and often act as the interpreter for families who need both.""Even for those advisors who uncover a relatively untapped niche, that may not be enough to win over cost-conscious clients. With a growing number of robo platforms competing to deliver planning services with fees dropping to nearly zero in some cases, human advisors are rethinking their traditional business model.As robo advisors have proliferated in recent years, many human advisors have tried to maintain their customary charge of 1% of assets under management (perhaps discounting their rate for their largest accounts). But they are finding that's harder to do in the current competitive environment.Some advisors with small practices are dropping their fees so that they're roughly in the same ballpark as automated rivals such as Betterment and Wealthfront, as well as Vanguard and other large companies entering the space. These independent planners have lowered their fees by 15% or more.Advisors who operate on a small scale wield an advantage in that they're closer to their customers and understand their needs. Investors in certain regions or demographic groups may grapple with specific concerns.If your target market consists of young professionals with heavy student debt loads, for instance, you can offer short, explanatory videos on your firm's website to educate them about paying off their loans. You can also dangle free, downloadable checklists, diagnostic tests and other resources to help them manage household debt.""Advisors have a tendency to treat their website as a brochure of their firm,"" Burns said. ""But the best websites give clients the information they want and are looking for. Website content should be client-driven, not advisor-driven.""RELATED:Do Clients Ask You To Predict Bitcoin's Future? Try This InsteadWhat Money Managers Expect The Stock Market To Do In 2018

172,SCHW,"E-Trade Financial (ETFC) announced Thursday that it will cut the base stock and ETF commission to $6.95 per trade, down from $9.99, the latest in a series of big price reductions this week sparked by Fidelity and quickly followed by Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).E-Trade will cut its standard rate as of March 13. It will also create a lower-priced $4.95 tier for investors who trade at least 30 times per quarter, down from a prior active investor standard of 150 trades per quarter.Fidelity Investments on Tuesday cut its stock and ETF trading commission by 38%, to $4.95, its first reduction in seven years. That was in response to Charles Schwab's Feb. 3 move to reduce its base rate to $6.95 from $8.95.Schwab didn't take long to respond to Fidelity, announcing Tuesday that it would match the $4.95 rate, effective March 3.Tuesday night, TD Ameritrade joined in, cutting its base rate to $6.95 from $9.99, effective March 6.IBD'S TAKE: There's more to choosing a broker than the lowest cost. IBD's Best Online Stock Brokers survey can help investors find the best broker for their trading needs.That made an E-Trade response almost inevitable.In about a month, the trading fee price range from the big online brokers has tumbled from about $8-10 to $5-$7.Fidelity and Schwab are more diversified than their more pure-play rivals, making them less exposed to reduced margins on stock trading.E-Trade fell 3.2% to 35.03 on the stock market today, again falling below its 50-day line. The stock tumbled 7.2% on Tuesday, rebounding 4.9% on Wednesday.Charles Schwab declined 1.8% to 42.22 after hitting a 17-year  high on Wednesday.

173,SCHW,"Health care coverage is in constant flux, but one thing that remains steady is the rising cost of medical care. As a result, both individuals and employers are seeking a flexible and tax-efficient way to manage their health care costs.One instrument: Health savings accounts, which let consumers set aside tax-free money to use for allowable medical expenses and investment, while gaining an additional way to save for retirement.Finding the best HSA account for your needs can be a challenge. Out of hundreds of HSA providers, we've compiled a list of the Investor's Business Daily Best HSAs based on criteria such as the fees they charge, the available tools to pay for medical expenses, and the investment options they provide for investors. Companies on the list of the best HSA providers cater to both employers and individuals, except for Fidelity Investments, which specifically targets large employers with more than 2,000 eligible employees.Keep in mind that picking an HSA provider is not just for employers, the self-employed or retirees. Individuals can choose their own HSA administrator even if a plan is offered at work.The nine Best HSA administrators, not ranked in any order, are:• HSA Bank
"
174,SCHW,"• HealthSavings Administrators
"
175,SCHW,"• Avidia Bank
"
176,SCHW,"• Optum Bank
"
177,SCHW,"• Bank of America

178,SCHW,"• HealthEquity
"
179,SCHW,"• Fidelity Investments
"
180,SCHW,"• SelectAccount
"
181,SCHW,"• Saturna Brokerage ServicesBesides the overall list, we highlight the Best HSAs in three categories: low fees, investment options and flexible account access.The companies were selected by IBD editors based on their account features, benefit consultants' input as well as customer reviews and ratings of the HSA providers' service and product offerings.""Various HSA providers have different value propositions,"" said Jon Robb, senior vice president at Devenir, an HSA research firm. It's important for HSA account holders to know how they want to use a health savings account. ""Some account holders are really focused on using this as a retirement vehicle, so they're really focused on investment options and the fees around investments. And maybe they don't really care about how easy it is to withdraw money from their account or what the interest rates are.""The other category is comprised of account holders who use their HSA for medical expenses and slowly accumulate their dollars, ""so they tend to be more focused on the monthly maintenance fees and looking at their interest rates,"" he added.When looking at fees, Robb points to three categories of providers: those that charge no fee but don't have too many HSA features, such as online access, investment options or even CDs. Usually they cater to a particular market and tend to be credit unions or community banks.A second category includes providers that charge some fees and provide a variety of options. Finally, there are those that have various levels of accounts and types of investment options.One top pick among low-fee providers is Avidia Health, a division of Avidia Bank, a bank in Hudson, Mass. Despite it originating in a community bank, Avidia Health operates and has accounts in all 50 states.For someone looking for a no-fee HSA provider that still offers various features, Avidia is it. It has a $0 setup fee, no monthly service fees, no online transaction fees, a no-fee online bill pay feature and a no-transaction-fee debit card. The account holder also benefits from free checks, a debit card, mobile app and a new, no-fee eClaims Manager feature, which enables the account holder to link his or her health insurance to the online HSA.""Once you reach $1,000 in the account, you have the option to be able to invest,"" said Lynda Westbrook, Avidia Bank's vice president of health care solutions. Avidia uses the Devenir investment platform and offers 13 mutual funds for self-directed management of the account. The only fee that comes into play is a pass-through fee of $2.50 that Devenir charges for the use of its portal. That fee is waived when the balance is $3,000 or greater.Investments take up ""less than 10% of a portfolio, and that's industrywide,"" said Westbrook. ""I think that is going to change if legislation changes and they allow (people) to put more money in. ... Younger people are the ones who are asking more for the investments, because they realize that between this and the 401(k), that's all they're going to have when they retire. There may be not be Social Security.""Some large, well-known financial institutions recently exited the health savings account business, mainly because the profit potential isn't big enough compared to their other businesses. But the potential for growth in HSAs has kept giants Fidelity Investments and Bank of America (BAC) in the game.Fidelity's HSA offering has no monthly fees and gives access to the full array of investment options available to its regular clients. In addition, account holders get access to all the third-party research available through online access to their HSA accounts.Recently, Fidelity lowered its commissions to $4.95 per trade. Account holders can use bill pay, a debit card or a check to pay for their medical expenses, just like a regular Fidelity client. And while its HSA offering is only available to large employers, Fidelity plans to expand this offering to individuals in the coming years.""One of the distinctions is that there's often two different accounts: a bank account for liquid HSA assets and then maybe a brokerage or some other type of account for invested assets. And our account is one,"" said Eric Dowley, senior vice president of HSA product management at Fidelity Investments.Optum Bank, which is part of UnitedHealth Group, holds over $7 billion in assets, and its fees are low. It gives investors a choice among 26 mutual names from companies such as Vanguard, Pisco, Oppenheimer (OPY), T. Rowe Price, American Funds, BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity. All funds either have no load or their load is waived.Another low-cost option: HealthEquity (HQY) is among the largest administrators with 2.7 million account holders and $5 billion in assets. Members can choose from 26 mutual funds. There's a $3.95 monthly maintenance fee but no trading fee.""Often, some of the investment lineups offered by other providers are certainly more limited, but also often can have higher-expense investments, and in the long run that can erode the performance. If that's the boat that you're in, in terms of investing for the long run, I would pay attention to what those fees are with the investments and if there's a fee even to get invested, which I know exists with some providers,"" Dowley said.Indeed, not everyone is in an HSA to pay for current medical expenses. Those accounts are more and more used as an addition to people's 401(k) plans, to save on a tax-free basis for medical expenses at retirement — or even add to their retirement assets. In those cases, they may not care about how easy it is to withdraw money from the account or what interest they can earn on lower-balance thresholds.A popular choice among investors is Saturna Brokerage Services. Its offerings include nearly all mutual funds and ETFs. Investors have access to Saturna's proprietary mutual funds — Amana, Sextant, Saturna Sustainable — for which it is the advisor. Saturna also offers access to stocks, bonds and a wide variety of non-Saturna affiliated funds.Trading fees are higher than other providers — $14.95 per online trade and $25 per broker-assisted trade. But if, say, you plan to make a single transaction yearly to transfer funds from your employer-based HSA to your individual account where you might have better investment options, Saturna could be a good pick.If you plan to make many trades a year, try another provider like HSA Bank, SelectAccount,  Fidelity or HealthSavings Administrators.HSA Bank, owned by Northeast regional banking company Webster Financial (WBS), is an industry veteran, holding more than $5 billion in assets. It offers many investment options, but charges monthly and yearly maintenance fees. Account holders can trade mutual funds and other securities via various platforms, including TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Devenir's self-directed mutual fund program.SelectAccount, whose custodian MII Life is a subsidiary of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, offers a self-directed brokerage account with Charles Schwab (SCHW) for account holders who have more than $10,000 in an investment account. It charges $4.95 per online trade.Another provider with a wide variety of investment options is Fidelity, with more than 5,000 instruments, including stocks, bonds, ETFs and mutual funds.HealthSavings Administrators is a smaller firm, with about $500 million in assets. But it has been around since the beginning and has a huge selection of investment options via companies such as Vanguard, Dimensional, Franklin Templeton Investments, T. Rowe Price and others. However, the accounts charge fees.Unlike many smaller providers, Bank of America has a nationwide network of branches, should you need to walk in and actually speak to someone about your HSA. Also, while it does not offer checking services for HSAs, you can get to your money through online banking and a debit card.Fidelity also provides wide access through the use of a debit card, checking, electronic funds transfer and online banking.

183,SCHW,"The online brokerage industry's price war escalated into a full-scale shoot-out on Tuesday. In the morning, just as Fidelity Investments' new, lower, base online retail commission for U.S. stock and ETF trades took effect, Charles Schwab (SCHW) blasted back at the Boston-based behemoth by matching its revised $4.95 commission.Tuesday night, TD Ameritrade (AMTD) jumped into the slugfest, hitting back with a new $6.95 base price per trade, which will replace its current $9.99 fee on March 6.Fidelity had started the day by responding to Schwab's Feb. 3 price cut. Fidelity, which lays claim to the mantle of largest online brokerage firm with its 17.9 million accounts and $1.7 trillion in total brokerage client assets, had slashed its commissions by $3 per-trade reduction, or 38%. It was Fidelity's first commission cut in 7 years.Charles Schwab cut its base online equity and ETF trade commission to $6.95 from $8.95 on Feb. 3. Schwab's Tuesday cut lopped $2, or 29%, off its less-than-one-month-old base commission. Schwab also responded to Fidelity's new options price with a lower fee of $4.95 plus $0.65 per contract. All of Schwab's new prices take effect March 3. Fidelity's took effect Tuesday.Fidelity's move Tuesday had briefly made its commissions lower than Schwab's. It also fell far below the $9.99 base commission charged by E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and, for a few more days, TD Ameritrade.Charles Schwab shares rebounded 5.6% in afternoon trade on the stock market today, after sinking 3.2% on Tuesday. TD Ameritrade rose 3.5% after crashing 10.5% Tuesday. E-Trade, which has yet to join the price cuts, rose 4.1% after skidding 7.2% Tuesday. Both Ameritrade and E-Trade sold off on Schwab's initial Feb. 3 fee cut.Fidelity is privately held.Smaller brokerages TradeKing and OptionsHouse also levy $4.95 base commissions. Interactive Brokers' (IBKR) base rate is $1 per share, falling to 0.5 cent per share for large enough trades. An account balance of at least $10,000 is required.Interactive Brokers stock climbed 4.1% intraday, more than offsetting Tuesday's 2.6% loss.IBD'S TAKE: There's more to choosing a broker than the lowest cost. IBD's Best Online Stock Brokers survey can help investors find the best broker for their trading needs.Fidelity also boasted that its online options prices and margin rates were the lowest of the four biggest online brokerages — itself, TD Ameritrade, Schwab and E-Trade.In addition, Fidelity claimed an average $10.79 price improvement in comparison with an industry average of $1.71. Price improvement reflects the difference between the maximum price a buyer says he will pay and the actual asked price that the broker obtains. For sellers of securities, it means they got more than the bid price on average.Ram Subramaniam, president of Fidelity's retail brokerage business, told IBD that investors should consider its new low price in conjunction with Fidelity's overall services. ""We're committed to being the value leader,"" he said. ""We're committed to being the pricing leader, and to delivering the best client experience in terms of research, platform, innovation and transparency.""Fidelity, Schwab and Ameritrade have been in the top three online stock brokerages for overall customer experience three of the past four years.For Fidelity, 2017 is the third year in a row that the Boston-based firm took the top overall spot in IBD's annual Best Online Brokers survey. Impressively, Fidelity had the first- or second-highest customer rating in all 13 survey categories. What started as one of the leading mutual fund families has now become a force in online trading.Less than two weeks ago, Fidelity released its annual report, showing that 2016 revenue rose 3.4% to $15.9 billion, a record for the privately held company.The combination of revenue growth and slightly lower expenses produced a record profit of $3.5 billion. That was an increase of 19.5% over 2015's $3 billion in operating income.Jim Lowell, editor of the independent Fidelity Investor, said Tuesday, ""(Fidelity's) diversified business model . . . enables them to draw others into siloed price wars at the expense of their competitors' bottom lines while simultaneously creating more immediate top line opportunities and marketshare potential for Fidelity.""Fidelity, Schwab and TD Ameritrade also dropped prices on options trades.RELATED:Charles Schwab Slashes Stock, ETF Trading Fees; TD Ameritrade, E-Trade Hit

192,SCHW,"Your stocks to watch this week are four web-based platforms that are building base-on-base formations: Netflix (NFLX), Etsy (ETSY), E-Trade (ETFC) and Sina (SINA).X After breaking out of a cup-with-handle base in early October, Netflix is now working on a flat base with a 204.48 buy point. Shares are finding support at the key 50-day line as they build the pattern, though shares fell 0.6% to 194.60 in morning trade on the stock market today. Netflix is considered the leading streaming service, but faces stiff competition from the likes of Amazon (AMZN), Hulu and others.E-commerce powerhouse Amazon also is a serious rival to Etsy with the expansion of its Amazon Handmade platform in October. While Amazon is extended from buy range, Etsy is shaping a cup-with-handle base with a 17.70 entry point. The provider of handcrafted goods is up 1.3% to 17.24 on Monday, continuing Friday's rebound from support at its 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for more high-quality stocks to add to your watch list?

As for fellow online brokers Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD), Schwab is vying for a breakout while Ameritrade remains within the 5% buy zone after its Sept. 27 breakout.Chinese internet giant Sina is more than 10% below a 119.30 buy point from a flat base after losing 2% to 106.98 intraday Monday. Sina fell back below its 50-day moving average on Friday after retaking that support on Wednesday.

194,SCHW,"The stock market may be up, but Americans' confidence in their ability to afford a comfortable retirement is down in comparison to each of the past two years. That lack of confidence often stems from a lack of progress in building — or even starting — a retirement nest egg. But Yvette Butler, president of brokerage Capital One Investing, recommends three simple and practical steps to break any logjam that's keeping you from building your retirement savings.And the problem is real. More than one-third — 38% — of Americans don't feel confident that they are saving enough to retire comfortably, according to a new survey by Capital One Investing, a subsidiary of Capital One Financial (COF).That's two percentage points more than the portion who lacked confidence last year, according to the financial firm's latest Financial Freedom Survey. And it's a whopping 10 points more than the percentage who lacked confidence in 2015.One reason for the rising lack of confidence is that so few American adults who were surveyed have a longtime financial plan. Only 49% have a plan.To get out of the vicious cycles of not saving or not saving enough, Capital One Investing's Butler recommends steps that are small but effective. ""It's like losing weight,"" Butler said. ""You know what you need to do: exercise more and eat less. But it's hard to get started.""The key is to take easy initial steps that start your savings process, Butler says.""Think about your finances holistically,"" Butler added. ""Each part fits together.""One key to building a retirement account is to make the savings process as automatic as possible. And that's one of the beauties of a 401(k) account. The money is set aside for you. Once you start to participate, you don't have to think about it. It is done for you. Your employer's payroll department or processor diverts each of your contributions for you. And you get a tax deduction with each regular contribution.And how should you choose the investments in your account? If you're not interested in making your own investment decisions, consider using a target date fund.Target date funds are portfolios — usually made up of mutual funds — whose mix of securities like stocks, bonds and cash becomes more conservative as the target date (usually retirement) approaches. Run by professional money managers, they're especially helpful to people who have little if any investment skill. They've become increasingly popular as buy-and-hold investments for retirement accounts.Ninety percent of plans tracked by research firm Aon Hewitt offered target date funds as of 2015. That was up from 33% in 2005.IBD'S TAKE: If you're an experienced investor who owns a target-date fund in a retirement account, run its holdings through Stock Checkup. Some might rate highly enough to consider buying. Also see if any are a member of Leaderboard and ripe for buying.Another solution that's increasingly popular is to use a robo-advisor. That's an online service that selects an asset allocation for you based on factors like your age, your goals, your risk tolerance. Affluent investors are flocking to robo-advisory services offered by big mutual fund firms like Fidelity, Vanguard and Charles Schwab (SCHW).Butler bottom-lined her advice this way: ""The idea for investors is to start a process that puts the power of time and compounding to work for them, and once you start the process to make it as automatic as possible.""Once retirement plans are started and start to grow, investors gain confidence that they're on the right track and any gobbledygook terms start to make sense.Fifty-one percent of Americans fear that they lack enough knowledge and experience to invest in an IRA, the study showed. Also, 49% say they don't trust the markets and the financial industry. Forty-five percent complain about lack of pricing transparency. And 42% cite the complexity of investing as the reason they don't save enough.Americans want to improve their retirement readiness, but many fall short.Thirty-nine percent of the nonretired people polled said they believe they should contribute 15% of more of their income to retirement savings each year. But only 13% are doing so, and that's two percentage points lower than last year.More than half — 52% — of nonretired people are socking away 15% or less each year. And 32% do not save anything.In addition, only 55% of millennials use a retirement account like a 401(k) at work, even though 71% of all working Americans have access to one. Participation rates are much higher among older workers, with 83% of Gen Xers contributing to a workplace plan and 80% of baby boomers doing so.RELATED:Here's How 40% Of 401(k) Plan Members Build Larger-Than-Average Account BalancesThe Big Retirement Savings Mistake That Workers Should Stop Making

195,SCHW,"Staying on top is harder than getting there, if only because everyone is gunning for the No. 1 slot and trying to co-opt what the leader does right.But for the fifth year in a row, Charles Schwab (SCHW) clients gave the firm the highest score for customer service in the IBD Best Online Brokers survey. Schwab also had the highest share of customers in the ""very satisfied"" category for the fifth year in a row and had the highest rating for website performance for the second consecutive year.Schwab moved Thursday to endear itself to clients a bit more, announcing it will slash its standard commission on stocks and exchange traded funds from $8.95 to $6.95, effective Feb. 3. Also, expenses for index mutual funds will be lowered beginning March 1, and investment minimums will be eliminated for these funds. Additional details were outlined in a Schwab news release on the commission cut.Brian McDonald, senior vice president of service and support, says customer service is ""the biggest part of the culture"" at Schwab.""Everything we do starts with: 'See through the client's eyes,' "" McDonald said in a phone interview with IBD.While the motto might sound like something most companies would pay lip service to, Schwab has walked the walk from the company's beginnings.""Our primary audience is the individual investors,"" McDonald said.The rankings are based on a major annual survey by Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence in which thousands of investors evaluate how well their own brokers measure up in 13 critical performance areas. The best brokers overall are determined based on their ratings across all of the categories.Schwab has placed as one of the top two brokers in Overall Customer Experience in all five years of the study.Schwab also ranked in the top three this year in 11 of the 13 performance categories, including the highest ratings in four of them.Forty or 50 years ago, Wall Street brokerages played a crony-capitalism game that favored the big players and the brokerages themselves. The idea that the individual investor mattered was laughable.But when the Securities and Exchange Commission deregulated the brokerage industry in May 1975, Charles R. Schwab grabbed the opportunity. Schwab developed and popularized the discount brokerage, making himself a hated man on Wall Street.Schwab unleashed a trend that accelerated. With the latest cut in commissions to $6.95, Schwab has now undercut many of its major rivals, including Fidelity, TD Ameritrade (AMTD), E-Trade (ETFC) and Vanguard. In stock market trading Thursday, online broker shares fell sharply on the potential for a price war. The stocks recouped some of  their losses early Friday.Low fees was one area where Schwab was not in the top three in the IBD-TIPP survey. The action to cut fees improves Schwab's position.Another critical area is trade reliability, one of the categories where Schwab received the highest rating in the IBD-TechnoMetrica survey.Many companies nowadays try to do customer service on the cheap, which seldom works out. Nearly every consumer can tell a frustrating story about dealing with an outsourced customer service department in a foreign country.Schwab avoids that problem by providing multilingual international services including Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese and Spanish, and by not outsourcing U.S. customer service.""Our approach is that we want to have a great deal of control on the service experience,"" McDonald said. The goal at Schwab is to build a team of ""financial service professionals,"" he said. Passion and integrity is what Schwab looks for and works to develop in the team.The website is another area where many a company can fumble. This is another area where Schwab wins a top score from its clients.""We focus on simple, intuitive, powerful research — up and running,"" McDonald said.The Keynote Brokerage Performance Index confirms IBD's findings. Keynote measures how well and how fast an online transaction is handled. In the week ended Jan. 8, for example, Schwab was No. 1 among brokerages with a total response time of 4.26 seconds.Schwab clients also gave it especially high marks in ETF choices. Bloomberg recently noted Charles Schwab has lured more than $10 billion to its exchange traded funds this year. Five years ago, Schwab wasn't even in the top 10 of ETF managers by assets. Now it's ranked fifth, with $54 billion in its 21 ETFs.Today Schwab is a more far-reaching company than it was in the 1970s. Services offered now include financial consulting, retirement tools, helping clients find an independent advisor, assistance for employers, and even instruction on becoming a Schwab franchisee.A version of this story was published Jan. 30, 2017.RELATED:Charles Schwab Top Ranked In Customer ServiceMillennial Investors Seek Sophistication From Online Brokers -- ReallyThe Only Thing Investors Have To Fear Is No Fear Itself

197,SCHW,"Many investors began to drool over the energy and financial sectors after the November elections. The prospect of lower corporate tax rates and less restrictive regulatory yokes was a big reason. But Larry Puglia, manager of $34.2 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX), began to place a lot of new bets on the technology sector.That's despite the fact that the tech sector stands to benefit less from changes in corporate taxes. Many tech companies already have less-than-peak rates, Puglia says. In addition, tech industry leaders worry that President Trump's immigration policies could deprive them of skilled workers. Also, investors feared there was friction between President Trump and Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, over the newspaper's campaign coverage.But Puglia feels the benefit to corporations — including many tech companies — of repatriation of bank accounts stuffed with cash has been overlooked somewhat. And Puglia thinks the likelihood of antagonism between the tech sector and the White House is overblown. ""We do not think that would happen to a great degree,"" Puglia said.Puglia's warm outlook for tech is reflected in the fund's most recently disclosed top-10 additions in the past six months. They included not only banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), but also techies Microsoft (MSFT), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Alibaba Group (BABA), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Priceline (PCLN) and Facebook (FB).Fast-food restaurant operator Yum Brands (YUM) was another top-10 addition. And the fund began a new position in brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW) that was large enough to also enter its top 10.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump agenda continues to steer the stock market, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture every day to find highly rated stocks and sectors poised to move higher.Puglia's moves are worth watching. Going into Thursday, his fund's 14.64% average annual gain over the prior five years outperformed 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500's 14% pace also trailed. He's in the top 84% year to date, which marks a rebound from 2016's modest 0.98% gain.JPMorgan shot higher shortly before Election Day. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 1%, 20% and 20% in the past three stanzas. Like other banks, JPMorgan benefits from investors' expectations that this corner of financial services will face a lighter regulatory burden than it would have under a Democratic-held White House or Congress. In addition, banks are expected to carve out wider net margins as interest rates increase. They are not expected to raise interest paid to depositors by much if any, yet they will be able to charge more for loans.Microsoft is well-positioned to keep on generating strong growth in its Office 365 suite of products, Puglia says. He also likes the outlook for its corporate cloud operations and Azure, its public cloud-computing platform.Chipmaker NXP is a leading provider of semiconductor solutions used in automotive connectivity and infotainment, he says. NXP's chips are also used in smartphone near-field communications payment applications. On Tuesday, Qualcomm (QCOM) extended its takeover bid for NXP until April 4.Alibaba offers consumer-to-consumer e-commerce services through its Taobao business and it runs T-Mall, a business-to-consumer platform. Both have dominant market share, Puglia says. Alibaba is also a leader in cloud processing services. The Chinese government is a key customer. Trading around 103 as of early Thursday, shares are below a 104.67 cup-with-handle entry.Money-transfer services provider PayPal has a five-year earnings annual growth rate of 25%. And it has reached deals with Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) that are mutually beneficial, Puglia says. Many investors had feared a more adversarial competition among the three companies. And Puglia likes PayPal's Venmo, Braintree and One Touch services.Trading around 43, shares are still trading just under a 43.17 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. EPS grew 9%, 13% and 17% in the past three quarters.Priceline gapped up nearly 6% on Feb. 28, a day after reporting a 32% increase in fourth-quarter EPS. Its top line grew 17% to $2.34 billion. Both earnings and revenue topped the company's own guidance. Hotel bookings have been the stock's largest growth driver. Airline ticket sales fell. That's despite steadily low oil prices, which have helped keep airfares down. The company's EPS grew 12%, 23% and 32% the past three quarters.Facebook shares are up 20% this year. Investors have begun to appreciate how well the company's advertising products, video strategy and Instagram photo sharing are being received, Puglia says. He adds that its investment in WhatsApp and Messenger also provides solid positioning in the messaging market, which is growing in popularity. ""We especially like the company's efforts to promote the use of video on its platform and to better monetize Instagram and video,"" he said.Facebook reportedly made the launch of its Facebook Live video service a priority last year. But enough users have posted videos of violence and crime to make at least some advertisers wary of the platform, according to CNBC.com. Facebook also has been hit with measurement controversies.Yum shares rose 9% this year through Feb. 13 to a 52-week high, but they've pulled back 7% since then. That has left them a scant 3% above where they were when Yum spun off its China division last Oct. 31. After EPS grew 44% for three quarters in a row, EPS grew 18% in Q4.Schwab has done a nice job of growing customer assets under management, Puglia wrote to shareholders on Dec. 31. ""Its earnings should benefit substantially from rising interest rates,"" Puglia added. ""This is enhanced by the fact that Schwab has a significant bank embedded within the company. That enables it to sweep brokerage deposits into the bank, creating more net interest income.""Rain fell on Schwab's parade recently when it got caught up in a pricing war with Fidelity Investments and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) over brokerage commissions. But Puglia says Schwab is far less dependent on commissions than TD Ameritrade is.RELATED:12 Blue-Chip Beauties That This Top Money Manager Likes NowDoes Your Mutual Fund Manager Have Skin In The Game?

198,SCHW,"Even the self-directed investor needs help sometimes.Just look at the results of Investor's Business Daily's 2017 Best Of Online Brokers report if you want proof. It shows customer service as No. 5 in importance to investors out of 24 attributes. It seems the adage is true that the more things change, the more they stay the same.Twenty years ago, online brokerage was a nascent industry. Charles Schwab (SCHW) was one of the pioneers, launching its service in 1996. The idea that middle-class investors could trade with frequency quickly caught fire, as Schwab reached the 2 million mark for online accounts within two years.But while people settled into the idea of bypassing humans when doing stock trades — made much more palatable when it meant paying much less in commissions — they've always needed customer service. Even though the self-directed investor might not want the full-service treatment for strategy or stock selection, they still appreciate having a live human as a backstop. In the end, they want to know where to get answers.In 2005, Schwab launched an ad campaign that often featured an individual investor contrasting what they wanted from their broker vs. what they were getting. The ads all ended with the tagline ""Talk To Chuck.""Schwab's extending of that hand to the perplexed online investor, and understanding his or her needs, no doubt played a role in its earning the highest rating for customer service in IBD's online brokers report, a position it's held for five consecutive years. Also in the top three brokerages in customer service were Fidelity and Scottrade.Here's how the best broker survey worked: Each broker was given a Customer Experience Index based on survey responses. The index totaled the percentage of ""excellent"" and ""very good"" ratings and subtracted the total percentage of ""fair"" and ""poor"" ratings. In customer service, 85% responded that Schwab was either excellent or very good while only 4% rated it fair or poor, thus giving it the 81 score.Clicking the ""Contact Us"" button on most websites is how to find out the ways in which a company is willing to field your questions. In the case of Schwab, your four options are by phone, email, live chat or visiting a local branch office.At Schwab, speech recognition facilitates many account management inquiries and transactions through ""Schwab by Phone"" or even place trades through the Telebroker feature. If frustrated by the automation or requiring a little more finesse, saying ""representative"" gets you to a live person.Fidelity adds a virtual assistant to the mix that uses search engine technology to field questions.Scottrade boasts the most branches available for live visits, and also routes calls to local branches during business hours.Just how important is customer service in an increasingly automated stock market? The IBD survey found the only categories ranking above it were the usual suspects: trade reliability, lower commissions and trading fees, site performance and equity trading tools.Customer service was a close fifth, and right behind it were research tools and investment research.RELATED:Scwhab Keeps Its Grip On Multiple Top RatingsMillennial Investors Seek Sophistication From Online Brokers — ReallyThe Only Thing Investors Have To Fear Is No Fear ItselfTake A Look At Brokers' Best Investment & Retirement Planning Tools

199,SCHW,"It's rare when a war's fallout benefits the most vulnerable. But in the ETF world, where the ongoing war on fees seems to be accelerating, the primary beneficiaries may end up being investors themselves.XState Street Global Advisors announced Oct. 16 that it significantly lowered expense ratios on 15 of its SPDR ETFs and switched indexes on three of them from the Russell indexes to SSGA's proprietary ones.On the same day, TD Ameritrade (AMTD) expanded its offering of commission-free ETFs to 296 from 100, featuring eight leading ETF providers, including the SSGA launch. TD Ameritrade also removed Vanguard from the commission-free trading program. One of the biggest ETF providers, Vanguard doesn't pay brokers to list its products.Here's The List Of Top-Performing ETFsInnovator IBD 50 ETF Debuts At The TopQ&A With WisdomTree's Chief Investment Officer3 Ways To Navigate Bonds When Rates Rise""The asset management industry has been very competitive, and as players are gaining scale, I think it's natural to see some price competition,"" said Marco De Freitas, managing director and head of retail strategy, product and digital client experience at TD Ameritrade.These announcements come on the heels of similar actions undertaken, often in multiple rounds, by BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity and Charles Schwab (SCHW) within the past year as investors increasingly pull money out of active funds in favor of cheaper, passively managed investments.Pressure from passive investing has pushed many to slash expense ratios on funds, De Freitas noted, ""which in general has been a great thing for investors, who have access now to a diversified portfolio at a very affordable price, both on the asset management side as well as on the brokerage side. ... It's a great time to be an investor.""Within the past year, Schwab has cut stock, ETF and options trading commissions, as well as ETF and mutual fund expense ratios. It now offers 22 low-cost ETFs, while its ETF OneSource platform provides over 200 commission-free ETFs from 16 providers. Its latest offering, Schwab 1000 Index (SCHK), launched Oct. 5.The fee war has been a big win for the company as the Schwab ETF OneSource program has attracted $18 billion in new ETF flow this year, representing 51% of total firmwide ETF flow, according to Schwab data.Switching an ETF index from an independent index provider, such as a Russell, MSCI or S&P, to an in-house, proprietary index can also help bring down cost for the asset manager. This, in turn, can benefit investors if the cost is passed along in the form of lower expense ratios on the ETFs.""In the case of those three funds, it was cost-advantageous to use self-indexes vs. Russell indexes,"" said Noel Archard, global head of SPDR Product at SSGA. ""We thought we could give an equivalent benchmark experience at a cost level that would support the price we needed to meet client demand.""Archard says that self-indexing is a tool that SSGA plans to use judiciously in the future. Meanwhile, some of the brand names of known, independent indexes resonate well with investors. And in some circumstances, it is more cost-effective to use an independent index. An example is when the index uses derivatives for hedging currency risks.In addition, not every manager has the tools and the resources to create their own index: ""You need to have a fair amount of capability to run indexes. This isn't just something that anyone can do,"" he added.A challenge that investors need to be aware of is whether an index is really independent, points out Rick Redding, CEO of the Index Industry Association: ""One question is, 'Is the investor better off?' Getting active products into a better, cheaper format, investors clearly have some advantages that they didn't have,"" he said.""But the thing that I think is overlooked and the question that a lot of investors should ask is, 'Is the index truly independent?' Is the index created by someone that doesn't have a financial interest in either trading the underlying securities, nor do they create the product that the investor trades.""Usually, there are checks and balances all along the way: Three different parties are involved in trading securities, creating the index and creating the ETF.""And why is this important? The independent producers don't have any interest in whether the market is going up or down. They're just trying to find the best representation of that market or that sector or that market segment,"" Redding said.He points out that it's also paramount for investors to understand the methodology behind an index, such as how inclusions and exclusions of a security are determined, and how often the index rebalances. This can result in different returns for similarly named indexes.""This is really becoming a much bigger issue — and this is an issue we don't see people talking about: Understand the underlying index you're investing in. Once you understand that, you know what risks you're being exposed to, because there's a lot of products that all sound very similar when they're sold to investors.""An example is high-dividend ETFs: ""Are they getting high dividends because they're all investing in bank stocks or utility stocks or some combination?"" asked Redding. ""If rates rise, it's going to have a very different impact on all those products, but they may have the same name in how they're marketed.""The good news is that a lot of this information is publicly available, so investors can do their due diligence when buying ETFs. But Redding also points out that there are grades of transparency, and many boutique products may not be as transparent.Still, an actively managed ETF tends to be more transparent, due to the publicly available methodology, than a comparable mutual fund, he notes.Bid-ask spreads can also eat into the return of a security and ultimately the ETF. If a security is less liquid, it can drive up its spread and the ETF's cost. At the same time, if the ETF is less liquid, it tends to trade with a wider spread than maybe a similar, larger and more liquid ETF. Investors need to be aware that low fees are not the only factor that goes into the total cost of an ETF.IBD'S TAKE: Searching for ETF ideas that may warrant a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.And while self-indexing has become more popular in the marketplace, Jonathan de St. Paer, senior vice president and head of strategy and product at Charles Schwab Investment Management, does ""not see self-indexing replacing the value proposition of our index partners.""He says that index transitions involve a change in holdings and can create greater turnover in the fund, generating additional trading fees, capital gain distributions and taxes. In addition, a particular fund holder may have chosen that fund for its specific benchmark and may reconsider the investment due to an index change.""Price matters — and that matters a lot, but it is not the only thing. If you're investing ... you want to make sure that you know what you're trying to do,"" said de St. Paer. Deciding on your allocation, picking the individual products to get the specific exposure, choosing a product with a low expense ratio, looking at liquidity, bid-ask spreads and tracking error vs. the index are all very important, he says.""It's not just the expense ratio that is the cost. Total cost is your expense ratio and your bid-ask spread, and to some degree the tracking error for the ability of your manager to deliver the exposure that you've chosen,"" he added. SSGA's replacement of Russell indexes in three of its funds raises the question of capital gains taxes.""While we won't know the tax implications until the index transition takes place in November, the ETF structure generally allows for tax efficiency and as is our normal protocol, we will continue to limit tax implications associated with this shift,"" the company said.RELATED:SSGA Launches Ultra-Low-Cost ETFs; Ameritrade Takes On SchwabIShares Cuts ETF Costs As New Rule Tied To Retirement Looms: One Hot TipHere's How Charles Schwab Is Waging Its War On Stock, ETF And Fund Fees

201,SCHW,"TD Ameritrade (AMTD) just beefed up the usefulness of its new Facebook (FB) Messenger chat bot, announcing Monday that clients can now use the mobile-friendly tool to trade stocks and ETFs.XThey also can use TD Ameritrade's bot for Messenger to make secure deposits to fund their accounts on the move, as well as to receive weekly alerts that summarize stock market action, and access quarterly performance video statements. Chat bots are driven by artificial intelligence (AI) technology and serve as virtual assistants or automated programs that allow corporations to communicate with their customers.TD Ameritrade clients can make stock investments independently — or access live client support to place a trade, the online broker said. The bot does most of the heavy lifting, so the customer merely has to click a single button as the final step.The bot is ""smart enough to recognize intent"" and make recommendations based on user interactions, TD Ameritrade's director of emerging technologies Sunayna Tuteja said in an interview. So if you type in ""FB,"" for example, it anticipates you might want to trade the stock or need help deciding between a market order and limit order, she explained.Until now, customers could only use TD Ameritrade's chat bot service, which launched in August, to view the status of their accounts and stock positions, and to access research and education content.A spokesperson for TD Ameritrade told Investor's Business Daily that one of the chat bot's most popular features since its debut is educational videos — driven by younger people who are just getting started with investing. Yet, she added, the chat bot's appeal cuts across demographics, with Baby Boomers engaging on the platform as frequently as millennial investors.TD Ameritrade's trading fees using the Facebook chat bot will remain the same, the spokesperson said. While the chat bot works both on desktop and mobile devices, the experience is better on the latter because Facebook Messenger is designed to be mobile-first, she added.Shares of TD Ameritrade dipped 0.3% to 48.14 on the stock market today, still in range from a September breakout past 47.36. Among other online brokers, Charles Schwab (SCHW) dipped 0.45% Monday, while E-Trade (ETFC) slipped 1%. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) was up 2.35%. Facebook shares lost 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.TD Ameritrade also reports results for the third-quarter Tuesday, on the heels of last week's reports from Schwab and E-Trade. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research foresee EPS rising 31% to 46 cents, with revenue up 16% to $965 million.The major discount brokers including TD Ameritrade are enhancing their digital and mobile platforms for a new generation of investors, as a slew of emerging micro-investing apps like Robinhood threaten to make stock trading free, or extremely cheap and easy, for beginners.Disney (DIS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are among other companies that have announced or are testing Facebook Messenger chat bots.RELATED:Charles Schwab Q3 Revenue Misses Forecasts; Stock Stays In Buy ZoneHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersMillennials Turn To ETFs To Achieve Investment Objectives

203,SCHW,"Investors know what they like, and they liked the November election results and December's interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve.Those events prompted a jump in investors who have retail accounts with Charles Schwab (SCHW) to declare themselves bullish. In a fourth-quarter survey of those investors, Schwab found 42% of them said they now feel bullish. That was a big jump up from the 34% who felt that way in Q4 a year earlier.""As a result of the election, clients saw an increased prospect for a reduction in personal and corporate tax rates, an increased likelihood of spending on infrastructure, and an increased likelihood of a reduction in regulatory burdens for some industries,"" said Myhanh Hoskin, a Schwab financial consultant, who is based in Seal Beach, Calif. ""The rate increase was a sign of growing strength in the economy.""Amid that widespread perception that the stock market had become increasingly worth investing in, Schwab investors did as much buying as selling in the quarter.The top five U.S. holdings among all Schwab stock mutual funds were Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) as of Feb. 16, according to Morningstar Inc.Apple is up 17% year to date, while Microsoft is up 4%, Exxon is down 10%, Johnson & Johnson is up 3%, and JPMorgan is up 5%.In Schwab's survey of its clients, the general balance between buying and selling bodes well for the market in additional ways. ""It shows there isn't a sense of euphoria,"" Hoskin said. ""It shows caution by many investors. And that suggests that we're not seeing a market top. That is a good thing. When you have too many people doing the same thing, that tends to be a contrarian indicator.""On the other hand, only 13% of investors said their top concern about the market is that it appears overdue for a correction, suggesting a tone of overconfidence.In contrast, a whopping 88% said they are confident about reaching their financial goals.Investors had 41.3% of their money in stocks, 21.1% in cash, 18.8% in mutual funds, 11.9% in exchange traded funds, and 6.9% in fixed income.And 21% of those investors said they planned to move more money into stocks during the current first quarter.Stocks were the most popular planned destination for additional allocations.ETFs were the second most popular target asset, with 17% of investors saying that's where they planned to put more money.Mutual funds were the third most popular, with 15% of investors saying they would move money into them in Q1.Investors were more inclined to get help in making investment decisions.

206,SCHW,"With their one child finished with college and hard at work on a job, Rich and Linda Wright of Kingsport, Tenn., are hurtling toward their next big goal, retirement. He's a market research analyst, trying to rebound from a layoff. Linda is a middle-school guidance counselor, whose school days are slated to end next June.Just shy of his 64th birthday, Rich increasingly wonders how they will squeeze income from their portfolios, without risking a lot of volatility, for decades to come. He's wary of bonds' likely price erosion amid rising interest rates. One thing he is bullish about is the prospect that his online brokerage, Charles Schwab (SCHW), will help him solve this puzzle. ""My parents lived into their nineties, so that's my general life expectancy,"" Wright said. ""I know Schwab has some tools I can use.""Whether it's for retirement — like the Wrights — or other goals, investment and retirement planning tools are increasingly on the minds of Americans. Those tools were rated by investors as one of the 13 most important traits that an online brokerage can have in the 2017 edition of IBD's annual ranking of the Best Online Brokers.And they were two of the most important traits for clients of Fidelity, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade — the three top-ranked brokerages in the category.Investor's Business Daily and its polling partner, TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, survey thousands of investors each year to find out which online broker characteristics are most important to them and how well their own broker performs in each important performance area. The investors' ratings determine the Best Online Brokers in Overall Customer Experience and in each performance category. (See the full broker survey details.)Investment and retirement planning tools qualified as a critical category for the first time this year.Fidelity, Schwab and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) were the top three brokers in the category. The tools include online interactive retirement calculators, which can tell you things like whether you're on track to save enough to generate the income you'll need. You can also find a wide variety of tools to help you make long-term strategic decisions — figuring out how to get your finances from where they are today to where you want them to be for retirement or other key goals. Those differ from tactical one-time-only decisions about, say, which securities to buy or sell today.Strategic decisions include figuring out whether to roll over your 401(k) account balance into an IRA. TD Ameritrade has an interactive tool for that.Other brokers offer tools that can knit together several related strategic decisions.Fidelity's Planning & Guidance Center (P&GC) combines several tools into one package. One, called Retirement Preparedness Measurement, gives you a score that indicates whether you are on track to save enough. If you are falling short, the tool package suggests ways to bridge the gap. For example, it will point out if you are not kicking in enough to your 401(k) account to get the maximum company match. Or it might suggest changing your asset mix to boost your weighting in growth-oriented stocks and stock funds.The package can even point out a timetable for maximizing your Social Security benefits, whether you are already receiving a check or have not filed a claim yet.Now offered to Fidelity customers, in the next few months the online brokerage plans to debut a version with fewer bells and whistles for non-customers.For Fidelity customers, the tool draws on data about assets in the Boston-based firm's care. You can enter information about assets that are in some other firm's custody, or you can give Fidelity permission to look inside those other accounts, without being able to touch the assets.Another Fidelity tool, Guided Portfolio Summary (GPS), analyzes your portfolio and tells you how you're allocated among sectors, geographies and asset types, and how your weightings compare to various benchmarks. And GPS and P&GC can ""talk"" with each other, sharing information. ""If a customer sets a retirement goal in Planning & Guidance Center, they can run a GPS analysis for that goal,"" said Jason Jagatic, vice president for product development, in the business group that oversees Fidelity's retail and defined contribution customers.Senior Vice President Matt Borden, to whom Jagatic reports, said, ""Our aim is to help people understand where they stand and then plan to look ahead, create an investment plan that works for their situation and implement it for their situation so they can achieve their goals and get a better outcome than they probably would without these tools.""Schwab offers a tool it calls Bubble Chart. It shows market performance of securities in your retirement or other account with images more than with words and numbers. The securities in your account are displayed on a grid. Each security is represented by a bubble.The size of each bubble signals its dollar value. The color of a bubble — green or red — tells you whether it has gained or lost value in the time period displayed. Each bubble's height shows its percentage change in value. The taller a bubble is, the more its value has changed.And each bubble's location on the grid signals its impact on your account. The further to the left it is, the less its impact is. The further to the right, the more its impact is. You can click or tap on each bubble to see additional data about the position.""We're in a visual world,"" said Eliel Johnson, Schwab vice president of user experience and design. ""It's a great way of conveying a lot of information in a small space. In other tools, it also helps you interact with the data — make changes to your account, change your contributions, and so on.""Said Fidelity's Borden, ""We want to think about tools that bring together your different financial planning tasks. We want to give you a holistic view of your situation and of ways of reaching your goals.""RELATED:Are You Saving Enough To Retire?

207,SCHW,"The online brokerage business is concentrated enough that the biggest brokers can overshadow others. In the 2017 Best Online Brokers report by Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, the analysis focused on six stock brokerages that had at least 125 of their customers participating in an investor survey.But sometimes noteworthy companies fly a bit under the radar. For the first time this year, IBD also took a look at the best of the rest of the brokers, examining those with 85 to 124 clients in the survey. Of 24 brokerages specifically named in the survey, six fit this description.Among these six smaller brokers, TradeStation emerged as a clear standout, both overall and in most of the survey categories. Merrill Edge and Vanguard also ranked in the top three brokers overall within this broker group. The three earn Honorable Mention for their performance.Despite their size, smaller brokers can still compete and succeed in the brokerage industry. Vanguard believes it distances itself from the competition ""by continuing to lower the cost of investing for our clients and putting the best interests of our clients first by providing expert and unbiased service,"" said spokeswoman Emily Farrell.Other brokers in the comparison were TradeKing, OptionsHouse and OptionsXpress, which was acquired by Charles Schwab (SCHW) in 2011. Each broker's scores are based on how highly its own customers rated it on 13 critical features. (For more details, read our article on the survey methodology.)The rankings suggest investor preferences and investment strategies play a large role in how each broker places in a specific category. A broker's strengths might favor long-term investing vs. short-term trading, or equities vs. options.Some investors desire high-quality institutional research and are willing to pay a premium for it, while others have their own investment ideas that they want to implement at a discounted rate.Known for catering to the active trader, TradeStation is making strides to appeal to a more diverse set of investors. The company plans to bring its institutional-quality trading platform to individual investors as an ongoing mission.Its emphasis on trading tools means it's no surprise that investors gave TradeStation the highest rating in equity trading tools among the six brokers. In the last few years, investor preferences have grown to place a premium on ""on-the-go"" trading tools, such as placing trades or checking portfolio values from a tablet or smartphone. TradeStation paid attention to this changing appetite and replicated its desktop tools in the mobile arena. The efforts paid off, and it had the highest score in mobile platforms and trading.In general, the firm's clients were pleased with its services. TradeStation scored more top scores in the 13 categories than any of the other five brokers.In fact, of the 13 categories, the lowest ranking TradeStation held was third, in options trading platform, investment and retirement planning tools, and low commissions and fees. That made TradeStation the most-well rounded broker of the six.Regarding its options platform, OptionStation Pro, TradeStation has plans to upgrade the system in the coming months. Changes include simplifying the interface and adding features for more advanced options traders.Being part of Merrill Lynch, a traditional brokerage house, can provide advantages, at a low cost, that other online brokers are unable to match. Merrill Edge launched in 2010 after Bank of America (BAC)'s acquisition of Merrill Lynch in 2008.Merrill Edge is a provider of Merrill Lynch's global analyst research reports, so it was no surprise that Merrill Edge had the top scores in investment research, research tools, and portfolio analysis and reports.Merrill Edge had mostly positive results. It showed in the top three in 11 of the 13 categories, including placing high in equity trading tools, low fees, and investment and retirement planning tools.As much as investors want to be independent and self-directed, they still see the need for professional investment advice. In response, the firm has introduced Merrill Edge Guided Investing, which seeks to blend online investing with a professionally managed portfolio through the use of a robo-advisor. A robo-advisor queries a client regarding risk tolerance, investment goals, time horizon and other investing attributes to recommend a diversified portfolio of ETFs to reach a desired asset allocation.Vanguard is the largest provider of mutual funds, so chances are if you have a retirement plan, like a 401(k), you've seen Vanguard funds as a potential investment option.John Bogle, founder and retired CEO of the Vanguard Group, espouses an investment philosophy of index investing. Essentially, instead of attempting to beat the benchmark index while incurring high costs, an index fund would track the performance of a specific index over the long run at a low cost.The company's brokerage site mirrors and prioritizes that investment philosophy, and like-minded investors seem to like it that way. Vanguard earned the highest client rating among the six brokers in investment and retirement planning tools and in low commissions and fees. It also had the top scores in trade reliability and customer service and was in the top three for five other factors.With such a long-term investment orientation and its focus on retirement, the broker's trading platforms might strike some investors as surprisingly basic. Vanguard earned low ratings for its equity and options trading platforms and research tools.TradeKing neither ranked in the top nor bottom of any category. But it was in the top three in ETF choices, investment research, and research tools.Options investors have different needs, and OptionsXpress and OptionsHouse naturally warrant a look. Out of the six brokers, they captured the highest scores in the options trading platform category.RELATED:Best Online Brokers For 2017 Identified – By Their CustomersWhere Vanguard's CEO Sees Fund Giant Headed In 2017At TradeStation, Feedback Guides Mobile Advances

209,SCHW,"Stocks jumped out of the starting gate Monday as positive New York-region manufacturing data helped boost the premarket session.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each opened 0.2% higher, pushing to new highs. The Nasdaq composite advanced 0.3%, grabbing another new high of its own.Investors were keeping an eye early Monday on fighting between the Iraqi military and Kurdish forces in the northern Iraq city of Kirkuk, and on Israel and Syria, after Israeli forces launched a retaliatory strike against a missile launching facility east of Damascus.The Dow and S&P 500 are both sitting on top of five-week advances. The Nasdaq has climbed for three weeks, and all three closed last week at new highs. This week's outcome is likely to be affected by earnings reports. Netflix (NFLX) reports after today's close, and the pace picks up on Tuesday, with Goldman Sachs (GS), UnitedHealth (UNH), Cree (CREE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) among the names expected to report.On the Dow, Travelers (TRV) led with a 1.5% gain. American Express (AXP) took the hardest early hit, down 0.8%.Apple (AAPL) scaled up 1% in early trade, after KeyBanc Securities upgraded the stock to overweight from sector weight. The note said iPhone X pricing, the increase of iPhone 8/8+ and a change to its storage pricing ""represent a more aggressive strategy to segment its customer base and extract incremental gross profit from its users than we previously expected.""Apple shares rose through resistance at the stock's 10-week moving average. Shares have made themselves comfortable below that line for the past month, but a three-week advance has started the right side of a possible new base.Among the big tech FANG stocks, Netflix gained 0.5% in premarket action ahead of its earnings report due out after the close. The stock ended Friday at the very top of its buy range, a fraction less than 5% past a 190.05 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Consensus views are calling for a big earnings gain, up 167%, for Netflix' third quarter, on top of a 30% rise in revenue.Biotech Exelixis (EXEL) soared 22% at the open. The company said the Food and Drug Administration granted a priority review of its kidney cancer treatment. Exelixis shares ended Friday pulled back 16% from a late-August high, in a possible six-week cup base.Charles Schwab (SCHW) dropped 0.9%, after narrowly topping earnings targets and narrowly missing revenue growth views in its third-quarter report. The stock ended Friday just above a 44.20 buy point in a three-month cup base.China-based names led the IBD 50 list. Chian Lodging GroupHTHT powered up more than 2%,  YY (YY) jumped 1.7% . Both stocks are extended and near new highs.Tampa, Fla.-based insurance broker Health Insurance Innovations (HIIQ) bolted 8% higher, after clobbering analysts earnings and revenue growth expectations for its third quarter, and announced a $50 million share repurchase initiative. The stock ended Friday still 49% below its Aug. 30 high, but up 50% from a late September low as it rebounds from the selloff that followed Hurricane Irma.Economic news gets off to a positive start for the week, with the New York Federal Reserve Bank reporting a surge in regional manufacturing in October, sending its Empire State Manufacturing Survey to a reading of 30.2, up from 24.4 in September — its best month in three years. That was far above consensus expectations, which called for the index to weaken to a reading of 20.The report showed longer delivery times and a decrease in inventory levels, both negative. But new orders and shipments were sharply higher, pointing to ""ongoing solid gains.""Oil prices traded up 1.4%, with West Texas Intermediate holding above $52 a barrel and approaching its late-September high. Copper spiked almost 3%, nearing a three-year high, after data showed China's copper imports surged in September and a central bank governor forecast an uptick in GDP growth to 7% in the second half of the year, just ahead of this week's Communist Party Congress.China's markets posted a mixed session Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rising 0.8%.

Apparently, they can keep going lower.XState Street Global Advisors on Monday joined BlackRock's iShares, Schwab (SCHW) and Vanguard in an ongoing low-fee battle by launching a suite of 15 ultra-low-cost equity and bond ETFs. The Boston-based firm slashed expense ratios across the 15 funds to a range from 0.03% to 0.11%.""We are truly excited to be able to offer ultra-low-cost ETFs to investors.

Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.""With its slashing of fees for a variety of ETFs, many tied to prominent indices, SSGA has aggressively crashed the low-fee ETF party consisting of iShares, Vanguard and Schwab,"" Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research, said in a note. ""However, while those firms have been bringing down expenses ratios by a basis point or two in recent years, some of the SSGA ETF cuts were by 10 basis points or more, including international equity ETFs trading under new tickers SPDW and SPEM.""Among the most drastic of its changes, SSGA cut the expense ratio on SPDR Portfolio Emerging Markets (SPEM) to 0.11% from 0.59% and SPDR Portfolio World ex-US (SPDW) to 0.04% from 0.34%.The SSGA launch will be offered commission-free on TD Ameritrade's (AMTD) ETF Market Center. Also on Monday, TD Ameritrade expanded its offerings in its commission-free ETF trading program to 296 from 100. Schwab offers more than 200 commission-free ETFs.TD Ameritrade added new providers to its commission-free lineup, but omitted ETFs from Vanguard, which doesn't pay brokers to offer its products. Vanguard funds will still be available through TD Ameritrade outside the commission-free program. This was first reported by the Wall Street Journal over the weekend.Vanguard ETFs can still be had elsewhere without paying a commission.""Investors seeking to purchase Vanguard ETFs on a commission-free basis can do so directly from Vanguard,"" Timothy Stokes, a Vanguard spokesman, told IBD. ""In addition to saving on commissions, investors enjoy best execution at Vanguard, along with all of the other benefits of investing with an industry leader beyond low-cost funds and ETFs.""Rosenbluth doesn't think Vanguard's policy of not paying placement fees is hurting the fund group.""Vanguard's ability to gather assets without having to pay to participate in a brokerage platform is impressive and helps justify their decisions,"" he told IBD. ""They have consistently gained market share in the last few years, even as commission free platforms have become more prominent and diverse. Additional costs to appear on a platform with priority shelf space would likely add to the expense ratio they charge.""Demand for low-cost ETFs has increased as advisors and investors replace mutual funds in asset allocation models or buy ETFs from commission-free platforms, Rosenbluth noted. SSGA has missed out on much of this trend because many of its expense ratios have been higher than iShares, Schwab and Vanguard, he says.But while investors may benefit from SSGA's lower fees, there could still be some questions.""However, while investors will be able to get exposure to the S&P 500 Growth and Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate indices for a lower expense ratio, the SSGA (funds) have historically traded less frequently than the iShares and Vanguard alternative and as such investors could incur higher trading costs,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, SSGA replacement of Russell indices with its own proprietary index will likely result in its shareholders ending up with a slightly different portfolio.""RELATED:IShares Cuts ETF Costs As New Rule Tied To Retirement Looms: One Hot TipHere's How Charles Schwab Is Waging Its War On Stock, ETF And Fund Fees

211,SCHW,"Charles Schwab (SCHW) reported third-quarter profit Monday that edged past forecasts, while revenue fell well short of estimates.Estimates: EPS to climb 21% to 41 cents, as revenue grows 14% to $2.19 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of 42 cents on revenue of $2.165 billion. Net interest revenue grew 28% to $1.08 billion, and asset management fee revenue rose 8% to $861 million, but trading revenue fell 21% to $151 million. New retail brokerage accounts totaled 216,000, up 29% from a year ago.  Core net new assets of $51.6 billion were up 72%. Total client assets rose 17% to $3.18 trillion.Stock: Shares closed down 0.6% at 44.47 on the stock market today after briefly sinking to 43.91. Charles Schwab ended last week at 44.73, in range from a 44.20 buy point.Discount brokers Schwab, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) dropped fees sharply earlier this year amid intense industry rivalry. Now they face another potential threat — the emergence of micro-investing apps like Robinhood that aim to stock market investing easy, fun and even free for beginners.Schwab's shares broke out of a long consolidation in late September, as the financial sector broadly rallied on hopes for Republican-led tax reform. But the rally stuttered last week after mixed reports from Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Well Fargo (WFC).E-Trade Financial reports Thursday and is estimated to report flat earnings of 51 cents per share despite a 23% expected revenue increase to $596 million.E-Trade rose 1.4% to 44.49, now slightly extended from from a 42.29 base-on-base entry point.TD Ameritrade has its earnings next week.

212,SCHW,"For many investors, being able to screen for stocks and conduct research like a professional trader are key factors to consider when searching for an online broker.That's why Research Tools and Investment Research — which includes stock reports, Wall Street buy and sell ratings, financial forecasts and more — made up two categories that rank highly in importance by respondents in IBD's fifth annual survey about online stock brokers.Investors were asked to rate the importance of 24 broker characteristics, as well as their primary brokers' performance in each of the 13 most important categories. Based on the 2017 Best Online Brokers survey results, the investors rated Research Tools sixth in importance, with Investment Research just behind at No. 7.The top three stockbrokers for the two categories were Fidelity, Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).Fidelity offers research tools including ETF Screener, which lets users quickly filter for exchange traded funds that best match their interests. For instance, if you're seeking a particular type of sector fund, you'd select Sector. You'll see the total number of available sector ETFs, as well as their net assets. You can further narrow the results by selecting criteria including objectives, performance, volatility and expense ratio.Let's say you already have a couple of ETFs in mind but aren't sure if they fit your criteria. No problem. Just click on the ""Add My ETFs"" and insert up to five names. The screen will appear at the top of your results list and show you how closely they align with the criteria you selected. You can save the screen so you could run it again later or to access it from a mobile device.You can build a similar screen for stocks or start with a predefined screen from independent research experts. Fidelity offers more than 140 criteria to allow users to tailor their results for their specific goals. It provides investment research from more than 20 sources.Charles Schwab's StreetSmart Edge trading platform gives users the research tools they need to help make informed decisions, including stock and ETF screens, advanced charting, pattern recognition and streaming news from providers such as the Associated Press and Thomson Reuters. Its Stock Screener helps users identify potential stock candidates by choosing a predefined screen such as Schwab ""A"" Ratings, Top Analyst Ratings, Near Price Highs and others. Those who prefer to tailor their own screens can select from a multitude of criteria including valuation, technicals and financial strength.Schwab boasts a robust research offering that includes proprietary research from in-house experts, as well as reports from Briefing.com, Credit Suisse, Market Edge, Morningstar, Standard & Poor's and many others.TD Ameritrade offers several trading platforms geared for different types of investors and a plethora of screens for stocks, options, mutual funds and ETFs. Clients can choose from predefined stock screens such as Strong Buys for a list of top-rated stocks on the Street, High Dividend Yield and RSI (Bullish) for stocks whose Relative Strength Index has crossed 30 and is rising.Or they can create their own custom screen by selecting criteria to meet their desired traits for stocks, options, mutual funds and ETFs. The Omaha, Neb.-based company provides equity research from partners including Dow Jones, Morningstar, S&P Capital IQ and Thomson Reuters.Last year it added a Social Sentiment feature to its Thinkorswim trading platform. This allows users to analyze social media sentiment — and how often companies' brands are mentioned — as another way to research stocks such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Disney (DIS), Nike (NKE) and Starbucks (SBUX).""This lens does not focus on what investors are saying about a stock in social media. It focuses on what consumers are saying about the products that the company makes,"" Nicole Sherrod, managing director of trading at TD Ameritrade, said in a news release. ""Traders can analyze what people think of a core brand in the portfolio or they can look at a roll-up of all the brands.""RELATED:It's A 3-Peat: Fidelity Tops IBD's Best Online Brokers Survey AgainSchwab Keeps Its Grips On Multiple Top RatingsTD Ameritrade's Focus On Technology, Innovation Pays Off

213,SCHW,"Shares of Charles Schwab (SCHW) fell Thursday as the leading online broker announced that it will cut its trade commissions on stocks and ETFs starting Friday and lower expenses on its index mutual funds starting March 1.Schwab will reduce its standard online equity and ETF trade commissions from $8.95 to $6.95, making them lowest among rivals such as Fidelity, Vanguard, TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade (ETFC). Commissions at those competitors range from $7 to $20.Expenses on Schwab's cap-weighted index mutual funds also will be aligned with their ETF counterparts, putting them among the lowest in the industry. Investment minimums are being eliminated for those Schwab funds and a single share class will be used, enabling even the smallest investor to pay the lowest possible fees, according to Schwab.""Any investor will pay the same best rate across the board,"" Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger said in a call with analysts. He described his firm's latest moves as ""critical for growth in the future.""The new expense ratios on Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX) and Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund (SWSSX) are 0.03% and 0.06%, respectively. Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Fund, set to launch Feb. 23, will charge 0.04%.Competing index funds from Fidelity and Vanguard cost anywhere from three to five times more for a $5,000 investment, Bettinger pointed out.The moves build on the firm's history of shaking up an industry where steep commissions and pricey investment products were the norm. Schwab ranked among the top brokerages in IBD's fifth annual survey of online brokers.In response to an analyst question Thursday, Bettinger rebutted the notion that the firm's moves target any particular competitor.""The outstanding growth we have delivered on both the top and bottom lines will continue into 2017 without respect to the moves we have announced today,"" he said. ""Investors have entrusted us with tremendous amounts of incremental assets. We wanted to combine the benefits of scale they have created with the discipline we have created around operating efficiency, and share those benefits with our clients.""In the analyst call, Bettinger described 2016 as an ""outstanding year"" for Schwab and estimated  that the next Fed rate hike could generate $300 million to $400 million incremental revenue for his company.""The environment appears to be more optimistic than it has been in recent years"" for the financial services industry, he added.Schwab, a member of the IBD 50 list of market-leading growth stocks, finished 5.3% lower on the stock market today and has sliced through its 50-day moving average for the first time since November. But it has nearly doubled in price from the market bottom of Feb. 11, 2016.The slide in Schwab shares on the stock market today came amid a broad financial sector sell-off, a day after the Federal Reserve offered little clue about the timing of its next interest rate hike. Banks and other financial services firms benefit from higher rates, which boost their margins.In the wake of Schwab's latest move, shares of TD Ameritrade and E-Trade sank around 9% each on Thursday. Schwab depends less on trading commissions for its revenue than rival brokerage firms.Vanguard, Fidelity, iShares and State Street have all chopped fees on their ETFs and mutual funds in recent years as the so-called fee war heats up.RELATED:Schwab CEO: 'We Will Continue To Modernize And Disrupt The Industry'Charles Schwab Slashes Stock, ETF Trading Fees; TD Ameritrade, E-Trade Hit

214,SCHW,"TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial fell hard Thursday after Charles Schwab (SCHW) announced it would cut its trading commissions starting Feb. 3.Schwab said it would cut its commissions on stocks and ETFs to $6.95 from $8.95, undercutting its competition including Fidelity, Vanguard, TD Ameritrade and E-Trade, according to the company's release. Fidelity charges $7.95 per trade, while E-Trade and Ameritrade levy a $9.99 commission. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) charges 0.5 cent per share purchased.Schwab shares skidded 5.25% to 39.17 on the stock market today, dropping below their 50-day moving average. But its online broker rivals fell much more, as investors bet that a price war will force them to follow suit or lose business. TD Ameritrade shares plunged 9.5% and E-Trade 8.9%. Interactive Brokers fell 1.9%.IBD's TAKE: There's more to choosing a broker than the lowest cost. IBD's Best Online Stock Brokers survey can help investors find the best broker for their trading needs. Schwab also said it would cut expenses for market cap-weighted index mutual funds ""to align with their Schwab ETF equivalents"" on March 1.""Reducing online trade commissions as scale and technology lower our operating costs is a way to ensure our clients benefit from their commitment to us,"" CEO Walt Bettinger said in the release.Schwab said the price changes are equivalent to $15 million in monthly revenue, noting that less than 11% of its revenue comes from trading. TD Ameritrade and E-Trade are more exposed to stock and ETF trading commissions.RELATED: Schwab Slashes Trade Costs On Stocks, ETFs, Drops Fees On Mutual FundsSchwab Keeps Its Grip On Multiple Top RatingsTD Ameritrade's Focus On Technology, Innovation Pays OffIt's A 3-Peat: Fidelity Tops IBD's Best Online Brokers Survey AgainBest Online Brokers For 2017 Identified — By Their Customers

215,SCHW,"The UConn women's basketball team. Tennis great Roger Federer. The U.S. women's national soccer team.To those examples of dominant performances, you can start thinking of three online brokerages: Fidelity, Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).They are again the best in IBD's fifth annual Best Online Brokers survey. In fact, the trio has been in the top three online stock brokerages for overall customer experience three of the past four years.The rankings provide a unique perspective to investors who are looking for a broker or just wondering whether their current broker is really the best one for them. That's because they're based entirely on ratings by the brokers' own clients. Investor's Business Daily and its polling partner, TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, surveyed 4,752 investors to find out how well their primary brokerage stacked up based on 13 critical characteristics.The 13 performance areas themselves were determined by how much importance investors placed on them. Because needs differ — a novice investor may value different services than an experienced trader, for instance — we present the best brokers in each category as well as the best three overall, based on their performance across all the categories. (For more on the methodology, see our article on the best stock brokers survey details.)For Fidelity, it's the third year in a row that the Boston-based firm took the top overall spot. Impressively, Fidelity had the first or second highest customer rating in all 13 survey categories. What grew into one of the leading mutual fund families has now become a force in online trading.As in previous Best Online Brokers surveys, privately held Fidelity met a stiff challenge from Charles Schwab. A small margin separated the two companies.Janet Malan, an investor who lives in California's Silicon Valley, weighed Schwab and TD Ameritrade before settling on Fidelity, largely because of costs and the flat fee Fidelity charges for trades. She found Schwab's fees higher than Fidelity's and Ameritrade's fee structure more complicated.Jose Calvino, an engineer in Greensboro, N.C., has accounts with four brokerages. His favorite? Fidelity. While he doesn't find a great deal of difference among his brokers, ""Fidelity provides more flexibility and latitude in the types of trading they allow in various accounts. ... If I were to consolidated all my accounts to one broker, I would choose Fidelity.""What does it take to be one of the best online brokers? You better have top research tools, ETF choices and website performance. The three brokerages topping the IBD survey shared the highest scores in those areas.Educational resources, stock trading tools and mobile platforms were other factors that weighed significantly in the final results. Fidelity, Schwab and TD Ameritrade also led in investment research, portfolio analysis and reports, and investment and retirement planning tools.Trade reliability was another factor shared by the top three brokers, although one in which there was little separation among all brokers that qualified for the survey.The brokers' research tools was an area that separated the top three from the rest, as has been the case in each year of the survey. There was a noticeable lag by the other brokers in the survey.Educational resources and investment research were other segments in which the top three stood out sharply.Low commissions were rated highly important to investors, yet the top brokerages didn't all get the best scores in that category. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) — which uses a commission system based on the number of shares traded rather than a flat fee — was the easy leader in that section.Schwab just cut its standard online stock and ETF trade commission from $8.95 to $6.95. The company also reduced expenses for the Schwab market cap-weighted index mutual funds to the same level as corresponding Schwab ETFs, and eliminated all investment minimums for those mutual funds.Scottrade ranked in the best three brokers for low commissions and fees. Scottrade also rated among the top brokers for customer service, while Interactive's options trading platform ranked as one of the best.Performing well in the areas most dear to investors certainly helped the top three brokers. Trade reliability, site performance and equity trading tools were the most important characteristics after commissions. In all of those, Fidelity, Schwab and TD Ameritrade were the top three in the survey. Fidelity and Schwab also were leading brokerages in customer service.As in prior years, the survey analysis focused on brokers with at least 125 clients who participated. Six brokers qualified this year.But for the first time, IBD and TechnoMetrica also took a look at smaller brokers with at least 85 customers responding. A separate article examines the six brokerages that qualified for this analysis.But overall, TradeStation, Merrill Edge and Vanguard were the best of the rest, earning Honorable Mention. In this group, TradeStation had the most top scores in the 13 broker service categories.Of the many resources that investors value most, preferences can change over time, and the latest survey saw a shift in which costs, ETFs, education, research and portfolio analysis gained in relative importance. At the same time, mobile tools, options trading and bread-and-butter factors such as site performance, trade reliability and customer service fell in priority.For all the digital tools now available to them, many online investors still crave some personalized help. The industry has responded with individualized advice. Robo-advisors — suggestions dispensed from computer algorithms based on the user's inputs — are available at many brokerages.Merrill Edge (owned by Bank of America (BAC)) has just stepped up its advisory offerings. This month, it launched Merrill Edge Guided Investing for current Merrill Edge clients and it is expanding to investors outside the brokerage in February. Unlike with robo-advisors, clients receive a recommended investment strategy from the Merrill Lynch Chief Investment Office.Still, IBD's survey found that online trading remains a predominantly do-it-yourself endeavor. Results show that investors value having many tools at their disposal, but put less worth on advisory help. Wealth management, automated advice and financial advice networks came in below the 13 services that investors ranked high in importance.Ancillary services such as banking, tax preparation tools and bonds also were low in importance. And despite the ubiquitous presence of social networks, investors don't feel a great need to use those when it comes to their trading.RELATED:It's A 3-Peat: Fidelity Tops IBD's Best Online Brokers Survey AgainSchwab Keeps Its Grips On Multiple Top RatingsTD Ameritrade's Focus On Technology, Innovation Pays Off

216,SCHW,"Shares of financial institutions — ranging from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to Charles Schwab (SCHW) — jumped as President Trump signed executive orders ordering a review of Dodd-Frank regulations as well as a halt to a rule that would require some retirement advisors to put their clients' needs over the bottom line.The bank rally pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average back over 20,000 Friday. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs (GS) are part of the Dow industrials.Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and other business leaders including the heads of BlackRock (BLK), Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM) also met Trump at the White House to discuss tax policy, trade, infrastructure and women in the workplace.Trump signed an order directing government agencies to plan changes to the Dodd-Frank overhaul put in place after the financial crisis. He also requested a pause to the fiduciary rule, set to take effect in April.Shares of JPMorgan rose 3.1% on the stock market today, rebounding from the 50-day line. Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.5%, Citigroup (C) added 3.2%.Investment banks were big winners, with a possible ban on proprietary trading among the possible Dodd-Frank provisions that could be rethought: Morgan Stanley (MS) jumped 5.5% and Goldman Sachs rallied 4.6%, both gapping above their 50-day lines.Charles Schwab added 2.55%, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) gained 1.5% and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) rose 1.1%. All three online brokerages fell sharply Thursday after Schwab slashed stock trading commission fees.Even as the Trump administration stacks its ranks with Goldman Sachs (GS) alumni, White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said in a Wall Street Journal article early Friday that the moves had less to do with helping banks and more to do ""with being a player in a global market where we should, could and will have a dominant position as long as we don't regulate ourselves out of that.""Cohn said Dodd-Frank constrains lending and the scope of financial products that banks could offer, while the fiduciary rule restricts consumer options. He also argued that regulations put in place after the housing bust were ineffective.IBD'S TAKE: With financial-management rules likely to change, read this story for more information about the best online brokers this year. Despite the Dodd-Frank criticisms, Trump's regulatory rollback comes after U.S. banks have scooped up market share in Europe as lenders there still try to regain composure after the financial crisis. And Citigroup last year said Mexico had ""tremendous untapped potential,"" setting its sights on Asia as well. But some analysts have expressed concern that trade restrictions could hurt banks' operations in Mexico.After the election, bank stocks soared on deregulation hopes and expectations that faster economic growth would spur wider yield spreads due to higher inflation and Federal Reserve rate hikes. Bank stocks have traded flat to slightly down in 2017, though.Cohn said the White House could try to install a new head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and added that the Treasury Department would try to make sweeping changes at mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC).RELATED:Banks Among Few S&P 500 Beneficiaries As Higher Rates Loom

The stock is trading just below a 824.40 cup-with-handle entry.After blowing past expectations in yesterday's Q4 release, Facebook (FB) dropped 1.7% and is about 1% above its 129.37 buy point.The IBD 50, a screen of leading growth stocks, was mostly negative in the stock market today, but there were some positive signs.On the upside, chip stocks looked to recover some of their recent losses.Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS) moved 2.5% higher and was attempting to shrug off its downside reversal day on Tuesday following its earnings announcement.On the downside, financial stocks continued to struggle after Wednesday's dovish Fed announcement.Eight out of the bottom 10 performing IBD 50 stocks were members of the finance or S&L sectors.Charles Schwab (SCHW) fell over 5% through it 50-day after it reduced its trading commissions.

219,SCHW,"Heading into 2017, financial stocks appeared to have a strong tailwind at their backs: rising interest rates. However, the first quarter of 2017 has started differently than expected. Instead of leading the market higher, many stocks within the broad Finance sector have shown signs of struggling and are on the brink of further consolidation. On Thursday, the Finance-Investment Bank/Brokers industry group…

220,SCHW,"The stock market wasn't moving much in afternoon trading Thursday ahead of Friday's jobs report. Wall Street shrugged off another strong earnings report from Facebook (FB). Financials lagged.The Nasdaq composite eased 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 fell fractionally. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly lower than Wednesday's levels.In the stock market today, Costco (COST) was a nice winner after reporting strong January sales. Shares jumped nearly 4% to 168.04. It's still in buy range from a 165.05 buy point. Facebook rose 1.7% early but reversed lower. Shares were recently trading around 130.80, down nearly 2%.Amazon.com (AMZN) outperformed ahead of its earnings report after the close. Shares rose 0.8% to 838.85. The stock is nearing an all-time high after a recent breakout from a cup-with-handle base with an 821.75 buy point.Meanwhile, several top growth stocks recently completed handle areas on their daily charts and could try to break soon. They include Tesla (TSLA), NetEase (NTES), GrubHub (GRUB) and Alibaba (BABA).IBD'S TAKE: Earnings from GrubHub are due next week. The stock was featured recently in The New America.High-yielder Philip Morris (PM) gapped above its 200-day moving average, rising 3% to 98.78. Earnings missed expectations but revenue was better than expected. Philip Morris sports a big dividend yield of around 4.3%.Inside the IBD 50, financials weakened across the board, perhaps due to perceived dovish comments from the Fed Wednesday.

221,SCHW,"Fidelity brokerage, focused on tapping the growing ranks of investors making their own trades and managing their investments, once again ranks among the top brokers in the latest IBD Best Online Brokers survey.X In doing so, it's kept abreast of markets that are becoming more fast-paced, international and complex. The Fidelity Investments unit now has 19.4 million accounts, up 9% from a year earlier.Its combination of customer awareness and product development enabled Fidelity brokerage to nail down a sixth-straight year as a  top-five firm in IBD's annual Best Online Brokers Survey. And for the fourth year in a row, its customers gave it the highest Customer Experience Index rating among all the brokers in the survey.Rather than resting on laurels, the brokerage is fighting to increase its pace of innovation and development, adopting what Head of Brokerage Customer Experience Scott Ignall refers to as ""a spirit of innovation and speed"" injected into the environment over the past couple of years.""We really embrace pace over perfection, knowing that our customers value constant innovation, and they want to get feedback and they want to get features from us on a regular basis, as opposed to waiting for big, long six-month or one-year projects,"" Ignall said.The high-output model led to releases in 2017 of trading account facial recognition security software for Apple (AAPL) iPhone X users, security voice pattern recognition speeding customer service calls, and account monitoring capabilities for Coinbase cryptocurrency traders. Fidelity brokerage also jumped into a price war last February, cutting its commission for online stock trades by nearly 40%, to $4.95 per trade, competing with Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (TD) and others.Ram Subramanian, Fidelity's head of brokerage services, also emphasizes the company's investment during the past year in upgrading its half-dozen customer service centers spread from Merrimack, N.H., to Salt Lake City. This included improving the associate work experience at those sites by upgrading the centers physically; improving hiring, training and career advancement policies; and implementing new call center technologies.Customer service has been a clear differentiator for Fidelity, which has consistently run at the head of the category for the past four years.One Florida investor interviewed by IBD, Sy N. (who asked that his last name not be used for privacy reasons), is a former CPA and a highly active trader now in his 70s. He says he runs a portfolio of several million dollars through a Fidelity brokerage account, along with accounts at TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, Schwab and eTrade (ETFC).All of these firms have wonderful people in the back office and, for the most part, they all know what they are doing, he says. But Sy says Fidelity is a cut above the others.As the trustee of an estate, Sy N. was trying to do a certain type of 401(k) rollover. He ran into brick walls at several brokerages.""It had a little complication — there was a trust involved — so it made them nervous,"" he said.Fidelity also initially said it wasn't possible, but then transferred him to a specialist who figured it out.""He helped me figure out how to do it, then he went back to the employer people, was with me on the phone, and it ended up getting done,"" he said.Lynn Shelby, a Phoenix investor who retired in September, says Fidelity also outperformed, in her opinion, at the retail level. She switched her trading account funds, a little more than $100,000, from Scottrade to Fidelity brokerage about two years ago.One reason for the switch was because she met an advisor at a Fidelity location near Shelby's home who began paying special attention to her account.""We spent a lot of time. We developed strategies,"" she said.Shelby and Sy N. are very different sorts of investors. Sy N. is moving millions of dollars in and out of stocks at a brisk clip. Shelby is taking advantage of growth stocks moving past buy points, but has really only been focusing seriously on investing since September.But both investors fit what Subramanian calls a ""self-directed investor,"" the type of customer who has become the target market for Fidelity's trading business.""A self-directed customer is someone who likes to broadly engage in the market themselves. What they ask us is 'Provide me the education, the research and the experience at my fingertips so that I can engage,' "" he said.Customers, of course, can pick and choose their tools. Sy N. uses Fidelity brokerage's basic, web-based trading platform to chart stocks and execute trades. He uses Fidelity, Investor's Business Daily and Schwab, where he keeps an account, for the bulk of his research.Shelby uses IBD's MarketSmith premium charting service for charting and tracking stocks and executes trades using Fidelity's online platform. She says she is making up for lost time in her market knowledge, reading books, taking seminars and also looking further into research offerings from the Fidelity brokerage.""Every day we get up at 6:30,"" she said. ""I say I'm not working, but really I have a little part-time job because I'm managing my money on a daily basis.""One aspect of the market that Fidelity is seeing take off among self-directed investors: options trading. The number of new options traders rose 27% in 2017, Subramanian says. Fidelity is piloting its Options Trade Builder program, which was designed to allow novice options traders to gather information and build trades.""But what we are finding now is that even more experienced, self-directed investors are finding it handy,"" he said.Fidelity is linked with both Alexa and Echo Show through Amazon.com (AMZN), increasing the capabilities and functions offered through voice control.Through a partnership with Coinbase, Fidelity brokerage allows customers to include their cryptocurrency account in their Full View monitoring feature. This allows customers to include pertinent data from all their accounts with other banks and brokerages and put it into a single monitoring and tracking application.But while Bitcoin and its digital peers are on Fidelity's radar, Fidelity does not offer access to cryptocurrency trades.""And at this point we don't plan to,"" Subramanian said. ""Our feeling is, we'll have to wait and watch. It is not an appropriate dealer offering,"" he said.Looking further ahead, Subramanian says smartphone and tablet computer-enabled mobile trading is an increasing focus for future trading technologies.""In fact,"" he said, ""a lot of the work we are doing right now, we are telling our teams to focus on build it first in mobile, and then work backwards"" into the web-based and downloadable applications.Ignall says mobile is still comparatively small but is growing quickly. Some 14.2% of all Fidelity's DARTs — daily average revenue trades — were sent via mobile in 2017, up from 11.9% in 2016. He also says there is a link between that number and the rising number of  investors under 35 years old, who constitute 15.5% of account holders now vs. 14.1% in 2015.Given that the number of Fidelity brokerage accounts grew in 2017 by what Subramanian says was more than 8,000 per day, that's a lot of young investors. It is also a fresh, rising source of feedback for the new speed and innovation-oriented Fidelity.""As we roll out new features and new products quicker, and in smaller, bite-size chunks, it allows us to get tighter with our customers to get constant iterative feedback from them,"" Ignall said. ""And (we can) increase that feedback cycle that is so critical to creating great products and services.""Want to read more about the other top brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

222,SCHW,"In an industry clogged with look-alike mutual funds, an ESG focus helps Calvert Equity Fund (CSIEX) stand out. The $2.2 billion fund bases its buy decisions not only on fundamental financial analysis but also on socially responsible criteria.X ESG refers to environmental, social and corporate governance criteria. ""Investors are attracted to this approach (using ESG factors) because they want to invest in companies that are solving these pressing ESG challenges,"" said Anthony Eames, director of responsible investment strategy for Calvert Research & Management. ""Over time, companies that get ESG factors right benefit from that, and that's good for the companies and their shareholders.""The financial fundamentals that the fund's four managers screen for are designed to find ""companies with consistent growth and stability in earnings,"" said Joseph Hudepohl, one of four Atlanta Capital Management co-managers who subadvise the fund for Calvert. Both Atlanta and Calvert are units of Eaton Vance.""Companies like that can thrive in any environment,"" he added. ""They're not reliant on the capital markets for funding, so they can withstand periods like (the financial crisis of) 2008-09, and they can compound over time.""Those traits are reflected in fund performance: strong, not dazzling, with lower downside risk than many of its peers.Calvert Equity outperformed the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 for the past year going into Thursday, up 30.87% vs. 26.95%. Large-cap growth mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Direct averaged 32.56%. And the fund provided shareholders with a smoother ride than its peer group has over time periods stretching from three to 15 years. Over the past three years, for example, the fund has gone down less than 85% of the S&P 500 in downturns, while its peers have averaged declines of more than 110% vs. the big-cap bogey.Calvert analysts sift through a universe of about 2,500 stocks. They pass a pool of 100 to 150 stocks that meet its ESG standards to the fund's Atlanta Capital co-managers. ""Then, based on our financial criteria and (low) valuation, we gravitate to the 45 to 50 names that make it into our portfolio,"" Hudepohl said.""Our universe of high quality businesses overlaps a lot with Calvert's universe of businesses that meet their ESG standards,"" he added.He says companies that satisfy the criteria tend to have tail winds because of those traits. ""There are long-term benefits to focusing on clean water like Danaher (DHR), for example, and on clean air like Praxair (PX).""Danaher's products include water treatment and vapor recovery systems. Its earnings per share rose 8%, 10% and 15% the past three quarters. Shares are up 27% in the past 12 months.Praxair makes atmospheric gases, process gases and industrial gas production equipment. EPS grew 7%, 5%, 6% and 8% the past four quarters, which followed eight quarters of EPS declines. Share price rose 37% in the past 12 months. The stock yields 2%.ESG criteria do not prevent the fund from investing in stocks that are popular among investors. FANG stalwarts Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are holdings.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Apple's strengths — like its five quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration — stack up against its peers at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.Calvert Equity's thesis for Facebook focuses on what Facebook excels at. ""Advertising dollars go where the eyeballs are,"" Hudepohl said. ""The internet is taking (consumers) eyeball time away from other media. And Facebook is one of the top truly global platforms after Google (for attracting consumers). It benefits from worldwide growth in attracting advertising dollars.""Equity managers like the steady earnings growth prospects for both Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V). ""They're two of the better examples of high-quality growth stocks and what we're looking for from a financial perspective,"" Hudepohl said about the credit card giants.Both companies also appear to have long runways in front of them. ""Amazingly, half of all transactions in developed markets are still in cash, so there is a lot of opportunity there,"" he said. ""And within emerging markets like India, China and South America, 90% of transactions are still done in cash.""And the two companies avoid taking on consumers' credit risk. ""They don't carry loans (from consumers),"" Hudepohl said. ""They are paid on each swipe of a card because of their technology. And the number of swipes is increasing.""Also, the companies have huge free cash flow, Hudepohl says. ""So they don't depend on capital markets to grow their businesses,"" he said. That means they don't have to issue stock or pay interest on loans or bonds to pay for capital expenditures or develop new technology.Charles Schwab (SCHW) benefits from a long-term secular tail wind of online brokers gaining market share, Hudepohl says. Also, Schwab stands to gain from rising interest rates. ""(The) low interest rate environment forced Schwab along with the rest of the industry to grant fee waivers on money market funds,"" Hudepohl said. ""As rates rise, those fees are being reinstituted.""""Secondly, the low rate environment also compressed net interest margin,"" he added. ""As rates rise, the spread that Schwab earns on its assets should continue to expand. Both benefits carry very high incremental margins to Schwab.""RELATED:Here's How Wall Street Professionals Play Bitcoin — Should You?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

223,SCHW,"Financial advisors should do more to help clients handle a rapidly changing world, said Bernie Clark, Charles Schwab's (SCHW) head of advisor services, as the company's Impact conference began in Chicago today.X""An increasingly important part of your future role as advisors will be helping clients determine when to create change ... and when to see aspects of change they might not be considering,"" Clark told a crowd of nearly 5,000 attendees at the company's annual conference.Clark evoked the health care industry, artificial intelligence and evolving workforce dynamics to illustrate that advisors must embrace a broader role in helping their clients navigate the forces of change.In his remarks from the main stage at the nation's largest and longest-running conference for independent registered investment advisors, Clark encouraged advisors to ""understand more about which changes will matter most to your clients"" by asking ""bigger questions"" and expanding areas of expertise.""Go beyond financial planning and portfolio management,"" said Clark. ""Expand your circle of influence to include new experts with additional types of specialization. Think about bringing on people who aren't typical financial hires and be ready to provide counsel and connect your clients to the right resources.""According to the results of the latest Schwab Independent Advisor Outlook Study, also released today at Impact, advisors are actively thinking about what skills they will need in their businesses going forward. Eighty-two percent of advisors report that they are seeking employees with ""people skills"" vs. 18% who are looking for employees who are ""skilled with numbers."" Moreover, the top three backgrounds considered valuable in candidates are communications, sales and consulting.Schwab Advisor Services marks 30 years of formally serving independent investment advisors this year. Today Schwab works with more than 7,500 independent advisors and has more than $1.4 trillion in assets under custody.""A lot has happened in those 30 years. But despite tremendous change, the core things that people care about will never change — family, relationships, personal and professional fulfillment, health, and security,"" said Clark. ""Another thing that doesn't change: the value of independent advice. Your model will continue to resonate. You are why your clients will be able to successfully deal with change, put it to work for them, and adapt to strategically build prosperous futures for themselves and their families.""Schwab's stock finished Wednesday at 44.54, down 0.05. It's trading above its 50-day moving average and 3% below its 52-week high and 14% below its all-time high of 51.66 reached in April 1999. The stock is up about 13% this year. Annual earnings have been growing at a 20% clip the past three years and are seen by analysts rising 25% this year and 21% next.RELATED:Tax Reform Muddies Waters For Charitable GivingWhat The Stock Market Doing Now?

The tech-heavy Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrial average eased a bit fro early highs, up 0.3% and 0.2% — respectively — helped by significant strength in Apple (AAPL).The S&P 500 also moved up 0.2%. All three major indexes set record highs.Among the Dow Jones Industrial components, energy giant Chevron (CVX) advanced 1% higher to move about 2% above a 118.79 saucer-with-handle entry.On the downside, American Express (AXP) declined 1%, but is still extended from a recent 82.10 flat-base entry.Apple was on pace to regain its 50-day line in the stock market today. Shares advanced 1.4% after KeyBanc upgraded the iPhonemaker from sector weight to overweight with a price target of 187 — a 19% premium to Friday's closing price at 156.99. The analyst commented that Apple is in the early stages of a more aggressive market segmentation strategy that could drive gross margins higher.Among companies reporting earnings, Netflix (NFLX) moved up 0.6% ahead of its Q3 earnings release due out after the market close. Analysts expect the video streamer to earn 32 cents per share on $2.97 billion in revenue. Shares are extended from a 190.05 cup-with-handle entry.Brokerage firm Charles Schwab (SCHW) declined 0.6% after reporting mixed Q3 results early Monday. While earnings topped estimates, revenue came in a bit light. Shares were slightly above their 44.20 flat-base entry.Meanwhile, investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) traded 0.8% and 0.6% higher ahead of their own Q3 earnings reports before the open Tuesday. Goldman is tracing a handle onto its saucer base, creating a 247.18 potential entry, while Morgan was right back at its 48.59 cup-with-handle buy point.FANG stock Facebook (FB) edged closer to its 175.59 flat-base buy point, rising 0.5%.Within the IBD 50, Essent Group (ESNT) followed through on Friday's flat-base breakout, moving up another 0.9%.

225,SCHW,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose modestly Monday morning ahead of big earnings this week after the major averages hit record highs Friday. Crude oil futures climbed as Iraqi forces advanced on Kirkuk, an oil-rich city controlled by Kurdish forces.XToday, highly rated Netflix (NFLX) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) report third-quarter earnings. Both Netflix and Charles Schwab are still in buy zones. Meanwhile, newly public Roku (ROKU) is setting up in an IPO base, something Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) has never done.S&P 500 futures rose 0.1% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2% above fair value while Dow futures advanced 0.15%.U.S. crude rose above $52 a barrel. Iraq's national army moved toward Kirkuk, an oil-heavy city. While not officially part of the autonomous Kurdistan, its forces hold the Kurd-dominated city. Kirkuk took part in a recent Kurdish independence referendum, which passed overwhelmingly.Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said Sunday that ""gradual"" interest rate increases are ""likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion."" Yellen, speaking at a Group of 30 banking seminar in Washington, didn't say whether she backs a rate hike in December.Meanwhile, Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda, speaking at the same event as Yellen, said the BoJ will continue to ""consistently pursue aggressive monetary easing.""But investors' focus will be on a flood of earnings this week, led by Netflix and Charles Schwab on Monday.Netflix broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 190.05 buy point on Oct. 5, as the internet TV giant announced plans to raise subscription rates. Shares closed Friday at 199.49, just within the 5% chase zone that goes up to 195.55.It's better to buy stocks as close to the entry point as possible, especially when the overall market has had a tendency to grind higher, with small uptrends followed by small declines or sideways action.Netflix will release results after Monday's closing bell. Analysts expect Netflix to report third-quarter earnings of 32 cents a share excluding items, up 167%  from 12 cents a year earlier. Revenue likely rose 30% to $2.97 billion.Wall Street has tended to focus more on subscriber numbers and guidance.Netflix previously forecast that it would add 3.65 million international subscribers in Q3 and 750,000 U.S. subscribers. That would be a net gain of 4.4 million, giving it 108.35 subscribers worldwide.Investors will pay close attention to Netflix's Q4 subscriber outlook.Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video and Hulu are growing peers in streaming media, with expanded libraries and original content. But for many households, especially those that have cut the cord on traditional pay-TV, the question is whether to subscribe to Amazon Prime Video or Hulu in addition to Netflix, not as a replacement.Netflix and fellow FANG stock Amazon are both currently on Leaderboard, IBD's premium service offering annotated charts of a select number of stocks, mostly growth names in or near buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. IBD discusses how to use this strategy with Netflix in the latest Earnings Preview column. Charles Schwab cleared a 44.20 flat-base buy point on Oct. 3. Shares nearly became extended a few days later, but have eased back to close Friday at 44.73, just over 1% above the entry.Schwab is a leading online discount broker but a strong presence in wealth management. Schwab recently cut equity commissions to $4.95 per trade. That's part of an industrywide price-cutting spree, though many startup apps such as Robinhood aimed at beginning investors offer trades with no commissions.Charles Schwab likely will release financials Monday morning. Wall Street expects Schwab to report third-quarter earnings of 41 cents, up 21% vs. 34 cents a year earlier. Revenue likely grew 14% to $2.185 billion.Fellow online brokerage E-Trade Financial (ETFC) reports after the market close on Thursday. Wall Street expects flat profit of 51 cents a share while revenue swells 23% to $596 million.E-Trade also is in buy range, above a flat base, or base-on-base pattern, buy point of 42.29. E-Trade closed last week at 43.89.Roku came public at 14 a share last month, soaring 68% in its Sept. 28 debut and rising to a record 29.80 the next day. Shares pulled back and began to consolidate, now forming a short IPO base. IPO bases are typically short: usually two to five weeks.Roku closed Friday at 23. The potential buy point is 29.90, 10 cents above the high.Keep in mind that having a potential buy point is no guarantee that a stock will reach and clear it. New IPOs are particularly volatile, so don't try to get ahead of the market and buy a stock early.It's better to wait for a new IPO to prove itself before jumping in. Snapchat parent Snap also had a strong first two days after its IPO. But after peaking at 29.44 on its second day, Snap began retreating, hitting a record-low 11.28 on Aug. 14, well below its 17 offering price. Snap has since rallied to 16.50, but still has not developed a sound base with a proper buy point.Roku is best known for its small set-top boxes for streaming TV used by many to access Netflix, Hulu and other streaming channels. Those Roku devices compete against the Amazon Fire TV stick, Apple (AAPL) TV and the Google Chromecast from Alphabet (GOOGL). But hardware sales are stagnant, so Roku sees the future in advertising and subscription-related revenue.RELATED:Expectations High For This FANG Stock Ahead Of Earnings; CSX Sets UpNetflix, GE, Goldman, PayPal Lead Busy Earnings Week: Investing Action Plan5 Hot Tech Stocks Near Buy Points As Nasdaq Hits New Record HighNetflix Binges On Price-Target Hikes Ahead Of Q3 EarningsFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Googles

226,SCHW,"Two young financial technology companies say they are buddying up to empower tweens and teens ""to get their feet wet in the stock market for free"" — but there's a thing or two to know.XBusyKid, a so-called ""chore app"" that parents use to reward kids for doing household tasks, will offer a free $10 Stockpile e-gift card to every new customer who sets up an account on their online platform. That $10 gift of stock can be used to buy fractional shares in Amazon (AMZN) and other popular companies.For its part, Stockpile is waiving its customary 99-cent fee per stock trade, on the initial $10 free stock purchase as well as for ongoing investments made through the BusyKid platform.""It is a way for us to really attract and bring in families,"" said Dan Schatt, chief commercial officer at Stockpile, which recently won backing from a venture arm of asset manager Fidelity. ""If you get young children connected with saving and investing, it will help them their whole life.""But there is a $14.95 annual subscription fee, per family, to join BusyKid. That fee could wipe out the yearly investment gains on small accounts. BusyKid said allowances on its platform tend to be $10 to $12 a week per child.Around 35% of Stockpile users are children. This makes the micro-investing app a ""complementary fit"" with Busykid, which lets families track chores and allowances via a cutting-edge, digital platform, said Schatt.A BusyKid customer who tries to use the $10 e-gift card will be directed to Stockpile to redeem the stock. The child then gets set up with a custodial account allowing him or her to buy and sell stocks and ETFs.Of course, once the initial free $10 stock gift is used up, children will have to use earned allowance from their parents to buy any additional stock through the BusyKid platform.To electronically fund the allowance, parents must link their bank accounts or spending cards to the BusyKid accounts. Not everyone might feel comfortable doing that on a relatively unknown platform that launched three months ago. And debit and credit cards incur a small fee — 59 cents for a $10 transaction, for example.Still, BusyKid joins a slew of new apps that entice beginners to buy stocks and ETFs by making it simple, cheap or even free to invest.In the process, they're shaking up traditional financial services firms and established online brokers such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).BusyKid users don't have to invest their earned allowance, if they don't wish to. They can instead share it with charities or spend it at retailers. But no matter which option they choose — share, spend or save/invest — they learn about work ethic, budgeting and financial decision-making, said BusyKid Chief Executive Gregg Murset, a Utah father of six.There are no hidden fees or transaction fees on the BusyKid platform, but there is a $10 minimum to buy a stock, he added. Also, BusyKid has a $1 minimum to move or pay out an allowance.Among Stockpile's kid users, the three most popular stocks are Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA), according to Schatt.RELATED:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners

229,SCHW,"Now that President Trump has ordered a delay of the Labor Department's controversial new fiduciary rule, which industry groups potentially stand to gain the most?The rule, which is slated to take effect April 10, requires financial advisors and brokers to recommend investments in the best interests of clients instead of those merely suitable. That would force advisors and brokers to put clients' interest ahead of their own profit.Financial firms have been deeply concerned about the potential effects of the new rule since it was approved last year. They fear it will hike advisory costs, making it less affordable for lower-income clients. That's why the delay has sharply boosted major banks and investment brokers.As of Thursday, 10 financial-related industry groups made the top 20 of the 197 groups tracked by IBD. Life insurance, investment bankers and brokers, and money center banks have seen big recent gains.The life insurance group includes highly rated stocks such as Primerica (PRI), which bears a 98 Composite Rating but is extended from a 73.15 flat-base buy point. The Duluth, Ga.-based insurer is a Leaderboard member. Lincoln National (LNC), with a 91 Composite, is near the top of its buy range from a 69.69 flat-base entry. New issue Athene Holdings (ATH) (95) is extended from a 48.82 buy point of a flat base. Shares have rallied nearly 30% from a 40 offering price at the Dec. 9 debut.The investment bank group includes asset managers such as Raymond James Financial (RJF), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Piper Jaffray (PJC). Raymond James is trading near all-time highs as shares ride the 50-day moving average higher. The St. Petersburg, Fla.-based company shares the top Composite Rating, 99, in the 30-stock group.The money center banks group, which includes Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS),  jumped 3% Feb. 3 on the news of the delay. The group remains near highs, following a 24% rally from its close on Nov. 8, election day, to its Jan. 13 peak.All the above stocks (except Athene) have posted 28% or better gains since Trump was elected Nov. 8, amid views that he would loosen regulation in the financial market.IBD'S TAKE: Primerica and Lincoln National are among financial and insurance stocks enjoying a ""Trump Bump."" Find out who some others are in this recent Sector Leaders article.Morgan Stanley owns the top Composite, 98, in the group. Shares are far extended from a 32.47 cup-with-handle buy point first cleared in October. The stock triggered the 20% to 25% profit-taking rule in November and has been making new highs. Bank of America's 95 Composite is second best in the group. Shares of the Charlotte, N.C.-based banking giant have bounced off the 50-day line after consolidating sideways the past two months. They tripped the profit-taking rule in late November.Goldman Sachs (also 95), which entered the profit-taking zone in mid-November, also has found support at its 50-day moving average. It's now extended from a bounce off the line near 232.Proponents of Trump's delay action include the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade organization. ""ICI supports a delay in implementation of the current DOL fiduciary rule,"" ICI President and CEO Paul Schott Stevens said in a statement. ""The Administration should use this time to address flaws in the rule and pursue a harmonized standard across the retail and retirement marketplace, coordinating with the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure investors' best interests are paramount.""The Financial Planning Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, issued a statement saying it ""strongly opposes"" Trump's delay: ""By issuing this memorandum, the President is directing the Department of Labor to produce an outcome that will likely lead to either a complete gutting of this thoroughly vetted consumer protection or lead to its outright demise. Either one is a bad outcome for American retirement savers.""RELATED:Trump Orders Delay Of Labor Department Fiduciary RuleJPMorgan, Charles Schwab, Goldman Jump On Trump's Regulatory Rollback

Energy stocks pulled back while lithium plays also sold off.Apple (AAPL) is expected to bring home $245 billion in foreign profits banked overseas to help pay for domestic projects, thanks to recently enacted U.S. corporate tax reforms. Apple pledged to contribute more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years. That includes creating 20,000 new jobs, funding a new campus and more data centers, and forging deals with U.S. component manufacturers.

235,SCHW,"Disruptive fintech startup Robinhood has fired another shot across the bow of the big online brokers such as TD Ameritrade (AMTD), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC). It will now allow investors to trade options, as well as stocks and ETFs, for free.But at least one analyst suggested that Robinhood's basic options tools may not appeal to options traders, who tend to be more sophisticated.The brokerage behind the popular Robinhood investment app, for free stock trading, said Wednesday it will charge no commission and no per-contract fee for buying or selling options, a type of derivative security. It will also forego exercise and assignment fees.By comparison, options traders pay up to $6.95 + $0.75 per contract at TD Ameritrade, and up to $19.99 for options exercises and assignments. Stock and ETF trades are $6.95 at TD Ameritrade.Robinhood described options, like equities, as a ""thing of the past"" in the digital age, when executing a trade is purely electronic.The app maker added that its options move is tied to ""the belief that sophisticated investment tools don't need to be complex or reserved for the wealthy."" It will offer both more and less advanced options strategies, such as buying calls and puts, selling covered calls and puts, and fixed-risk spreads. The different investing strategies allow investors to not only go long on a stock when they expect its value to go up, but also to short a stock when they expect its value to go down, Robinhood said.Tom Sosnoff, a co-founder of Tastyworks, a new options and stock trading platform, welcomed Robinhood's latest move. ""The self-directed investor has been overshadowed for too long by passive, herd-driven investments,"" he said.But Michael Wong, a Morningstar equity analyst, suggested Robinhood might face an uphill task growing its appeal with options traders, who are ""generally more sophisticated than equity investors, so need the better tools and information that the more established players have."" Charles Schwab acquired optionsXpress and TD Ameritrade acquired thinkorswim to have a more sophisticated options trading platform, Wong noted. He added: ""I'm not sure if a slimmed-down options trading tool is what serious options traders are looking for.""Even as investing apps like Robinhood make inroads with investors, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab and E-Trade Financial have enhanced digital offerings for a new and young audience.Shares of TD Ameritrade fell 2.3% on the stock market today, but have advanced 9% from their late September breakout past a 47.36 buy point. Schwab, a top-rated, IBD 50 stock, and E-Trade fell 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively, both also extended from recent buy points. Interactive Brokers (IBKR), which has been running up for several months, slid 1.6%.Online brokerages, including Fidelity, have been cutting stock and ETF trading fees in the past year.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? The IBD 50, which screens for leading growth stocks, is a good place to start.Robinhood is among several new investing apps that began to allow Americans to invest in stocks for free over the past two or three years. Instead of making money with stock trading fees, Robinhood makes money with premium services such as Robinhood Gold, which lets investors trade on margin and during extended hours.Robinhood is not a publicly traded company, but it is growing fast. The brokerage has more than 3 million users, up from 2 million in April, and is valued at $1.3 billion, seeing $100 billion in transaction volume since its 2015 launch.Robinhood, which started as an app, added a web-based platform in November.Clients have saved $1 billion in commission fees by using the smartphone-based platform, which is expanding to the web, Robinhood said.RELATED:These Data Show Why The Fed Doesn't Have To Hike AggressivelyBest Stocks To Buy And WatchBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis

236,SCHW,"Citigroup (C) reported strong results for the fourth quarter Tuesday and said a $22 billion charge won't change how much money it plans to pay out to shareholders. The bank stock flirted with a buy point, but has been lagging the general market in recent weeks.X Estimates: EPS to rise 4.4% to $1.19 as revenue grows 0.5% to $17.09 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of $1.28, excluding a charge of $8.43 a share related to the tax law, on revenue of $17.3 billion. Global consumer banking revenue grew 6% to $8.4 billion. International clients group revenue dipped 1% to $8.1 billion, as fixed income trading revenue sank 18% to $2.4 billion while banking revenue climbed 14% to $4.7 billion.While Citigroup booked a $22 billion charge to account for the tax changes, the effect on capital that regulators scrutinize was ""much less significant,"" said CEO Michael Corbat in a statement, noting the annual bank ""stress tests,"" or Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), that's used to determine how much in buybacks and dividends banks can pay out.""Tax reform does not change our capital return goals as we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital in the current and next two CCAR cycles, subject to regulatory approval,"" he said. ""Tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns, but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward.""Stock: Shares rallied 0.5% to 77.22 on the stock market today.

Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Big-bank and financial earnings pick up steam this week, with Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) set to release results Wednesday; Morgan Stanley (MS), American Express (AXP) and Keycorp (KEY) Thursday; and Synchrony Financial (SYF) Friday.Citigroup, as well as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, said they would take big charges from write-downs of deferred tax assets, which companies can use to ease their tax burden in the event of a loss.But banks still see long-term benefits from the tax cuts, while long-term yields have risen more than short-term yields recently, allowing banks to capitalize on the spread.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These 4 Top Tech Stocks With Strong RS Lines Hit Buy PointsDow Giant UnitedHealth Hits Buy Zone On Earnings, 2018 OutlookLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 each added 0.4%.But after Tuesday's losses, with the market due for a breather and as federal lawmakers wrestled to fashion a spending extension to keep the government operating after a Friday night budget deadline, wary investors were also watching for weak spots in Wednesday's early gains.Apple's (AAPL) decline further below its buy point, General Electric's (GE) continued weakness and Goldman Sachs' (GS) early loss following its fourth-quarter report raised red flags against the opening gains.

239,SCHW,"Buying stocks has never been easier, cheaper or more accessible, as new investment apps target millennials and beginning investors with deep interest in the stock market — but not-so-deep pockets.Robinhood promotes ""free stock trading."" Stash lets you ""start investing with just $5."" Acorns will ""invest spare change from every purchase."" And Stockpile offers ""your favorite stock by the dollar"" — so you can buy fractions of Alphabet (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN) shares, which are nearly a thousand dollars each.""Micro-investing apps have 'gameified' investing,"" said Lex Sokolin, fintech strategy director at Autonomous Research, in an interview. ""They are more about incentivizing participation in the financial markets — any participation by the younger generation — and making applications engaging and in some ways addictive.""The expansion of micro-investing apps will force the financial establishment to adapt — and could even disrupt traditional brokerages, say fintech and investing experts. But first these startups must show they can hang on to the customers they have acquired and turn a profit. That's no easy matter when incumbents such as Vanguard, Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) have steadily lowered fees or removed minimums to trade stocks and ETFs, and have improved their digital platforms for a new generation of investors to boot.But in one early sign that these fintech startups are winning over established giants, as well as beginner investors, Stockpile said Thursday it has raised $30 million in its latest round of fundraising, led by a venture capital fund backed by global asset manager Fidelity International, bringing the total it's raised to more than $45 million.In just a few years of existence, micro-investing apps have built a core audience among millennial investors with not much in the way of investable assets.And the generation that came of age with the minimalist simplicity of Apple's iPhone doesn't want to look at screens overflowing with headlines, numbers and scrolling tickers.On Robinhood, which allows people to trade stocks for free and does away with investment minimums, there's no short interest data, analyst ratings or options information. The app is stripped of the bells and whistles found on TD Ameritrade or other fully featured brokerage apps, and doesn't even have ads that clutter the screen. Its design is carefully crafted to inspire — rather than overwhelm — the first-time investor, Robinhood says.Punch a stock ticker into the app, and you see little besides price action, a chart and a buy button. To buy the stock, enter the number of shares, preview the cost, swipe up — and you're done.""Interactions must be small, fun and easy"" for first-time investors, Sokolin said. ""Micro-investing apps nailed it better than online brokers or robo-advisors.""On Stash, you can build portfolios around investment themes like ""Clean And Green"" or ""American Innovators,"" rather than try to choose between less descriptive names like the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund or the Red Oak Technology Select Fund.Marie Thomasson, a 37-year-old financial planner in Los Angeles and self-described app junkie, recommends Stash to beginning investors.The app explains ""just what you need to know about investing and no more,"" she said, contrasting it to mainstream brokers' ""white papers"" that are dry, boring, outdated or overwhelming.The average age for Robinhood's 2 million users is 28, and a third of them use the app to make their first-ever stock purchase. If you think that's young, consider Stockpile: 60% of its user base is under 30 and 30% are children, who can get set up with custodial accounts.Stockpile has no account minimums and no monthly fees. And even a high-priced growth stock like Amazon can be bought for $25 or $50 or any dollar amount an investor chooses. Stockpile makes money in part by charging a flat fee of 99 cents a trade.For that amount, investors get fractional shares in the company and, often, their first taste of stock ownership, Stockpile CEO Avi Lele said in a phone call. The brokerage also offers gift cards that can be redeemed for stock, sold online and through outlets such as Target (TGT) and Safeway.But the stock ""gift card fee"" of $2.99 online ($4.95 and up in a store) — another way Stockpile makes money — has drawn flak as a hefty commission. Stockpile argues that it ensures the gift recipient gets the full stock-gift value.Lele said the app was inspired by his own struggles to scrape together a $5,000 minimum investment required by a brokerage firm. Lele was 25 before he had the money he needed to buy the Microsoft (MSFT) stock he badly wanted.""You can buy quality stocks even when you are starting out"" on Stockpile, he added. ""You can't do much with 50 bucks at a traditional brokerage.""And for those old enough to have credit cards, the Acorns app rounds up purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the change in ETF portfolios.University of Wisconsin student James Koenig, 22, estimates that his day-to-day spending nets him a $35-$50 investment every month.""Acorns is hands-down my favorite investing app,"" he said. ""I like the idea of being able to do small amounts that eventually add up to something bigger. You don't need to make a huge commitment.""There are trade-offs, of course. Robinhood, for example, offers fewer investment choices, less robust research tools, and a mobile-only trading platform. Micro-investing apps also get knocked for making stock trading much too easy.Acorns' and Stash's $1 monthly fees sound small, but could erase the yearly gains of a beginning investor who may have a couple hundred dollars or less in the apps, critics note. Jason Kirsch, a fee-only financial planner in California, argues that users have an incentive to overtrade, which can lead to huge losses, especially for novice investors.While apps such as Acorns offer some basic portfolio tracking, Kirsch finds that in more-complex situations — such as tracking individual securities for tax-loss harvesting — ""none of these apps has built-in software that makes this easy.""And Tastyworks, a new platform that enables self-directed investors to trade any investment strategy, be it stocks, options or futures, dings such apps for doing little to build either a robust technological platform or strategic know-how for investing in the stock market.""They may have captured a nice share of the business, but they may as well be selling hot dogs,"" sniffed Tastyworks co-founder Tom Sosnoff.Meanwhile, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and E-Trade have slashed trading commissions from $8-$10 per trade to $5-$7, narrowing the advantage that the new apps have on that score. And the incumbents have minimum balances that range from zero at TD Ameritrade to $1,000 at Schwab.In addition to questions about how much money the apps can make for their users, there is the question of how they can make money for themselves while charging nominal fees, or none at all in Robinhood's case.But in September of last year, the company launched Robinhood Gold, a premium product charging $6-$200 a month for added services like buying on margin and extended-hours trading. The service is attracting high-net-worth, active investors and becoming a major revenue driver, spokesman Jack Randall said, with some Robinhood accounts now running into millions of dollars. Robinhood also earns revenue by collecting interest on the cash and securities in user accounts.As for zero-fee trades, the company says it is able to offer this benefit because its all-electronic, tech-driven brokerage platform has slashed overhead costs. Randall dismisses trading fees as arbitrary markups with no place in the digital age, when ""executing a trade is the same as sending an email.""Robinhood is adding 140,000 accounts every month to its 2 million-strong user base, which has made $75 billion in transactions since the app's 2014 launch. But Randall could not say how many accounts are actually funded or used for trading and wouldn't share data on average account size or typical starting balance.The economics of micro-investing apps are extremely challenged, Sokolin acknowledged, while arguing that their true value lies in the opportunity to leverage the attention of audiences they have acquired.""They may offer automated savings, but then up-sell into financial planning, or provide financial literacy, or create video content and add lead-generation into other categories, or sell customer data to other parties,"" he said. ""There are lots of things you can do with a big audience other than getting them to buy funds.""Robinhood says its users check the app 10 times a day on average. That kind of engagement among a highly coveted demographic whose brand loyalties are still up for grabs could be made lucrative, for example, by monetizing users' data or up-selling premium services to them.Robinhood has won $176 million in venture capital funding since its 2012 launch and is now valued at $1.3 billion, PitchBook fintech analyst Evan Morris wrote in a recent report. Stash has raised more than $79 million since its October 2015 launch and has a $264 million valuation.

241,SCHW,"Small caps and technology stocks led a rebound on Wall Street that gave the S&P 500 a record high.Gains were broad after Republicans introduced a tax reform proposal that includes a big reduction in corporate tax rates. Winners beat losers by a 7-3 ratio on the Nasdaq and by 9-to-7 on the NYSE.XThe S&P climbed 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied 1.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed nearly 0.3%. The Nasdaq is making a good rebound off its 50-day moving average, a positive signal at least in the short term. Volume rose from Tuesday's levels, according to unconfirmed numbers.But the star of the day was the Russell 2000. The small-cap benchmark surged 1.9% to a new high, extending a rally from its Aug. 18 low and narrowing a performance gap for 2017 vs. the Nasdaq and S&P 500.Financials are the largest sector of the Russell 2000, accounting for about 18% of the index. Regional banks in the index have accounted for much of the Russell 2000's surge as a rising trend in Treasury yields gives the sector a boost. Banking stocks have been shadowing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note.Yields on the two-, five-, 10-, and 30-year Treasuries began rising following Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech Tuesday, Tradeweb noted. The 10-year yield Wednesday rose 8 basis points to 2.31%. Yellen fanned expectations of a December interest-rate increase, saying that raising interest rates gradually is the appropriate strategy considering the uncertainty on inflation, Bloomberg reported. The GOP tax package was another reason financials climbed.The SPDR Financial ETF (XLF) broke out to new highs Wednesday, while SPDR S&P Regional Bank (KRE) surged 2.1%.Information technology is the Russell's second-largest sector and also performed well Wednesday. Semiconductor, fiber-optic, data-storage and other technology industry groups led the market.The shift in interest rates has sent investors fleeing from one of the most popular Treasury alternatives: the Dow utility average, which dropped 1.3%. A provision in the tax plan to limit corporate interest expenses also appears to be hurting utilities.Dozens of stocks broke out past buy points in Wednesday's trading, including financial leaders Cowen (COWN), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Bank of America (BAC) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).Other notables were SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG), Five Below (FIVE), II-VI (IIVI) and Cintas (CTAS).

243,SCHW,"LGI Homes (LGIH), NVR (NVR), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Lending Tree (TREE) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) had a terrific 2017 — and so did the industry groups of which these winning stocks form a part.X The top industry groups of 2017 include homebuilders, video game makers, mortgage firms and trading brokerages. Meanwhile, apparel and shoe retailers, coal producers and oil-and-gas drillers enjoyed a year-end burst of performance. Momentum in those groups is worth watching into 2018.LGI Homes and NVR have surged 161% and 102% this year, while homebuilding peers KB Home (KBH), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM) have fared almost as well, with gains ranging from 81% to 102%. They are benefiting from pent-up millennial demand as well as broad strength in the economy.The residential/commercial-building industry group, as a whole, soared 99.4% for the year and 23.1% in the final quarter of 2017. But headwinds loom.The housing sector tumbled in early November after the GOP tax reform plan set a cap on deductions for mortgages and property taxes. It has recovered since, but critics maintain the cap knocks back homebuilding and housing-related companies by making homeownership less affordable.Take-Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard soared 123% and 75%. Video game publishing peers Nintendo (NTDOY), NetEase (NTES), Zynga (ZNGA) and Electronic Arts (EA) follow, with gains of 74%, 60%, 56% and 33% respectively.The stocks have gained ground as the industry shifts to higher-margin digital distribution and looks for opportunities to monetize downloadable content. Esports, or professional video game competitions, are seen as another long-term growth driver.The gaming software industry group gained 78.7% this year, despite a 1.2% retreat in the fourth quarter.Lending Tree skyrocketed 236% higher, while Essent Tree (ESNT), CoreLogic (CLGX) and HFF Inc. (HF) boast gains ranging from 70% to 25%.These mortgage and mortgage insurance providers benefit, as homebuilders do, from housing's growth and strength in the sector.

The stock market posted its best year since 2013, after all, with the S&P 500 gaining 19.4%. A bull year for stocks naturally raises Americans' desire to invest in and trade equities.Several of these companies also stand to gain from rising interest rates as well as the partial Dodd-Frank rollback. The bill would lift regulatory burdens on smaller financial institutions, such as Schwab.The investment bank/brokers-finance group is up 64.3% for the year and nearly 42% in Q4.Scientific Games (SGMS) and Golden Entertainment (GDEN) sport gains of 266% and 170%, respectively. Casino giant Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is up 30%.Casino stocks have gained in part from growth in Macau, the world's largest gaming market and the only place in China where gambling is legal.

250,SCHW,"Donating to charity seems like a slam-dunk of positivity. You support a worthwhile cause, feel good about it and perhaps gain a tax deduction and expressions of gratitude from those who sought your gift.XBut for high-net-worth individuals, philanthropy and anxiety often go hand-in-hand. Deciding how much to give and where to give it can prove vexing.""Many of our clients are looking for guidance in their charitable giving,"" said Steven Wittenberg, director of legacy planning at SEI Private Wealth Management in Oaks, Pa. ""They may be anxious about whether their money is being wasted or if it's making an impact.""Developing expertise in charitable giving can separate advisors from their competitors by helping them become holistic financial advisors. By treating philanthropy as a central part of financial planning, advisors can suggest ways to enhance a client's retirement or estate plan.It's often a win-win proposal. Clients who lack a deep grounding in giving away money may appreciate their advisor's input and understanding of the charitable landscape. And advisors wind up attracting and retaining more clients thanks to their specialized knowledge of the nonprofit world and how to make the most of donated funds.""Advisors should recognize that it's an issue that many clients are worried about and position themselves as a go-to source for philanthropic advice,"" Wittenberg said. ""Some clients may not verbalize this need until we educate them.""For advisors who view charitable giving as a core part of their service, they raise the topic early and often with clients. When onboarding newcomers, they routinely ask about their charitable priorities.Even for those individuals inclined to donate generously, they may not make the most tax-efficient moves or conduct proper due diligence in allocating their gifts. Advisors can provide tools and resources to identify worthy causes while maximizing the tax benefits of giving.For clients with more ambitious plans to donate funds, financial advisors may partner with attorneys, accountants and philanthropic consultants to map out a detailed strategy. Through this team approach, the advisor-client relationship grows stronger and more lasting.""Getting specialized third-party providers involved can help identify options beyond checkbook philanthropy,"" Wittenberg said. He cites examples such as donor-advised funds and family foundations.Donor-advised funds offer a simple way for individuals to direct their giving by making a tax-deductible gift to the fund. The investment firm or community foundation that manages the fund aims to generate positive returns on the assets while distributing some of the money to charities per the donor's instructions.Of course, it's up to advisors to embrace charitable giving as part of their practice. Clients may not necessarily realize all the benefits — from tax savings to emotional gratification — unless their financial planner educates them and offers practical guidance.As more financial advisors provide comprehensive financial planning and seek ways to differentiate themselves, advice on charitable contributions has gained popularity as a value-added service.""Philanthropy was a side topic 20 years ago,"" said Kim Laughton, president of Schwab Charitable, a San Francisco-based donor-advised fund provider established with the support of Charles Schwab (SCHW). ""Over the last 10 years, we've found that the more advisors bring it up, the more clients appreciate it and want help with it.""From a business perspective, financial advisors who provide guidance on charitable giving can boost their client retention rates. It's harder for clients to leave when they've opened up about their desire to give back to their community  — or the larger society — and their advisor paves the way for them to follow through.""When an advisor is supportive of a client's philanthropy, you can forge an emotional tie with the client as a passionate helper,"" Laughton said.Providing tools and information to clients can reinforce your role as an expert on giving. For example, Schwab Charitable offers white papers to individuals who want to learn more about charitable-giving strategies.""Our most popular white paper is on donating more complex, appreciated assets to charity, such as privately traded securities, real estate and collectibles,"" Laughton said.The trickiest challenge for many financial advisors is raising the issue of charitable giving in the first place. If clients don't initiate the conversation, what's the best way to broach the subject without sounding preachy or pushy?""There's a real fear among some advisors of how to bring it up if a client isn't very philanthropic,"" Laughton said. ""It may feel like you're prying or the topic may seem out of bounds.""Mentioning charitable-giving options as part of a larger discussion of tax strategy can make sense. If you're searching for possible tax deductions, you can ask clients if they support any charities on a regular basis.RELATED:Good Listening Skills Help Separate Human Advisors From The Robos Looking For Good ETFs To Buy?

251,SCHW,"You've left a job where you have money in a 401(k) plan. Do you leave it at your old employer, or roll it over into one of three choices: the 401(k) plan at your new employer, an individual retirement account or a Roth IRA?XIn deciding where to move the money in your account, first consider that you're likely better off making one of those choices rather than taking the money as a lump-sum withdrawal. That's because you could be on the hook for paying regular income tax as well as a 10% penalty tax on the amount withdrawn. Plus, if it's big enough the lump sum could bump you into a higher tax bracket.If you do need some money to meet immediate expenses, consult with your employer or financial advisor on how to have the smallest impact on your taxes.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Mostly likely you'll want to transfer your 401(k) money to your new employer's plan or into an IRA. Two reasons for leaving your retirement money in the old employer's 401(k) plan is if it has better investment choices than the new employer's plan or your new employer doesn't allow you to join its plan for some period.Either way has advantages: 401(k)s are governed by Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) rules. This means they're protected from creditors, bankruptcy proceedings and lawsuits. You can also borrow from a 401(k), though there are pros and cons for doing so.Just be aware that old employers can ask you to remove funds from a plan if the balance is less than $5,000. In such cases, if you're unable to move that to the new employer's plan right away, you might be better off doing a direct rollover to an IRA to avoid paying taxes. In direct rollovers, money is transferred from your 401(k) account to an IRA. You don't take a check and then deposit it in the IRA. Why? Because unless you handle it right, you could end up paying taxes before you need to.Your old employer also may ask you to remove money from your 401(k) after you reach retirement age. Here again, a direct rollover to an IRA is preferred.Most financial advisors have an argument  against rolling old 401(k) money into a new employer's plan.""I always advise against rolling into the new company's 401(k),"" said Peter J. D'Arruda, president of Capital Financial & Insurance in Apex, N.C., and author of ""7 Baby Steps to a Ridiculously Reliable Retirement Income."" ""The only time it makes sense is if you have to borrow against it. But interest rates are so low now, this doesn't make sense to me. People get in trouble taking loans out of 401(k)s.""The downside of keeping money in a 401(k) is that you might pay higher fees and have limited investment choices.Traditional and Roth IRAs offer potentially lower fees and a wider range of investments, particularly if you open your IRA account at a leading brokerage, like Fidelity, Charles Schwab (SCHW) or TD Ameritrade (AMTD).If you're working with a financial advisor, rolling over to an IRA could made it easier to take a more holistic approach to your financial planning, said Jessica Iorio, executive director of the New York-based Bapis Group, a wealth planning team at Hightower.If you roll your 401(k) account money into a traditional IRA account, the money continues to grow tax-deferred and is taxed as regular income when withdrawals are made in retirement. With traditional IRAs, you must begin taking minimum distributions once you reach age 70-1/2, and those distributions are taxable.Money rolled over from a traditional 401(k) into the Roth IRA is taxed the year it occurs. But once you pay the taxes on the rollover to the Roth IRA, all the capital gains and income in the account are tax-free. You pay no taxes on withdrawals in retirement. The only catch is you have to wait until you're 59-1/2 to make tax-free withdrawals and that money earned in the Roth IRA can't be withdrawn until it's been in the account five years.Deciding whether to go with a traditional or Roth IRA depends largely on age and investment time horizon.""The questions you need to ask are what's my current income tax bracket, compared to what I project my income tax will be in the future? You want to convert (to a Roth) in a lower income tax bracket,"" said Jeff Fishman, president of Los Angeles-based registered investment advisor JSF Financial. ""How many years until retirement? If you're on the younger side, it's more compelling because then you get decades of tax-free growth.""Fishman adds it only makes sense to rollover from a traditional 401(k) to a Roth IRA if you have money outside the account that can pay the taxes.""I'm a big fan of the Roth,"" said Darryl Rosen, founder of the Rose Advisory Group, a Chicago-based independent retirement planning firm and author of the retirement planning book, ""The Race of Your Life""""There are numerous advantages to the decision to convert it to a Roth. But people don't like to pay the tax. I never advise to convert to a Roth without doing a deep dive on what their taxable income is and whether they will pay too much tax to get it done.""Rosen notes that you don't have to convert it all at once to a Roth IRA. You can roll over the 401(k) into a traditional IRA and spread the conversion into a Roth over many years.""It's not an all-or-nothing proposition,"" said D'Arruda.RELATED:How To Turbocharge Your 401(k) ReturnsWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

252,SCHW,"Though Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) didn't begin offering exchange traded funds until 2009, it's made a big impact on the industry.XIt launched its first four ETFs in November 2009 with some of the lowest operating expense ratios at the time, ranging from 0.09% to 0.15%. That challenged rival ETF providers to lower their fees.What's more, Schwab offered its ETFs with commission-free online trading to Schwab account holders.The San Francisco-based brokerage continues to live up to its reputation as a low-cost disrupter. When it launched, Schwab U.S. Broad Market (SCHB) carried a 0.08% expense ratio. Today, the cost is even lower, at 0.03%.Schwab is now the fifth-largest provider of ETFs, with nearly $80 billion in assets under management. Its proprietary ETF offerings have grown from four to 21.IBD caught up with Jonathan de St. Paer, Senior Vice President and Head of Strategy & Product for Schwab, to discuss how the investment giant became such a disruptive force in the industry and offer tips on ETF investing.The full interview with de St. Paer follows:IBD: Tell me about the strategy for Schwab ETFs, and why have ETFs become an increasingly important part of Schwab's business?de St. Paer: Charles Schwab Investment Management is driven by a desire to serve our clients' largest needs, and a belief that price and simplicity matter. We are focused on building a limited number of products that can serve as the foundation of a portfolio for a wide variety of clients. Our focused set of 21 ETFs are a great example of this strategy's success, as we've grown to become the fifth-largest ETF manager and are ranked third in terms of inflows. We're pleased to see the results that we've achieved by sticking to that long-term strategy.In Q2, we achieved the largest asset flows in our history and had the highest quarter-over-quarter assets under management growth rate amongst the top 10 ETF providers. This was the second time in Schwab ETF history that we surpassed $6 billion in quarterly flows. These strong flows helped us reach record assets under management of nearly $80 billion.We know that investors and advisors are embracing ETFs overall and we expect adoption to continue to grow. Their low costs, tax efficiency and intraday tradability drive their continued popularity. In a 2016 study of ETF consumers, 52% of RIAs and 44% of individual investors increased their investments in ETFs. Our products also have exposure in nine out of 16 robo models.IBD: What are your most significant achievements/innovations since launching Schwab ETFs in 2009? What sets your products apart?de St. Paer: We think our straightforward approach to building high quality products at a great price — without unnecessary complexity — sets us apart. In today's world of product proliferation and competing sound bites, it's important to remember that having a strong, low-cost portfolio core is vital for all investors. I was here when we launched our first ETFs in 2009, and like a proud parent, I'm thrilled to see how well our offering has grown in just eight years. Schwab ETFs have gone from 0 to nearly $80 billion in assets under management, and we are now the fifth-largest provider of ETFs.I should also mention that over the past three years (2014-16), not a single Schwab ETF saw outflows. No other top 10 ETF issuer can make this claim! And, no Schwab ETF has had to distribute capital gains yet.IBD: If your focus is on foundational products, why offer smart beta strategies?de St. Paer: We offer investors traditional market-cap weighted and Fundamental Index strategies because we believe that both can be part of a strong portfolio foundation and work well together. Each of these strategies can play an important role in a portfolio, and combining them can provide better diversification and potential for more attractive risk-adjusted returns across various market cycles.Retail investors and RIAs are embracing Fundamental Index strategies — both on their own and as a complement to market cap indexes. In fact, our Fundamental Index offering is now over $20 billion, and our Fundamental Index ETF assets under management reached $10 billion in Q2. Five of six Fundamental Index ETFs have over $1 billion in assets.IBD: Schwab entered the ETF business relatively late but has been a disruptive force in the industry. How have you managed to compete with the biggest players that have been entrenched longer than Schwab?de St. Paer: I started at Schwab almost 14 years ago, and very soon realized that this company is different. Schwab strives to challenge the status quo and looks for ways to offer clients more value and a better experience. And our scale makes that possible.Today, we compete with the biggest players in the industry because of our simple goal — we want every investor, regardless of their size, to have access to great products and pay the lowest possible costs for them. One way we do that is by remaining focused. We offer a carefully designed offering of ETFs, each of which can reach large scale. That allows us to pass the benefits of that scale back to investors through great pricing.  We were the first to offer commission-free ETFs, and we did that right out of the gate with the launch of our first products. Our market cap index ETFs have been recognized for having some of the lowest operating expense ratios in the industry. The results speak for themselves, and I feel like we're just getting started.Schwab ETFs are no longer the new kids on the block. They have been established as one of the largest and fastest growing managers in the U.S., and have compelled the entire industry to rethink costs. At the end of the day, investors are the big winners here, and that's how it should be.IBD: What's the next big thing in ETFs? And for Schwab?de St. Paer: I don't have a crystal ball, but we certainly see a continued appetite for low-cost, transparent ETFs. And in a post-DOL (Dept. Of Labor fiduciary rule) world, we expect that demand to accelerate.Investors don't need innovation in the form of more complex products that generate extra fees for managers. The proliferation of complex products has led to a lot of confusion among investors, from beginners to professionals. Providers need to focus on investors' needs, and take a hard look at products that don't work. There are too many ETFs out there that are sub-scale, complex, expensive or confusing to investors.Our goal is to have every investor, regardless of their size, pay the lowest possible costs for high-quality products that form the core of a portfolioIBD: How is demand shaping up so far in 2017, and what key trends did you see in the first half of this year?de St. Paer: Demand for Schwab ETFs has been extremely strong so far in 2017. Schwab ETFs have pulled in $13.2 billion year-to-date in flows, ranking us third in the industry. Schwab ETFs ended the second quarter with $78 billion in assets under management, up from $59.8 billion at the end of 2016. That amounts to more than 30% asset growth in six months, the largest growth of any top 10 issuer.The bulk of flows continue to go into our low-cost cap-weighted strategies. Notably, international equities, both developed and emerging markets, pulled in more assets than U.S. equities year-to-date. This is a trend we've seen across the industry as the U.S. market rally shows signs of fatigue and investors are moving to increase their international exposure. In fact, our own Schwab International Equity ETF (SCHF) has surpassed $10 billion in total net assets, the first Schwab ETF to cross this milestone.IBD: What are your most popular ETFs by total assets and flows so far this year?de St. Paer: Our most popular ETFs by flows year-to-date are SCHF, Schwab U.S. Large Cap ETF (SCHX), and Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE).  Combined, these three ETFs have grown by $6.9 billion, or 42%, in the first 6 months of 2017.Our most popular ETFs by assets under management are SCHF, Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF and SCHX.  Combined, these three ETFs have $28.7 billion in assets under management.IBD: Recent industry flow data shows just how dramatically investors are favoring low-cost index products over active management. Can you talk about that trend?de St. Paer: We know that cost and value matters to investors and even a few basis points can make a big difference over time. And as I mentioned earlier, as firms absorb the impact of the DOL rule, we expect this focus on value to continue. The fact that prices are coming down across the industry is great news for investors.Much of the asset management industry still relies on a model that's based on high-cost funds. As fee awareness and fiduciary expectations rise, downward pressure on costs will continue, and some of these managers will need to evolve. Here at Schwab, we'll remain focused on delivering foundational, transparent and straightforward ETFs — at very low cost.IBD: People are comparing you to Vanguard more; how do you feel about that?de St. Paer: We are like-minded in many respects, such as keeping costs low. However, there are many differences between our businesses — from our pricing to our service model to our use of smart beta strategies. But I think we have a more compelling value proposition — from pricing to product focus to service.IBD: How will CSIM continue to disrupt — in the next three years, five years and 10 years?de St. Paer: Schwab has a heritage of democratizing investing for 'Main Street' investors — and disrupting the industry while we're doing it. That's in our DNA and I don't expect that to change.We'll continue to disrupt by putting the client first. No matter what! It sounds simple, but if you're genuinely committed to that idea as we are, disruption will naturally follow. You can look at the last 40+ years from Schwab as proof.IBD: How can people learn to invest in ETFs — and what are the most important things to know before starting to invest in ETFs?de St. Paer: At Schwab, we encourage everyone to take ownership of their financial lives by asking questions and doing their homework. A good place to start is by talking to a professional who encourages your questions about investing in ETFs. If you prefer to do your own research, there are a number of ETF education resources and tools on schwab.com and schwabfunds.com.Saving and staying diversified are paramount. Don't get caught up in the latest pitch you've heard or ad you've seen. Before investing in an ETF, it's important to know what you're looking for and make sure the ETF you're buying provides the exposure you want. When you're confident in that, you'll want to examine costs, consider the structure and the sponsor, and review how the ETF has tracked its index over time.IBD: Will ETFs ever be a major choice in 401(k)s?de St. Paer: This is the biggest question the ETF industry has faced for many years. We believe that index products, with their low costs and broad diversification benefits, will continue to play a very important and growing role in 401(k)s, but today's retirement plans often provide index exposure through other products, like mutual funds and collective trusts. This is because of operational challenges many retirement platforms have in supporting ETF trading. That being said, we are seeing some adoption of ETFs by plan sponsors looking for low cost solutions, often coupled with personalized managed accounts, and by those who like the wide array of ETF strategies that are available. ETFs are also gaining adoption in 401(k)s as underlying investments in target date funds, and they remain a very popular choice for 401(k) participants that use self-directed brokerage accounts.IBD: What's the biggest mistake investors make in ETFs?de St. Paer: Not paying close enough attention to costs. Although low expenses are one of the big draws of ETFs, there are several costs investors have to keep an eye on. The most obvious costs are trading commissions and operating expenses. Two other misunderstood, and often overlooked, elements of cost are bid/ask spreads, and the difference between market price and net asset value.It's important for investors to understand and account for expenses when evaluating ETFs. Although total costs of ownership have been trending downward, costs still matter!RELATED:What Is Vanguard's Take On Global Growth, Active-Passive Debate?

253,SCHW,"JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) is barreling down the fast lane. Manager Giri Devulapally's fuel? Lots of financial and technology stocks, including Morgan Stanley (MS), Mastercard (MA) and Applied Materials (AMAT).X (IBD)And amid a Friday rally by the broad market as of midday, key fund holdings are rising too.Chip gear maker Applied Materials was up 2.92%. Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) was up 1.77%. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), maker of the Eylea macular degeneration eye treatment, was up 1.35%. Consumer electronics colossus Apple (AAPL) was up 0.84%. And credit card provider Visa (V) was up 0.69%.The $12.5 billion fund was up 23.04% this year going into Friday, topping 94% of its large-cap growth fund peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 15.66%. The S&P 500 was up 9.96%. The mutual fund's 23.23% gain the past 12 months topped 96% of its peers as well as the S&P 500.How has the fund achieved such eye-popping gains? It starts with the fund's investment approach. Fund literature boils it down to: ""Targeting companies with large markets, sustainable competitive advantages and strong price momentum, the Large Cap Growth Fund seeks to harness the return potential of America's fastest-growing companies.""The fund is rare in its naming strong price momentum as a trait sought in stocks and indicates acknowledgement that technical analysis plays an important role in its stock selection.Financials and tech were JPMorgan Large Cap Growth's largest sector overweights as of June 30 vs. its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Devulapally recently told shareholders that among financials he still has ""a positive view on companies with exposure to capital markets and interest rates."" His information technology overweight, he added, ""continues to be driven by a variety of industries, such as payments, semiconductors, video games, software and mobility.""That outlook has led Devulapally's fund to such holdings as money-center bank Morgan Stanley. The stock is up 9% so far this year.Brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW), up 1% this year, benefits from the float on customers' cash. Float is profit on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account. Rising interest rates lift the profit on float.In the tech stock grouping, credit payment processor Mastercard is up 28% this year. Chip gear maker Applied Materials is up 38%.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA), another member of the IBD 50, is up 49% this year. Earnings per share grew 40%, 70% and 343% the past three quarters. That's a nice rally from the prior two quarters, in which EPS fell.In the software space, digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) vaulted past Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal second quarter on June 20, reporting accelerating sales and earnings growth for the period. It also guided analysts higher for Q3. EPS grew 45%, 42% and 44% the past three stanzas.Its digital media segment provided 68% of total corporate Q2 revenue.And online payment processor PayPal (PYPL), an IBD 50 stock, is up 51% this year.Among other holdings, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has an IBD Composite Rating of 98.Share price has soared 104% this year. Strong data for a triple-pill to treat the underlying genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis have been a key driver of the stock. The biotech company expects to spend more in research and development costs for the year as it continues development of its triple-pill.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), yet another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.What else does the fund have going for it? Large-cap stock mutual funds have outperformed other U.S. diversified stock fund categories over the past six and 12 months as well as the past two, three and five years. Reflecting this fund's commitment to large-cap stocks, it owns four Dow Jones Industrial stocks: Visa, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple and Home Depot (HD).Visa, which is also one of the fund's payments stocks, is up 32% this year.Software titan Microsoft is up 17% this year.IPhone maker Apple, up 37% this year, is another one of Devulapally's mobility stocks.Home improvement retailer Home Depot fell nearly 3% on Tuesday. The company reported Q2 results that beat Wall Street expectations. But, as IBD reported, analysts see a potential slowdown in its stronger full-year outlook.After pulling back Thursday and Friday, shares were up 10% for the year.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap Growth FundHow To Make Your Boss Add $76K To Your 401(k)

259,SCHW,"Pay off debt, or save for retirement?Never has that quandary been more acute than it is right now for the younger members of today's workforce. Millennials are confronting often-crushing debt from student loans — more onerous than perhaps any other generation has faced — and trying to save for their eventual golden years.XDepending on the level of education, young professionals could be saddled with student loans totaling anywhere from $100,000 to as high as $400,000 for doctors and attorneys, financial planners say.""The level of student debt this generation is shouldering is unprecedented,"" said Jennifer Putney, vice president of participant engagement at Prudential Financial (PRU). ""It's huge.""Still, those starting to weave their way through their careers need to try to figure a way to set aside money for retirement. With concerns mounting that Social Security may not survive the latter half of this century, it's imperative that the nation's largest demographic somehow make provisions for life after those careers are over.And millennials are the first to admit it, Putney says.""Interestingly enough, it's very much on their minds,"" she said, almost as much as their student debt. ""They're going to have to figure out how to do both.""Dan McElwee, executive vice president for Ventura Wealth Management in Ewing, N.J., is a millennial himself, and at age 32 he's at the older end of that generation's spectrum. He says the debt burden makes many of his contemporaries wonder whether it's worth the effort to get the education.Those who go back to school to get an MBA, for instance, not only are adding as much as $100,000 in new debt, they may be missing out on $200,000 from two years of earnings. He says, though, that the schooling can be obtained and saving for retirement still can be done.""You have to look at it in different silos,"" he said. ""People tend to be overwhelmed by their debt numbers.""The key is to make a budget, McElwee said. Some will get ambitious about saving — putting in $100 to $200 a month — but then give up on it once they discover it's too much to set aside. McElwee says it's best to do a little of your own financial planning, and set aside a certain amount where you can keep contributing.Then take a look at other expenses, he said. Don't defer on those student loans too long, he cautions, and examine whether you're getting the best deal. It's possible to refinance student loans and make them more manageable.Adam Barringer, a certified financial planner at Charles Schwab (SCHW) in New York, is a millennial as well and says he isn't sure that student debt is the biggest burden that millennials face.Barringer, 28, tries to put it in context with the device most often associated with his generation: the cellphone. When buying a cellphone, you look for the best deals first, then you make the monthly payments on the phone and finally pick up whatever cool apps are available.In financial planning, it's best to find whatever deals are out there. With retirement plans such as 401(k)s, employers often match an employee's contribution. That's essentially free money for employees. With 401(k)s, you can contribute $18,000 a year and/or put $5,500 into an individual retirement account tax free.Then you can pay your bills — in this case your student debt and other financial obligations. Then spend the rest of your money on vacations and other expenses.""It's a simple process, and it's the same way we would approach it when buying a phone,"" he said.Colleen Jaconetti, senior investment strategist in Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group, also says matching the 401(k) is essential, but saving whenever you can is helpful. Cutting $15 a day out of everyday expenses such as coffee, lunch out of the office, or happy hour will go a long way. Even if you can do that every other day, it helps.""Try to save as much as you can and invest in low-cost investments,"" she said.How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersP-s-s-s-t, Millennials! 5 Tips For Taming Your Student-Loan DebtHow To Make Your Boss Add $76K To Your 401(k)Top Jobs For Millennials: What They Are And Tips For Landing Them6 Ways To Maximize Your Productivity By Minimizing Distractions

But a brokerage like Schwab that acts as a custodian of assets can grow both the top and bottom lines by charging a variety of fees.In a recent interview with IBD, Charles Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger said he intends to do for investment planning what low-cost ETFs, mutual funds and robo-advice platforms have helped his company do for asset allocation.In other words, use technology to make high-level financial planning accessible and affordable to all investors, at next-to-nothing cost.Schwab's Q3 report showed core net new assets grew by $30 billion, sustaining what the firm called a ""solid"" 5% annualized organic growth rate. At the end of Q3, the company had 10 million brokerage accounts and 1.1 million bank accounts, up 4% and 6%, respectively.Schwab financial consultants also held planning conversations with 34,000 clients in Q3, up 17%.

262,SCHW,"Financial services firms emerged as big winners in 2016, testifying both to an economy on the mend and to their own dexterity in navigating the postcrisis obstacle course of stringent regulations and ultralow interest rates.Many companies in the financial sector have yet to return to the heights that preceded the financial crisis of 2008. But sector leaders, such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), have long since taken back that perch.Schwab, with $2.73 trillion in client assets, is one of the world's top financial services companies. It has grown return on equity for four straight quarters, helping it earn a spot on the IBD 50 list of elite growth stocks, as well as the Big Cap 20.The stock has advanced 35% after breaking out in early August, and it made a fresh 52-week high Dec. 27.Walt Bettinger, president and CEO of Charles Schwab, ties his company's success to its relentless focus on innovation and the best interests of investors. He takes obvious pride in having shaken up an industry where steep trading commissions and expensive investment products used to be the norm.Up next: democratizing wealth management. Bettinger, 56, intends to do for investment planning what low-cost ETFs, mutual funds and robo-advice platforms have helped his company do for asset allocation.In other words, use technology to make high-level financial planning accessible and affordable to all investors, at next-to-nothing cost.In one of a series of year-end interviews with industry leaders, IBD talked to Bettinger about the changing regulatory landscape for financial services companies, his plans for 2017, and more.The Ohio native is credited with steering Schwab through the financial crisis of the last decade. Since he took over as CEO in October 2008, the value of Charles Schwab stock has more than doubled. It has more than tripled since the stock market bottom of March 2009.IBD: What were your main accomplishments in 2016?Bettinger: At Schwab, we focus each year on demystifying the process of, and reducing the cost of, investing. Some might call it innovation. Others might call it disruption. But for us, the goal is the same — to help millions of investors build a better life by investing wisely, with transparency into what they are paying and into the rationale behind our advice, with objectivity, and with a minimal drag on results from fees and costs.We call this strategy ""Through Clients' Eyes.""From a numbers standpoint, clients of Schwab will, for the fifth consecutive year, entrust us with more than $100 billion of net new assets. Our approach to service and investing plays a major role in why investors, independent advisors and corporate benefit plan sponsors entrust us with their assets.IBD: What's planned for 2017, especially for your fund and brokerage businesses?Bettinger: More of the same, but with even greater intensity.Our strategy will continue to modernize and disrupt the industry on behalf of the investor by harnessing our scale to lower costs and expand access to wealth management services that historically have only been available and affordable to the most affluent.We played a major role in lowering commissions years ago. Today, average asset management pricing is falling with the massive move toward ETFs and index mutual funds. The function of asset allocation is beginning to commoditize as technology makes sophisticated portfolio construction easier to understand and achieve, more objective and efficient.And lastly, we believe that technology is beginning to make high-level financial planning accessible to the masses of investors at little to no cost.The true winners in all of this are the investors — as they should be.IBD: What are likely to be the biggest challenges?Bettinger: Unfortunately, our industry suffers from a lack of trust among consumers.Many factors have contributed over the years — the perceived role of the industry in the financial crisis of the last decade, contrived complexity, and a general lack of passing along scale benefits to the consumer in the form of lower fees, commissions and other charges.As a member of this industry, our greatest challenge is to be different — to constantly challenge ourselves to be clear and transparent, simplify and demystify investing wherever possible, and ensure that client charges are fair and reflect the cost efficiencies that our scale can provide.IBD: Will regulatory constraints loosen ahead?Bettinger: Based on what we're hearing so far from the incoming administration, it would be reasonable to assume some loosening of regulations, or at least a slowing down of the pace of new regulation.But it's still very early, and there are aspects of the regulations enacted after the financial crisis that many in the financial services sector would agree are well-intentioned and good for investors and shareholders. Regardless of what happens, when we look at the biggest issues that we anticipate driving our strategy over the next decade, we don't think regulatory issues play a major role. They may impact our tactical execution, but not our big-picture strategic choices.IBD: What investment trends are you seeing?Bettinger: The two major trends are commoditization and transparency.As previously mentioned, commoditization has arrived for commissions (with discount brokers), is occurring right now in asset management (as seen in the shift to passive investing), is underway in asset allocation and is beginning in financial and investment planning.More specifically, commoditization in asset allocation is primarily in the robo-advice, or digital/automated advice space, and that same commoditization is going to advance from just the asset allocation portion of the investing process to the planning portion as well.Investors understand the role that technology has played in simplifying their lives, and they expect the same results from technology in their investing activities.This is not to say that professionally trained people won't play a role in investing. But people, without world-class technology, won't be enough for financial service firms to grow in the future.From a transparency standpoint, we can see it in the ""fiduciary vs. broker"" debate. We can see it in the massive move away from active asset management and toward passive asset management. We can see it in investors' expectations for greater understanding of the fees and charges they pay.And we do not believe that any of this will reverse and go the other way.IBD: How are you responding to these changes?Bettinger: Our goal is always to anticipate where clients' needs will be in the future — and to begin to position Schwab for that future state.Sometimes we refer to this as ""skating to where the puck is going,"" to borrow a line from the great Wayne Gretzky.Examples of these efforts in the past have included: our ultralow cost ETFs — priced even lower than Vanguard; our digital advisory program, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios — the largest of the true digital advisory programs with all of its great automation like rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting and goal tracking; and our low-cost target date funds with annual expenses of only eight basis points.Also our introduction of Institutional Intelligent Portfolios for investment advisors — a concept now copied by several other firms.(Editor's note: Institutional Intelligent Portfolios is Schwab's robo-advisor solution for independent registered investment advisors (RIAs). It allows RIAs to create client portfolios using more than 200 ETFs from the major fund companies.)IBD: What should investors do differently in the new year?Bettinger: In many ways, they should do the same thing every year: get engaged in their finances, ask questions and if they don't have one already, develop a financial and investment plan based on their personal goals.Our industry spends too much time and energy advising investors on which stocks and sectors to get in and out of every year. Given that it's nearly impossible to predict which asset class will perform best in a given year, what really matters is whether you have a plan with specific goals, and the right level of diversification and risk.One of our most important investing principles is: ""Ignore the Noise."" In other words, tune out the daily news about market fluctuations and look at whether you are making progress toward your goals.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewMillennial Investors Are Here, And Wall Street Will Never Forget ItShe Called The 2009 Market Bottom And Sees Stocks Muddling Through Ahead

266,SCHW,"Alex Vlasov hardly fits the stereotype of the millennial who is averse to stock market risks and skeptical of Wall Street. ""Put spreads,"" ""options monitoring"" and ""algorithm design"" are commonplace terms in his investing vocabulary.He describes his generation as ""shifting the paradigm"" to get more control over their investments. Vlasov uses TD Ameritrade's (AMTD) Thinkorswim platform for its robust analytics and options monitoring tools. And the 20-something New Yorker,  a Citigroup vice president, switches to Interactive Brokers to design algorithms and execute the most cost-efficient trades.Vlasov bears out what data from IBD's fifth annual Best Online Brokers survey indicate: Millennial investors have high expectations and seek sophistication from their online brokers.Investor's Business Daily and polling partner TechnoMetrica asked thousands of investors about their experience with their primary online broker. Millennials, those who are between age 18 and 34, made up about 9% of the survey respondents.A complex portrait of the millennial investor emerges from the survey. Among key findings, millennials are trading stocks, ETFs and other investments almost as enthusiastically as older investors. Yet they are cost conscious and the least satisfied with their broker experience among all age groups.As a result, millennials are far less likely to promote their brokers to a friend or colleague. And they are more likely to switch brokers, citing cost as the main reason for switching.Survey respondents were asked about their experiences at brokerages in the 13 categories that investors in the study deemed most important. The categories covered everything from fees, site performance and trading platforms to planning and research tools, educational help and customer service.Across every single category, millennials rated their experience lower than others.Brokers appear to face a challenge with this age group, or an opportunity, depending on how you look at it. Either way, the importance to the financial industry of what the Pew Research Center says is now the largest living American generation is clear.With the generational transfer of wealth at an inflection point, and the earnings of many millennials starting to accelerate, brokers are fervently courting this demographic.Leading online brokers are increasingly focused on their mobile platforms to capture the youngest investors.Among 415 millennials in the survey, TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers[ticker symb=IBKR] and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) were the most popular brokers. Just over a third, or 34%, said one of the three firms was their main broker.Online brokers like TD Ameritrade and Interactive appeal to more adventurous investors, on-the-move investors and amateur professional traders, relative to rivals whose images are tied to wealth management, says Morningstar (MORN) equity analyst Michael Wong.He notes that these brokerage firms specifically showcase mobile trades, options trades, algorithm testing and high-frequency trading in their marketing efforts.""Mobile is where millennials are — at their phones,"" Wong said. ""Online brokerages recognize increased investor sophistication, and millennials could be at the higher end of that sophistication level, or at least have a different concept of how to invest or what it means to be a more successful investor than other generations.""And though many millennials may seek control of their investing, their taste for technology extends to so-called robo-advice. Among investors who said their broker offered an automated investment advisory service, 56% of millennials said they had placed some assets in it, vs. 29% of investors of all ages.Low commissions and fees mattered most to millennials, as it did to respondents overall, the survey found. But the emergence of TD Ameritrade as the top broker of millennials in the survey suggests they are not just looking for the cheapest deal.Millennials consider the entire value proposition of a broker, and pricing is not the barrier to entry for younger investors that some may assume, says Nicole Sherrod, managing director of trading at TD Ameritrade.""They are big stock pickers — 55% of what millennials are investing in are individual equities,"" Sherrod told IBD in a phone call. ""What good is a cheap trade execution if you are not well-educated on all the risks of the investment you are getting into?""Sherrod describes her firm as a ""premium price player in the space,"" a position that she considers justified given its deep well of free educational content as well as analytical and trading tools.Millennials, she reports, are voracious consumers of TD Ameritrade's online content about stocks, ETFs and derivatives. And as they learn about the more sophisticated strategies, they put them into practice.In 2016, millennials used diversified instruments to invest at TD Ameritrade, including stocks, options, foreign currencies and futures. Futures and foreign-exchange activity jumped 12% over the prior year and was the highest among all age groups.Given their relatively small earnings, young investors are seeking ways to put less of their hard-earned dollars at risk while working to grow assets — with S&P E-Mini futures, for example, according to the broker.That doesn't make them risky thrill-seekers, in Sherrod's view. ""It's actually shrewd,"" she said.Young investors are a major reason why TD Ameritrade aims to make its mobile platform the best in its class, Sherrod told IBD.The firm recently released an in-app messaging feature that allows a service representative to ""take over"" the app at an investor's request — if the customer needs help with their first covered-call trade, for example. Sherrod describes the feature as a big hit with millennials.The leading online brokers may have their work cut out for them as they seek to capture the youngest investors.The millennials in the survey were far less concentrated in the largest online brokers. While 75% of all investors in the survey primarily used one of six major brokers, only 52% of millennials used one of those six brokers. More broadly, 94% of all investors said their primary online broker was one of the 24 brokers specifically named in the survey, but only 77% of millennials did.Put another way, a hefty 23% of millennials are choosing small or obscure names as their primary online broker.Of note, the ironically named Robinhood — a two-year-old stock brokerage app that touts free stock trading — was cited as the primary broker by 6% of the millennials in the survey. That is close to the 7% who cited Fidelity and 5% for Charles Schwab (SCHW), and level with Scottrade.Even TD Ameritrade, which had the highest share of millennials in the survey, was cited by 13% of millennials vs. 20% of all investors in the survey.Do those numbers suggest that the top brokers are struggling to capture this audience? Sherrod thinks not.""It's not that we're struggling to attract millennial investors, but we're attracting them to various degrees,"" she said.Morningstar's Wong points out that an investment or brokerage account is a lower priority for most millennials, who may be living paycheck to paycheck. They put any savings first into emergency funds in banks and 401(k) retirement plans at work, he says.Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica, says new players see an opening.""Millennials start trading with small accounts and are attracted to options because of the leverage they offer,"" Mayur said. ""They are commission-sensitive and knowledge-thirsty.""Some new players recognize the opportunity offered by the millennial segment. For example, the financial website Tastytrade, which has copious live shows by millennials, is expanding its operation by launching  a new brokerage firm called Tastyworks this month.""Among other survey findings, 6% of the millennial respondents were women. Millennial investors were more likely than the overall group to have some college education but less likely to have an advanced college degree.Predictably, their household income was less than average and their portfolio size far smaller at a median of $35,900. Half the millennials surveyed had been investing for less than three years.Eighty-one percent of millennials in the survey owned individual stocks and 33% owned exchange traded funds — the top two types of investments among this age group.Growth stocks were most popular, owned by 70% of millennials, followed by stable, long-term performers at 38%. Defensive stocks were among the least popular, owned by 9% of this cohort.Half the millennials traded at least five times a month, roughly in line with the overall average.RELATED:TD Ameritrade's Focus On Technology, Innovation Pays OffMillennial Investors Are Here, And Wall Street Will Never Forget ItThe Only Thing Investors Have To Fear Is No Fear Itself

270,SCHW,"Robert Webb has schooled generations of entry-level traders, teaching courses on trading and the nature and structure of markets at the University Of Virginia's McIntire School of Commerce.  He has watched trading technology advance to where the average soul on the street can use tools once reserved for the market's most elite actors.In a world where ""the cost of computation is close to zero,"" Webb says, access to the internet and reams of rapid-fire information even the playing field.  What then separates one investor or trader from another is ""critical judgment, as well as experience,"" he said. ""With the advent of high-frequency trading, it becomes even more important to trade smarter, and to recognize what you can't do.""The ability to trade smarter is what the top names in trading tools aim to provide in their online offerings. In IBD's 2017 Best Online Brokers study, all the top three brokerages in both the Equity Trading Tools and Mobile Platform/Mobile Trading Opportunities categories have been steady winners in the survey over the past three years.TD Ameritrade (AMTD), Fidelity and Charles Schwab (SCHW) hold the top three slots in both categories this year.To determine the rankings, Investor's Business Daily and its polling partner, TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, asked investors to rate how well their primary broker performed in 13 critical categories, which investors themselves judged as most important among a list of 24 broker attributes. (Read more about the study details in our survey methodology story.)All three top brokers are moving aggressively to expand and fortify their mobile trading options, while at the same time keeping entry-level tools straightforward and simple.The industry has generally adopted a three-tier model for its online trading systems. The most essential tools are set up in online web platforms at Fidelity.com, Schwab.com and TD Ameritrade.com. All three web-based tools offer broad-range functionality, ability to trade stocks and options and to create extensive and detailed watchlists, among other features. Ameritrade brands its web-based product under the name Trade Architect. Schwab's basic product is Trade Source.More aggressive investors generally gravitate to downloadable trading platforms. Fidelity's top-line model, Active Trader Pro, was developed in-house. Schwab's top-shelf product was originally based on trading tools evolved from its $488 million acquisition of Austin, Texas-based CyberCorp. in 2000. Schwab upgraded the brand to Street Smart Edge in 2011, following its $1 billion acquisition of Chicago-based OptionsXpress.The purchase was aimed partly at acquiring options-based tools and features, says Barry Metzger, senior vice president who oversees Schwab Trading Services. ""But also (a focus was) really on the talent at OptionsExpress, in being able to understand what traders want and in building great capabilities.""Ameritrade acquired its high-end offering, Thinkorswim, with its purchase of Chicago-based online brokerage Thinkorswim in 2009 for more than $600 million.While all of the high-end offerings are available to all company clients, they are specifically aimed at experienced, higher-frequency traders, rather than investors.""This is a user who knows exactly what they want to do,"" said Nicole Sherrod, managing director of TD Ameritrade's Active Trader business. ""We have clients who are trading futures at midnight, so we have to be sure that that app is just best in class.""The downloadable tools provide in-depth stock charting and tracking, the ability to automate watchlist screening and creation, and sophisticated trade placement and alert capabilities. Much of the computation is handled server-side, Sherrod explains, to avoid bogging down desktop computer memory.All three brokers offer chart pattern-recognition functions in both their web-based and high-end tools. Schwab and Fidelity contract this capability through Ottawa, Ontario-based Recognia. Ameritrade has an in-house crew who handles chart recognition.None of the leading brokerages would discuss specific numbers of clients using their products, but all report tremendous growth in their mobile trading platforms, the third tier of online trade tools, into which they are pouring an increasing amount of effort.Among the most difficult challenges across the brokerages: grafting the mobile trading tools to both the web-based and high-end products.""One of the things we really try to do is help create a consistent experience,"" said Jeff Chiappetta, vice president of client experience for Schwab Trading Services, ""where clients can easily go from any one of our platforms (to another) and have the same look and feel and trading experience.""Fidelity has steadily crafted its products in-house, using third-party assistance judiciously and minus the bolt-on strategy of acquisitions. Throughout that process, consistency in the trade experience regardless of the platform, has remained a priority, says Jennifer Samalis, Fidelity senior vice president of brokerage products and customer experience. So has the intent to keep things accessible.""One of the main driving components behind Fidelity's trading experience overall is simplicity and ease of use,"" she said.Webb's classes give some sense of how the average investor ramps up through the skill levels once beginning to trade online.The classes cater to students getting an early start in the market, and are built around institutional-grade trading products from Chicago-based Trading Technologies. These allow students to create high-volume, algorithm-driven trading programs to take advantage of tightly specified fluctuations in the market.Webb says students typically enter such courses wanting to trade stocks, and wanting to trade on a fundamental basis. He requires them to learn to trade futures, and to trade according to technical criteria.""The objective behind trading is to make money,"" Webb said. ""And some days the money may be in cocoa or sugar or cattle or crude oil. It may not be in stocks or bonds.""His goal?""Expose them to the world of trading, and let them decide how they want to trade,"" Webb said, ""but be aware that a variety of highly successful traders use a whole host of different tools.""RELATED:Invest Like A Pro With These Top Online Brokers' Research ToolsIt's A 3-Peat: Fidelity Tops IBD's Best Online Brokers Survey AgainSchwab Keeps Its Grips On Multiple Top RatingsTD Ameritrade's Focus On Technology, Innovation Pays Off

The Nasdaq shows a 1.8% gain, and the S&P 500 is up 1.1%. All three indexes have pushed to new highs. Small caps had further to go, with the Russell 2000 up 1.8% for the week through Thursday, but still closer to its 50-day moving average and lagging well below its Dec. 9 high.American Airlines (AAL) fell 2% at the open, as its fourth-quarter earnings sailed past analysts' targets. Revenue edged out expectations, a critical measure of airline sales called unit revenue turned positive for the first time in two years and the company launched a new $2 billion share buyback initiative. American ended Thursday in a flat base with a 50.74 buy point, and a more aggressive alternative buy point at 50.Microsoft (MSFT) traded nearly 2% higher. The top software developer's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue comfortably cleared forecasts, boosted by its strengthening cloud-computing business. Shares are above buy range on their third rebound from the 10-week average since clearing a flat base in October.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) dealt an early 8% gain despite reporting late Thursday its fourth-quarter earnings came in far below analyst expectations. A 37% revenue gain, however, clobbered estimates and better-than-expected results from the Wynn Palace in Macau boosted investor sentiment. Wynn has traded through a series of consolidations for the past nine months, and ended Thursday 15% below its September high.Chevron (CVX) dropped 3% after a weak fourth-quarter report.

While Netflix and a few tech earnings were standouts, banks are losing steam after a strong run while Exxon Mobil (XOM) and other energy stocks are pulling back. Steel stocks popped Wednesday after Trump's Commerce Secretary nominee signaled more tariffs on Chinese steel, but later gave up their gains.

It made harmless moves, as most senior equity traders have already taken off for the three-day holiday weekend.The Russell 2000 gained 0.6% en route to a mild weekly gain, cutting away some of the prior week's 1.7% sell-off.

The megacap tech bounced off a mild intraday low of 115.59 to close a bit higher at 116.52.As noted in a recent Stock Market Today column, Apple has done enough hard work to craft a cuplike base that sits atop another cup-with-handle pattern. That latter pattern was formed out of a long bottoming base.The question for market observers now is this: Will the market show enough strength for new breakouts by Apple and others? Or, will Apple pull back to shake out the last uncommitted holders who have been sitting on paper losses and eager to bail out?That, in essence, is the psychology behind the building of a cup with handle. Remember that a handle should reflect a shakeout, and thus you'll see a downward slant along the lows as a handle forms. With narrow handles, check the slope on a daily chart. The minimum length of a handle on either a cup, double bottom or saucer is five trading sessions, or a week, on a weekly chart.Nvidia represents the future of computing, and the roles of semiconductors to make machines and devices connected to the internet, and enhance people's lives and the workplace.The Santa Clara, Calif., firm also currently boasts superior IBD Ratings, including a 99 Composite at IBD Stock Checkup on a scale of 1 to 99; a 96 EPS Rating; a 99 RS; and a top-flight A for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity).Are there other large-cap companies that more or less match Nvidia's solid ratings?

283,SCHW,"Think you've got the post-election stock-market winners' sorted out? Well, have you considered consumer discretionary or companies likely to gain an edge as new tax rules are applied? Award-winner Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) sees stocks like CarMax (KMX), Charles Schwab (SCHW), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) doing well as a Trump administration ushers in corporate tax cuts and interest-rate hikes.Schwab and Fox also stand to benefit from demographic trends and the rising prospects of media-content winners.And despite issues weighing on Alphabet, Macauley expects the internet giant to nearly double earnings in the next five years.The $2.4 billion Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) is a Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner. To learn more about its managers' visions of likely stock-market leaders in the months and years ahead, IBD turned to Brian Macauley, one of the fund's three managers. Macauley, who is 42 years old, shared insights on those and other stocks he thinks will do well as corporate America adapts to life under new political leadership. He spoke from his office in Arlington, Va.IBD: Your fund's low turnover rate makes it look static. But the fund is flexible in other ways. Is that its real secret sauce?Macauley: Right, we don't manage to a style box or by market-capitalization size.This is a go-anywhere portfolio with an emphasis on finding long-term compounders — businesses with the competitive position, growth, and management to create outsized value over an extended period of time. We most often find business with these characteristics in the mid cap space, but sometimes small- or large-cap companies will fit our model.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders We try to build a portfolio with attractive expected returns and low risk of loss. We do not want artificial capitalization limitations or style boxes to constrain us.IBD: You recently told me your usual turnover rate is slightly higher. Why is that?Macauley: On average our turnover is about 15%. This past year is one of the lower years. The reason is that in general we've not had a lot of market volatility, so we haven't seen a lot of mispricing to take advantage of.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceIBD: Whether 4% or 15%, this fund differs from its Hennessy stablemates, which rebalance just once a year, right?Macauley: We buy and sell when it is appropriate in the marketplace. We have a very different approach from our stablemates.IBD: Your turnover rate is a fraction of the 66% pace for U.S diversified stock mutual funds on average, according to Morningstar Inc.Macauley: Right.IBD: Tell me more about the traits you seek in stocks.Macauley: We're looking for businesses with a wide competitive moat, durable competitive advantages that can earn outsized returns on capital even if competitors come into their market. We look for businesses that have a different mousetrap that can gain a lot of market share over time, or that have a secular tailwind that benefits them or their whole industry.We look for high quality management that thinks and acts like long-term owners. We look for a low risk of catastrophic outcome. We try to stay away from situations where there's rapidly changing technology or a fad or a fashion risk.And we try to meld growth with valuation. We will pay for quality, but we want to make sure we get in at a discount. Warren Buffett says that a lot of accounting vagaries obscure the true economics of a business. We try to look through vagaries and understand a business's true economics.IBD: I know this is unlikely, but has the fund done anything to take advantage of the Trump election?Macauley: We don't make directional bets based on individual economic influences. We had a number of REITs and yield-sensitive positions do poorly (amid election results), but those have been offset by strength in our more consumer discretionary and yield beneficiary names.Names that benefited were CarMax, Charles Schwab and Encore Capital Group (ECPG).CarMax is the largest used-car retailer in the U.S. It has a differentiated consumer proposition — it is a no-haggle-on-price dealer. And it offers a wide selection of late-model used cars, making them easy to use to purchase a car.IBD'S TAKE: To get a handle on whether no-haggle pricing helps car-sellers like CarMax, read this IBD report.They've grown to 170 stores and should be able to about double their store base as they march across the U.S. in the next 10 to 12 years.They get two benefits from the Trump election. One, if there are tax cuts, then consumers will have more discretionary dollars in their pockets. Second, they are a purely U.S. company that pays a high tax rate. To any extent that corporate tax rates change, they could see a cut.Schwab is a broker and custodian of investor assets, serving individuals, wealth planners and registered investment advisors. They benefit from brokers leaving wirehouses like (Bank of America (BAC)-owned) Merrill Lynch and becoming fee-only advisors. Schwab provides the enabling technology for advisors to do that. Also, as baby boomers retire and roll their 401(k) balances into IRAs and look for financial advice, Schwab is a solution for them.And Schwab holds a lot of cash from clients. They can lend that out and buy securities with it. As rates rise, they earn more from that.IBD'S TAKE: Schwab is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank/Bankers industry group due to key growth metrics. It has a top-notch IBD Composite Rating. Consulting IBD's Stock Checkup is a quick way to get a handle on the traits of a stock like this.Encore Capital Group purchases charged-off credit-card receivables. Encore is a specialist in trying to get people to pay what they owe on those credit-card debts. Regulatory burden has compressed this industry to essentially two competitors that control 90% of the industry. It's difficult for new players to come back in. And it takes a large operation to collect debt efficiently.A softer regulatory environment should allow the supply of debt to come to market more quickly.IBD: Does Alphabet's recent softness reflect investors' fear that a Trump presidency will bring trade wars and an economic slump?Macauley: Our thesis is that between growth in online advertising and improved monetization of mobile search and growth at YouTube, that Google (Alphabet) should nearly double their earnings over the next five years. From the current valuation, that's a reasonable opportunity given the high quality business we believe Google is.Their competitive moat is not technology so much as it is users' habits. So there's a low risk of Google being leapfrogged.The election has done three things: One, it has caused scrutiny of low corporate tax rates. We think Google's taxes are not so low, but there still could be some increased tax burden. Second, if there is a trade war, Google and other large technology companies are high-profile places that other countries can retaliate against. Finally, there is the obtuse risk that these technology companies were biased in their presentations of (political) information during the campaign. They may receive more scrutiny from the new administration because of that.IBD: What's driving accelerating earnings per share growth at American Woodmark (AMWD), a kitchen cabinet maker?Macauley: About half of their business is driven by new home construction, which is still climbing out of a depression. We have a long way to go to get to long-term historical norms, so that cyclical uplift is a tailwind.Another thing: during this housing recession they had net cash that they used to improve their service levels and gain market share.After partnering with Home Depot (HD), then Lowe's (LOW), then large home builders in the 1980s, in the last few years they finally had the bandwidth to service the small kitchen-bath market.And they've culled out a lot of lower margin customers in the last few years, filling their capacity with higher-profit customers. So they will have much higher operating margins going forward.And they benefit from the election. Some of their competitors import products. Woodmark pays a full tax rate, so if corporate taxes go down they benefit. And if people have more discretionary income due to tax cuts, they're more likely to buy a home or remodel.IBD: Marlin Business Services (MRLN), which provides leasing for small-ticket equipment leasing, has trended higher in recent weeks. Any election cause and effect?Macauley: They are simply very good at underwriting those leases. They work with people leasing copying machines, equipment for dentists' offices, restaurant equipment. Because of the regulatory environment, regular banks have pulled back from this space. Even where banks compete, it can take weeks to get a loan from banks, but just hours from Marlin. And Marlin is working to bring this to other (business areas). That provides a good forward outlook.IBD: Why do you like 21st Century Fox among media companies?Macauley: The media world is separating into winners and losers, and 21st Century Fox will be a winner. They have must-have content. And they are included in all important over-the-top solutions like Hulu, Google Unplugged, Dish Network (DISH).IBD: Does ""over-the-top"" mean independent from a cable provider?Macauley: Yes. All you need is an internet solution. It's a more efficient means of distribution. People who want to cut the cord with their cable provider are likely to end up with a noncable solution that includes Fox content. And over-the-top is attractive to advertisers because ads can be targeted and lower advertisers' cost per thousand of reaching viewers.In addition, Fox owns 30% of Hulu, which we think will be successful.IBD: Insurance seems staid. What's the appeal of Aon (AON)?Macauley: This is a company that should be relatively a-cyclical, with a low teens growth profile.They are one of only three providers with a global insurance footprint, so there aren't many other places you can go for global coverage. And with their size, they collect a tremendous amount of data. They create information solutions that are valuable to clients and insurance companies, which enables them to grow market share. And they are available at a fairly attractive price — about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: American Tower (AMT) pulled back after the election. Do you still like it?Macauley: The stock has come under pressure as almost all REITs have because interest rates have risen and there's some expectation they might continue to rise, which would make (some) REITs worth less.In addition, there's concern that the new administration would be more amenable to a merger between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS). Obama was strongly against the merger. If two large tenants merge, it would reduce revenue growth at American Tower for some period.Despite the risk, with its growth profile this is one of our four best ideas, which is why on one of our largest positions we (recently) could buy it cheaper than it was just days earlier.IBD: Why has O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) rallied in recent weeks?Macauley: O'Reilly is the best in their industry at getting parts to customers quickly. They've set up a distribution network that's more robust than anyone else's. And in this business, especially on the commercial side, a mechanic needs same-day parts so he can fix a car and return it to a customer in the afternoon. O'Reilly is in the best position to do that.They have 4,500 stores today. They'll have 6,500 or 7,000 stores in the U.S. over the next 10 years.They pay a full tax rate, so any tax cut should benefit them. As for possible new tariffs, they do import parts from Asia, but all of their competitors do as well. And any increase in tariffs will be passed on to their end customers.IBD: Mistras Group (MG) gapped down 13% on Oct. 7, a day after reporting a 4% decline in first-quarter EPS growth and a downward revision for the fiscal year. It has rallied since then. Do you still like the stock?Macauley: If you run an oil refinery, let's say, you deal with a very corrosive product. Mistras inspects plants to make sure it does not blow up. They are the leader in nondestructive testing for oil and gas and other infrastructure assets, like aerospace and bridges.Our thesis is that they can hold their market position and improve margins by applying some better-business practices being brought to them by the CFO they hired a few years ago. The business will be valuable to a private equity or strategic buyers. We think somebody else will own it after (current management) fixes the operations.IBD: Since you don't trade a lot, how do you spend your days?Macauley: We spend time monitoring businesses we own and industry developments. We have a watch list of 75 companies that represent our next-best ideas, and we always try to stay on top of that. It's a continual process of looking for ideas that are superior to what we already own.IBD: How do you and your co-managers divide portfolio responsibilities? Is each of you responsible for certain sectors, for example?Macauley: We're all equally responsible for names in the portfolio. Our voting on trades is one-third, one-third, one-third, majority rules. Day to day, we have a primary analyst in charge of each name. I'm the primary on CarMax, for example. My partners know my primary businesses well, but not in quite as much detail as I do.IBD: Financials are the fund's largest sector, with a 29% weighting as of Sept. 30. Why is that?Macauley: There is an important distinction for us. We're really invested in specialty companies. We do not tend to own traditional depository banks or commodity financials. Markel (MKL) is our largest. It's a specialty insurer. It's also our oldest holding. The records don't still exist, but I believe it's been in the fund since the fund opened in 1997.Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) (the fund owns A shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange) is an alternative asset manager. It invests in assets other than stocks and bonds. It owns office buildings, toll roads, retail real estate, hydroelectric plants, electrical transmission lines. They are infrastructure related assets.IBD: You had a 15% cash weighting as of Sept. 30, well above the industry average. Is that much cash normal?Macauley: We've averaged about 8% over the past seven years. We've had a lot of inflows. We're patient about deploying new capital.IBD: How long does it normally take you to build a full position in a stock?Macauley: Every situation is different.

284,SCHW,"A federal appeals court on Thursday declined to slap down the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule, which is intended to minimize conflicts of interest by brokers and financial advisors dealing with clients' retirement accounts.The court action was a setback for opponents of the DOL and Obama administration rule, which requires brokers and advisors to recommend investments that are in the best interests of clients, not merely suitable for them. As a result, the new rule will require brokers and advisors to put their clients' best interest before their own profit.Discount brokers like Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) are expected to benefit from the rule. A Goldman Sachs report said the rule will likely heighten investors' concern about fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs and passive mutual funds. That should benefit iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.IBD's TAKE: This IBD report analyzes the financial impact of the fiduciary rule on workers and on the financial services industry.In its Thursday ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied a request by the National Association for Fixed Annuities for an emergency injunction against the DOL and Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez.In their order, D.C. Circuit judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, David Tatel and Sri Srinivasan said NAFA ""has not satisfied the stringent requirements for an injunction pending appeal.""The Justice Department had asked the court to not enjoin regulations that had been issued after six years of public comment, which the government called essential to the nation's retirement security.The department had described NAFA's accusation that the new regulations will cause irreparable harm to members of the annuities group as speculative.Critics of the new rule say it will make some retirement investment advice unaffordable by middle-income families.More lawsuits against the fiduciary rule are still pending in Texas, Kansas and Minnesota federal district courts.How President-elect Donald Trump will deal with the fiduciary rule is a wild card. Trump and his intended Labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, are seen as advocates for reduced regulatory burdens.RELATED:New, Tighter Retirement-Advice Rule Raises Industry ConcernsNew DOL Rule Forces Investors To Weight Their Options

287,SCHW,"Millennial investors confound those who want their business. Are they less likely to invest than older Americans, or are they investing at an earlier age? Studies show the answer is yes to both questions. Are they completely smitten with ETFs, or are they favoring mutual funds in their workplace retirement plans and buying stocks in brokerage accounts? Again, the answers are yes and yes.Young Americans' investing habits have drawn intense study by the financial industry. And little wonder. The likes and dislikes of young investors matter to Wall Street.Millennials — born between 1982 and 2004 — have overtaken baby boomers as America's biggest living generation. The oldest are poised to become midcareer professionals and a more potent investing force in the coming decade. And with a historic $30 trillion transfer of wealth from older to younger generations expected over the next 30 years, the stakes to manage their inheritance assets and investments are high.The research to date points to opportunities for brokers and asset management companies, but maybe not their recent business models. So expect more change: increased automation, expanded services, different investment products and industry mergers.""Millennials play a key role in the future of our industry,"" said Keith Denerstein, director of product management at TD Ameritrade (AMTD). ""Approximately one-third of our new accounts are from millennials, and while they're in the early stages of the investing life cycle, they've already proven to be extremely savvy with their investment decisions.""This generation invests less because they have fewer assets and retirement seems far away, but they worry about saving for retirement. And while young people do invest in stocks and mutual funds, they clearly are near the lead of the broad U.S. shift from active trading to passive investing.Experts say millennials' love for funds that passively track market indexes could reshape the investment industry and intensify the shift away from trading as a means to generate revenue.""The writing has been on the wall for a long time that trading commission prices are in a secular, long-term decline,"" said Michael Wong, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. ""To offset that, investment firms are choosing asset-based fees, which work well for (their) clients that do not trade that much.""The latest example of this trend comes via TD Ameritrade. As commission pressures intensify, the brokerage firm is pushing more aggressively into new business segments that are less tied to fees from trades and more tied to fees from asset management and banking services.In October, TD Ameritrade announced it is buying smaller rival Scottrade for $4 billion. The purchase gives the Nebraska-based company a larger bank footprint as well as additional client accounts. And in November, it became the latest financial firm to unveil its own robo-advisor services, a fee-based source of revenue.At TD Ameritrade, millennials had 54% of their investments in stocks vs. 16% in ETFs and 9% in mutual funds as of June.That would seem like a shot in the arm for active trading and stock picking. Yet the company told IBD its millennial clients are steadily increasing their investments in ETFs and funding those purchases by investing less in individual stocks and cash.The online broker is making efforts to teach more millennials how to invest in stocks.The TD Ameritrade U initiative gives college students the opportunity to put financial and economic theories learned in the classroom into practice. They get free access to virtual accounts that allow them to actively trade on the Thinkorswim platform without risking any real money.Commission-based revenue accounts for roughly 40% of Ameritrade's total revenue and has held steady at that level for a decade. The remaining 60% of its revenue is asset based.TD Ameritrade's stock jumped more than 2.0% Wednesday to a 52-week high of 41.12. Post-Thanksgiving, it pegged a fresh high of 41.21 but now sits about 1.0% below that level.IBD'S TAKE: Traditional money managers adapted to meet the needs of millennials by launching or acquiring robo-advice platforms. Whether investors will ultimately benefit remains to be seen.The challenge to grow asset-based fees and diversify revenue streams won't go away anytime soon, experts say.""Schwab (SCHW) is a role model for a certain type of retail brokerage,"" Wong told IBD in a phone interview. It has successfully grown asset-based revenue, through proprietary and third-party mutual fund and ETF offerings, as well as spread-based revenue, generated from client cash balances in deposit and brokerage accounts.In recent years, Charles Schwab expanded its own ETF suite from six to 21 funds, included non-Schwab ETFs on its OneSource commission-free trading platform, debuted a robo-advisory service dubbed Intelligent Portfolios, and significantly increased brokerage and banking branches.With a retail client base of nearly 7 million accounts and more than $1 trillion in assets, Schwab's business is underpinned by individual investors.The company's client assets total $2.71 trillion, reflecting its evolution from discount broker to a complex financial entity with interests in securities brokerage, banking, money management and financial advisory services.The shifts in its revenue patterns over time are illuminating.Trading revenue of $866 million accounted for 13.6% of Schwab's total net revenue of $6.38 billion in 2015 vs. 49% in 2000.Over this period, asset-based fees and interest revenue swung the other way. They accounted for 81.1% of Schwab's total net revenue last year vs. 48% in 2000.That trend may suggest active trading is on the decline. It may seem to confirm the view that Americans are increasingly becoming passive investors. Schwab, however, believes the shift from active to passive is nuanced.ETFs trade like a stock, and investors are using these passive vehicles in extremely active and tactical ways, the company points out.""The use of passive products — like index-based ETFs — doesn't mean that clients are being passive about their investing strategies,"" a Schwab spokesperson told IBD in an email.Schwab earns a place on the IBD 50 list of elite growth stocks as well as the Big Cap 20.For three quarters in a row, Schwab has grown margins after tax from year-earlier periods. The stock is far outperforming the S&P 500 in the second half of 2016. It's up more than 60% since late June.Shares of Schwab jumped more than 2.0% to a 52-week high of 39.22 in above-average trading Wednesday, but by Monday had eased to roughly 1.0% under that level.Schwab's success is tied, in part, to its scale and clout. This creates a ""network effect,"" Wong says.The more clients Schwab has, the more asset managers want to distribute their own products via its platforms. And the more third-party product managers — such as State Street (SST) and Wisdomtree (WETF) — that use the platform, the more clients want to sign up with Schwab, he adds.Financial firms are busy trying to plumb the millennial mentality through surveys, conference workshops, social-media outreach and more.They are learning that this youngest generation of investors has jumped on the gospel of low-cost, passive investing and of staying invested for the long haul. Recent studies by Schwab and TD Ameritrade recorded them as having more of their investments in ETFs than older investors.""Millennials have come of age in a world where ETFs have always been available and where passive investing has been a successful strategy,"" said TD Ameritrade's Denerstein.The firm's client data show millennials have the same top ETF holdings as older investors — plain-vanilla funds such as Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI), SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV) and Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO).This year, neither the early stock market pullback nor the Brexit vote shook those millennial clients out of their favored buy-and-hold, passive investing style.Denerstein finds that encouraging ""for a generation that might have been turned off"" after seeing two major stock market crashes gut their parents' portfolios. RELATED:As Robo Advisors Go Viral, Where Do Traditional Money Managers Go?

288,SCHW,"Long known for a strong corporate culture and cutting-edge technology — and a longtime mainstay in IBD's annual best brokers list — TD Ameritrade (AMTD) is showing no signs of slowing down, even with a market capitalization of $24 billion.When the company came out with fiscal first-quarter results earlier this month, it announced $19 billion in net new client assets, as well as record client assets of $797 billion, up 15%. Client trades per day jumped 11% to 487,000.Newly tapped Chief Executive Tim Hockey cited the ""Twitter effect"" for the newfound momentum in trading.""A lot of portfolios were repositioned as a result of Trump's win,"" he said. ""It also drove more investors who are normally less active in the market to come back into the market.""Pre-election, client trades per day were at 451,000. Postelection, they jumped to 514,000 and were holding steady in early January at 508,000.Hockey wouldn't mind at all if Trump continues to tweet.""His tweets drive market activity, whether it's related to individual companies, industry sectors or the U.S. dollar,"" he said.TD Ameritrade earns high scores from customers, ranking among the top three brokers in Overall Customer Experience in the 2017 IBD Best Online Brokers study by Investor's Business Daily and polling partner TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence.Rankings are based on a survey of thousands of investors, who rated how well their primary broker performs on 13 important characteristics. (See our methodology for more details on how the rankings were determined.)TD Ameritrade scored in the top three in 11 of the 13 service areas. It received the highest rating in three categories: equity trading tools, mobile trading platforms and options trading platform.Already the No. 1 online broker based on trading volume, TD Ameritrade recently announced plans to acquire Scottrade for $2.7 billion. The deal still faces regulatory scrutiny and isn't expected to be approved until the second half of the year. Once completed, the combined company's transactions are expected to increase to around 700,000 trades per day.Hockey, a former Toronto-Dominion Bank executive with 32 years of experience in retail banking and wealth management, took over in October from Fred Tomczyk, who led the company from 2008-16. Hockey's promotion to the CEO post is ironic, because Tomczyk was a defenseman and a captain for the Cornell hockey team.""I've known him for some 20 years,"" Hockey said.Going forward, Hockey says TD Ameritrade's focus is on the client experience.""Companies that try to be everything to everyone are not being explicit about their brand proposition,"" he said. He later added: ""Apple is great on product, Ritz-Carlton is great at client experience and Wal-Mart is good at pricing. All three are great brands because they chose to compete more explicitly on one dimension.""In December, Hockey announced plans to increase tech spending by 25%.""Technology is integral to the client experience,"" Hockey said. ""There's a lot of opportunity ahead with new innovative capabilities coming online.""In December, TD Ameritrade launched a service to bring financial market updates and stock quotes to clients using voice-enabled search through Alexa, Amazon's (AMZN) virtual assistant.Derivatives (options and futures) remain a focal point for the company as they made up about 43% of daily average revenue trades in the first quarter.In TD Ameritrade's Trade Architect platform, the Trade Finder tool simplifies the process of making an options trade. Just enter four simple criteria and the tool delivers trades that match your search. Using Ameritrade's Thinkorswim platform, option traders can access Stock Hacker to screen for stocks using fundamental, technical and option-related data. Trade Flash – a real-time streaming feature which shows large stock block trades - was enhanced to show large option trades as well.Mobile trading continues to grow in popularity, and it's a strength at TD Ameritrade. In the first quarter, average daily mobile trades came in at a record 99,000, making up about 20% of total trades.The company continues to invest heavily in mobile, with a recent focus on bringing mobile apps more in parity with trading platforms. Mobile Trader, for example, recently added several new features, including the ability to sort watch lists by any column while keeping device bandwidth low.Mobile users also can customize symbol profile data to view data most relevant to them. Option traders can now view implied volatility and how much a stock is expected to move for each expiration date.So-called ""fintech"" firms like TD Ameritrade have been shaking up the financial services arena for a while now, offering cheaper alternatives to traditional money management.""We're getting back to our financial roots. We were the original disruptors in the wealth management industry, along with Charles Schwab (SCHW),"" Hockey said.It's also moving forward. Essential Portfolios, launched in 2016, is TD Ameritrade's first robo-advisor offering, an automated, digital advisory service. With it, investors get the benefits of professional management with simple portfolios at low cost.Investors can set a goal, assess their risk-tolerance level and set long-term dates for key financial goals. There are five model portfolio strategies to choose from with fund recommendations by Morningstar Investment Management.In addition, TD Ameritrade's Amerivest Managed Portfolios digital interface was recently overhauled to give clients a self-guided tool to define individual investing goals, select an investment solution and track progress with as much or as little human support as clients want. Fifteen diversified asset allocation models, constructed with mutual funds or exchange traded funds, are offered.""We've been designing our products for our financial advisors and clients together. This way, we can find the sweet spot between the client experience on the digital side and in person,"" said Lule Demmissie, managing director of investment products and retirement.In November, TD Ameritrade integrated earnings analysis tools into its Thinkorswim trading platform, including earnings estimates from Estimize, an open financial estimates platform that combines fundamental estimates for stocks from more than 3,000 independent buy-side and sell-side analysts, private investors and students.Crowd-sourced estimates by Estimize have been shown to be more accurate than Wall Street 70% of the time.On top of that, investors can go back as far as two years and get quarter-by-quarter comparisons for a complete view of a company's earnings history.In terms of charting, a new feature is the Candlestick Pattern Editor. Users can create their own candlestick patterns in addition to an extensive list of predefined ones.Perhaps the best-known candlestick pattern is the Doji, which has been shown to be useful in detecting trend reversals. For investors new to candlestick charts, the Thinkorswim learning center is filled with educational content.The Social Sentiment feature (Social Signals) helps investors with trading decisions based on Twitter mentions.""We're not so much interested in picking company cash tags (as an example, IBM's cash tag is $IBM), but we are interested in what consumers are saying favorably or unfavorably about a company's product,"" said Nicole Sherrod, TD Ameritrade's managing director of trading.Sherrod recalled a time about two years ago when Twitter sentiment was flagging trouble at Sears before the negative headlines started to hit. And using Deckers Outdoor as an example, Sherrod said: ""Social Signals isn't really interested in $DECK mentions, as it is a tweet that says: 'Hey it's cold out. I'm buying a pair of Uggs,'"" she said.Thinkorswim also offers the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED), where investors can review historical economic data from more than 80 different domestic and international sources with access to to nearly 400,000 data points.""What's going on with the Fed and the broad economy is more important now than ever before,"" Sherrod said.RELATED:It's A 3-Peat: Fidelity Tops IBD's Best Online Brokers Survey AgainSchwab Keeps Its Grips On Multiple Top Ratings

291,SCHW,"Stocks bucked out of the chutes on Friday, racking up broad early gains as investor optimism got a lift from oil prices, overseas markets and some healthy economic news.The Nasdaq spiked 2.4%. The S&P 500 vaulted 1.9% higher and the Dow Jones industrial average hauled in a 1.4% opening gain. Small caps leaned toward the high end of the action, with the Russell 2000 pumped up 2.4% in early trade.Volume rose, up 27% on the NYSE and 9% higher on Nasdaq vs. trade at the same time Thursday.The stock market today's early redemption rally lifted the Nasdaq 1.4% for the week and the S&P 500 0.9%, putting both within reach of their first weekly gain this year.Oil was a key factor, as West Texas Intermediate oil shot up more than 5%. Brent crude prices spiked past 6%, lifting both back above the $31 per barrel mark and positioning oil prices for their first gain in four weeks. A passel of factors, including possible new stimulus measures in the eurozone and cold weather in the U.S. and Europe, lifted prices for a second day and appeared to squeeze out some short sellers. WTI oil traded up 5.5% for the week and nearly 19% above Tuesday's low.Economic news was also a positive.U.S. manufacturing firmed in January, according to researcher Markit, which placed its preliminary Purchasing Managers Index estimate for January at 52.7, up from 51.3 in December and well above consensus views for a downtick to 51. Output and new business underwrote the gains, Markit said, while employment and inventories eased.New-home sales spiked in December to an annualized rate of 5.46 million. The National Association of Realtors put November's sales rate at 4.76 million homes sold; consensus estimates had called for an increase to a rate of 5.2 million sales for December.Leading economic indicators for December, reported by the Conference Board, fell 0.2%, according to Econoday. November's figure was revised upward to 0.5%.Energy stocks dominated the S&P 500 in early action, but just behind that phalanx rode a healthy mix of gainers.Chipmakers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) spiked 6% apiece.United Continental (UAL) rebounded 5% in heavy trade. The airline reported weaker-than-expected revenue and earnings on Thursday.Brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW) climbed more than 4%, its first advance this week, in double it average trade.American Express (AXP) took the hardest hit on both the S&P 500 and the Dow, down 10% despite reporting Q4 revenue and earnings declines that were harsh, but not as bad as expected.Among leaders, EQT Midstream Partners (EQM) swung up 5% in soft trade. The second straight advance put shares up 1.7% for the week, but still below their 10-week moving average.LinkedIn (LNKD), Veeva Systems (VEEV) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) rose more than 4%.Ligand is rebounding from a test of support at its 200-day moving average, preparing to test resistance at its 50-day line. Veeva and LinkedIn have more repair work to do before their charts offer any possible buy points.At the weaker end of the IBD 50, Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) posted a loss of nearly 2% after backing away from a test of resistance at its 50-day line.

292,SCHW,"Your financial future is up to you. Savvy ETF investors don't allow the ebb and flow of the stock market to throw their plans and portfolios off track. They treat even a very good year for exchange traded funds with dispassion.As 2016 draws to a close, most major asset classes — not including foreign developed-market equities — are up on the year. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is up nearly 9%, ahead of its 10-year average annual gain of nearly 7%.Even a shock presidential election result, expected to create a flight to safety, saw the stock market climb to flirt with all-time highs.The annual portfolio tuneup at this time of year is not just a time to drill into the nitty-gritty of your individual ETF holdings — their performance and fees vs. the benchmarks and relative to rival funds, for example. It's also a moment to take a step back and look at the big picture.Your ETF winners in 2016 — small companies, high-yielders and emerging markets, for example — may mean a portfolio with far bigger stakes in those asset classes than you realize. In effect, investors are set up for increased volatility and potentially big losses if the markets reverse.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016And indeed market trends change. Tony Davidow of Schwab tells IBD his research shows there's no pattern to how the different asset classes performed over the past decade. Emerging markets are at the top this year, as in 2005, 2007 and 2009. They were at or near the bottom in 2008, 2011 and 2015. Other asset classes were just as erratic.So, in his view, it's best to diversify your portfolio with the goal of seizing opportunities and reducing risk. Investing in ETFs — which tap virtually every known asset class and world region — makes that easy. Davidow discusses what to keep in mind as you fine-tune your asset allocation during the annual checkup.Another forward-thinking aspect of the portfolio tuneup at this time of year relates to taxes.Waiting until April to make potential tax-related changes is a missed opportunity, Alex Benke of Betterment points out. He offered three actionable ways investors can reduce the tax bite and improve the overall tax efficiency of their portfolios.Here is what the two investing experts said, in their own words.Tony Davidow is an asset allocation strategist at Schwab Center for Financial Research, a unit of the $2.71 trillion investment firm Charles Schwab (SCHW).During turbulent markets, you may notice your asset allocation veering off course. Year-end is often a good time to revisit your asset allocation. The temptation is often to rebalance into market volatility — rather than developing a disciplined plan to rebalance based on a predetermined time horizon or level of deviation from your allocation.For example, with the strong year-to-date performance of the emerging markets, investors may need to trim their exposure because they may be overweight. It's worth noting that emerging markets have given back some of their gains postelection.Conducting a thorough year-end portfolio checkup is a good practice. Have your goals and objectives changed over time? What's your market outlook? Are there tax considerations that should be dealt with?We believe that the current market environment presents a number of challenges — increased bouts of volatility, increased correlations, generational low yields for fixed income, and lower expected equity returns. You can respond to these new market realities in the following ways:With the growth of exchange traded funds, you can now access segments of the markets that were historically difficult to tap into. You now have many ways of gaining exposure to markets as well.Many clients were leery of allocating assets abroad due to concerns about Chinese economic growth, the Brexit vote and geopolitical risk. However, some of the best-performing asset classes in 2016 have been outside of our borders. Appropriate diversification can help mitigate risk and uncover opportunities.The chart below helps illustrate the value of diversification by showing the year-over-year performance of various asset classes. As you can see, there is no discernible pattern, or predictive capability in the data, but rather it shows the natural rotation of the best- and worst-performing asset classes over time.U.S. large-cap stocks were near the top of the pack in 2013-15, but have lagged in 2016. Several of the best-performing asset classes this year — emerging markets, high yield, international and emerging-market debt — were laggards in recent years. Asset allocation provides exposure to a broad group of asset classes — and attempts to do so in the optimal fashion — not too much or too little.The diversified portfolio owns a portion of all of the asset classes, and consequently takes out the peaks and the valleys associated with owning individual asset classes. The returns of the diversified portfolio are typically in the middle of the pack — with lower risk — thus smoothing the ride. The reality is no one has a crystal ball and can accurately predict the best-performing market on a year-over-year basis.With the innovation of indexing, you can now choose to own a segment of the market in a market-cap fashion, or choose among the different types of smart-beta strategies (i.e., momentum, low volatility, quality or fundamental). Smart-beta strategies ""break the link"" with price — the idea that the market capitalization of a company is the best barometer of a company's performance.Fundamental indexing screens and weights securities based on such factors as sales, cash flow, dividends and buybacks. The difference in weighting methodology can provide very different returns over time.At Schwab, we are advocates of allocating to both market-cap and fundamental index strategies. Each has a role within a portfolio. Market-cap strategies tend to be the lowest-cost solution. They provide little or no tracking error and provide market beta by definition.Fundamental index strategies have historically delivered excess returns relative to their market-cap equivalents. Over longer periods of time, our research has shown that these strategies deliver alpha. The combination provides diversification, cost-effective exposure and the potential for alpha, or excess returns.As you review your portfolio, you may want to evaluate your current allocation. You may want to examine the way you're accessing each asset class, and you may want to rebalance your portfolio to align with your long-term strategy. Market volatility presents both challenges and opportunities.(Editor's note: Morningstar's Instant X-ray is a free tool to better understand your portfolio's asset allocation. Schwab offers asset allocation models for free to the public.)Alex Benke is vice president of advice and investing at Betterment in New York City; assets under management: $6.1 billion.Investors typically think about taxes in April, but December is the time when planning is more important.As the 2016 tax year comes to a close this Dec. 31 (and not the April 15 tax filing deadline), it's time to take action so that you can complete any changes by mid-December, so you won't miss year-end tax deadlines.Everyone's circumstances will vary, but here are three actionable ways you may be able to improve your portfolio.First, gather your cost-basis statements, year-to-date realized capital gains for all taxable accounts you own and last year's tax return for the ""carry forward loss"" numbers (which can be found on Form 1040 Schedule D, and is the difference of line 21 and 16 for the 2015 tax year).Using the statements you gathered, look for ""quick wins,"" or opportunities to sell losses and reduce costs in what you already hold in your taxable accounts. These suggestions assume you are paying taxes on your investment gains, i.e., you are at least in the 25% marginal tax bracket.Second, resolve tax-inefficient and out-of-balance areas in your portfolio. As you undertake the review, you should look for areas where you can increase tax efficiency as well as control for risk.For example, while maintaining your overall asset allocation, you may want to implement an asset location strategy.This involves managing your multiple accounts as a single portfolio, placing assets that are taxed more into more favorably taxed accounts (such as Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs).So you'll want to buy tax-inefficient holdings — those with active management or dividend payouts that are taxed at higher rates, such as bond funds and international stock funds — in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts. Tax-efficient investments, such as U.S. stock funds, which pay dividends that qualify for a lower tax rate if held more than 60 days, can be held in taxable accounts.Third, create a to-do list for future years. Sometimes, you can't make all the changes you want to make in a single tax year due to tax implications. Earmark these opportunities for future years, including moving assets to a more ideal allocation, into more tax-efficient investments, and out of high-fee funds.RELATED:Which ETF Investment Strategies Are Right For You?

But advisors have made great strides in the last five to seven years. Thanks to today's cloud-based and mobile technologies, financial advisors can work from anywhere. That makes them more efficient.IBD: How was it different a decade ago?Skiles: The systems were more software-based. You had desktop-based things that advisors could install on their networks and their computers. But today, the way that technology interacts with advisors is different. It's more intuitive. It used to be that you'd go to your database people and say, ""Run these reports for me."" Now you can bring up a report with a client sitting there as you ask questions.IBD: How have new technologies changed the advisor-client relationship?Skiles: Clients are now logging in and using tools that their advisor provides. It's completely interactive. Clients can even make their own changes. It deepens their engagement with the advisor. It helps the client see everything that the advisor is doing on their behalf, beyond just investment stuff like what the market did today.IBD: So what else is the client seeing?Skiles: How am I doing in terms of saving for retirement? How am I doing saving for my kids' college? How am I doing with my spending? Clients see it right in front of them on the screen with the advisor there to explain it all and help answer their questions. It's like looking at your X-ray with the doctor there explaining what you're looking at.IBD: Advisors have so many choices when shopping for technology. How can they shop smart?Skiles: Years ago, advisors had limited choices. Now it's much more complicated, from performance reporting to trading systems to contact management (software). One, you can ask your custodian and other business partners, ""What are you seeing?"" and ""Which financial planning program do you work well with?"" Two, talk to other advisors. Find out what technology they like and ask, ""How do you use that program?"" Based on the feedback you get, gravitate to one or two providers and learn more about them.IBD: How about price?Skiles: Don't simply focus on price. Price is a factor but not the only factor. You also want to consider where the product is going. I like to ask (tech) providers, ""Tell me about your last two or three releases. What did you accomplish through those releases?""IBD: What kind of answer are you looking for?Skiles: I'm looking to see if they're proactive with their product. Technology is always evolving. It never stays still. You want a provider that's always making their product better. For example, they might say, ""A year ago, we updated our interface for the iPhone 6."" By asking about their last few releases, you get out of (shopping for) vaporware where they announce future plans but don't have a recent track record of upgrades.IBD: From a client's point of view, what does a tech-savvy advisor's operation look like? What do clients notice?Skiles: Clients notice two things right away. They look at an advisor's website and how accessible it is on multiple devices — not just on a big screen but also on a smartphone or tablet. They also look at how an advisor handles the regulatory side, the filling out of forms. Clients want their advisors to leverage technology to streamline the paperwork, from form-filling software to electronic signatures.IBD: Looking ahead, how do you think technology will affect the way advisors do their job?Skiles: We talk about succession planning. Well, working anywhere, anytime is incredibly powerful. The easier it is to do the work means advisors might stay in business much longer, or decide not to grow as fast or not have as many clients. Thanks to technology, advisors have more choices based on how they want to work.IBD: But won't clients want to meet with their advisor in person?Skiles: With the next generation of clients, many will prefer to meet virtually with a webcam on both sides. With screen-share technology, you can have even better meetings with more engaged clients. The old way, only one person had the mouse. Now you can turn a client from observer to participant.IBD: Is there a downside to virtual meetings?Skiles: You need the right systems in place to run reports and secure client data. I know advisors with a thriving business who will go overseas for a month on a working vacation and not tell their clients. They'll take calls and access their cloud-based systems, but they have to make sure they're not accessing Wi-Fi (from an unsecured connection) in a coffee shop in London or Paris.RELATED:What Financial Advisors Are Doing To Ramp Up Their Social Media Efforts

They also worried about the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates.Tuesday was the sole day of broad market gains. Home builders and health care stocks did well.But Wednesday was another down day as energy stocks helped drag major indices down.Energy stocks and other commodity stocks weighed on the market on Thursday.For the week, all sector categories were down. Financial services — many of whose banks would benefit from higher interest rates — were down the least, off 1.07%.Among world equity funds, Japanese funds advanced 0.82%, making them the only category to gain ground.Emerging markets funds were the worst laggards, down 3.21% in the latest week.Latin American funds easily retained the cellar position year-to-date, down 23.23%.Taxable bond funds slipped 0.59% in the latest week. That left them down 0.98% for the year.U.S. Treasury funds were down 0.85% in the latest week, reflecting worries about a rate hike. That left Treasury funds off 1.28% for the year.Tax-exempt bond funds fell 0.29% in the latest week. That cut their year-to-date gain to 1.19%.Follow Paul Katzeff on Twitter: @IBD_PKatzeff.

343,SCHW,"It's relatively easy to use IBD and find leading stocks that are forming bases. But it's a lot tougher for both the individual investor and the professional to find truly exceptional patterns.Like many things in life, the details can separate great patterns from merely decent ones.In 1996 and early 1997, Charles Schwab (SCHW) crafted great bases. Its details are worth study.From a low point in July 1994, shares of the fast-growing discount broker more than tripled by late September of 1995. Afterward, the stock went into a correction phase and built a deep four-month cup-with-handle base. The drop within the base was 43%, more than the 30%-33% maximum decline that you'd like to see.A breakout from that faulty cup with handle went nowhere. Schwab settled into what would become a long, mostly sideways consolidation. While a consolidation isn't as well defined as a cup-with-handle pattern or double bottom, you still want to look for key traits that make a sound base.Schwab's consolidation, which spanned nearly eight months, had a number of positives. First, the base was a continuation of a first-stage base. The cup with handle that didn't get anywhere was the initial part.The pattern had many up weeks in above-average volume (1). Such action points to accumulation from big buyers such as hedge funds and mutual funds. In total, the number of up weeks in high turnover outnumbered the down weeks in big volume by an 8-5 margin.Schwab's consolidation also had a number of tight weekly closes, which showed supporting action from institutions. And there was a shakeout week  (2) that ended July 19. During that week, the stock broke below its recent lows, but it then reversed higher in strong turnover.Schwab broke out in huge turnover during the week that ended Nov. 8 and rallied 55% in just 16 weeks. Along the way, it made light pullbacks to gain support at its 10-week moving average. Then Schwab formed another cup-with-handle base.The 14-week pattern had a big upside-reversal week in the week that ended April 4, 1997. Volume was huge that week, confirming the bullish move  (3). Four weeks later, in the week that ended May 2, the stock surged nearly 16%.Schwab broke out from the cup with handle in huge turnover during the week that ended May 30. Shares rallied 29% by July before forming another base.

"
364,SCHW,"Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, likens her job to drinking from a fire hose of feeds and reports.The work involves intense reading and research, every day, for the benefit of investors in ETFs and mutual funds. The main data points that inform her thinking include leading market indicators, monetary policy indicators, investor sentiment surveys, market breadth data, and every variety of short- and long-term valuation metrics. To help her dig up all this data, she has one research assistant.Tough? Perhaps. But here are the words that Sonders uses to describe her work: Intriguing. Fascinating. Intricate.""I love the psychology of the markets,"" Sonders said recently, in a phone interview with IBD. That interest in the ""behavioral side of things"" may explain why she enjoys being on the road, almost every week of the year.She travels to speak to Schwab's clients and other investors, alongside which she participates in and produces written reports, audio and video recordings, conference calls and webcasts. Asked where in the financial landscape she finds inspiration along the way, Sonders replied: ""I find it when I'm talking to our investors.""Sonders is a fan of charts. They are a mainstay of the hundreds of talks she gives in a year. They reinforce her philosophy that capitalism is the best economic structure.The Connecticut resident's conscious effort to address audiences in a simple way was inspired by a mentor. She used to be a regular panelist and guest host on PBS's original ""Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser."" ""The best piece of advice he gave me was, 'Get people to understand what you are talking about,' "" Sonders said.She's had other informal mentors along the way, including legendary stock investor Marty Zweig (""a pioneer in so many things, he invented the put-call ratio, he coined 'Don't fight the Fed' "") and Charles Schwab, the man who in 1971 founded the eponymous brokerage and investment firm she now works for.Her own investing takes the passive indexing route, with a heavy bias toward ETFs. ""I put my money where my mouth is,"" said Sonders, who is also on the investment committee at Windhaven, a Schwab subsidiary that constructs ETF-based portfolios for typically high-net-worth clients. She describes her personal asset allocation as aggressive for her time horizon, but keeps tinkering with her 401(k) to a minimum.""I look at it on an annual basis, or if there is a major move in the markets,"" Sonders said. She may make a tactical move only in response to extreme conditions -- ramping up equities in 2009, for example.The only stock she owns is Charles Schwab (SCHW), part of her compensation. The macro view is her thing, not bottom-up stock picking.A winner of multiple industry awards, a particularly meaningful award is one from Kiplinger's. It came, she noted, in 2009, a pivotal year for the stock market. ""My feeling was the bottom was in,"" she said. ""I was vocal about that view and stuck to my conviction even when I took heat for it.""The citation for that award said in part that Sonders ""has proved herself an expert in divining which way the economic winds will blow. In the fall of 2006, for example, she warned Schwab clients about the housing-market bubble."" IBD'S TAKE: Leading investment management firms including Charles Schwab have consistently advised investors to stay at a normal, long-term strategic allocation as the bull market matures.In a Q&A with IBD, Sonders discussed everything from what is needed for the next leg up for stocks to the growth of Schwab's ETF investing business unit. The investment services firm has around $2.71 trillion in client assets.Here's what she said:IBD: What's unique about the current economic and market situation, and what's the same old thing?
"
365,SCHW,"Liz Ann Sonders: What's unique is unprecedented monetary policy globally, including zero and negative rates and how significant a driver of equity market behavior it has been during this bull market relative to past cycles. What's the same, though, is how investor sentiment drives markets in the short term -- in a contrarian fashion. That said, although optimism rose with the market's trek to all-time highs in August, longer-term measures of sentiment show a still-skeptical investing public; i.e., the ""wall of worry"" is intact.IBD: What will it take for the stock market to snap out of its range and make a significant advance?
"
366,SCHW,"Sonders: From the aforementioned standpoint of investor sentiment, it's unlikely it turns decidedly more pessimistic (which would be a healthy contrarian indicator) without a pickup in volatility or a deeper pullback. In the meantime, given stretched valuations, it's likely that earnings growth needs to stage a healthier rebound than consensus expectations to carry stocks significantly higher.IBD: How would you sum up your outlook for the economy and stock market?
"
367,SCHW,"Sonders: The most likely scenario for the economy is continued muddle through, sluggish growth. Recession risk remains relatively low (albeit up recently) given that no excess has built-in the economy; i.e., inflation, monetary policy, capital spending, capacity utilization, etc. The secular bull market is likely intact, although in a more mature phase which will be marked with higher volatility and greater frequency of pullbacks. A bear market should be avoided unless it begins to sniff out a recession.IBD: How is the stock market likely to react to a Trump/Clinton victory, and how should investors react?
"
368,SCHW,"Sonders: Based on stock market behavior to-date around the moving target of polls and perceptions, it appears the least unsettling outcome for stocks would be a Clinton win, with both houses of Congress remaining in Republican control. We are suggesting investors remain at their long-term strategic allocations and not monkey around with short-term trading around election results -- prospective or reactive.IBD: What helped Schwab become the fifth largest ETF provider in 2016?
"
369,SCHW,"Sonders: Investors are increasingly (and correctly) focused more on planning, asset allocation, and progress toward their goals rather than elusive market outperformance. They are also becoming more aware of what they're paying, the value they're getting in return, and the long-term impact that costs and fees can have.Our ETF business has grown rapidly because of its ability to develop low-cost, high-quality investment vehicles that meet investor needs -- and Schwab can do this because of its scale, and unique platform and distribution models. Schwab ETFs are available through the commission-free platform, as well as through packaged products and solutions such as Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, Schwab Managed Accounts (401k platform using Schwab ETFs), and Schwab's new Target Date Fund series using ETFs inside.IBD: Is Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, your online robo advisor, growing?
"
370,SCHW,"Sonders: Schwab Intelligent Portfolios launched in March 2015, and client assets in the service totaled $8.2 billion at the end of Q2 2016. So it's grown pretty quickly. We think the future of investment advice will be a mix of technology and live professionals. The emergence of automated investing is exciting for investors because it makes investing and advice more accessible to more people, and it's exciting for the industry because it makes portfolio management very efficient and scalable.IBD: What's your best advice for both new and experienced investors?
"
371,SCHW,"Sonders: Well, at Schwab, we're big believers that whether you're just starting out or have been investing for years, it's important to stay engaged with your finances, and if you work with a financial professional, ask questions to ensure that you understand how you're invested and how you're tracking against your goals. And if you're doing that and investing according to a plan, the best advice might be to ignore the short-term noise and headlines. That might sound odd coming from someone who spends most of her time writing and talking about the stock market and economy, but the reality is that for most long-term investors, short-term events and news typically don't have a significant impact.At the portfolio level, we believe this is a good time to remain at long-term strategic allocations, but use volatility to tactically rebalance around those norms. In more volatile periods, rebalancing can occur more often and ""forces"" investors to do what we know we're supposed to, which is ""buy low and sell high."" It also allows our portfolios to tell us when it's time to make portfolio adjustments vs. relying on our own (or pundits') forecasts of what will happen.IBD: How do ETF strategist firms, such as Windhaven, help investors?
"
372,SCHW,"Sonders: An ETF-based asset manager can help clients achieve their financial goals through prudent management of their investment portfolios with an emphasis on broad diversification, portfolio transparency and low costs -- all things that really matter to most investors.At Windhaven, we aim to provide investors with three broadly diversified strategies consisting primarily of low-cost index ETFs, designed to capture growth in rising markets while attempting to reduce exposure in declining ones.

373,SCHW,"A new Labor Department rule seeks to keep conflicts of interest out of the financial industry, but will it actually benefit you and other investors?The idea is to save each investor thousands of dollars -- perhaps every year -- by lowering fees, making investors' investment choices clearer, helping them avoid unnecessary costs by making their expenses clearer and by forcing brokers and financial advisors to guide them to potentially more productive investments even if they are less profitable for the broker or advisor.Brokers and financial advisors are scrambling to figure out what they must do to comply with the so-called fiduciary rule, which is due to take effect next April -- unless derailed by pending industry lawsuits. Firms are putting their own new rules in place for how to interact with clients -- what sorts of advice they'll be allowed to offer to investors like you, and what sorts they won't. They're updating software. And they're sorting out how to charge customers for service, with an earthquake tilt toward fees for service and fees on assets and away from commissions on transactions.The new rule will impact mainly brokers and financial advisors who help clients invest for retirement. About $1.9 trillion in investors' assets will be affected by 2020, according to a new study by global management consultant A.T. Kearney. It expects the asset shifts will involve about $23 billion in revenue, creating big winners and losers.Mutual fund complexes alone will see investors yank out $1 trillion in assets, Kearney says, costing them $14 billion in revenue. That tectonic shift is expected to result from investors fleeing fund fees that they perceive as too high or are steered into other investments by brokers and advisors, newly leery of violating the fiduciary rule.A swarm of pending lawsuits by players in the securities industry shows the industry's concern.Key plaintiffs include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Financial Services Institute, Financial Services Roundtable, Insured Retirement Institute, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), National Association of Fixed Annuities, American Council of Life Insurers and National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors.Individual investors should also be concerned. Sure, they should benefit from the new rule's prohibition against certain conflicts of interest.IBD'S TAKE: Wondering how to play the fiduciary rule fallout? See which publicly traded financial firms stand to benefit and which stand to lose in this IBD report.The rule will require brokers and advisors to put their clients' best interest before their own profit. Under the current standard, brokers and advisors can recommend investments so long as they are merely suitable for a client. That lets brokers and advisors recommend investments that are more profitable for them due to, say, commissions, even if other lower-cost investments would suit a client's need better.But the new rule will also have negative effects. ""Anything that has an impact of a reduction in personal touch, a potential increase in cost and/or a loss of continuity with professional advice could be characterized as negative,"" said Jason Grantz, managing sales director for the Eastern U.S. at Unified Trust Co. ""Several (effects) impact small accounts in particular."" The negatives include:To cope with changes your broker or advisor wants to implement, you might want to move assets to a firm that is prepared to deal with you in a manner more to your liking, Grantz says.On the other hand, individual investors may see benefits beyond just fewer conflicts of interest.You may see a decline in average expense ratios for funds offered to a firm's clients. That is the most frequently cited impact expected by asset managers polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, according to Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research for GMI.""Actively managed funds charge a premium for their efforts to outperform a benchmark, even though the majority of the survey respondents think that passive funds provide comparable returns to active investing,"" Rosenbluth writes in a new report.He added, ""Asset managers will need to be cognizant that advisors will be questioning whether their clients' best interest is being served by active funds that are more expensive than their peers.""Also, pricing transparency will increase, A.T. Kearney partner Uday Singh said.And simplified investment menus, the possible demise of high-fee funds with relatively poor track records and greater focus on low-cost passive funds will help investors meet their retirement savings goals, Rosenbluth says.As brokers and advisors seek to comply with the new rule, trillions in assets will shift among various types of financial firms between 2017 and 2020. Firms gaining assets will generally also gain revenue.Wirehouses -- big, full-service brokerages -- should see assets under management (AUM) decline by a net $300 billion, with a $4 billion decline in revenue, Kearney says. Their smaller competitors, known as independent broker-dealers in the industry, will likely be hurt by lower sales of high-commission products. They should lose $350 billion in AUM, causing a $3 billion loss in revenue.Also, costs of compliance will force smaller broker-dealers to consolidate.The ranks of winners should include registered investment advisors (RIAs), who already operate as fiduciaries, and robo-advisors. Relentless publicity about high fees and costs will prompt many self-directed individual investors to take their business away from brokers and advisors. Instead, Kearney forecasts, they will shift $150 billion in assets into funds they buy directly from mutual fund firms and into ETFs. Direct sellers of funds and ETFs stand to gain $1 billion in revenue, Kearney says.Wirehouses in the line of fire, Kearney says, include Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).Independent broker-dealers facing asset withdrawals include Raymond James (RJF) and Ameriprise (AMP).Vanguard, Betterment and Wealthfront offer robo-advisory services that stand to benefit from the shifts in assets. Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) are seen gaining inflow from self-directed investors.Retirement plan distributors like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price (TROW) could see a decline in revenue from 12b-1 fees -- annual marketing and distribution fees that are part of a fund's expense ratio. But they should benefit from assets staying inside 401(k) plans longer as fewer brokers and advisors urge workers and retirees to roll over money from company-sponsored retirement plans into IRAs, Kearney says.Fidelity is expanding its menu of ETFs and low-cost funds and its robo-advisory capacity. ""Fidelity is responding to what customers want with low-cost solutions and increasing its digital offerings,"" Singh said.""Digital offerings"" include not just robo-advisory services but also easier mobile and online service. ""That creates a frictionless user experience,"" Singh said. ""The question is, will Fidelity move far enough, quickly enough?""That same question applies to many financial firms in many categories, Singh adds.As for lawsuits by financial firms and organizations, which generally charge that the DOL overstepped its authority in creating the new rule, Chicago securities-fraud attorney Andrew Stoltmann, who is not involved in any of the cases, predicts that none will derail the new rule.""Because the DOL capitulated on so many issues that were so important to the securities industry in the final draft of the rule, I think that has made the rule relatively bulletproof in terms of judicial review,"" he said.RELATED:New, Tighter Retirement-Advice Rule Raises Industry ConcernsTips For Advisors Who Are Considering Partnering With A Broker-DealerThese Investors Will Soon Get More Robo-Advisors

374,SCHW,"Sunny with a hint of rain: That was the weather as investment research firm Morningstar's seventh annual ETF conference kicked off in Chicago Wednesday, as well as the sentiment among attendees, who've seen stocks climb to all-time highs but still can't shake a lurking sense that the stock market's long bull run may soon be over.For investors in the audience, keynote speaker Liz Ann Sonders had some succinct advice: Stay at your normal, long-term strategic allocation as the bull market matures. Sonders is chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab (SCHW), and her firm remains bullish on the stock market even as it has grown more cautious over the past year and a half.Sonders outlined the economic and market outlook in a chart-heavy presentation, while fielding questions from participants. Her key observations grappled with the Fed, volatility, corporate earnings, the presidential elections, emerging markets and more.""We do think we are going to get another rate hike some time this year,"" Sonders said, while acknowledging that leading market indicators -- jobs and wage growth, consumer expectations, levels of debt, and productivity -- were all over the place.The Fed, Sonders insisted, should stop treating the economy like a patient in the trauma room. She offered some advice to the audience too: ""As an investor, you should not be praying for bad economic news to keep the Fed at bay.""A slow tightening cycle, she added, is historically better for stocks. The Federal Reserve hiked a benchmark rate for the first time in nearly a decade in December, but has held off on more hikes since then.The risk of a recession remains relatively low, at 34%, and while ""we could have an inflation scare, the likelihood of an inflation problem is very low,"" Sonders said.Exchange traded funds like iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) surged in popularity this year as investors searched for strategies with the potential to deliver investment success in a rocky market.Sonders sees investors bouncing back and forth between panic and relief -- a trend that's likely to continue given the uncertainties tied to the Fed and November elections.Asked by an audience member whether a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump administration would be better for stocks, she replied: ""What about none-of-the-above administrations?""The market, she added, is not ""moving with any precision with regard to one or the other (candidate).""Too much earnings growth tends to mean greater valuations and a market that is closer to the top than the bottom, she explained.And some key sectors are seeing profits come under less pressure, energy among them.Emerging markets have received more attention this year, in part for their more attractive valuations. But Sonders cautioned that the lower value may in many cases be for a reason. Many emerging markets are loaded with financial companies and state-owned enterprises.Sonders advised investors to ""dig deep on why areas outside the U.S. have lower multiplies"" and not to look at valuations in a vacuum. She added that emerging markets should not be lumped together.""You would be better served to be a bit more active (in your investment decisions), rather than a broad 'EM or no EM' approach,"" she suggested.Before Sonders spoke, Morningstar's (MORN) director of global ETF research noted that roughly $2.4 trillion is invested in U.S.-listed exchange traded products vs. roughly $800 billion around the time the annual ETF conferences began seven years ago.""This has been an organic growth story,"" Ben Johnson said, adding that investors' preference for low-cost, passive strategies was driving the flow of money from other investment products to ETFs.RELATED:ECB's Draghi: No Bond Buying Extention, Expansion; No Stock BuysHow Three Most Heavily Traded ETFs Are Faring: Exclusive Club Gets New MemberOil ETF Rally Continues As Broad Stock Market Wavers

389,SCHW,"A week that started off with business as usual ended on a tumultuous note, with the market swinging wildly in response to the Fed's statement Thursday.Stocks initially rose Thursday afternoon following the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates, then sold off late in the session to end mixed.On Friday, the major indexes sank early before paring some of their losses.Some industry groups were particularly affected by the Fed decision. The super regional banks group reversed sharply lower Thursday afternoon and closed down nearly 3%. On Friday, it lost another 3%.Super regionals ranked No. 126 among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, down from No. 63 six weeks ago. Go to Investors.com to view the full industry group list and rankings.Most of the stocks in the group, including Northern Trust (NTRS), PNC Financial (PNC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB), fell further below their 200-day moving averages. They've been toiling below the support line since last month's big market sell-off.Banks benefit from higher interest rates because they can get bigger net margins. When rates are low, their borrowing costs are low. But the amount they can charge on loans, and banks' earnings from other investments, are also low.Money center bank stocks are taking a hit, too. The group reversed Thursday for a more than 1% loss, and fell north of 2% Friday. It fell to No. 123 from No. 70 six weeks ago.UBS (UBS) gapped down Friday, breaching its 200-day moving average for the first time since March.It's now 13% below a 22.27 cup-with-handle buy point cleared in mid-July. UBS, with a 67 Composite Rating, is the top stock in the group based on that metric.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also gapped down Friday. The stock is holding above its Aug. 24 low, when it triggered the 8%-loss sell rule as it sank as much as 21% during the session. It's now 3% below a 62.97 buy point initially cleared in April.Also among financials, investment bankers and brokers (No. 121) lost further ground Friday.Charles Schwab (SCHW), Credit Suisse (CS), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Cowen (COWN) each gave up more than 3%.Utility stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, rose both sessions. They tend to outperform when bond yields are low, as they are now.But if rates go up, utility stocks face more competition from bonds because bond yields typically rise.The water supply group (No. 102) was one of the few gainers Friday. The gas distribution utilities group (No. 72) was nearly flat. (For more on utilities, see today's Income Investor column on Page B15.)Real estate investment trusts also tend to move with rates. Investors like them for high yields, but not as much when bond yields go up.Property REITs (No. 128) and mortgage REITs (No. 132) were also among the day's better performers, relative to other groups.

390,SCHW,"Master This Sell Rule: Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks
"
391,SCHW,"A climax run, also called a climax top, is an awesome thing to watch — especially if you own a piece of the action. But it also poses the difficult question of when to sell. It's obvious that the stock can't climb at that fast rate forever. A correction is clearly on the way. So when and how do you cut risks and take profits?
"
392,SCHW,"To begin with, remember this basic rule: buy on fundamentals, sell on technicals.

393,SCHW,"Factors such as earnings, revenue growth, margins and so on play a strong role in determining whether and when you buy a stock. But a stock generally peaks while its fundamentals are still strong.

396,SCHW,"Many investors holding Charles Schwab (SCHW) early in 1999 had such hopes. Here were the elements of the climax run.
"
397,SCHW," Sell Rule 1: After a big rally over several months to a year or more, look for an unusually rapid price run of, say, 25% to 50% or more over two to three weeks. The discount brokerage had gained an astounding 439% from an October breakout to its peak of 77.50 on April 14, 1999. In the last two weeks of the run, Schwab gained as much as 64%. This rise signaled a climax run.
"
398,SCHW," Sell Rule 2: Watch for an exhaustion gap. Schwab gapped to a new high on April 13 as volume screamed 272% above average. The next day, Schwab closed the gap, falling 8% in even heavier trade. The next three days of big declines showed that institutional investors had sold heavily.

Schwab marked an exhaustion gap on the trading day after Christmas; that big up day, Dec. 28, capped a startling advance of 82% in under three weeks. However, climax runs normally begin at least 18 weeks after a proper breakout. So this rally was still too early in the run to be a sell trigger.
"
401,SCHW," Sell Rule 3: Get ready to sell when a stock is trading 70% to 100% or more above its 200-day (or 40-week) moving average. At Schwab's peak, the stock traded 210% above the mark. The rise above the 40-week line rule isn't a sell signal on its own, but it is a solid secondary indicator of a stock making a near-vertical move.

406,SCHW,"American fund investors have taken to heart the message that every dollar saved in fund fees is the pleasant heft of an extra dollar in their pockets.A new suite of mutual funds targets consumers to whom costs matter while investing for a rainy day and planning for retirement.Schwab Target Index Funds launched Thursday and are billed as the lowest-cost target-date mutual funds for employer-sponsored retirement plans. They are also among the lowest-cost options for retail investors and are available through IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) or brokerage accounts.The new Schwab Target Index Funds are available for 401(k)-type retirement plans with an expense ratio of eight basis points (0.08%) and no investment minimums. Outside of retirement plans, they are available to individual investors at a 0.13% expense ratio and with a modest $100 minimum investment. The target dates run from 2010 to 2060 in five-year increments.""Plan participants no longer have to pay for a more expensive target-date fund because they work at a smaller company,"" Marie Chandoha, president and CEO of Charles Schwab Investment Management, said in a media statement. Until now, even participants in large plans did not have access to target-date mutual funds at the low price of eight bps, she added.Assets in U.S. target-date funds totaled $854.78 billion in July 2016 -- more than doubling since July 2011. Vanguard accounted for roughly a third of industry target-date assets in July 2016, with a haul of $261.96 billion that topped other target-date providers' intake, according to Morningstar Inc.Schwab has been chipping away at Vanguard's claim to the title of low-cost leader. Its focus on low-cost ETF investing has paved the way to asset growth and disrupted the fund industry. Schwab is now the fifth-largest ETF provider, up from seventh a year ago. Still, its 2.2% ETF market share trails Vanguard's 23.7%.For 401(k) participants, the 0.08% expense ratio on Charles Schwab's (SCHW) new funds translates to $8 dollars in fees for every $10,000 invested. That compares with an industry average of 0.73% for target-date funds, Schwab said, citing Morningstar research. Vanguard's target retirement funds have an average expense ratio of 0.13% and typically require a $1,000 minimum investment.Target-date funds are built to be held over very long time periods, so small differences in funds' fees can make an enormous difference when compounded over decades. Schwab provided this example: If you invested an average $7,500 a year over 40 years in a fund with a 0.73% expense ratio and with an average 6.4% return each year, you would have just over $973,000. If the fund's expense ratio dropped to 0.13%, the same investment would give you more than $1.13 million -- a difference of $160,000 over 40 years.Schwab drove down costs for its new offer by using its own famously low-cost ETFs as underlying investments.The new target-date series invests in eight exchange traded funds from Schwab's 21-ETF lineup, including the $6.2 billion US Large-Cap (SCHX).SCHX has a 0.03% expense ratio -- unmatched by any non-Schwab equity ETF, according to Morningstar. In fact, each of the stock, bond and REIT ETFs inside the Schwab Target Index Funds has the lowest operating expenses in its respective Lipper category, according to Schwab.The asset allocation in the Target Index Funds becomes more conservative over time. The ""glidepath"" approach reduces investment risk as retirement approaches and factors in investors' need for income after retiring.Fees are top of mind when workers saving for retirement choose target-date funds, a recent survey of 401(k) participants for Schwab Retirement Plan Services found. Nearly one in four workers -- 22% -- described fees as the most important criterion when deciding whether to invest in a plan's target-date funds. That was second in importance only to the fund's five-year performance record -- the top criterion for 26% of respondents.The online survey was done in early June and included 1,000 retirement plan participants. They were aged between 25 and 70, worked for companies with more than 25 employees in their 401(k) plans, and contributed at the time of the survey to their retirement plans.SCHX stumbled on the stock market Friday.The new Target Index Funds are an addition to Schwab's existing target-date suite of funds, which debuted in 2002 and include active and passive strategies.RELATED:Schwab Disrupts ETF Industry And Plans To Keep At ItThe 401(k) Is The Top Choice For Retirement Savings

407,SCHW,"Charles Schwab (SCHW) on Monday reported a 28% surge in its second-quarter profit on revenue gains from new accounts.The San Francisco-based company earned $452 million, or 30 cents per share, while revenue jumped 17% to $1.83 billion. The results met Wall Street expectations.The average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 30 cents per share, while seven analysts expected $1.8 billion in revenue.During the quarter, the company added 271,000 brokerage accounts, a 4% boost. The company ended June with 10 million accounts.The financial services firm also said the number of accounts enrolled in one of its retail advisory solutions unit grew 8% to reach 581,000. Financial consultants also held 33,000 planning conversations, marking a 14% increase.The company declared a 7 cent dividend, beginning in the second quarter, up 1 cent.Its shares fell 1 cent to 27.02 in morning trading. Schwab shares have declined 18% since the beginning of the year, while the S&P 500 index has climbed nearly 6%. The stock is down 22% in the last 12 months.IBD's TAKE: Charles Schwab shares have been in a volatile downtrend for the past 11 months and are currently below their declining 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The clear standout in its low-rated group is MarketAxess (MKTX), which is trading near record highs and has strong ratings for earnings and other key criteria.

408,SCHW,"Clouds are gathering over the robo-advisor industry. And the forecast should inspire investors who use robo-advisors to keep an umbrella nearby, according to a prominent observer of the robo-advisor space.Robo-advisors are finding it increasingly difficult to grow their rate of asset inflow.IBD'S TAKE: Having their own robo-advisor may be a good strategic move for asset managers, but investors should think twice before buying these stocks now. The Finance/Investment Management Group has lagged the general stock market over the past six months, ranking 119th out of 197 industries tracked by IBD. To find the groups that are leading the market now, bookmark the daily IBD Industry Themes column.And while that does not put investors' account balances in jeopardy, ""it increases the risk that some robo-advisors may have to raise prices in the coming year,"" Michael Kitces, director of wealth management for Pinnacle Advisory Group and a prominent commentator on the retirement-funding industry, told IBD.Still, even after a price hike, robo-advisors' fees may remain well below what full-service brokerages, for example, charge. On an account balance of $125,000 with a 60-40 stock-bond mix, prominent robo services like that of Charles Schwab (SCHW) levy a 0% annual robo fee plus a 0.23% average ETF expense ratio, according to investorjunkie.com. Betterment assesses a 0.15% robo fee plus a 0.15% average ETF fee. Vanguard charges a 0.30% robo fee plus a 0.09% average ETF fee. In contrast, full-service wirehouses tend to sock clients with fees of 1% to 1.5%.Asset-gathering growth rates are falling rapidly for robo-advisors, especially independent ones, Kitces says. Key robos' growth of assets under management (AUM) is just one-third of what it was one year ago, Kitces wrote on his website. Wealthfront is growing AUM at a little more than 2% annually, down from above 6%. Betterment's growth rate north of 6% is down from better than 17%.Dan Egan, Betterment's director of behavioral finance and investing, says asset growth can reflect temporary factors such as overall market run-ups or pullbacks. Robo-advisors in general and Betterment in particular, he says, remain very popular. And Betterment's AUM continues to grow in dollar terms, he adds. ""Betterment is the largest and fastest growing (robo-advisor),"" he said. ""When something gets very large, growth is harder to sustain on a percentage-wise basis.""Robos' slowing pace of AUM growth reflects high client acquisition costs and an inability to achieve economies of scale.The slowdown could force some robos to shut down or, ""more realistically, to be sold,"" Kitces told IBD. If your robo-advisor folds, you would not lose assets -- but you would have to transfer your account holdings to another asset manager, he says.""Fortunately, many of the independent robo-advisors have raised significant capital (from investors in the advisory firm itself) though. So even that prospective 'day of shutdown' (or 'forced sale') could still be a long, long ways off,"" Kitces said.""In terms of costs, though,"" he continued, ""a growth slowdown is not a good thing, especially since many (industry observers) have noted that robo-advisors don't even appear to be profitable (or financially viable) at their current pricing and volume of clients. If they can't dramatically increase the number of clients and scale,"" price hikes by robo-advisors will be more likely in the next 12 months, to avoid running out of operating capital.Egan says Betterment is not considering any such move. His shop's growth, he adds, will enable it to fund continued innovation and new services, such as January's rollout of its 401(k) plan offering.Kitces says it is unclear whether robos' root problem is that competition is crimping their ability to attract net new assets, or that they ""grossly underestimated the challenge of getting clients in a scalable manner.""The net amount of new dollars flowing into robo coffers has stayed even, he says. Robos are not taking in less money.""It's just that taking in the same money as the base gets bigger means the growth rate is falling. Getting $100 million per month when Betterment (had assets under management of) $1 billion was a 10% monthly growth rate,"" he said. ""Getting the same $100 million now when Betterment is $5 billion (in AUM) is only a 2% monthly growth rate.""Worse, Kitces cites research that says robo-advisors need tens of billions of dollars in AUM to be profitable and financially healthy. So to become and remain profitable, their asset-growth rate must rise, not decline, he says.Of 13 active robo-advisors that investorjunkie.com views as big enough to track, the only one with more than $10 billion in assets is Vanguard's, which has $31 billion in AUM. That's just a fraction of Vanguard's overall AUM, which topped $3 trillion as of Dec. 31. The next-largest is Schwab's with $8.2 billion.The slowdown in AUM growth comes as Wells Fargo (WFC), the world's largest bank by market cap, said on Wednesday that it plans to start a robo-advisory service in 2017.And yet another big player in the mutual fund industry, Legg Mason (LM), just entered the robo-advisor field with its acquisition of an 82% stake in Financial Guard, which has $454 million in AUM.Legg Mason had $718 billion in assets under management as of May 31.The move gives Legg Mason a beachhead in the robo-advisor space. Despite robo-advisors' profitability woes, they've attracted investors largely with their offering of low-cost, automated, online investment strategies, which typically make heavy use of ETFs.In contrast to independent robo-advisors, the outlook may be easier for robos that get gobbled up. Financial Guard now gets access to Legg Mason's deep pockets and distribution channels. A Legg Mason news release said, ""The transaction expands Financial Guard's access to financial institutions that serve the needs of investors.""Does the slowdown in growth make robo-advisors less crucial for asset managers to have as an option for their clients? Big mutual fund shops and other asset managers that don't have their own robo-advisor still risk losing out on a meaningful number of clients and their assets. Robo-advisors' cumulative share of assets under management by advisors of all stripes should rise to 5.6% by 2020, up from 0.5% in 2015, research firm A.T. Kearney forecasts.Legg Mason said its Financial Guard deal would help financial advisors who partner with it to grow their practices and meet the new Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary standard, which is due to take effect in April.The DOL rule aims to prevent brokers who provide retirement plan advice from putting their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests. Brokers could meet the new standard by making use of low-cost robo-advisors, at least with some small-account clients. Otherwise, many advisors might avoid taking on small-account clients because it would not be profitable to provide them with service without charging higher fees. But by avoiding smaller accounts, an advisor would risk losing a client whose account could grow over time.Reflecting this concern, Legg Mason noted that there is about $845 billion in small IRA accounts holding less than $25,000 each at U.S. wirehouses, independent broker-dealers and regional brokers that may be impacted by the new DOL rules.""Legg Mason will offer the Financial Guard platform to firms who are looking for technology solutions to assist them in meeting expanded compliance requirements in a holistic, cost efficient way,"" the release said.The DOL deadline has helped drive a wave of acquisitions similar to the Legg Mason move in the past 18 months. BlackRock (BLK) took over FutureAdvisor last summer. Invesco (IVZ) grabbed Jemstep early this year. UBS (UBS) bought a stake in SigFig in May.Other key players in the mutual fund industry have created their own robo-advisory services:Legg Mason announced its move earlier this month.

409,SCHW,"It wasn't long ago that complex advances in investing, such as automated asset allocation, portfolio management and tax-loss harvesting, were considered high-minded concepts reserved only for the elite.Enter the robo-advisor, an automated version of the financial consultant, born in the wake of the last financial crisis. It quickly became the new norm, delivering these same services to ordinary investors for very low costs and putting them on the path to modern investing in minutes instead of days. It was another in an endless series of examples where technology leveled the playing field.As it made services more accessible, digital advice also threatened to put the squeeze on traditional financial services firms. These new robo-players gave their regards to Main Street on their way to infiltrating Wall Street, armed with algorithm-driven, web-based platforms that undercut big names such as Vanguard and BlackRock (BLK).But established players in the investment industry are striking back, flexing their own muscles in a variety of ways. Their methods are familiar -- one popular choice is buyouts, often a quick fix -- yet their arsenal is vast, ranging from white-labeling robo-advice services to building partnerships. In some cases, they're creating their own proprietary platforms.Ultimately, the robo-advisor industry is headed for a shakeout that could mean fewer upstarts and more power to established players. For investors, that means financial advisors will be more attentive to them right now as the established names vie with upstarts for accounts, but that could change after the shakeout is over and choices dwindle.""Investment industry incumbents are finally taking the digital advice threat seriously,"" analysts at research firm Corporate Insight wrote in a recent report.After years of waiting and watching, several financial heavyweights elbowed their way into the digital advice space since the beginning of 2015. Among them:BlackRock shares fell 7% Friday as the market sold off on Britain's planned exit from the EU. Schwab's stock sank 12%, Interactive 6%, Bank of America 7% and Invesco 14%.The moves into automated advice are opening up possibilities for these companies.The BlackRock-FutureAdvisor deal was particularly striking in that it expanded the reach of the robo-advisor, says influential financial blogger Michael Kitces. The world's largest investment manager announced that the acquired FutureAdvisor unit would meet the needs of banks, broker-dealers, insurers, other advisory firms and even 401(k) plans.In other words, the classic direct-to-consumer robo model pivots toward a more business-to-business model, with automated advisors integrated into a partner's web portal in some cases.According to BlackRock, the B2B approach will allow a much larger and broader segment of clients to benefit from digital advice. Industry watchers point out that it may benefit BlackRock too. See sidebar on how robo-advisors will fare in the next market meltdown.""The robo-advisor is now a distribution channel,"" Kitces wrote after the FutureAdvisor deal was announced. Asset managers are trying to pick up robo platforms to distribute their exchange traded funds, Kitces told IBD. He noted that Schwab's robo channel ""is filled primarily with Schwab ETFs,"" and its success prompted similar moves from BlackRock for its iShares ETFs, and Invesco for its PowerShares ETFs.Fourteen of the 54 ETFs on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios are Schwab ETFs. The average portfolio in the service has about 60% of assets allocated in Schwab ETFs, based on objective selection criteria including low costs, according to Charles Schwab.Recent research highlights both the successes of, and pressures on, robo-advisors.Corporate Insight has found that as of July 2015 -- the latest period for which data are available -- the 11 leading digital advice providers had $8 billion in managed account assets, a 208% jump from $2.6 billion in April 2014. Betterment, the largest independent robo-advisor, reports its assets under management have vaulted more than 300% to a current $4.8 billion since the start of 2015.However, Morningstar (MORN) estimates that robo-advisors need between $16 million and $40 billion in assets under management just to break even. The fees-per-customer robos generate far outstrip their average costs to acquire a client.Investors are increasingly comfortable in giving control of their assets to a digital portfolio manager, according to Corporate Insight.""Spearheaded by such firms as Betterment and Wealthfront that offer low-cost, online managed accounts and have significant venture capital backing, these innovative startups are creating a growing market for digital advice,"" the firm recently reported.The first robo-advisors emerged on the investing scene around 2008, in the wake of the financial crisis. They succeeded by identifying key consumer demands, especially among millennials -- the use of technology to deliver financial advice and cheap, index-based exchange traded funds to lower the costs of investing.That growing market for low-cost, online managed accounts caught the attention of traditional firms, Corporate Insight's report said.It added: ""The wealth management industry's existing clients, baby boomers, are nearing retirement. Incumbents seem aware that the next generation of young investors will have different expectations than boomers, particularly when it comes to technology and cost.""According to Vanguard Group, its new Personal Advisor Services (PAS) was a response not to a vague robo-advisor threat, but to specific client demand. The product went into testing stage three years ago and was in development even before that, a Vanguard spokesperson said.Like a robo-advisor, PAS generates client portfolios using software programs, based on responses to online questionnaires about risk tolerance, time horizon, current income and other matters.PAS, however, caters mainly to baby boomers nearing retirement rather than to millennials, and it offers an ongoing client-advisor relationship, Vanguard's Katie Hirt told IBD. The spectrum of advice spans everything from financial behavior coaching to cash flow analysis. The client and Vanguard advisor chat between two and six times a year on average.For this hybrid service, Vanguard charges a 0.30% annual fee, or $150 on the minimum portfolio balance of $50,000 -- not far removed from Betterment's annual advisory fee of 0.25% for an account of the same size.""A robo offer that's targeting a younger investor may be well suited for someone who's looking for a purely online experience and not looking to work with an advisor,"" Hirt said.At PAS, investors' assets are allocated in portfolios comprised of Vanguard mutual funds and Vanguard ETFs. Assets under management have more than doubled since PAS debuted -- from $17 billion in May 2015 to $36 billion as of March 2016.To put that achievement in context, here's a simple fact:Total assets of the 11 leading robo-advisors were $21 billion in July 2015, including both online managed accounts and paid investment advice, according to Corporate Insight.Robo-advisors initially outmaneuvered the investment industry's old guard, but their future is anything but assured, a recent Tabb Group report said.""The value of their much-needed innovation is not in question,"" wrote Marlon Weems and Alexander Tabb, analysts with the international research firm. ""The rising concern (is) that the sleeping giants they have awakened, i.e. traditional firms, have superior economies of scale and resources that will allow them to respond quickly and at a lower price.""Robo-advisors aggressively and successfully targeted millennials, whose needs will become more complex as they age, Weems and Tabb said. That raised this question: Can robo-advisors make those young investors stick as long-term clients?Weems and Tabb point out that traditional wealth managers are able to charge fees on the underlying ETFs in their portfolios. That gives these firms an edge over smaller, upstart robo-advisors. Another key issue is that millennials simply don't have much in the way of assets, at least as of now.In fact, financial blogger Kitces observes that some robos are struggling to keep growing as they face increasing competition, get buried by client acquisition costs and struggle to grow their average account size. That's why FutureAdvisor and others are agreeing to be bought out, he says.Classic robos like Betterment and Wealthfront earn a flat advisory fee regardless of which portfolio or fund a client is invested in. Kitces has argued that Schwab and BlackRock's use of proprietary products in their new robo channels, coupled with their discretion over clients' investments, could be problematic.Other industry watchers wonder if even industry leaders like Betterment and Wealthfront can remain independent in the long run.In an interview with IBD, Daniel Egan, Betterment's director of investing, said it is not the target of any big investment manager. Nor is it rattled by the ETF and mutual fund firms rushing into the digital advice business. As a fiduciary advisor, Betterment is aligned with a client's best interests, he said.""I couldn't be happier,"" Egan said. ""I love when, effectively, existing players validate our business model.""

424,SCHW,"Jerry Dodson's Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) proves that you can have your socially responsible cake and eat it too.The $1.5 billion mutual fund favors companies that provide employees with ""outstanding workplaces."" So do the five other funds at Parnassus Investments, which Dodson founded in 1984. That includes things like offering workers profit-sharing, time off for working parents, paid time off for volunteer work, fair treatment and clear communication.The investment team at Parnassus, which has $16.5 billion under management, also screen out companies engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing or refining of fossil fuels.None of those criteria have prevented Endeavor from outperforming its peers or the broad market in the past 10 years.It is the top-performing environmental, social and corporate-governance (ESG) fund over the 10 years ended June 30, with an 11.57% average annual return in that decade, says Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 averaged a 7.42% yearly gain in that span.The fund also ranks in the top 1% of all large-cap growth mutual funds in that period and the top 2% over the past five years.And it is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, glowing in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Through Q2, it was ahead of roughly 42% of all U.S. diversified stock funds so far this year.Dodson's affinity for ESG investing has deep roots. He founded Parnassus Investments at the age of 41 with those goals in mind. Earlier work was a harbinger of what was to come: A political science major as UC Berkeley, he got his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1971, then went on to work for a nonprofit outfit that helped minority-owned businesses. He helped organize Continental Savings of America, becoming the president and CEO of the S&L, which developed an innovative product for depositors to invest in solar energy projects.Dodson is lead manager on Parnassus Fund (PARNX) and Parnassus Asia Fund (PAFSX) and sole manager of Endeavor. From his office in San Francisco, 73-year-old Dodson talked with Investor's Business Daily about the ins and outs of his investment approach and how he began to use social screens.IBD: You're juggling two tough tasks: You not only use ESG criteria, you also run a concentrated portfolio. Which is tougher?Dodson: You know, the hard part was getting the philosophy and tweaking it with simulations, which was done over many years. Once we understood the strategy would work, the size of the portfolio just followed.You'll be surprised that we took advice from a journalist (about the size and strategy). I was social friends with Milton Moskowitz, who was writing a news story that started as a book. It was about the 100 best places to work.I looked at the returns of the 50% to 60% that were publicly traded ... and thought I should start a fund based on that. Milton thought I should stick with 100 companies. I disagreed. He said I'd screw it up.Anyway, it took years (of looking for fundamental metrics that correlated to good stock performance). It took about two years of back-testing on paper, then five more years of running the portfolio (before opening it to the public).IBD: Aside from ESG criteria, it looks to me as if you seek large-cap companies with wide moats or strong competitive advantages, and quality management teams that act in the best interests of shareholders. Have I got it right?Dodson: That's it, succinctly.IBD: Information technology is your largest sector, with a 50% weighting as of March 31. Is that a typical exposure to tech?Dodson: It's usually been our largest sector, but not 50%. Normally it's around 30%. The reason is that we know the sector well. Silicon Valley is down the road from us and more and more right here in the city.Also, in terms of workplace, technology companies seem a step ahead in providing a good environment. Google -- Alphabet (GOOGL) now -- has generous maternity leave, a gym where you can work out, days off for doing charitable events.Compared to, say, the steel industry, workplace issues score stronger at tech companies.IBD: Speaking of Alphabet, it's been trending sideways since late April. Do you still like the stock?Dodson: We started buying at 525 in December 2014. Now it's up to (the low 700s). We think it will make more gains. But you're right, it's been pretty flat. We regard it as a long-term holding. It's got a great moat and a good social story.IBD: Why do you think it has more room to run?Dodson: Primarily because of its moat, and it's looking to develop new products. It has a huge cash stake, a talented workforce. Its search engine gives them (revenue and earnings) stability. I don't know what new ideas they're working on, but I know they're looking for new products and they'll find something.IBD: In general, you emphasize some ESG criteria more than others, right?Dodson: We are more focused on the workplace, how a company treats employees. Then the environment. Workplace is a component of ""social.""IBD: How is workplace part of ""social""?Dodson: The word ""social"" covers a lot. For us, it means how a company treats its employees. It can mean safety record, privacy policy, relationship to the community where the company operates, diversity programs and good, clear, honest communication.IBD: Do you ever invest in a stock because its E, S or G features are very attractive, even though its financial performance is not so bright?Dodson: In the past we've done that. I did it before Endeavor Fund, with Parnassus Fund (PARNX). The stock was Control Data (a supercomputer company). They would hire former prisoners, do great social things. But the business strategy was just OK. We invested, and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever had. It cured me of picking for environmental or social reasons alone.IBD: Let's talk about individual holdings as of your latest disclosure. Citrix Systems' (CTXS) earnings per share rose 51% and 82% the past two quarters. A lot of people think the enterprise software developer, specializing in desktop virtualization, lost its focus. It's in a reorganization that has involved layoffs of staff and contractors. How does this situation look to you?Dodson: The reason we invested was because of their GoToMeeting app (which is being spun off). GoToMeeting is similar to Citrix's XenApp. You can be thousands of miles away from your server, doing applications, and you can use it on your smartphone or laptop, and it delivers it safely on your mobile device. That's what makes them successful. People want applications, this company delivers them where you want.IBD: Your stake in Applied Materials' (AMAT) is up. Are you satisfied with their progress?Dodson: It was in the doldrums when we initiated a position in May 2009 at 11.22. Equipment used to make semiconductors tends to be volatile. Sales and earnings are very cyclical. We tried to buy at a time when the stock had fallen off, then ride it up. Now it's (rising). We believe Applied will benefit from significant order growth with its leading etch and deposition tools.IBD: Ciena's (CIEN) earnings per share have slowed from 625% growth three quarters ago to 50% growth and a 3% decline the past two frames. Everything OK there?Dodson: We've owned it quite a while. It's more volatile than we expected. It makes communication glass wires, equipment that moves impulses, whether they are voice or data, along transmission lines. Earnings have been lumpy because any time you have an equipment maker, it has ups and downs. We've held it through cycles. It's more volatile than we expected. But we like the company, and we think it has more upside.IBD: Why do you own C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW)? It's not a tech story. And revenue has declined three quarters in a row.Dodson: It's a freight forwarder, focusing on trucking. You're right. It hasn't done well. That's primarily because shipping has not picked up as much as anticipated. The economy is growing (at an annualized rate of) 2% or less. To get trucking and freight forwarding growing, the economy has to grow more. So it's a play that the economic recovery will accelerate. But our average cost is 55. The stock is in the mid-70s, so we've done well.IBD: Charles Schwab's (SCHW) EPS grow has accelerated for two quarters, but share price has been weak. What's your play here?Dodson: We're tied in to them. We pay Schwab if customers come in through them.But the key? A lot of brokerage firms, including Schwab, collect interest on margin loans. With interest rates so low, they don't make much. But if interest rates increase, then there's a huge earnings increase for Schwab. It's in the mid-20s now. It would go to the 40s.If our economy gets better, rates will go up and Schwab will take off.IBD: Intel's (INTC) EPS growth is speeding up. Where's the growth for their computer chips coming from?Dodson: They make chips for personal computers, smartphones and other applications. They also make chips for servers. Those sales are going up.They've been trying for years to get into the mobile (devices) market. They finally have semiconductors going into the iPhone. They're trying to get more into communications and other growth areas. With this Apple (AAPL) chip and other missions, that's what we're banking on to move Intel higher.IBD: Procter & Gamble (PG) is the classic defensive stock. But revenue per share has declined for eight quarters. Is this what you want?Dodson: You're right about revenue declining. They've got these amazing brands: Crest, Tide, Gillette, Head & Shoulders. But they need a new growth engine. We're looking at it. Does it have growth ahead? We haven't reached a conclusion.IBD: IBM (IBM) EPS is down four straight quarters. Sales are down 16 frames in a row. Why invest in it?
"
425,SCHW,"Dodson: My only defense is that Warren Buffett owns a lot more than I do. I first bought it at the end of 2013. I expected it to turn around as they cut emphasis on hardware. At some point, growth in (consulting and) software will offset declines in hardware. But it hasn't happened yet. At 10.7 times (forward) earnings, we believe share price is on the bargain table.IBD: Is Buffett selling?Dodson: No. We look when there's a filing, but we've seen no sign of (Buffett selling). I'm sure he's having the same regrets I have.IBD: W.W. Grainger's (GWW) EPS and sales finally notched gains after declining for two quarters. But shares are not making headway.Dodson: Grainger makes everything under the sun (for maintenance). This in some sense is a play on the overall economy. If the U.S. economy can grow fast enough, Grainger will do well because its products touch almost every sector of the economy.IBD: Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EPS and revenue growth have slowed in recent quarters. Do you still like this stock?Dodson: I was expecting sales to increase quite a bit for their hepatitis C product. But they had to cut prices because of competition. Both AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) make therapies for hep C. Gilead is a great lab. They will develop new therapies. In time, the company should do well.IBD: This fund began with a different name. Why the name change, Jerry?Dodson: The way we pick stocks hasn't changed. We started out as the Workplace Fund. We had good performance early on, but the name Workplace Fund was not getting the attention we thought it should.People on our staff said we got strange reactions from brokers and advisors, who weren't sure what the name meant. ""Why not pick a more general name?"" they said. They said that would get more shareholder money, more acceptance.IBD: And why is the fund concentrated?Dodson: Primarily because I can't find enough companies that are undervalued that meet the workplace and social criteria.IBD: The fund has 25 names. How typical is that?Dodson: We would like to have 35 to 40 names. We're looking for more. The last couple years we went down to 25 or so.IBD: The fund had an 11% cash weighting as of May 31. Was that because it's hard to find your kind of stocks?Dodson: That's correct. I try to stay as fully invested as possible.IBD: Jerry, make my day: Before running this fund, did you run a totally non-PC fund -- you know, one that only invests in ammo, tobacco, oil?Dodson: Before Endeavor, I managed each of six (including one that no longer exists) other Parnassus funds prior to finding a manager for each of them. I founded Parnassus Investments in 1984. Prior to that, I worked for six years as president of a small bank in San Francisco. Before that, I spent four years as a foreign service officer with the Department of State, serving in Panama and Vietnam.IBD: What was your investment style before you embraced ESG?Dodson: We've embraced ESG since the firm was founded. It was one of our founding principles.IBD: What got you into ESG?Dodson: My personal philosophy had always revolved around ESG, but I wasn't sure it could be used as a business philosophy. At Continental, I started a program to allow savers to put their money into special savings accounts that would be lent out for solar energy installations. Much to my pleasant surprise, the program was very popular.It convinced me that there was a market out there for investors who wanted to make a positive impact with their money. This led to the founding of Working Assets Money Fund (1983-1984), which took ESG factors into account in investing in money market securities.This, in turn, led to the formation of Parnassus Investments.I took the ESG from my experience, then added the value-oriented philosophy of Benjamin Graham, whose writings I admired. These two strains formed the basis of the Parnassus investment philosophy.IBD: How did you come up with the Parnassus name?Dodson: I lived on a street near Parnassus Avenue in San Francisco. I looked up the mythology around Mount Parnassus in Greece and discovered it was the site of the Oracle of Delphi. I liked the image of the oracle often going against the prevailing wisdom. It fit my contrarian, value-oriented investment philosophy.IBD: Since you're 73, do you have plans to retire?Dodson: I plan to retire as chief executive officer in 2018 at 75. However, I plan to stay on indefinitely as manager of Endeavor until I find someone well-qualified to take over.

426,SCHW,"Charles Schwab’s (SCHW) decision to stop offering A class mutual funds that carry a commission reinforces a trend that already exists.The discount brokerage behemoth said that it will stop offering A-class load mutual funds as of May 2.""There definitely has been, over the past 15 or so years, a big move away from load shares,"" said Scott Cooley, director of policy research for Morningstar Inc. ""Fifteen years ago, load funds were more than 40% of mutual fund assets. Now they're down to 20%. The industry has been growing, but load funds have lost market share.""Shareholders with already existing A-class funds at Schwab can leave them there or even transfer such shares into a Schwab account, the brokerage told IBD. Account holders can also still sell and receive dividend reinvestments for those shares inside a Schwab account.Schwab insisted that the move is a response to dwindling interest by shareholders in paying loads, not a response to a recent Department of Labor (DOL) rule that tightens restrictions on advisor conflicts of interest and requires advisors to disclose how they're paid.""Load funds have never been part of our core offering,"" spokeswoman Natalie Rix told IBD.The DOL rule extends a fiduciary standard of decision-making to advisors who work with retirement accounts. The new rule requires brokers and other advisors to recommend mutual funds and other investments based on their clients' interests.Under the new rule, advisors will have to disclose conflicts of interest and compensation setups to clients.Even if Schwab is not reacting to the extension of the fiduciary rule, ""with the DOL fiduciary rule coming into effect, it will hasten the move away from load shares,"" Cooley said.At least one fund complex, Waddell & Reed, said in February that it would merge A-class shares into institutional shares, which commonly charge no load and also have relatively low annual expense ratios, Cooley says.MFS, another fund complex that offers load funds, told IBD, ""MFS offers its mutual funds in multiple share classes, some of which include sales loads. Although this has become an increasingly smaller part of our business in recent years, we continue to offer shares with loads to provide greater flexibility for the various distributors that sell our funds.""Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for S&P Capital IQ, said, ""Advisors are increasingly shifting to fee-based business from commission-based and lower-cost index-based mutual funds and ETFs. Sales load funds are hard to justify in a fee-based account.""He added: ""We expect more mutual fund firms to focus on no-load options and to reduce the number of A and C class (lower annual load) products in the next couple of years.""

427,SCHW,"Money manager Vladimir “Val” de Vassal holds the same kind of leading stocks that you probably try to buy. But can you say your portfolio has outperformed 98% of your peers?De Vassal of Glenmede Investment Management aims to remove messy emotion from his buy and sell decisions. That adds to his performance in the long run, he says.Through May 31, he and his colleagues, including co-manager Paul Sullivan, have steered $2.3 billion Glenmede Large Cap Growth Fund (GTLLX) to average annual gains that topped all but 2% of their large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past three and five years.Since de Vassal took the reins in early 2004, the mutual fund has scored a 9.16% average annual gain, while the S&P 500 averaged 7.26%.The fund’s star performance over both the long and short term make it an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersIn an interview with IBD from his Philadelphia office, De Vassal, 56, shared some of his investing secrets. Here’s what he had to say about the techniques that allow his investing team to beat the S&P time and again:IBD: You have a quantitative investment approach. What does that mean, and how do you mix in fundamental research with that?De Vassal: I look at our process as a quantitative discipline based on fundamental insights. I worked with fundamental managers for 20 years. They were value-oriented, growth-oriented, small-cap, large-cap, even international. Basically, one of my responsibilities was objectively assessing their criteria in selecting stocks in their particular sectors or universe, and assessing what worked and what didn't.And I've tried to remove the emotion and subjectivity out of the process.So we've built a library of the factors that worked and that didn't. They're different for different sectors. If you talk with a tech analyst versus a utility analyst, they talk about very different metrics as to why a company is effective or not.So we've built models that are unique for each sector. Some factors may be similar, but when we look at stocks, we look at them relative to their peers in the sector in terms of their attractiveness. This is a continual process every year.We add each year of data to our analysis. And we'll test new ideas.We have dialogue with our internal portfolio managers and analysts. We also have dialogue with some leading Street research firms like Empirical (Research Partners), Bernstein, JPMorgan (JPM) and Citi (C).IBD: What type of market does your approach work best in?De Vassal: Our process works when valuations and earnings matter. We look to create a portfolio that is cheap with high cash flow versus its benchmark, but has strong consistent profitability. And the stocks we own are likely to have positive earnings and revenue surprises, and fewer negative earnings and revenue surprises, than the benchmark.Where the strategy can struggle is when investors are distracted by macro issues. In the financial crisis in the Great Recession, earnings didn't matter. Investors fled equities, and they didn't care at what price.In that situation, when investors are not focused on specific company fundamentals but are driven by macro and behavioral issues, our models have less efficacy.IBD: What about more recently?De Vassal: Other periods when the strategy underperforms would be risk rallies, like 2009, and we've had a pretty strong risk rally starting in March this year, when a lot of the riskiest names are outperforming, in the last couple of months.But in this risk rally, there's been a lot of price dislocation when you look across stocks within sectors, a lot of gap between high- and low-priced stocks measured on, say, price-to-book.So this year's risk rally is a good environment for active equity managers because there seems to be a large arbitrage opportunity between cheap and expensive stocks that maybe can be taken advantage of. Those create opportunities for future price appreciation.IBD: So you like the current market?De Vassal: Our indicators still suggest we're in a positive growth environment for the U.S. economy. We had two weak quarters in Q4 and Q1. But our models suggest we should expect a rebound. Most economists expect 2% to 3% annualized growth in GDP for this quarter and the next couple of quarters.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWe favor more cyclical sectors right now, like technology and consumer discretionary. We're underweight in interest-rate sensitive sectors like utilities and REITs.IBD: Let's talk about how you put your strategy to work. How does Edwards Lifesciences (EW) fit in? All of my questions are as of your latest disclosure.De Vassal: We owned it as of Jan. 31. It had good return on equity, over 20%. More sell-side analysts were raising than lowering estimates for the year and next year. The valuation was not cheap. But the fact that more analysts are raising estimates and that it has strong profitability and momentum -- historically, strong earnings growth offsets a rich valuation. And that's why we included this stock.IBD: What other holdings were you attracted to for similar reasons?De Vassal: Other names we bought in January were Oracle (ORCL), Masco (MAS), Schwab (SCHW). Again, they were attractive based on our criteria, a combination of earnings growth and analysts' estimates.One stock we sold in January was H&R Block (HRB). It was in the bottom quintile of its sector. Fortunately -- it's down 40% since we sold it.If there's something hitting one of our downside screens, we force it out of the portfolio. No questions asked.It takes time for fundamental analysts and portfolio managers to fall in love with a stock. But once they put it into a portfolio, it's hard for them to let go. We try to remove that emotion out of the process. In the long term, that adds to our performance.IBD: How does your approach differ from a fundamentals-only fund manager's?De Vassal: We look for stock that is cheap and has positive growth metrics and (whose coverage) analysts are raising estimates. We just look at what criteria work best in differentiating stocks in a sector. If it's a health care company, we don't look at what's in their pipeline, for example. Our stock ranking model for health care emphasizes high free cash flow yield, low relative price-to-book, strong reinvestment rate and positive earnings and revenue estimate revisions.IBD: Facebook (FB) has three quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. How do you look at this holding?De Vassal: It's attractive in our models. Its valuation is not cheap. But its fundamentals and growth story are positive. So is the fact that analysts are raising estimates.There have been periods when we sold Facebook because it was getting too rich. Last year, the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, which is now Alphabet (GOOGL)) were just flying. But their valuations got too rich, and we wouldn't hold on. But at this point, Facebook would still be considered a buy in our models.IBD: You opened a stake in Lowe's (LOW) just last year. What was your thesis?
"
428,SCHW,"De Vassal: We started our stake in June 2015. It ranked in the top third of our stock-ranking models. It had positive (revenue and earnings) estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. Valuation was not too extreme. The price-earnings ratio on this year's earnings was under 20.Our stock-ranking models are based on 12-month periods. We look to turn over about 1/12th of the portfolio each month to maintain attractiveness. Every month we look to refresh and harvest losses to offset short-term gains in particular.IBD: Cadence Design's (CDNS) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for two quarters. What's your quant view?De Vassal: It has had very positive earnings revisions. When we ran this in January, every analyst raised estimates for this company. Its P-E is not that expensive. It was 17.7 in January. It has done well and is now a little over 20.IBD: Thinly traded Mettler Toledo (MTD) is in an uptrend, but its EPS growth is slowing slightly. What's your view?De Vassal: It is still attractively ranked in our model. Estimate revisions are more neutral. But we showed positive for looking forward on analysts' estimates. It has very strong profitability, very high ROE. January ROE was over 40%. Some was contingent on book value. It's decelerating, but historically their growth has been over 10%. Looking forward, this still looks like double-digit growth, even if low double digits.IBD: You've been boosting your stake in Accenture (ACN). Why?De Vassal: It has a very attractive rank in the tech sector for us. Analysts at the margins are raising their estimates. It has high ROE and a good track record of dividend growth.IBD: What makes you different from other quant-oriented fund managers?De Vassal: The difference is in four principles.First, we believe in active management, and that stocks get mispriced. One issue with benchmark indices is that if a stock is overpriced, effectively it is overweighted. To address that, we ignore weights of individual stocks. We want to avoid the idiosyncratic risk of overexposure to a single name. If everything else is equal between a midcap and a mega-cap name, why wouldn't you invest in both instead of overweighting one just because it has a larger weight in the benchmark?Second, we treat each sector differently. I don't believe one model should be used for all stocks. Stocks in different sectors have different attributes and business models.Third, downside risk screens, including quality of earnings; avoiding companies with poor stock quality, debt and/or high idiosyncratic risk.Fourth, we differentiate stocks that are more likely to have positive versus negative surprises based on sell-side analyst behavior, company fundamentals and technical data.IBD: The idea behind your quantitative approach is that it homes in on the factors that identify stocks which outperform and it enables you to avoid being sidetracked by subjective factors that are, basically, irrelevant to outperformance, right?De Vassal: Yes, we build extensive back tests going back 20 years-plus, that identify which combinations of criteria would create a portfolio of stocks that outperform the average stock in the sector on a rolling 12-month basis, and which would be in the top 20%, the most attractive stocks.IBD: What about risk?De Vassal: We're looking for the most consistent excess return over rolling 12-month periods. So we're looking for the highest return per unit of shortfall risk. And shortfall risk would be any (stock) that didn't outperform the average stock by at least 200 basis points.We want to have upside, but we don't want to have much downside performance relative to the average stock.IBD: Some managers portray themselves as people who eat and sleep fund management, doing nothing else. But you've got at least one interesting hobby. Tell me about it, please.De Vassal: Well, one of my hobbies is genealogy. My last name is French. It's an old French name. We have a family tree going back more than 1,000 years. Apparently family members did a thousand-year reunion in 1987. We learned about it after the fact.We have a lot of documentation, interesting history. Our family went from France to the Ukraine in the early 1800s. We actually, this past Saturday, we saw relatives that we didn't know about. One, she was my third cousin. We got in touch through a Frenchman who was doing genealogical research on my family, and we ended up connecting for the first time.

As expected - she did not get pinned down - she did though try to make clear that her preference is to move rates up sooner and slower rather than later and faster....I think most investors/analysts and strategists would agree with that strategy...and so the market did not panic.....Look - the Fed and every other central bank around the world will continue to do their part to stimulate and support global markets...(since elected officials are clearly impotent and are unable to perform as expected) .......so sit back and relax....no worries....the song says - ' I've come to give you a hand and lead you to the promised land' doesn't it?Across the pond - a couple of things happened - just in case you missed it.....Greeks voted to accept the latest (and worst) bailout plan - but not without any drama.....late yesterday - images appeared of Athens under fire....Molotov cocktails being tossed about, police using tear gas to disperse the crowds, inside the parliament building - the room erupted into chaos - Greek ministers up in arms with Alexis - as the sense is he sold his country out....yet in the end - the measures did pass (was there really a choice?). If nothing else - the deal does provide some respite and will allow that country to return to some sense of normalcy. For the markets - yesterday's vote did represent a major hurdle and now that it is over investors can move forward and look ahead - this morning it is clear that the 'Risk On' mentality is alive and well as Global markets are all in relief rally mode.Now do not discount the good earnings that we have seen so far......the Banks here in the U.S. have not disappointed (good) add in Netflix (NFLX), Intel (INTC) and UnitedHealth (UNH) and the tone of earnings feels decidedly positive.....Yes - I understand that we are only 4 days into it - but considering what analysts had prepared the street for - it is a welcomed relief that initial reports are 'better than expected'.Economic data at home today includes Initial Jobless claims of 285k, Continuing Claims of 2.3 mil - both would be an improvement over last week, Philly Fed Survey - expectation is 12.0. In Europe - we are awaiting the ECB rate decision - expectation is for NO change - rates to remain low.....but the real focus will be if the ECB ups the ante for Greek assistance.Since Yellen's second day of testimony is to yield no surprises - the only thing we will be waiting for is the Q&A from the Senators - let's hope that we do not see the stupidity displayed by congressman Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) yesterday - as he attacked Ms. Yellen during her testimony over documents related to a possible Fed leak in October of 2012 - when Uncle Benny was in charge...European markets are all up - FTSE +0.43% , CAC 40 + 1.39%, DAX + 1.50%, EUROSTOXX +1.38%, SPAIN +1.32% and ITALY +1.28%.... and here, too, the focus will now turn to earnings - which are also coming in better than expected - Banks and retailers showing early strength.......Greece will now be returned to the back burner until the next crisis......Technically - we are above all of the moving averages....and they all now represent support...... U.S. futures are up 8 points in early trade looking to test the recent highs at 2125ish.....earnings today include Charles Schwab (SCHW), Ebay (EBAY), PPG (beat), Philip Morris (PM) (beat) , Goldman Sachs (GS), and Citigroup (C) to name just a few.....The tone is decidedly bullish - a complete change from last week as investors celebrate the good news.Take good care -KpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O'Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

463,SCHW,"June gloom settled firmly over the market Friday as stocks opened to scant losses despite better-than-expected May jobs data.The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average deflated 0.1% apiece. Volume rose 27% on the Nasdaq and 4% on the NYSE, vs. action at the same time Thursday.While there was much anticipation ahead of Friday's May payrolls report, Greece's debt deadline and the biannual meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the stock market today showed little reaction to developments any of the three fronts. Payrolls topped expectations, and the unemployment rate increased as job-seekers flooded back into the labor pool. Greece delayed its payment to the International Monetary Fund, rolling its four comparatively smaller payments into a $1.5 billion lump sum now due at the end of the month, significantly increasing the odds of a default. OPEC kept its overall production target unchanged and offered no suggestion that members producing above their quota levels — an issue that could send prices lower over the next few months — would be penalized.Oil and financial issues were the only stocks showing gains on the Dow. JPMorgan (JPM) topped the index with a 1.5% gain. Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) rose a bit more than 1%, the largest advance among Nasdaq 100 stocks.Financials also topped the S&P 500. Alabama-based Regions Financial (RF) jumped nearly 4%. Charles Schwab (SCHW) trimmed its initial gap-up gain to near 3%.China's JA Solar Holdings (JASO) soared 13% out of the starting gate. The company reported that a bid by Chairman and Chief Executive Baofang Jin to buy all outstanding company shares valued the company near $490 million. The announcement came just as European regulators imposed tariffs on China-based solar component plays, including Canadian Solar (CSIQ), ET Solar and ReneSola (SOL), a penalty for violating a 2013 pact allowing them to trade in the European Union at reduced tariffs.Among IBD 50 stocks, the Israel-based CyberArk Software (CYBR) jumped nearly 3% in early action. The gain puts the network security software developer a bit less than 9% from a 69.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Cirrus Logic (CRUS) led the list's downside, dropping more than 3% in very strong trade. The chip developer is down 6% from its May 26 high but still above its 10-week moving average.

464,SCHW,"Charles Schwab (SCHW) investors are happier than investors with other firms. But investors rank the entire financial industry lower than fields such as technology, food and drink, and pharmaceuticals. Investors’ trust in finance is particularly weak in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, but strong in India and China.Those are the results of new surveys by the CFA Institute and J.D. Power.Schwab tops the list of 21 financial services companies in a poll of investors for the “2016 U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study.” The report, by marketing and information services firm J.D. Power, said, “Schwab has developed an overall client experience that is closely aligned with the evolving priorities of today’s full-service investor.” The next most popular firms, in order, were Edward Jones, Fidelity Investments and UBS (UBS) Financial Services.At the bottom of the list are LPL Financial (LPLA), PNC (PNC) Wealth Management, Lincoln (LNC) Financial Network and, lowest of all, Voya Financial (VOYA).The financial services industry as a whole ranks below most other industries in “From Trust to Loyalty: A Global Survey of What Investors Want in 2016.” The survey comes from the CFA Institute, which calls itself “a global association of investment professionals.”The technology world ranks at the top; 77% of the survey’s respondents (3,312 retail investors from 10 countries and 502 institutional investors from six countries) say that they trust the tech industry “to do what is right.” In second place (68%) comes the food and beverage industry, followed by brewing and spirits (65%), pharmaceuticals (64%), banks (63%) and telecommunications, energy and consumer packaged goods (62% each).Financial services ranked under all of those industries: 61% of retail investors and 57% of institutional investors said that they trusted the industry.The survey’s other industries were automotive (60%), entertainment (55%) and, coming in dead last, media (47%).The level of trust varied from country to country, the CFA Institute reported. In India, 90% of the survey respondents said that they trust the financial services industry. Just below India was China (89%). From there, the level of trust fell hard: only 64% in Canada and Hong Kong, 63% in Singapore, 55% in France, 54% in the United States, 50% in Australia, 44% in the U.K. and 40% in Germany.
"
465,SCHW,"The financial services industry breathed a sigh of relief when the Department of Labor (DOL) issued its new rule last week. That rule aims to shield individual investors from retirement plan advice by brokers who put their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests.The sigh of relief was because the DOL's new restrictions on brokers' conflicts of interest was less onerous than the industry had expected. The DOL imposed a fiduciary standard, but provided exemptions and a slower implementation timetable.Still, the industry does stand to feel a megabuck impact. The rule could fuel as much as trillions of dollars in client asset shifts -- mainly from high-cost actively managed mutual funds -- with hefty losses of fees and commissions. It will also likely impose billions of dollars in upfront and subsequent annual compliance costs.In the $23 trillion U.S. retirement market, much of that impact will be in the $7.3 trillion IRA market, says a new report by Goldman Sachs. About $5 trillion of that will not be affected by the new rule. That's because that money was already subject to the fiduciary rule or is in self-directed accounts that don't use a financial advisor's recommendations or for some other reason, Goldman says.That leaves about $2.2 trillion in mutual funds where advisor-aided buy-sell decisions could change due to the new rule. And financial firms could be hurt by the loss of sales commissions -- also known as loads -- as well as by the loss of annual fees, as shareholder investments into those accounts slow or as assets are shifted into other, lower-cost types of assets such as index funds and ETFs, Goldman says.Mutual fund front-end loads -- commission paid when the fund is bought -- range from 0.50% to 5.75% of the value of the shares purchased, Morningstar Inc. says. Deferred loads, -- paid when shares are sold -- range from 1% to 4%.The average annual expense ratio, or percent of assets paid by the shareholder to the fund manager, is 1.18%. Stock funds bear an average annual cost of 1.25%. Bond-fund shareholders pay 0.96% on average.At 1.18%, $2.2 trillion in at-risk IRA assets would generate $39.6 billion in annual fees alone.Shareholders have been shifting to no-load share classes for years, says the Investment Company Institute, an industry group.And shareholders are already voting with their wallets against what is perceived to be higher cost mutual funds. Those $2 trillion in retail mutual funds that generate brokerage commissions account for 20% of active mutual fund assets under management. That's down from a 37% share in 2007.And where are those assets going? Individual investors are not putting them under their mattresses. They're shifting them into lower-fee ETFs and index mutual funds. Boosted by this rotation, ETF assets could mushroom to $7 trillion globally by 2020, up from $2.8 trillion today, Goldman says.In addition, the industry will also be hit by compliance costs: costs of revamping procedures to comply with the new rule, costs of retraining staff. Goldman says annual compliance costs will be more than $13 billion in upfront costs and more than $7 billion in annual costs.Retail brokers, asset managers and life insurers face swirling crosswinds of benefits and financial harm as shareholders shift existing assets and shift future asset allocation strategies, Goldman warns.""We see discount brokers like SCHW, AMTD and ETFC as relative gainers, likely gaining share as FAs"" -- financial advisors -- ""seek new platforms built for a fiduciary world and smaller accounts migrate to self-directed IRAs (and/or) auto-advisors,"" a Goldman report readers, referring to publicly traded brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).""Furthermore, we believe the end result will likely be further pressure on fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs/passive (mutual funds),"" Goldman's report added, citing iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.In addition, Goldman predicts that rollovers to IRAs from 401(k)s by retirees will slow. Because that process will be subject to the fiduciary rule, brokers will simply avoid it. Instead, financial advisors may advise their clients to leave assets in their 401(k) accounts. That should help a fund family like T. Rowe Price (TROW), Goldman says. T. Rowe Price does much more business running 401(k) accounts than it does as an IRA custodian, according to Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren.The largest players in the 401(k) business should gain, Goldman says. Among publicly traded companies, that includes BlackRock, State Street, Prudential Financial (PRU), Northern Trust (NTRS), Principal Financial Group (PFG) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK).T. Rowe Price and AllianceBernstein (AB) are also positioned to gain market share in the target-date fund business.Image provided by Shutterstock.

466,SCHW,"Individual investors won some but not all of what was hoped from a sweeping new rule that tightens conflict-of-interest standards for brokers. Those brokers manage trillions of dollars in retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs, creating compliance headaches and liability issues for the financial industry.Still, the new rules are more lenient than the financial industry had feared they would be. And that leniency led investors to bid up stocks on Wednesday of many asset managers, brokers and insurers.Life insurer Primerica (PRI) soared nearly 7%. Broker and financial adviser Ameriprise Financial (AMP) rose 1.5%. T. Rowe Price (TROW) rose 1.4%. ""Several of these stocks are trading up today,"" said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. ""The rule impact is being seen as not as onerous as feared.""Despite industry relief, overall the rule is seen as a victory for individual investors.The final Labor Department (DOL) fiduciary rule, which follows months of public and industry views on its proposal, requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients when providing retirement advice. The Obama administration claims that will lower costs and boost returns for investors.""Today’s rule ensures that putting clients first is no longer a marketing slogan,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a conference with reporters. ""It is the law.""The fiduciary standard of behavior creates new grounds for complaints by investors who feel they have been short-changed by their broker. At the outset of a brokerage relationship, a broker can still require a client to agree to take any disputes to arbitration rather than to court. But now the broker has to meet a higher standard of professional behavior, says Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago securities-fraud attorney.""(The new rule) creates a strengthened cause of action for those suing their brokers,"" Stoltmann said. The new rule does not mean that DOL itself will become more active as a securities cop, Stoltmann added.The government made some concessions in its final rule after months of criticism from the financial industry.The Investment Company Institute, a group representing mutual funds, last summer called the proposal so complicated that it is unworkable. Brokerages charged that the requirement would add costs that make retirement advice unaffordable for many lower- and middle-income investors.Some financial firms will probably benefit, while others are expected to be hurt.Discount brokerages such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stand to be helped, Morningstar predicted. So are companies that sell a lot of index and exchange traded products, like State Street (STT), BlackRock (BLK) and Vanguard. And robo-advisors are also likely to gain business. Brokers would be compelled to use their low-cost products and services rather than high cost alternatives.T. Rowe Price stock was up because its funds are relatively good performers, meaning they are more likely to be acceptable investment recommendations by brokers, Warren said. Also, the firm has been bolstering its sales staff in recent months, to boost its IRA business, he added.In its new rule, the Labor Department addressed some industry concerns. The originally proposed eight-month deadline for compliance is gone, replaced by a longer, ""phased"" implementation timetable.Also modified is a requirement for new clients to sign a contract in which any broker conflicts are disclosed. These would include the broker disclosing that high-commission products might be offered even though lower-cost alternatives are available. The final rule says the contract does not have to be signed until a client actually opens an account. The proposed rule called for the contract to be signed when the client first had contact with a broker.Another item dropped from the final rule: a proposed list of acceptable assets that advisors can recommend instead of certain high-risk investments. And a widely expected prohibition of in-house investment products has been dropped.""I'm a little disappointed the DOL has caved on the issue of whether firms can recommend proprietary products like annuities,"" Stoltmann said. ""No real fiduciary could do this. I think the DOL caved on a very crucial issue.""The new rule basically extends a fiduciary standard mainly to brokers when they provide investment advice for retirement accounts. A fiduciary standard requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients. Registered investment advisors (RIAs) are already subject to the fiduciary standard, but a stricter version than imposed by the new rule on brokers, said Stoltmann.The new rule takes aim at IRAs -- particularly on money that is transferred or rolled over into IRAs from workplace retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, says Skip Schweiss, TD Ameritrade head of investor advocacy.Under the old rule, brokers could recommend investments that were merely suitable for clients. The DOL says that the old standard allowed brokers to base recommendations on what would generate commissions for them, even if a better-performing, lower-cost investment was available.The White House -- which supports the tighter standard -- said in February 2015 that investments made on the basis of conflicted advice under the old rule returned roughly 1 percentage point less a year on average than investments made on the advice of fiduciaries.With an estimated $1.7 trillion of IRA assets invested in the type of products that generate conflicts of interest, the White House estimated that the aggregate annual cost of conflicted advice is about $17 billion.""A retiree who receives conflicted advice when rolling over a 401(k) balance to an IRA at retirement will lose an estimated 12% of the value of his or her savings if drawn down over 30 years,"" read the White House report. ""If a retiree receiving conflicted advice takes withdrawals at the rate possible absent conflicted advice, his or her savings would run out more than five years earlier.""With a $100,000 rollover for people age 55 to 64 in 2012, a 12% loss would cost the average investor $12,000.Morningstar forecast a mixed impact for active asset managers, including AllianceBernstein (AB), Cohen & Steers (CNS), Eaton Vance (EV), Federated (FII), Janus Capital Group (JNS) and Legg Mason (LM). The same applies to full-service wealth managers, including Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Raymond James (RJF) and Wells Fargo (WFC).These companies have product lineups that include both higher and lower cost products.And some impact could differ from what's expected. Many full-service brokerages could replace commission-based IRA fund sales with IRAs that generate fees on assets. ""As fee-based accounts can have a revenue yield upwards of 60% higher than commission-based, this could translate to as much as an additional $13 billion of revenue for the industry,"" Morningstar reported.Also, full-service wealth managers could stop serving clients with low IRA account balances. Those clients could take an estimated $250 billion to $600 billion in assets to robo-advisors. That could push a number of robo-advisors above the $16 billion to $40 billion asset base that Morningstar estimated they need to become profitable.Even within groups that could be hurt by the new rule, like active asset managers and insurers, some companies could benefit. ""(Firms) with moats will gain market share from their less competitively advantaged peers or ... will be able to adjust their business model to offset the negative financial effects of the rule,"" Morningstar reported.

467,SCHW,"Office subleasing, an early indicator of past downturns, is at its highest level since 2010. The amount of available space from subleases in the city jumped to 1.9 million square feet (176,500 square meters) last month, a 46% increase from the end of the third quarter, according to a report from Cushman & Wakefield. Twitter (TWTR), Intuit (INTU), and Zenefits are among tech companies putting excess space on the market.“It’s the beginning of the change,” said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. “We’re very early in the correction process. It’s going to take several years to play out, and we don’t know how deep it will be.”A five-year frenzy for San Francisco office space may be cooling as venture-capital investments decline and tech firms slow their hiring from a breakneck pace. The extra space is a warning sign that the growth rate for some companies was unsustainable, Rosen said. Some startups took more space than they needed in the hopes of expanding later, while others are moving to less-expensive areas or shifting staff to other buildings in the city.A pullback would be a marked shift for one of the hottest U.S. real estate markets. San Francisco had the lowest metropolitan office-vacancy rate at the end of last year, at 5.9%, according to CBRE Group (CBG). The San Francisco Bay area was No. 2 in the country for office investment in 2015, behind New York, the brokerage’s data show.“A lot of the startups aren’t doing as well as the money behind them would like them to do, so they’re cutting off the flow of funds for a number of these companies,” said Robert Sammons, regional director of research at Cushman & Wakefield in San Francisco. “These companies are having to make corrections in their business plans.”The largest share of space on the market is from companies that are contracting or consolidating, according to Cushman & Wakefield. As of the end of last year, about 55% was from the technology industry.An increase in subleasing preceded office-market downturns following the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bust in the late 1990s, said Colin Yasukochi, director of research and analysis at CBRE in San Francisco.The trend isn’t entirely negative. Some companies that leased space in the early stages of the boom can rent it out at a profit. Others may be expanding and moving into bigger offices, an indicator of growth.Subleasing also opens up more affordable space at a time when rents are near record highs. The space on the market for sublease has asking rents about 17% below those of regular leases, according to Cushman & Wakefield.“If you’re looking to move to San Francisco, the increase in subleasing availability is a sign that there’s still space available,” said Drew Murrell, citywide revenue manager in the division of budget and analysis at the San Francisco Controller’s Office.Twitter is subleasing 50,000 square feet at its 1355 Market St. headquarters, according to Matt Hart, executive managing director at Savills Studley, a tenant brokerage.A spokeswoman for Twitter declined to comment. The social-media company, which said in October that it would cut as much as 8% of its staff, has lost 67% of its market value in the past year.Companies such as Intuit are banking space that they’re renting with plans for expansion but don’t yet need. The software firm is subleasing two floors at 22 Fourth St. “that we have in our portfolio for future growth,” said spokeswoman Diane Carlini.Zenefits, which occupies four floors at 303 Second St., is subleasing space to move workers to adjacent floors, said Jessica Hoffman, a spokeswoman. The human-resources software startup, facing investigations over compliance with state rules, said last month that it would cut about 250 jobs.A big chunk of the subleasing space on the market comes from Charles Schwab (SCHW), which is subletting about 300,000 square feet as it combines its two San Francisco offices into one while boosting staff in other states, including Colorado and Texas, said Sarah Bulgatz, a spokeswoman for the financial-services firm.More than 1 million square feet in additional sublease space will likely be available this year, said Hart of Savills Studley. He said that he’s more concerned about a shift in tenant demand.“Many startups that were hiring 10 to 20 employees per month have adjusted to a net zero to three employees per month,” Hart said.Jobs in San Francisco’s tech industry, which includes Internet, software-publishing and data-hosting companies, increased by an annual rate of 5.1% in January, half the 10.5% growth in the same period the year before, according to Amar Mann, a regional economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Anemic initial public offerings and falling valuations for some tech companies are leading to a decline in the early-stage investments that help fuel office demand. Venture-capital investments fell 32% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months to $11.3 billion, according to a January report from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Bay Area companies releasing IPOs dropped to 26 in 2015 from 35 the year before, Savills Studley data show.“We’re going to have a correction in the job market in San Francisco over the next several years,” said Berkeley’s Rosen. “We had an economy that was growing based on the availability of capital rather than the fundamental performance of some of the companies.""Related:More Commercial Investors Home In On Multifamily Sector, Study SaysChic Co-Working Spaces Now Drawing A Corporate CrowdCrowdfunding Tests NYC’s Commercial Property Market.

"
530,SCHW,"Target-date mutual funds are the Goliath of the 401(k) investing space, dominating the flow of new money into retirement plans.They're also yesterday's technology, with little to show in the way of innovation in the past 10 years, says Jud Doherty, CEO of Stadion Money Management, a $3.7 billion ETF-based investment firm based in Georgia.Stadion recently launched an ETF-based retirement solution for micro and small businesses -- which make up an overwhelming majority of 401(k) plan sponsors in the U.S. It gives these employers ""incredibly customized asset allocation solutions"" that they, unlike larger counterparts, may not otherwise have access to, Doherty said.""We believe this is a huge improvement over one-size-fits-all target-date strategies,"" he added.Target-date funds typically plug in a generic retirement year (say, 2035) and maybe risk profile to set an investor's glide path to retirement.Stadion's new offering begins by looking at a plan sponsor's overall membership profile to custom-tailor a default glide-path solution. Clients typically have a few hundred employees or less, and anywhere from zero to $50 million in assets.Then, plan participants may further define their investment paths by answering a questionnaire about their personal risk tolerance, non-401(k) assets, expectations and goals via a web-based platform.Stadion leverages technology to deliver low-cost asset-allocation solutions, much like a robo-advisor such as Betterment or Wealthfront.But it works actively with financial advisors to deliver what small and micro businesses need from a retirement offering.""We live in an advisor-sold world and work with the advisor in mind, from sales support to fiduciary services,"" Doherty told IBD in a phone call.Stadion's new 401(k) solution, called StoryLine, is built around roughly 160 SDPR ETFs from State Street (STT) Global Advisors.""It's very simple to build a customized asset-allocation portfolio with a line-up that comprehensive,"" Doherty said. The diversity of ETFs -- smart beta strategies, factor-based strategies and currency-hedged strategies, among others -- is a plus, too.""Those types of exposures would cost you far more in a traditional mutual fund,"" Doherty explained.He puts the average cost of Stadion's solutions at 0.70%, including the firm's own service fee. That's less than the expense ratio of the average target-date fund -- 0.78% in 2014, according to Morningstar.ETFs have struggled to make much headway in the 401(k) space, experts say. Some of their biggest advantages over mutual funds, such as low costs, intraday tradability and tax efficiency, are less meaningful in the context of employer-sponsored retirement accounts.""Large plans have access to very low-cost index (mutual) funds, which are as good or better than ETFs in the 401(k) setting,"" said Matt Hougan, CEO of Inside ETFs.With smaller plans too, ETFs face challenges that are hard to overcome.It costs money to run a 401(k) plan -- something neither employees nor companies like to pay for with a direct fee, Hougan said. That's resulted in a culture of revenue-sharing agreements with fund companies, typically for actively managed funds.Low-cost, index-tracking ETFs and mutual funds don't have enough revenue-sharing potential to cover those administrative costs, Hougan said.Charles Schwab (SCHW) was the first major firm to launch a full-service 401(k) program based on ETFs in February 2014, two years after the launch of a similar retirement offering based on index mutual funds.The ETF and mutual fund offerings combined now have 140 clients, 100,000 participants and $10 billion in assets, according to Steve Anderson, head of Schwab Retirement Plan Services.The firm didn't provide numbers for the growth of their all-ETF 401(k) platform since inception.

532,SCHW,"Winning can occur at random, but companies that win time after time are something special.For the fourth year in a row, Charles Schwab (SCHW) finished among the top five in IBD's Best Online Brokers Survey.Schwab shined especially bright in customer service .Brian McDonald, senior vice president of client service and support, says that the Schwab work culture is about ""being able to see through the client's eyes.""""It's incredibly important at Schwab,"" McDonald said in a phone interview with IBD.Excellence starts with recruiting the right people, McDonald said. ""We want to make sure we have the best and the brightest.""The training program involves communicating a ""culture of service"" as well as building a financial services professional through role-playing and training.""We want you to be able to empathize (and) empower them to 'own their tomorrow,'"" McDonald said.""Own Your Tomorrow"" is the marketing campaign theme that debuted in June 2013, following up on the popular ""Talk to Chuck"" campaign that began in 2005. When Schwab launched ""Own Your Tomorrow,"" company founder Chuck Schwab said, ""Investing is an act of optimism, and Schwab was built for the optimists who believe tomorrow will be better than today.""The ""Own Your Tomorrow"" video ads are unusual because they go way beyond advertising's traditional, buy-this-service approach. (Many of the videos don't even mention Schwab.) The videos are more like short stories, mini-documentaries and works of art.The videos include a short documentary of a government lawyer in Washington, D.C., who dropped out to become a yoga instructor and surfer in San Diego; a young woman breaking free of a bad life situation; a man who hits the road on a motorcycle after getting dumped by his girlfriend; a woman who tells her partner, ""You are not the ruler of me""; and a sedentary man who gets off the couch to hit the road on his bicycle where ""everything seems new again.""You don't have to be a master of literary interpretation to get the meaning.View Full 2016 Best Online Brokers ReportIn a way, the lifestyle changes in the ""Own Your Tomorrow"" videos aren't so different from the changes in the brokerage industry and Schwab's role in them.After the May 1975 deregulation of brokerage commissions, Chuck Schwab created a discount brokerage and became a market disrupter.Old-style brokerages that enjoyed protected and high fixed fees suddenly had to compete.Crony-style businesses often genuflect to the idea of a free market as long as they don't have to live with it. The old-style investment firms hated the change.Like it or not, though, the free market prevailed.But change cuts both ways. The innovator must continue to innovate, or it becomes the victim of the next big wave of changes.Schwab has kept its edge with a number of changes. In 1978, it was the first to extend customer service hours. In 1979, it invested in a mainframe that allowed automatic transactions. In 1980, it launched 24-hour quotations.Other moves include 24-hour and seven-day-a-week order entry and quotation services, in 1982; automated technology for phone brokerage service, 1989; Spanish-language TeleBroker service, 1994; online trading, 1996; and after-hours trading, 1999.Then came pre-market trading in 2000; an online community for active traders, 2008; mobile deposits for smartphone users, 2011; bill payments via iPhone, iPad and Android, 2012; and commission-free trades for ETFs, 2013.What about 2015?The new thing last year was Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, an automated investment advisory service. Intelligent Portfolios uses computer algorithms to create, monitor and rebalance portfolios in line with individual investors' stated goals. It's a long way from the days when Schwab was the tiny firm with maverick clients who did their own research and didn't want to hear anybody else's opinions about the market.Some clients are still ""fiercely self-directed,"" McDonald said.Yet these days, 76% of Schwab's clients want periodic or ongoing advice, McDonald said, which explains many of the additional services that Schwab has added over the years.Despite these moves, two things haven't changed.First, ""most new clients at Schwab come through referrals,"" McDonald said.Second, unlike some companies that outsource customer service, Schwab keeps its service in-house.Outsourcing customer service to a foreign country — and hoping that the client can understand a foreign accent as thick as fog — isn't the Schwab way.""Our culture trumps everything,"" McDonald said. ""It's harder to do when you outsource.""

544,SCHW,"It's an old saw that people vote with their wallets, but don't tell that to the boards of mutual funds trying to make changes to their funds.
"
545,SCHW,"SEC rules require funds seeking to make a material operational change, such as adding a new subadviser, making a change in fees or making an acquisition, to solicit shareholders to vote on the proposal. The fund can't make changes until it receives an affirmative vote from a majority of the outstanding shareholders.
"
546,SCHW,"Recently, funds have found it increasingly difficult to engage shareholders to participate in these votes, which causes the funds to delay timely changes.
"
547,SCHW,"The process, called a proxy solicitation, involves mailing out information about the proposal to every shareholder in the fund. Included in the package is a ballot that the shareholder must mail back.
"
548,SCHW,"Yet even though these votes affect how the funds invest the shareholders' money, few shareholders participate. So the funds send out more solicitations — additional mailings, packages from overnight delivery services and even personal phone calls — which drive up the funds' costs.

"
550,SCHW,"In 2012, when Hennessy Funds wanted to acquire another firm, it sent out proxy materials twice via U.S. mail. When the effort failed to get enough votes from its 45,000 shareholders, the firm spent another $40,000 to ship overnight packages with the proxy materials. It still didn't get the necessary result.

"
557,SCHW,"A recent problem is that fund firms have lost transparency on who their shareholders are. In the old days, funds knew shareholders' names, addresses and phone numbers, because investors bought shares directly from the funds.

572,SCHW,"Best ETFs 2015: April Performance UpdateSchwab ETFs are growing fast. In just over five years, Schwab's 21 exchange traded funds have captured $30 billion in assets and 1.5% of total market share. It's now the seventh largest ETF provider in asset size, up from 10th a year ago. John Sturiale, a senior vice president at Charles Schwab (SCHW) Investment Management (CSIM), helped craft the brokerage's target retirement date funds in 2002.More recently, he created fundamentally weighted, smart beta ETFs. Sturiale spoke to IBD about his firm's strategy, pipeline and philosophy in ETF investments:IBD: What sets your ETFs apart?John Sturiale: We want to provide investors with access to high-quality ETFs that form the foundation of their investment portfolios at an extremely low cost.We were the first to offer commission-free ETFs with the launch of our first products in 2009.A few years later, we drove down costs even further — and in a dramatic way — by slashing the operating expenses on all our cap-weighted ETFs. To this day, they are the lowest in their respective Lipper categories.In 2013, we expanded our ETF roster beyond cap-weighted funds with the launch of six Fundamental Index ETFs.We believe that cap-weighted and fundamentally weighted strategies have an important role in an investor's portfolio.IBD: What surprised you most in the past five years?Sturiale: I'd say it's the incredible pace at which retail investors and advisers alike have embraced ETFs. ETF assets at Charles Schwab & Co. have increased from $83 billion in December 2009 to $231 billion at the end of 2014 — nearly a 3X increase in five years — with a compound annual growth rate of 23%. Those assets are split roughly 50-50 between retail investors and registered investment adviser (RIA) clients.It is clear that investors love the benefits that ETFs can provide: access to broad or niche segments of the market in a low-cost, accessible, transparent and tax-efficient wrapper.IBD: Why invest in Schwab U.S. Broad Market (SCHB) or Schwab U.S. Large Cap (SCHX) vs. the more established Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI) or SPDR S&P 500 (SPY)?Sturiale: The bottom line is investors can access high-quality products at the lowest cost. Period.All 15 of our cap-weighted ETFs now have at least a three-year track record.IBD: Why offer both smart beta and traditional, cap-weighted ETFs?Sturiale: Market-cap strategies provide cost-effective exposure to a broad market or market segment. Fundamental strategies also can provide broad-based market exposure, but securities are selected and weighted based on financial metrics such as earnings, sales or dividends.Because the companies within the underlying indexes are weighted differently, market-cap and fundamental index strategies perform differently across market cycles. Used in combination, they allow investors to build portfolios with better results in the long term.Quite simply, these strategies are better together.IBD: Any plans for actively managed ETFs?Sturiale: We wouldn't rule anything out, and CSIM does have exemptive relief to offer active ETFs. But we have a terrific product set that meets our client needs right now.With just three of our cap-weighted ETFs, U.S. Broad Market, International Equity (SCHF) and U.S. Aggregate Bond (SCHZ), investors can create the foundation of a diversified portfolio at an approximate cost of just 7 basis points. If they were to add Emerging Markets Equity (SCHE), the cost would rise to just 11 basis points. (Editor's note: That's $11 per $10,000 invested.)IBD: Are exchange traded managed funds (ETMFs) and nontransparent active ETFs a good idea?Sturiale: That's a question more appropriate for the SEC. They sent some pretty clear signals with their decisions last year.The (ETMF) model that ultimately did receive an exemption looks more like a mutual fund than an ETF in its structure. It's unclear to us whether these products will capture investors' interest. We don't expect it will be the watershed moment that, at one time, people thought nontransparent ETFs had the potential to be.IBD: How has Schwab ETF OneSource affected the market?Sturiale: Schwab ETF OneSource extended our commission-free ETF offering beyond Schwab ETFs. Today, Schwab clients can access more than 200 ETFs spanning 66 Morningstar categories for zero commissions.The numbers tell the story best: At the end of 2014, Schwab ETF OneSource had $38 billion in assets under management, and flows into ETFs in the program represented 43% of the total ETF flows at Schwab.Its success demonstrates that costs really do matter to investors.IBD: Schwab Index Advantage targets the 401(k) market. Do ETFs have a place in retirement portfolios?Sturiale: ETFs represent less than 1% of the $4 trillion-plus 401(k) market. Our company sees that as a huge opportunity to bring value to employers and their employees.With the ETF version of Schwab Index Advantage, employers have a low-cost, high-quality alternative that embeds advice.We don't believe excessive trading is a risk, and we've seen zero evidence of it. Some in the industry expressed a similar concern more than 20 years ago when mutual funds became popular in 401(k)s. It's important to remember that since ETFs have three-day settlement, it's actually possible to trade mutual funds more frequently than ETFs in a 401(k). But we just don't see this behavior.IBD: Is money flowing out of equity mutual funds and into equity ETFs at Schwab?Sturiale: While it's true that our ETFs are growing at a faster rate than our mutual funds, both continue to grow. We don't see a lot of evidence of assets moving directly from one to the other. In fact, in Schwab's 2014 ETF Investor Study, we asked investors which assets they intend to use for future investments in ETFs. The top three responses were existing cash, new cash and stocks.IBD: Schwab has been a somewhat disruptive force in the ETF industry. What challenges did you face?Sturiale: We've been disruptive because our No. 1 focus is our clients. We've heard directly from investors that cost is king. Of course, we want Schwab ETFs to be a top choice for investors but, to do that, we have been and continue to be vigilant in meeting client demand for high-quality products at an extremely low cost.IBD: What's the best investment decision you ever made?Sturiale: From the start of my career, I've been investing in my 401(k) every month through stock market ups and downs, in a well-diversified investment strategy.

573,SCHW,"A slack session swept into a rally Wednesday afternoon, following the Federal Reserve's rate policy announcement.The major indexes reversed higher on the news, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 1.3%, the S&P; 500 to a 1.2% gain and the Nasdaq up 0.9%.The stock market today finished in higher trade according to preliminary figures, with volume up 17% on the Nasdaq and 28% higher on the NYSE.As expected, the Fed dropped the ""patient"" qualifier on the timing of a possible interest-rate hike. It also lowered its estimates for growth and inflation, and said it would need to see further improvement in jobs and inflation before implementing a rate increase.The result sent the dollar skidding lower vs. the euro. Oil prices erased early losses and surged, leaving Brent crude up 4.5% for the session and West Texas Intermediate futures with a 2.7% gain.In stocks, oil, steel and mining issues posted the best gains among industries for the day. The top 10 advances among S&P; 500 stocks were oil or mining related. At the bottom of the list were Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Regions Financial (RF).Also at the rump of the index, Adobe Systems (ADBE) ended more than 3% lower after its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings cleared analyst consensus, but growth of subscribers in its Creative Cloud online offerings disappointed expectations. The stock pared losses after finding support at its 10-week moving average.Virgin America (VA) slumped 7% after Credit Suisse initiated coverage with an underperform rating and a 31 price target.

"
584,SCHW,"ETFs offer the combination of these advantages.
"
585,SCHW,"""From my standpoint, mutual funds are different from ETFs,"" said Robbie Cannon, president and chief executive at Horizon Investments. ""ETFs are building blocks.

"
590,SCHW,"More Choices
"
591,SCHW,"In Schwab's 401(k) ETF platform, investors can invest in 27 asset categories vs. its Schwab Index Advantage mutual fund platform, which offers 19 asset categories.
"
592,SCHW,"Due to their more complex structure, mutual funds tend to be more expensive than ETFs. The differences may be minimal when looking at large index-tracking mutual funds.
"
593,SCHW,"Vanguard Index 500 , a $198.7 billion mutual fund, has an expense ratio of just 0.17%. Charging even less, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) ETF takes 0.09% of assets a year to cover expenses. But the gap becomes more apparent when getting exposure to international markets, Cannon explained.
"
594,SCHW,"""Mutual funds carry a cost. There is a cost to the structure, to the share classes that aren't there with an ETF,"" he said. Mutual funds also require more record-keeping due to the fractional share calculations.
"
595,SCHW,"But flexibility and access to many asset categories is really the advantage that ETFs provide over mutual funds.
"
596,SCHW,"""One of the most noteworthy (advantages): there's been a lot more development in the ETF index space than in the mutual fund space,"" said David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management.
"
597,SCHW,"New market niches can be very difficult to engage in terms of mutual funds, explains Cannon. He cites examples such as Market Vectors Uranium & Nuclear Energy (NLR).
"
598,SCHW,"""The ETF machine has picked up where mutual funds have left off,"" said Cannon. ""Those nooks and crannies of the capital markets, they might not be important now, but for the 40-year-old they might be very important for him in the future to have the ability to take advantage of.""
"
599,SCHW,"Striking A Balance
"
600,SCHW,"Too much flexibility can also be a risk in some cases. Cannon says it's important to strike a balance of having flexible building blocks and flexibility in terms of the risk-return opportunity, while guarding against investors becoming day traders.
"
601,SCHW,"Cannon believes that asset allocation tools offered by investment firms are useful in growing and distributing wealth.

It's here to stay.""More ChoicesIn Schwab's 401(k) ETF platform, investors can invest in 27 asset categories vs. its Schwab Index Advantage mutual fund platform, which offers 19 asset categories.Due to their more complex structure, mutual funds tend to be more expensive than ETFs. The differences may be minimal when looking at large index-tracking mutual funds.Vanguard Index 500 , a $198.7 billion mutual fund, has an expense ratio of just 0.17%. Charging even less, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) ETF takes 0.09% of assets a year to cover expenses. But the gap becomes more apparent when getting exposure to international markets, Cannon explained.""Mutual funds carry a cost. There is a cost to the structure, to the share classes that aren't there with an ETF,"" he said. Mutual funds also require more record-keeping due to the fractional share calculations.But flexibility and access to many asset categories is really the advantage that ETFs provide over mutual funds.""One of the most noteworthy (advantages): there's been a lot more development in the ETF index space than in the mutual fund space,"" said David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management.New market niches can be very difficult to engage in terms of mutual funds, explains Cannon. He cites examples such as Market Vectors Uranium & Nuclear Energy (NLR).""The ETF machine has picked up where mutual funds have left off,"" said Cannon. ""Those nooks and crannies of the capital markets, they might not be important now, but for the 40-year-old they might be very important for him in the future to have the ability to take advantage of.""Striking A BalanceToo much flexibility can also be a risk in some cases. Cannon says it's important to strike a balance of having flexible building blocks and flexibility in terms of the risk-return opportunity, while guarding against investors becoming day traders.Cannon believes that asset allocation tools offered by investment firms are useful in growing and distributing wealth. He's a big advocate of asset allocation choices within 401(k) plans.

621,SCHW,"Growing Roots In A Recession
"
622,SCHW,"Schwab told IBD in 1998 that he was motivated by a fear of poverty drilled into him by his father, Robert Schwab, who often told stories about the Great Depression. Those fears intensified in the recession of 1958, when at age 19 Schwab went looking for a job in Chicago only to find long unemployment lines.

"
634,SCHW,"Schwab profit and revenue soared amid the dot-com boom and trading volume expanded.

647,SCHW,"The stockbrokerage and investment bank industry group is rich with stocks carrying solid profit margins.Five stockbrokers' stocks posted quarterly after-tax margins of 15% or higher in recent quarters. Two of them are among the top five stock brokers in IBD's Best Online Brokers 2015 survey:• MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading platform provider, delivered after-tax margins of 26% to 30% in the past dozen quarters.• TD Ameritrade (AMTD), a brokerage and financial services provider, pegged margins in a range of 24% to 28% in the past six quarters.• Charles Schwab (SCHW), a brokerage and financial services provider, served up after-tax margins of 21% to 22% in the past six quarters.• E-Trade Financial (ETFC), an online brokerage and banking services provider, turned in after-tax margins of 14% to 17% in the past four quarters.• Lazard (LAZ), an asset manager and merger adviser, posted after-tax margins of 15% to 17% in the past four quarters.All percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number. Results for the quarter ended in December were not yet available.How do these stocks stack up on other growth-stock criteria?• Revenue growth: MarketAxess takes the pole position with five- and three-year sales growth rates of 18% and 15%, respectively. Schwab is second at 8% and 10%.• Earnings growth: MarketAxess is No. 1 here too. The five- and three-year EPS growth rates are 35% and 18%. Lazard split the leadership with a lower five-year rate of 16% and a higher three-year rate of 28%.• Return on equity: This figure measures financial efficiency. Historically, elite stocks have scored 17% or better on the ROE gauge. Among the five stocks, Lazard leads with an ROE of 48%. MarketAxess is second at 24%.• Supply and demand: MarketAxess and Ameritrade were tops early this month. MarketAxess has an A- in Accumulation and 1.1 in up-down volume. Ameritrade has a B in Accumulation and 1.0 in up-down volume.• Institutional support: Fund activity isn't especially high right now in either a positive or negative direction. All five showed small changes or stand-pat numbers from Q3 to Q4.Three of the five stocks sport youthful base counts. The current or most recent base for MarketAxess, TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab are first stage. E-Trade and Lazard are consolidating in third-stage patterns.As a stock advances, it pauses to form consolidations or bases. Breakouts are less likely to work after the first two stages.Many investors restrict their buys to first- and second-stage breakouts.Income InvestingAnother way of looking at the brokerage industry group is from the perspective of income investors.First, a qualifier: The best strategy for culling income from stocks is to use CAN SLIM to buy the best stocks and then take income from the profits. Yes, like farming, some years will be plentiful and others not. But over time, investors will have more profits to slice than if they rely on dividends from conservative stocks.Realistically, though, some conservative investors have no interest in learning CAN SLIM and can't handle the uncertainty and close monitoring associated with growth stocks.So for those investors, let's look at which brokerage stocks are suitable for a more traditional dividend strategy. Stocks listed are only those trading at $12 or more per share.• Top dividend yields: Calamos Asset Management (CLMS), 4.5%; Greenhill (GHL), 4.6%; Credit Suisse (CS), 3.5%.• Top dividend growth rate: TD Ameritrade, 53%; Ameriprise Financial ([STOCK[AMP]]), 34%; and MarketAxess, 33%. The percentage is calculated over a three-to five-year period.• Five-year earnings Stability Factor: Ameritrade, 7; LPL Financial (LPLA), 12; and Raymond James (RJF), 12.The scale for earnings Stability runs from 0 (calm) to 99 (wild).

Soon you'll be able to check the stock price of Alibaba or buy that GoPro breakout with a turn of the wrist. Just like you're checking the time.These are the kinds of innovations that investors look for in their stockbrokers. The Mobile Platforms/Mobile Trading Opportunities category was ranked 1-4 in importance by customers of three of the top five brokers in IBD's Best Online Brokers 2015 survey.Back in the 1990s, a long-ago epoch young stock investors only read about in books, they let us log on to our brokerage accounts by phone, punching a complicated sequence of numbers that stood for letters of the alphabet to get quotes or make a trade. A mechanical voice read back stock prices.Along came the BlackBerry and other primitive smartphones followed by the iPhone and Android tablets and phones. They gave us apps designed to let us check our portfolios and make trades over cellphone lines or Wi-Fi. That is, if we were brave. Connections were slow and uncertain. Did that trade go through or not?As connections improved and processing power grew, so did the apps that online brokers put so much effort into designing, providing real-time quotes and news, streaming charts, technical studies, brokerage reports and ratings, text-message alerts and just about anything else we need to stay in touch with our money while we're on the go.The next step is the Apple Watch, announced in September by Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and said to be ready for a March release.

""The day it was announced, we were getting tweets and emails about it. It's generated more interest than just about anything we've been doing. One gentleman told us he hoped it wouldn't turn red on a day when his stocks were down. That could be embarrassing for him.""It's a complicated business designing an app for a watch. The amount of real estate the designers have to work with is limited, so they must be clever. Sherrod notes that 40% of TD Ameritrade's trades are options, and option plays can get complicated.Other leading stockbrokers are cagey. They don't want to tip off the competition or raise customers' hopes unrealistically high.""We think watches are the big thing coming down the pipe, and we're eagerly watching and planning,"" said Kunal Vaed of E-Trade (ETFC).E-Trade boasts of being at the forefront of Internet and mobile trading from the beginning.It had apps for the BlackBerry and was ready when the iPhone and iPad were released, Vaed said. When iOS8 was announced last year, E-Trade was a featured app in Cook's presentation, Vaed said.E-Trade strives to make the most of the iPhone's innovative features, such as trading using Touch ID, the biometric feature of newer iPhones, and the use of a software widget to give customers a view of their stock watch lists and the market without having to unlock their phone.Brokers work hard to produce cool, easy-to-use apps because that's where the customers are. ""We want to be where our customers are living their digital lives,"" Vaed said.Every broker is reporting an increasing percentage of trades made via mobile devices.Sherrod of TD Ameritrade, which has 6.3 million accounts, said that in the last quarter, 1 million users logged on through a mobile devise. Three quarters of mobile trades are made from iOS devices like iPads and iPhones. Mobile trades have grown 25% in the past year.""Google's Android dominates by market share,"" she said.

It plans to have that in place by the end of the year.""We'll have the same simplified experience across all channels,"" said Art Garcia , director of investment solutions. USAA has a large component of military families among its customer base, so that makes mobile more important.USAA customers can conduct all their business on any platform or start on one and finish on another. That includes communications with any of the broker's 1,500 financial advisers.Charles Schwab (SCHW) is moving in the same direction. ""Our goal is to make it so seamless an experience that whether you're using a phone, a tablet or a PC, you don't have to relearn to get competent,"" said Kelli Keough, VP of client experience.

659,SCHW,"Indeed, the severity of each market decline acts as the mold for the bases that emerge from the decline. That's a factor that investors must take into account as they study chart patterns. A base that may seem flawed could be acceptable when it is put in the context of the broad market.
"
660,SCHW,"In 2013 and 2014, the market had several modest corrections. The Nasdaq never declined more than 11% in those two years.

665,SCHW,"The 2008-09 bear market saw plenty of examples of absurdly deep bases that still generated successful breakouts.

667,SCHW,"That year's recovery helped the personal technology company build the right side of its base in about a half-year's time. The stock formed a handle and broke out the week ending July 17 at 146.50. Volume picked up sharply the next week (2).

668,SCHW,"The stock's handle also could have been interpreted as a flat base, since it fit the profile of that base as well.

676,SCHW,"While IBD's focus is on leading stocks, investors should also take a look at exchanged-traded funds, or ETFs.ETFs can help enhance your investing experience and boost your stock-market profits. Investors can also use ETFs to glean more information about the market.Due to their low cost and versatility, investor interest in ETFs has grown sharply over the years. In September, assets in ETFs stood at $1.83 trillion, according to the Investment Company Institute (ICI), up 19% from a year ago.ETFs tend to have lower expenses than mutual funds. Some brokers such as TD Ameritrade (AMTD), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Fidelity will let you trade certain ETFs commission-free.Some ETFs track broad market indexes, such as the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) ETF, which tracks the benchmark S&P 500 index. Others monitor other segments of the market. If small caps are greatly outperforming in the market, investors can participate via the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) ETF.Staying on the right side of the market is key to maximizing gains. There are times when investors should be in and times when investors should be on the sidelines.IBD has had a long history of helping investors determine market direction with the Market Pulse, but we've gone further with the ETF Market Strategy, which can be found on the ETF page or on Leaderboard, a premium product.Basically, the ETF Market Strategy helps investors decide how much exposure they should have in the market by following a simple scale of market risk based on the current market outlook.When the market goes into a confirmed uptrend, investors should be 100% invested. But when the market comes under pressure, exposure should be cut to 50%.In a market correction, the entire ETF should be sold. Once the market goes back into a confirmed uptrend, investors can return to full exposure. Let the daily Market Pulse table (today on B3) be your guide.Investors can trade this simple system using ETFs such as the PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) and SPDR S&P 500. Both have extremely high liquidity.The ETF Strategy was back-tested using the PowerShares QQQ Trust, and sharply outperformed both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq over the study period from October 2005 to September 2014.There is an optional rule to help protect capital if a fresh uptrend gets into trouble early. If the Nasdaq slides 2.6% from the closing price of the follow-through day that triggers a new confirmed uptrend, investors should move to 100% cash.At times, certain industry sectors of the market will be in play. Many ETFs focus on specific areas such as biotech, semiconductors or retail. Investors can examine such sector-oriented ETFs to see what areas of the market money is going into.There are even leveraged ETFs that give investors double or triple the exposure to a sector or broad index. But beware that some of these ETFs are thinly traded, so stick with the more active ones.Among some sector ETFs, SPDR Financial (XLF) and SPDR Energy (XLE) have plenty of liquidity. They trade tens of millions of shares each day.

680,SCHW,"Earnings season kicks into high gear this week, with a slew of high-profile quarterly results from some of the biggest and brightest companies. Many are the first to report for their given industry, giving investors a particular interest in analyzing the financials and outlooks.Here are six of the most important earnings reports on tap.TuesdayCharles Schwab (SCHW) was a pioneering discount brokerage, but it's still blazing new trails. Schwab shares hit a 13-year high on March 21. The stock consolidated and attempted a breakout on July 3. It fell back as the market sold off, though in light volume. Schwab rose 0.7% to 27.10 on the stock market Friday.Wall Street expects Schwab to report a 28% earnings per share gain to 23 cents. That would snap 3 quarters of accelerating growth.J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) has had a tough time of late. Once deemed the best-run Wall Street bank, JPMorgan Chase has paid billions of dollars in various settlements. Mortgage activity has slowed — affecting many lenders — while fixed-income trading seems permanently depressed. JPMorgan said in a SEC filing that it expected Q2 market revenues down 20% vs. a year earlier. Finally, the company reported on July 1 that CEO Jamie Dimon has throat cancer, though that should be ""curable.""Shares have retreated since hitting a 14-year high in late March.JPMorgan earnings likely fell 19% to $1.29 a share, matching Q1's 19% year-over-year decline. JPMorgan is just one of several major bank earnings. Wells Fargo (WFC) reported earnings Friday. Citigroup (C) reports Monday, with Goldman Sachs (GS) joining JPMorgan on Tuesday. Bank of America (BAC) results are due Wednesday.Intel (INTC) has seen a rebirth in recent months, with shares recently hitting a 10-year high, in the wake of solid Q1 results in early April and then upwardly revised revenue guidance on June 12. Intel is benefitting from the recent revival in corporate PC sales after Microsoft (MSFT) stopped supporting the venerable Windows operating system.Intel earnings should show a 33% gain to 52 cents a share, following yearly changes of -5%, 6%, 0%, -28% in the prior four quarters. Investors will want to have some indication if PC sales will remain strong in the second half of the year, or if Intel will find some other way to expand.Yahoo (YHOO) earnings will rise 9% to 38 cents a share, following Q1's flat reading. Q1 revenue edged higher, as display ad sales climbed 2%, offering some hope that CEO Marissa Mayer can generate top-line growth. Still, Yahoo's most important news may be about Alibaba. Yahoo owns a minority stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant, and it gives some headline figures on Alibaba's results.Alibaba's planned U.S. IPO is widely expected to take place in August. Yahoo will sell a significant share of its existing holdings as part of the offering.Yahoo shares have been in a downtrend since hitting a decade-best in early January.WednesdayLas Vegas Sands (LVS) is the world's largest casino operator. Despite its name, Sands — like Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM) — gets the bulk of its revenue and profit from Macau, China's gaming enclave and the world's largest gambling site. Macau growth has slowed in recent months amid a crackdown on moneylenders in the area. But there are some signs that the worst is over for Macau. Meanwhile, Las Vegas casino revenue has been solid.Las Vegas Sands earnings should show a 40% gain to 91 cents a share, analysts predicted. That would the second straight quarter of moderate acceleration.But Sands stock has been in a modest downtrend for the past four months, falling below its 50- and 200-day moving averages last week.ThursdayGoogle (GOOGL) is involved in many ventures, from self-driving cars to alternative-energy investments to Android mobile software. The open-source Android has become the global leader over Apple (AAPL) iOS. It's a direct money-maker, though it likely does help boost mobile ad revenue. Search-based ads remain the bulk of Google's business. But it's a good business: Earnings likely rose 31% to $6.26 a share. That would follow decelerating growth for the past two quarters to just 8% in Q1.Google shares hit a record high of 615.05 in late February. The stock consolidated and has been building a handle on its cup base. Google (GOOG) Class C shares, which started trading on April 3, are near a new highFollow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.RELATED:Wells Fargo Q2 Earnings Growth Slows As Banks Report

681,SCHW,"Charles Schwab entered the brokerage business in the early 1960s and found it rife with hidden charges and conflicts of interest.""Adverse incentives were rampant,"" Schwab, 76, told IBD. ""It was an industry built upon sales and the inherent commissions.""He would not conform. ""This gave me my early beginning,"" he said. ""I wanted to be completely different from the rest of those firms.""Schwab remains chairman of his namesake financial service company, Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW)It's one of the nation's largest brokerages, with $2.3 trillion in client assets. The firm had 2013 sales of $5.4 billion, and its stock has been on a 150% run since 2011.Schwab himself sits on an estimated net worth of more than $6.2 billion, according to Forbes.Meanwhile, he has revolutionized an industry that could seem revolting to him for the way it treated customers.""He treats every individual with equal respect,"" said Stephen McLin, who has known Schwab since 1981 and is a longtime member of the company's board. ""He's as polite and nice to the guy bringing the food to the conference room as he is to the president of the Federal Reserve Bank.""One For AllJohn Kador wrote in his 2005 biography of Schwab: ""In the beginning when investors were at the mercy of stockbrokers, financial self-determination ... was reserved for the well-off. Then Charles Schwab beat Wall Street and reinvented the brokerage industry. Now Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. continues to liberate the world of personal finance and we are all, rich and poor, better off for it.""In building his empire, Schwab overcame deeply entrenched financiers and investment brokers who did not appreciate his concept of offering discount brokerage service and transparent transactions to ordinary people. He contends they denied him access to financing and tried to block his business.Schwab overcame them with humility and mild-mannered perseverance, says McLin.The boss fostered a corporate culture far different than those engendered by his naysayers. ""We're not going to make money trying to sneak fees or rip off some of our customers,"" McLin said. ""You remember Goldman Sachs referring to customers as Muppets? Nobody would last long doing that around here.""Schwab was born amid the Great Depression to Terrie and Lloyd Schwab. He grew up on a farm 25 miles from Sacramento, Calif.His father was a small-town lawyer who instilled in his son the traditional values of a rural, Roman Catholic family trying to get by at that time. In the mix were honesty, respect and sweat.""Money was tight,"" Schwab recalled. ""I learned that hard work was the only way to get ahead.""As a teen and into his 20s, he worked on railways and in oilfields and drove a tractor on a sugar beet farm. He slept in a bunkhouse with mostly Mexican farmworkers who didn't speak English. He'd get up at 6 a.m. to grease the tractor. ""I was paid $1 an hour, or $12 a day,"" he said. ""They subtracted $3 a day for room and board.""Schwab took an early interest in money because there was so little of it in his life. ""I didn't like the lack of resources I grew up in,"" he said.He read books, but found reading difficult. Only when he was in his 40s would he learn why: dyslexia.Yet his passion pulled him through the pages. ""I read the biographies of great men,"" including J.P. Morgan, he said. ""I learned the most successful people in America were people who came out of finance. So I wanted to learn about that, how they did it.""Schwab struggled through high school with his reading problem, but often got by on his natural charm. This strategy didn't work so well at Stanford University, so he studied subjects with more numbers than words: economics, finance and accounting.While working toward an MBA, which he landed in 1961, he spent nights and weekends as a financial analyst for an investment firm in Menlo Park, Calif. That gave him an insider's view of the industry.""What I learned about was the massive set of conflicts firms lived under in order to sell to their clients and how their profits were made,"" he said. ""The higher the risk was for the client, the more the broker made. This was never explained to the client.""For Schwab, investing helped Americans buy homes, fund businesses and pay for education, family vacation and retirement. It was not supposed to be a sales program for oversized commissions.Staying in Northern California, Schwab founded his firm in 1971 as First Commander Corp. in San Francisco, renamed it Charles Schwab in 1973 and turned it into a discount brokerage two years later.The discount brokerage benefited from regulatory changes that made possible lower commissions — to today's $8 per trade from the old days of $89.Long-standing brokerages hated the idea of a discount operation, even badmouthing Schwab's firm as a ""bucket shop,"" he recalled.""We were breaking down the barriers. This really upset the traditional firms,"" he said. ""We were very disliked. On one occasion I was called unethical.""Open For BusinessHe persevered on one core belief: ""I just had a deep sense of the value of investing as the most important way for saving and building wealth,"" he said. ""I thought it was reasonable to expect thousands of people getting interested.""Great trials awaited Schwab after he took his firm public in 1987. He endured a stock market crash that year, then the catastrophic earthquake that shook his firm's home base of San Francisco in 1989.""You've got to be eternally optimistic,"" he said of the leadership traits that carried him through. ""You've got to come up with the most positive things that can be said about the business and what you're doing, even in the most adverse times. And you've got to believe. Only then can your team believe in you.""Schwab rode a generational wave of investors who wanted to make money decisions on their own. He accommodated them with his investor-friendly innovations.In 1984 his firm had launched its Mutual Fund Marketplace with 140 funds — no-load so its clients weren't out of money on Day One.""Chuck Schwab,"" said Kador, ""will be remembered most for making it as convenient for customers to buy mutual funds as easily as they could pluck items off the shelf at Wal-Mart (WMT) .""Company PlansThe firm also launched a no-fee individual retirement account, money-market mutual funds, a Schwab 1000 index fund, services for independent financial advisers, automated telephone trading and, in 1996, online trading accounts.Charles Schwab went on a 1,000% stock sprint in the next three years.True to his earliest observations about his industry, Schwab did not pay his brokers commissions. ""We pay people salaries and bonuses based on the happiness of clients, not based on revenues,"" he said.As the needs of Main Street grew more complex, so did Schwab's offerings. The company had always attracted investors who didn't want money advice, but in 2002 it started offering guidance.Then came:• Traditional banking in 2003.• Managed investment portfolios in 2006.• Exchange traded funds with commission-free trading in 2009.• A mobile app in 2010.• A platform for active traders in 2011.• Schwab Index Advantage, bringing a large selection of index funds to 401(k) investors, in 2012.• The Schwab ETF OneSource platform, offering its customers more ETFs than anyone else in the industry, in 2013.Today, Schwab is as much a part of the fabric of Wall Street as any firm, and it aims for more growth.""Given the fact that we still have a small share of the actual market, we see huge upside,"" Schwab said.Schwab, who left the CEO post in 2008, likes to point out that a reputation for fair dealing carries his firm: ""Most clients come from referrals from other clients. We measure that every day.""As he looks back on his career, he said he hopes the key words in his legacy include ""democratizing investing"" and ""bringing investing to millions of people.""""We've helped clean up Wall Street,"" he said. ""We've taken a lot of the mystery out of the business.""

"
683,SCHW,"John Bogle has pushed forward along his own path.
"
684,SCHW,"The founder of Vanguard Group, the world's largest mutual fund firm, has relentlessly championed an investment vehicle that he pioneered decades ago.
"
685,SCHW,"Bogle was once clearly in the minority. But his unwavering loyalty to index funds over actively managed funds has enriched him and multitudes of followers — and forced other fund companies, including some active-management titans, to add index-fund options to their menus.
"
686,SCHW,"The actively managed Contrafund (valued at $107 billion), for instance, is still Fidelity's top dog, but the Boston giant's Spartan 500 index fund ($74 billion) is coming up fast.
"
687,SCHW,"In a country where the big score sets the tone, the patience and steady hand of index tracking is a hard sell. Bigger rewards can be had if actively managed dice roll right. But index funds are generally a cheaper investment, and over the long haul they tend to outperform the average actively managed fund. Bogle has driven these truths to the top of his field, even when the field tried to shout him down.
"
688,SCHW,"On The Rise
"
689,SCHW,"Passive index trackers that weight by market cap or target investment opportunities in specific financial markets, then stick with them through all market conditions, are as popular as they've ever been. They comprise 22% of all mutual fund assets, says investment research firm Morningstar (MORN) .
"
690,SCHW,"That number might sound unimpressive, but consider: Investments in index funds and ETFs have outpaced inflow into actively managed funds in recent years, according to Charles Schwab (SCHW), with Bogle's Vanguard Institutional Index Fund — now $168.22 billion — leading the tidal change. In all, Vanguard Group ranks No. 1 among fund families, with $2.6 trillion in net assets.
"
691,SCHW,"The real gravitational pull has been Bogle. You can reference his 10 books — collectively, they've sold over 880,000 copies — including his 1999 masterwork, ""Common Sense on Mutual Funds,"" an elucidation on index tracking.
"
692,SCHW,"You can point to his 1999 Woodrow Wilson Award from Princeton University for ""distinguished achievement in the nation's service,"" his 2004 Time magazine ranking among the world's most influential people, and his chairmanship of the board at the National Constitution Center, self-billed as ""America's most hands-on history museum."" (Successors in that post include Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton).
"
693,SCHW,"You can marvel at Bogle's contributions to the investment community, including, at age 85 (still vigorous after a heart transplant in 1996), an active lecturing schedule and recent articles in the Financial Analysts Journal and the Journal of Portfolio Management.
"
694,SCHW,"Or you can look at the breakdown of how investors invest. ""Investors have withdrawn $500 billion from actively managed funds (including ETFs) and put $600 billion into index funds over the past five years,"" Bogle told IBD. ""That's a trillion-dollar shift. It's astonishing, and it's not going to stop.""
"
695,SCHW,"Born in Montclair, N.J., just five months before the Wall Street crash of 1929, Bogle treaded the Great Depression's tumult with aplomb. His family struggled financially, but he eased the burden by earning a full scholarship to the Blair Academy, a prestigious prep school in New Jersey.
"
696,SCHW,"His undergraduate degree from Princeton University led him to Wellington Management, where he thrived. Before long, CEO and fellow Princeton alum Walter Morgan made him president of what was one of the largest private investment-management firms in the world. Bogle was also named chairman of Wellington Fund, which invested in both stocks and bonds, and as such was a pioneer in the balanced mutual fund field.
"
697,SCHW,"A disastrous merger with a Boston-based investment firm that prized stock value over a company's intrinsic value — ""shortsighted, naive, opportunistic and really stupid,"" Bogle recalled — ended his tenure atop the management company. It also refocused the man on the things that he wanted to do differently at Wellington Fund.
"

"
710,SCHW,"The fact that his ""Little Book of Common Sense Investing"" has such high standing since it debuted in 2007 would be more impressive, he noted, if it were No. 1 in a more popular grouping: ""I don't know how many books on Amazon have been at the top of their genre for that long, but the mutual funds genre is not exactly the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' genre.""

"
713,SCHW,"Bogle likes to say his basic rule of investing — be satisfied to get your fair share — is simple: ""The brokerage firm is based on 'Don't just stand there, do something.' My rule is 'Don't do something, just stand there.' People understand things better when they're put in simple terms.""

That's true, but here's the irony: The obvious is something anybody can recognize, and it doesn't take an uncanny ability.
"
716,SCHW,"""I've done what I've done, and it's up to other people to judge it. So what do I want on my tombstone? 'He did his best,' I guess.""John Bogle has pushed forward along his own path.The founder of Vanguard Group, the world's largest mutual fund firm, has relentlessly championed an investment vehicle that he pioneered decades ago.Bogle was once clearly in the minority. But his unwavering loyalty to index funds over actively managed funds has enriched him and multitudes of followers — and forced other fund companies, including some active-management titans, to add index-fund options to their menus.The actively managed Contrafund (valued at $107 billion), for instance, is still Fidelity's top dog, but the Boston giant's Spartan 500 index fund ($74 billion) is coming up fast.In a country where the big score sets the tone, the patience and steady hand of index tracking is a hard sell. Bigger rewards can be had if actively managed dice roll right. But index funds are generally a cheaper investment, and over the long haul they tend to outperform the average actively managed fund. Bogle has driven these truths to the top of his field, even when the field tried to shout him down.On The RisePassive index trackers that weight by market cap or target investment opportunities in specific financial markets, then stick with them through all market conditions, are as popular as they've ever been. They comprise 22% of all mutual fund assets, says investment research firm Morningstar (MORN) .That number might sound unimpressive, but consider: Investments in index funds and ETFs have outpaced inflow into actively managed funds in recent years, according to Charles Schwab (SCHW), with Bogle's Vanguard Institutional Index Fund — now $168.22 billion — leading the tidal change. In all, Vanguard Group ranks No. 1 among fund families, with $2.6 trillion in net assets.The real gravitational pull has been Bogle. You can reference his 10 books — collectively, they've sold over 880,000 copies — including his 1999 masterwork, ""Common Sense on Mutual Funds,"" an elucidation on index tracking.You can point to his 1999 Woodrow Wilson Award from Princeton University for ""distinguished achievement in the nation's service,"" his 2004 Time magazine ranking among the world's most influential people, and his chairmanship of the board at the National Constitution Center, self-billed as ""America's most hands-on history museum."" (Successors in that post include Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton).You can marvel at Bogle's contributions to the investment community, including, at age 85 (still vigorous after a heart transplant in 1996), an active lecturing schedule and recent articles in the Financial Analysts Journal and the Journal of Portfolio Management.Or you can look at the breakdown of how investors invest. ""Investors have withdrawn $500 billion from actively managed funds (including ETFs) and put $600 billion into index funds over the past five years,"" Bogle told IBD. ""That's a trillion-dollar shift. It's astonishing, and it's not going to stop.""Born in Montclair, N.J., just five months before the Wall Street crash of 1929, Bogle treaded the Great Depression's tumult with aplomb. His family struggled financially, but he eased the burden by earning a full scholarship to the Blair Academy, a prestigious prep school in New Jersey.His undergraduate degree from Princeton University led him to Wellington Management, where he thrived. Before long, CEO and fellow Princeton alum Walter Morgan made him president of what was one of the largest private investment-management firms in the world. Bogle was also named chairman of Wellington Fund, which invested in both stocks and bonds, and as such was a pioneer in the balanced mutual fund field.A disastrous merger with a Boston-based investment firm that prized stock value over a company's intrinsic value — ""shortsighted, naive, opportunistic and really stupid,"" Bogle recalled — ended his tenure atop the management company. It also refocused the man on the things that he wanted to do differently at Wellington Fund.By 1974, he'd struck out on his own and created Vanguard, focusing on index-tracking tactics that the Wellington Fund eschewed.The next year Bogle, influenced greatly by American economists Eugene Fama and Burton Malkiel, both champions of long-term investing, founded the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, the nation's first index mutual fund. Under Bogle, Vanguard grew to become the world's largest mutual fund company.Managed since 1991 by Michael Buek, it's no longer ""Jack Bogle's Vanguard,"" according to Morningstar, which gives the fund a B stewardship rating on an A-F scale, ""but it's still a fine steward of shareholders' wealth.""Despite decades of detractors, Bogle has clearly won many followers with his index approach — including some believers who still can't completely separate themselves from active management.HuzzahsJon Ten Haagen, founder of New York-based Ten Haagen Financial Group, isn't exactly a devotee, preferring actively managed products.

763,SCHW,"Three of the most powerful follow-throughs in recent times occurred in 1990, 1998 and 2010.
"
764,SCHW,"Two of them — on Sept. 1, 1990, and Oct. 15, 1998 — came during periods of financial turmoil or economic weakness. The success of those follow-throughs shows why it's important to tune out emotion and listen only to the market.
"
765,SCHW,"The follow-through is the market-bottoming signal discussed in this Investor's Corner series, which today looks at the results of these three follow-throughs.
"
766,SCHW,"The 1998 follow-through came shortly after Russia defaulted on its debt, setting off a chain reaction that led to the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, a giant hedge fund. The Nasdaq, which had hit a record high in late July, reversed course and lost a third of its value by early October.
"
767,SCHW,"The Oct. 15 follow-through came on the fifth day after the Nasdaq hit a low. The composite jumped nearly 5% in higher volume after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. The index rose 57% in less than four months from the closing price on the follow-through.
"
768,SCHW,"The day after the follow-through, LED-lighting stock Cree (CREE) jumped above a 17.60 buy point and tripled. Other tech stocks also broke out and began big rallies. Dell (DELL) and Microsoft (MSFT) both rose nearly 60%. Investment brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW) staged a powerful rally, clearing a 28.85 buy point of a cup-with-handle base on Oct. 14 and rocketing 537% in six months.
"
769,SCHW,"The Oct. 18, 1990, follow-through came as the major averages started to emerge from a bear market in which the Nasdaq fell as much as 31% from its peak. On the day of the follow-through, the government released data showing that housing starts fell for an eighth straight month, the longest slide since 1959.
"
770,SCHW,"Yet the Dow Jones industrial average gained 2.7%, the S&P 500 2.3% and the Nasdaq 2.2%, all in higher volume than the day before. This movement confirmed the rally attempt that began with an Oct. 12 low and gave investors the green light to buy fundamentally strong stocks breaking out of sound bases.
"
771,SCHW,"In six months, the Nasdaq rose 53%. Microsoft jumped 71% in two months, and Apple (AAPL) rallied 62% in about four months.
"
772,SCHW,"The follow-through on Sept. 1, 2010, was accompanied by much less gloom, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each rising 3% on a strong U.S. manufacturing report.
"
773,SCHW,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Aruba Networks (ARUN) were among many leaders that broke out shortly thereafter. Chipotle rose 70% in three months, while the Nasdaq rose as much as 19% in 51 trading sessions.

The more space between the two, the stronger the existing trend.To get a 200-day moving average, just add the latest 200 closing prices and divide by 200. Moving averages are standard on most charting platforms, including IBD Charts.Once a stock gets 70% to 100% above its 200-day moving average (or 40-week line on a weekly chart), watch out — the rally may have gotten ahead of itself. Very few issues can sustain that kind of momentum. According to an internal IBD study done in the mid-1990s, leaders topped once they got on average 111% above their 200-day averages.Keep in mind that this signal shouldn't be used in isolation. It doesn't mean that a stock will just turn around and dive.It's rare, but some stocks stretch more than 100% above their 200-day moving averages for extended periods of time.If you do see a stock get extended well past its 200-day line, it's best to search for other symptoms of climax-type action before deciding to sell. More signals add to the weight of the evidence that the stock is topping.Business at discount broker Charles Schwab (SCHW) was booming in the late 1990s, thanks to a wildly bullish stock market. The San Francisco-based firm was also benefiting as investors switched to online trading from expensive full-service stockbrokers.The stock cleared a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Oct. 16, 1998 1. By early 1999, it was already more than double its 40-week line.But by April it had developed other signs of climax action. The stock shot up seven straight sessions 2, gaining nearly 60%. In the last day of the advance, the stock gapped up and had its biggest one-day point gain since the move.Schwab reversed April 14. At its intraday high, it was up more than triple its 40-week line 3. In that day's IBD, the stock boasted a 94 EPS Rating, a 99 RS and an A for Accumulation. But ratings alone don't flash sell signals. Schwab tumbled 66% in the next six months 4.

839,SCHW,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, significant rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts were among the positives. However, higher expenses remained a headwind.In fact, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history as its earnings did not lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. It delivered an average positive surprise of 2.9%.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteHowever, activities of Schwab during the second quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the past 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings was revised 1.7% downward to 58 cents. Nevertheless, the figure reflects a year-over-year improvement of 48.7%.Notably, Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 17.9% in the past year, outperforming 10.8% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post second-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to impact Q2 results.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsAfter an impressive first quarter, in terms of significant market volatility, client activity returned to normalized levels in the second quarter. Nevertheless, Schwab opened 141,000 and 122,000 new brokerage accounts in April and May, respectively, indicating that investors were somewhat interested in entering the market. Also, the company’s efforts toward lowering trading fees should have helped in adding more brokerage accounts during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts for the second quarter is 11,181, which reflects a year-over-year improvement of 6.6%.Thus, despite a sequential slowdown in market volatility in the second quarter, Schwab’s trading revenues are expected to witness a modest improvement, supported by decent growth in brokerage accounts.Further, Schwab witnessed a rise in total client assets and average interest-earning assets in April and May, on a year-over-year basis. This should reflect in the company’s results for the entire quarter.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets for the to-be-reported quarter is $3.4 trillion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.5%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the quarter is $249 billion, which reflects growth of 15.3% year over year. Hence, higher assets, along with an improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Improvement in the two most important components of Schwab’s revenues is expected to support overall revenue growth in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is $2.50 billion, which reflects year-over-year growth of 17.2%.However, Schwab’s operating expenses have remained elevated for the past few quarters. Moreover, because of higher compensation and benefits costs, overall expenses are expected to remain high in the second quarter.Now, let’s see what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is -2.29%.Zacks Rank: Schwab currently has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Jul 17.

840,SCHW,"U.S. investment banks have been much favored by investors because of the far-reaching benefits that rising rates, increasing trading activities, investment banking business momentum and record IPOs could bring to the industry. While the first half of 2018 failed to display impressive results due to trade-war fears and geo-political tensions, the expected future benefits have been helping investment banks outperform the broader market since mid-2016.M&A activities were strong in the first half of this year with the execution of many large transactions. Steady economic growth and low interest rates in the emerging economies along with growth in corporate earnings on tax reforms are likely to keep the momentum alive in the quarters ahead. Although trade-war worries and higher interest rates in the United States can undermine this growth curve, M&A deal volume is anticipated to accelerate.Moreover, steadily growing IPO activities experienced since the beginning of this year are expected to continue, driven by favorable equity markets and decent corporate earnings. In fact, improved investors’ confidence in the stock market might create a solid IPO pipeline in the quarters ahead.These factors might lead to solid investment banking revenues for the industry participants. Equity underwriting fees are projected to increase and a potential rise in fees from growing M&A activities in some sectors could result in higher advisory fees.However, debt underwriting fees may not be a good support, as rising rates in the United States will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities.Nevertheless, uncertainty-induced instability might continue for some time, which will keep supporting the trading business. Further, with the continued increase in interest rates, investment brokers are expected to earn more on the un-invested cash in their customer accounts.  Furthermore, innovative trading platforms, investments in technology and advertising are expected to enhance the overall backdrop for investment banks.Attractive Stock Market Performance Looking at the group's market performance over the past two years, it appears that the broader economic recovery has been helpful to industry participants. The gradual improvement in the trading environment, a favorable investment banking backdrop and policy changes were other factors encouraging investors to bet on investment banks and brokers.The Zacks Investment Bank Industry, a 22-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past two years.The industry has struggled lately, but it has done very well when we look at a longer time horizon. Over the last two year period, the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 69.6%, handily outperforming the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Finance Sector's 29.3% and 28.3% gains, respectively.Two-Year Price PerformanceInvestment Bank Stocks are on SaleDespite outperforming the industry in the past two years, the industry’s valuation looks inexpensive. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing finance companies because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.     This ratio essentially measures a bank's current market value relative to what it would be worth if all assets were sold, debt was paid and intangible assets were written off.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 2.69X, slightly above the median level of 2.57X, over the past two years. The industry has traded as high as 3.31X and as low as 1.69X over the last two years.The space looks attractive when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&P 500 is 10.07X and the two-year median level is 9.17X.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM) As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing investment banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with its broader sector tally ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount.The Zacks Finance Sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 2.76X and the median level of 3.48X for the same period are above the Zacks Investment Bank Industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM) Outperformance May Continue on the Improving Earnings OutlookProspects of profitability with rising interest rates, increase in volatility-driven trading income, investment banking business momentum and other strategic initiatives should help investment bank stocks continue generating solid shareholder value going forward.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to continue outperforming the broader market in the quarters ahead. Investors may consider the current price levels as good entry points as there are convincing reasons to predict a decent upside in the near term.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance going forward is the industry's earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the estimate revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry below shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018. While estimates for this year and next have been stable lately, they did come down a fair amount earlier. Price and Consensus: Zacks Investment Bank IndustryThe industry's earnings outlook becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $3.16 'EPS' estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up dollar EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Investment Bank industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the dollar earnings of $3.16 'per share' of the industry for 2018, but how this dollar number has evolved recently.Current-Year EPS Estimate RevisionsAs you can see here, the $3.16 'EPS' estimate for 2018 is up from $3.04 at the end of March and $3.03 at the end of the month period to that and $2.63 this time last year. In other words, the sell-side analysts covering the companies in the Zacks Investment Bank industry have been raising their estimates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Investment Bank industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #57, which places it at the top 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has remained in the top half of the rank list over the past eight weeks. Investment Banks Promise Long-Term GrowthThe industry possesses solid long-terms prospects as well. The group’s mean estimate of long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate has been mounting since February 2018 to reach the current level of 15.94%. This compares favorably with the Zacks S&P 500 Composite’s figure of 9.8%.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth RateIn fact, the basis of this long-term EPS growth could be the top-line recovery that the industry participants have been showing since the beginning of 2017.Another important indication of a solid long-term prospect is the improvement in the group’s return on equity (ROE), which is a key metric for evaluating finance stocks.Bottom LineOne should particularly consider betting on investment bank and broker stocks that depict an upbeat earnings outlook.5 Investment Bank Stocks to Bet onEvercore Inc.

841,SCHW,"Improving operating backdrop, rising rate environment and easing of regulations, along with the strengthening of the domestic economy, should keep supporting the performance of banking stocks. So, we bring one such stock — UMB Financial Corporation (UMBF  -  Free Report) — which continues to indicate strong fundamentals and improving prospects.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has been revised 1.9% upward over the last 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism regarding its earnings growth potential. As a result, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Looking at the company’s price performance, the stock has gained 8.2% so far this year, slightly underperforming 9.6% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to. Notably, UMB Financial has a Momentum Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best upside potential.Thus, given the strength in fundamentals and upward estimate revisions, the stock is expected to gain further in the near term.Here are a few other factors that make the stock a viable investment option.Revenue Strength: UMB Financial’s revenues have witnessed a CAGR of 5.5% over the last five years (2013-2017). Also, its projected sales growth of 6.5% for 2018 and 5.8% for 2019 ensure the continuation of the uptrend in revenues.Earnings per Share (EPS) Growth: UMB Financial witnessed earnings growth of 6.2% in the last three to five years.

In fact, management anticipates revenue growth to be in low double-digits in 2018, backed by rate hikes and other favorable macroeconomic factors.Moreover, further rise in rates will likely lead to a notable improvement in net new assets and total client asset balances.

846,SCHW,"The Federal Reserve lifted a key U.S. interest rate for the second time this year and signalled at a slightly more aggressive plan to tighten monetary policy in the near term. Interest rates rose again as the U.S. economy heated up and inflation crawled higher.With the Fed hiking rates and aiming for more increases this year, banks, insurers and brokerage firms stand to gain. Meanwhile, utilities, homebuilders and gold miners are likely to lose.Fed Gets Slightly More HawkishThe Fed, as widely expected, raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2%. Eight of the 15 Fed officials said that they expect interest rates to increase at least four times this year, up from seven in the March Fed rate meeting. The Fed’s dot plot, in fact, indicated that policy makers predict two additional rate hikes this year for a total of four increases instead of three as planned earlier.By the end of this year, the median forecast for the federal funds rate stands at 2.4%, compared with the March forecast of 2.1%. Beyond this year, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee predicts that it will hike rates three times next year and one more time the following year to propel its benchmark rate up to 3.4%.Fed’s View on Economy & InflationThe Fed’s decision reflected an economy that is improving by the day. After all, the jobless rate is at its lowest since 2000, wages are going up and consumers are pretty confident. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that “most people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment is low.” Lest we forget, for the first time in nearly 20 years, there are more job openings in the United States than workers to fill the positions.Fed officials also believe that the economy doesn’t require much help at the moment. Fed has removed the language that said the central bank expected federal funds rate “to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”Powell, in the meantime, added that the Fed is comfortable with the comeback of inflation. The Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE), has already touched the central bank’s 2% target during March and April. The Fed expects inflation to remain higher than 2% in the next two years. (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Beat the Fastest Rise in Inflation in 6 Years).Winners & Losers in a Rising Rate SettingWith the Fed raising interest rates and hinting at faster hikes, certain sectors stand to gain, while some sure have a lot at stake.Let’s take a look at the sufferers first –UtilitiesInvesting in utilities won’t be a good idea in a rising interest rate scenario. Utilities are capital intensive and funds generated from internal sources do not always meet requirements. Hence, these companies have towering debt loads. Low interest rates help them pay off debts and book profits.But higher rates along with an escalating debt level, for that matter a steep debt/equity ratio, impact the credit ratings of these utility operators. If the credit ratings go down, a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates, leading to a rise in cost of operations.Home Construction Higher federal funds rate will make it more expensive for banks to borrow money, which eventually translates into higher borrowing rates for consumers. This is surely a dampener for real estate activities and losers, affecting construction-related businesses, like homebuilders.Mortgage rates are already on the rise. On average, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate climbed to 4.66% last month, the highest in seven years, before dropping slightly in recent weeks.GoldRising rates diminish the appeal of precious metals like gold because the commodity doesn’t offer yield as high as other safe haven assets like government bonds. Higher interest rates also boost the dollar and dent demand for dollar-denominated commodities.Following the Fed’s announcements, the ICE Dollar Index that measures the value of dollar against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1% to 93.898.Now, which areas are set to make the most of a rate hike? Of course, financials!BanksBanks are definitely the go-to rate trade now. As a rule, higher interest rates boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.National banks like the Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) are very rate-sensitive and have consistently seen earnings rise on a quarter-point rate hike.InsurersVery few companies root for a rate hike as much as those in the insurance industry. And why not? The relationship between interest rates and insurance companies is linear and straightforward, meaning the higher the rate, the greater the growth.Insurers derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a rise in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest premiums at higher yields and earn more investment income, expanding their profit margins.Not only investment income, which is an important component of insurers’ top line, annuity sales should also benefit from a higher rate environment.Asset ManagersBrokerage firms advantage significantly from an increasing rate environment since a hike in rates generally occurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Notably, a wealth management firm like The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) has said time and again that each quarter point increase in rates generally adds to interest revenues, much of which flows directly to pre-tax profits.Top 5 GainersGiven the aforesaid positives, we have selected five solid stocks from these winning areas that boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).BankFinancial Corporation (BFIN  -  Free Report) operates as the holding company for BankFinancial, National Association that provides commercial, family, and personal banking products and services in Illinois.

851,SCHW,"Benefits from a stabilizing economy and improving interest-rate scenario have well positioned the investment management industry, which performed well during the first three months of 2018.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appeared that volatility was back in the markets in the just-concluded quarter, with extremities in February and March. This resulted in higher trading activities, and increased fixed income and equity revenues, primarily for investment banks.Also, most investment managers have waived off majority of their fees with the rates rising since 2016 and this decline in fee waivers supported their quarterly results. Also, it is expected to continue aiding top-line growth in the upcoming quarters.Notably, as investment brokers earn interest income on un-invested cash in customer accounts, the rate hikes will enable them to invest at higher rates. Thus, brokerage firms will likely engage in more investment activities as rates continue to increase, which will further boost their interest income.Therefore, we are focusing on two investment brokers, TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD  -  Free Report) and The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW  -  Free Report), which seem to be well positioned for the future, due to their underlying strength and growth prospects.TD Ameritrade has a market cap of $34.39 billion and provides securities brokerage services and technology-based financial services to retail investors, traders and independent registered investment advisors. On the other hand, Schwab, with a market cap of $77.15 billion, is a leading discount brokerage firm, which provides securities brokerage, banking and other financial services to individual investors, institutional clients and other broker-dealers.Both, TD Ameritrade and Schwab currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Though both brokerage firms have similar business trends, deeper research into the financials will help decide which investment option is better.Price PerformanceWhile, both the firms have outperformed the industry (up 6.8%) so far this year, TD Ameritrade’s performance has been better. Its shares have surged 20.1% year to date compared with 14.3% rally of Schwab’s shares.Dividend YieldWhile both the companies have been deploying capital in terms of dividend payments to enhance shareholder value, TD Ameritrade has an edge over Schwab in this case. This is because TD Ameritrade has a dividend yield of 1.37% while Schwab has a dividend yield of 0.68%.Moreover, TD Ameritrade’s current dividend yield also compares favorably with the industry average of 1.25%.Leverage RatioHere, Schwab seems to be better positioned than TD Ameritrade. While both the companies have a debt-to-equity ratio higher than the industry (0.24), Schwab’s debt-to-equity ratio of 0.30 is lower than TD Ameritrade’s ratio of 0.37.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12-months for TD Ameritrade and Schwab is 19.66% and 17.20%, respectively. While both companies have a greater ROE than their peers (the industry has an ROE of 10.34%), TD Ameritrade seems to be better positioned, in terms of reinvesting its earnings when compared with Schwab.Earnings Growth ProjectionsFor TD Ameritrade, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $3.18 for fiscal 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 72.8%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 25.6%.For Schwab, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.42 for 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 47.6%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.5%.This round is biased toward TD Ameritrade.Sales Growth ProjectionsFor TD Ameritrade, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $5.40 billion for fiscal 2018, reflecting 46.8% rise from the prior year.For Schwab, the consensus estimate for sales stands at $10.18 billion for 2018, indicating growth of 18.1% year over year.Therefore, TD Ameritrade has an edge here as well.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that TD Ameritrade is better positioned than Schwab when considering dividend yield, earnings and sales growth expectations, reinvesting potential as well as price performance. Schwab wins only on better leverage position.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

853,SCHW,"Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF  -  Free Report) announced second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31) earnings per share of $1.63, which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On a year-over-year basis, the bottom line jumped 27%.Results were primarily driven by an increase in net revenues, reflecting solid investment banking strength. Also, growth in assets acted as a tailwind. However, higher expenses were on the downside. Net income for the quarter totaled $242.8 million, up 29% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues Improve, Costs RiseNet revenues for the quarter amounted to $1.81 billion, rising 16% year over year. The rise was attributable to an increase in almost all the revenue components except net trading profits. Further, the reported figure marginally topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Segment wise, in the reported quarter, RJ Bank registered an increase of 26% in net revenues. Further, Asset Management and Private Client Group depicted top-line improvement of 40% and 17%, respectively. However, Capital Markets witnessed a decline of 10% in net revenues, while Others reported improved revenues against negative revenues in the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expenses increased 6% year over year to $1.48 billion. The rise was largely due to increase in all cost components, except for the absence of acquisition-related costs and losses on extinguishment of debt as well as lower other expenses and bank loan loss provision.As of Mar 31, 2018, client assets under administration increased 14% on a year-over-year basis to $729.5 billion, while financial assets under management surged 55% to $132.3 billion.Strong Balance Sheet, Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Mar 31, 2018, Raymond James reported total assets of $36 billion, relatively stable sequentially. Total equity rose 4% on a sequential basis to $5.9 billion.Book value per share was $40.82, up from $36.28 as of Mar 31, 2017.As of Mar 31, 2018, total capital ratio came in at 24.1%, increasing from 22.7% as of Mar 31, 2017. Also, Tier 1 capital ratio was 23.2% compared with 21.8% in the year-ago period.Also, return on equity came in at 16.7% at the end of the reported quarter, up from 8.8% a year ago.Our TakeWhile the company remains well positioned to grow via acquisitions, elevated expenses, mainly due to higher compensation costs and bank loan loss provisions are likely to hurt bottom-line growth. Also, lack of geographic diversification remains a major concern for the company as it might hamper its financials and limit flexibility, going forward.Raymond James Financial, Inc.

854,SCHW,"The landscape in the retail brokerage industry has certainly changed.  Once the exclusive territory of full-service brokers and big investment banks who charged up to 5% of the value of a trade to execute the purchase and sale of stocks, the industry is now dominated by what used to be known as “discount brokers” who operate primarily online and offer fast executions and previously unheard of prices – in some cases as low as a few dollars per trade.While some investors still choose the attention of a traditional broker, most active and self-directed investors now use a discount broker to buy and sell not only stocks, but also options, futures and even currenciesThe Original Discount BrokerCharles Schwab (SCHW  -  Free Report) was the pioneer of the discount brokerage industry. The first major house to offer lighter services for reduced commissions and fees, they’ve been synonymous with the discount brokerage industry since the beginning.Offering a wide range of investment services including both ordinary discount brokerage and more hands-on advice through a network of independent advisors, Schwab was the beneficiary of increased trading volumes during the volatile first quarter of 2018 and reported record revenues with sales of $2.4B, up 15% from the same quarter in 2017.Brokers also typically benefit from higher interest rates as it increases the amount they collect on margin balances and Schwab saw net interest margins increase to 2.2% from 1.87 a year earlier.Despite higher costs for employee compensation and a one-time charge due to a $15M loss in unsecured losses by customers in volatility products, Schwab earned $783M in the quarter, or $0.55/share, a 41% increase over last year.  With 6 analyst upgrades in the past 30 days, Charles Schwab is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but has a strong possibility of changing soon.The Online PioneerE-trade Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) was one the first discount brokers to concentrate on an online presence - in the mid-1990s - and has been a favorite of actively trading customers ever since.Just like competitor Charles Schwab, they were a big beneficiary of the market volatility early in the year, posting results last Thursday that set all-time records for revenues, operating margins, trading revenue, margin balances and net asset flows.Beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate, E-Trade reported earnings of $0.88/share and the positive language in the report has prompted 5 analysts to raise their forecasts for 2018, resulting in a Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.53/Share, up from $3.11 90 days ago.Etrade is a Zacks rank #1 (Strong Buy).Former Market Maker Turned BrokerGrowing from options market making giant Timber Hill, Interactive Brokers (IBKR  -  Free Report) has found that using its platform for market access as a broker is considerably more profitable in terms of both revenues and net earnings.  Interactive brokers caters to sophisticated individual investors and advisors, offering tools and services to what professional traders use, but at discount prices. They offer trading in multiple asset classes worldwide in a single account and from a single interface.After selling the underperforming Timber Hill market-making division in 2017, Interactive brokers has registered double digit earnings surprises in each of the last three quarters and seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate rise to $2.21/share for 2018, a 44% increase from the $1.53 reported in 2017, earning a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  The stock price has been rewarded in kind, rising from the mid-30s in the summer of 2017 to close at $73.80 on Friday, giving it a Momentum score of “A”.Though the volatility that aided the results of the discount brokers last quarter seems to have subsided somewhat in recent weeks, the prospect of trade wars, geopolitical risk and the coming mid-term elections all increase the probability that we’ll see more volatile markets throughout 2018.Investors would be well-served to include some companies like brokerage houses that benefit from choppy markets.

Also, on a year-over-year basis, the bottom line surged 10%.Results were primarily driven by an increase in net revenues, reflecting improved investment banking.

858,SCHW,"In the second (April-June) quarter, the stock market witnessed increased volatility on impending trade war fears, geo-political tensions, outlook for interest rate hikes and inflationary pressure. These weighed on the performance of financial stocks.The decent performance of the financial stocks in the first quarter on revival of client activities in February and March provided some respite, which aided these stocks to record positive gains year to date.One such investment bank is TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report), which has rallied 5.6% year to date, against the industry’s decline of 4.4%.This price performance is backed by a gradually improving operating environment and rate hike scenario, which is beneficial for brokerage business. Furthermore, anticipated improvement in trading activities and several of its ongoing initiatives bode well for TD Ameritrade.Moreover, estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have been north bound. In the last 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved up 4.3% and 6.8% for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, respectively.TD Ameritrade’s debt/equity ratio is 0.33 compared with the S&P 500 average of 0.68, displaying low debt burden relative to the industry. It highlights the financial stability of the company even in an unstable economic environment.Also, TD Ameritrade’s ROE of 19.66% compared with the industry average of 9.60% indicates the company’s commendable position over its peers.TD Ameritrade’s earnings have increased 10.46% annually over the last three to five years. The earnings growth momentum is anticipated to continue in the near term as well. The company’s projected EPS (earnings per share) growth (F1/F0) is 72.83% for fiscal 2018 and (F2/F1) nearly 22.72% for fiscal 2019.TD Ameritrade’s trading volumes have been displaying an uptrend in the last few years with an increase in average client trades per day. We believe that in the near term, the company will be able to grow its trading volumes due to expected improvement in equity markets, rising rate environment as well as its innovative trading platforms. Additionally, the company continues to undertake investment spending in technology and advertising that are likely to enhance the overall business.Further, with a rise in rates, brokerage firms are likely to engage in more investment activities. As brokerage firms earn interest income on un-invested cash in customer accounts, the rate hikes will enable these firms to invest at higher rates. As TD Ameritrade currently derives nearly 35% of its total asset-based revenues from net interest income, the company is poised to benefit from the recent rate hikes.Additionally, TD Ameritrade remains a leading asset gatherer with nine consecutive years of double-digit asset growth since fiscal 2008 in net new client assets. Also, the company’s net revenues have been improving as it recorded 5.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last four years ending fiscal 2017, with the trend continuing in first six months of fiscal 2018. Based on the company’s solid business model, focus on high net-worth clients and improving service model to boost engagement and retention, we expect TD Ameritrade to experience significant top-line growth in the future as well.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

The reported figure was 10.5% higher year over year.Total asset-based revenues for the quarter amounted to $632 million. The figure increased 31.9% year over year, driven by higher insured deposit account fees, as well as investment product fees and net interest revenues.Commissions and transaction fees declined 1.8% from the prior-year quarter to $330 million. However, the quarter's NIM was 1.66%, up 31 basis points year over year.Total operating expenses increased 13.9% year over year to $622 million.

Shareholders’ equity was $7.2 billion compared with $5.1 billion as of Sep 30, 2016.Our ViewpointThe company came up with an impressive performance on a significant improvement in trading activities. Further, eased margin pressure in the quarter acted as a tailwind. The company recorded a rise in average client trades per day in the fiscal third and fourth quarters. Also, its deal to acquire Scottrade is likely to be accretive to earnings per share. TD Ameritrade’s steady capital deployment activities and revenue growth are encouraging.However, we remain cautious of elevated costs, which are likely to weigh on the company’s financials.TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation QuoteCurrently, TD Ameritrade carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

866,SCHW,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 16, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, no provisions and a significant rise in total client assets, and new brokerage accounts were among the positives. However, higher expenses and a decrease in trading revenues remained headwinds.Moreover, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history as its earnings did not lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. It delivered an average positive surprise of nearly 3.8%.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteHowever, activities of Schwab during the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained unchanged at 53 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 35.9%.Notably, Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 35.7% in the past year, outperforming 31.2% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post first-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, it is quite likely that Schwab will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is +0.31%.Zacks Rank: Schwab currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsOverall trading activities remained strong during the quarter, driven by significant market volatility, specifically in the months of February and March. Notably, Schwab opened 165,000 and 138,000 new brokerage accounts in January and February, respectively, indicating that investors were interested in entering the market. Also, the company’s efforts toward lowering trading fees should have helped in adding more brokerage accounts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts for the first quarter is 10,936, which reflects year-over-year improvement of 6%.Thus, with growth in brokerage accounts, Schwab’s trading revenues might have witnessed improvement in the quarter.Further, Schwab witnessed a rise in total client assets and average interest-earning assets in January and February on a year-over-year basis. This should reflect in the company’s results for the entire quarter.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets for the quarter is $3.5 trillion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 18.8%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the quarter is $233 billion, which is expected to grow 7.4% year over year. Hence, higher assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Improvement in the two most important components of Schwab’s revenues should support overall revenue growth in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is $2.34 billion, which reflects growth of 12.7% year over year.However, Schwab’s operating expenses have remained elevated for the past few quarters. Moreover, because of higher compensation and benefits cost, overall expenses are expected to remain high in the first quarter.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 19.

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

However, higher expenses and a decrease in trading revenues remained the headwinds.After considering tax act related charge, quarterly net income available to common shareholders was $550 million, up 14% year over year. For 2017, it was $2.18 billion, up from $1.75 billion in the prior year.Revenue Improvement Offset by Expense RiseNet revenues were $2.24 billion for the reported quarter, climbing 14% year over year, supported by asset management and administration fees (up 8%) and net interest revenues (up 26%) and other revenues (up 26%). These were partly offset by a 24% fall in trading revenues. The reported figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For 2017, net revenues grew 15% from the prior year to $8.62 billion. The figure was on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Total non-interest expenses rose 12% year over year to $1.30 billion. All expense components increased on a year-over-year basis.Provision for loan losses and fee waivers were nil.Pre-tax profit margin improved to 42.5% from 41.8% recorded last year.At the end of the fourth quarter, Schwab’s average interest-earning assets grew 8% year over year to $228.5 billion.Annualized return on equity as of Dec 31, 2017, came in at 14%, on par with the year-ago level.Other Business DevelopmentsAs of Dec 31, 2017, Schwab had total client assets of $3.36 trillion (up 21% year over year). Also, net new assets — brought by new and existing clients —surged 112% from the prior-year quarter to $78.1 billion.In addition, Schwab added 386,000 new brokerage accounts in the reported quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had a total of 10.8 million active brokerage accounts, 1.2 million banking accounts and 1.6 million corporate retirement plan participants.Our TakeFocus on low-cost capital structure will continue supporting Schwab’s performance in the quarters ahead. Also, initiatives to strengthen market share will likely support its profitability over the long term, despite the expectation of near-term reduction in trading revenues.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteSchwab carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

873,SCHW,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter and full year 2017 results on Jan 17, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, lower level of fee waivers, no provisions and a significant rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts were among the positives. However, higher expenses and a decrease in trading revenues remained headwinds.Moreover, the company has a decent earnings surprise history as its earnings have not lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. It delivered an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 2%.However, activities of Schwab during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 41 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 13.9%.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteNotably, Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 30.1% in 2017, outperforming the 19.5% growth for the industry it belongs to.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is -0.72%.Zacks Rank: Schwab currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsAlthough, market volatility did not improve much in the fourth quarter when compared with the prior-year quarter, overall trading activities remained relatively decent. Moreover, Schwab opened 117,000 and 122,000 new brokerage accounts in October and November 2017, respectively, indicating that investors were somewhat interested in entering the market. Also, the company’s efforts toward lowering trading fees should have helped in adding more brokerage accounts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts for the fourth quarter is 10,696, which is projected to witness year-over-year improvement of 5.3%.Thus, with the growth in brokerage accounts, trading revenues might have witnessed modest improvement in the quarter.Further, Schwab witnessed a rise in total client assets and average interest-earning assets in October and November on a year-over-year basis. This should reflect in the company’s results for the quarter as well.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets for the quarter is $3.3 trillion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 18.2%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the quarter is $220 billion, which is expected to grow 6.3% year over year. Hence, higher assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Improvement in the two most important components of Schwab’s revenues should support overall revenue growth in the quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is projected to be $2.23 billion. The figure is expected to witness growth of 12.9% year over year.However, Schwab’s operating expenses have remained elevated since the past few quarters. Moreover, because of higher compensation and benefits cost, overall expenses are expected to remain high in the fourth quarter as well.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 18.

The decrease was mainly due to lower general and administrative costs, and absence of consumer bad debt.Income before income taxes came in at $268 million in the quarter, surging 46% year over year.

877,SCHW,"Believe it or not, investments can actually begin with just $100. True, there are plenty of stocks available for less than a penny, but investing $100 in stocks may not always provide investors the diversity that mutual funds can assure. Moreover, risks associated with penny stocks are much higher.On the other hand, there are low-cost mutual funds with decent returns where investors can invest just $100. These funds are even offered by prominent firms like BlackRock Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) and Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW  -  Free Report). Mutual funds are an affordable option for diversity as well as a safer investment bet.Investing in Mutual FundsMutual funds are great options for investors looking for a relatively less risky way to earn at least more than what fixed income instruments offer. Money from individuals and even organizations are invested in stocks, bonds, or other assets covering diverse industries globally.One of the benefits of mutual funds is that it allows a small investor to invest in a basket of securities at one go. Investors need not worry about investing a large chunk in securities separately. Moreover, these are less risky than any individual asset class as underperformance of a security gets mitigated by outperformance of others in the portfolio. In addition to the asset diversification, mutual funds also provide liquidity, economies of scale, and are professionally managed.A $100 investment cannot make an investor rich. This can only be to get someone started with investments, with the actual returns coming when an investor decides to invest a certain amount of money for a considerable time. So, this can double up as a great retirement plan as well.3 Best Bets NowA $100 bet will make more sense when the bulk of that amount is invested and no charges are paid from it. Funds that carry no sales load and have relatively low expense ratios should be preferred. It is also important to look at the performance track record.The following funds hold either a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #2 (Buy), as we expect the funds to outperform its peers in the future.

888,SCHW,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is transforming into a major threat to the wealth management industry based on its Sumerian virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platform, Artificial Intelligence (AI) expertise and trove of consumer data & spending patterns.The company in collaboration with Fidelity Labs recently created a digital financial advisor Cora that people interacted with using a VR headset.Amazon plans to lure enterprises in utilizing its VR/AR tools to develop company specific apps. The recent VR demonstration reflected its technological capability, which enhances the possibility of entering into the investment advisory and consulting field, and eventually financial services domain.The company has been looking for ways to enter the financial services to continue its growth momentum. Amazon’s scintillating growth over the last decade can be attributed to its capability of disrupting retail, grocery and cloud computing market. Shares have returned 1921.1% over the period, significantly outperforming S&P 500’s gain of 113.4%.  The company has also shown active interest in providing healthcare services. Amazon has teamed up with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) to create a non-profit organization to address the needs of their U.S.-based employees.Wealth Management Totters from AI ThreatInvestment advisory and consulting functions are important because these facilitates cross-selling of different financial products under wealth management domain. Penetrating into this field should ultimately help Amazon to expand its financial services offerings in the long haul.Amazon’s foray into the wealth management market doesn’t bode well for wealth managers and consultants. They are already under tremendous pressure due to rapid evolution of AI and tools like machine learning, which has been promulgating roboadvisors (automated investment solutions). Business Insider Intelligence estimates that 10% of all global assets, or $8 trillion, will be managed by robos by 2020, significantly up from $200 billion in 2016.Leading asset managers and banking firms like The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo WFS are already using roboadvisors. Blackrock, the largest fund manager in the world has been using machines and algorithms to pick stocks for its actively managed funds.Overstock (OSTK  -  Free Report), an e-commerce provider, with almost 40 million active users has already rolled out a roboadvisor supported by tZERO Advisors.Amazon’s Data Trove & Popularity Provides an EdgeNevertheless, Amazon’s entry is especially threatening given the trove of information it has about consumers and their spending habits. The company has the ability to harness AI, machine learning tools and the Sumerian platform to offer customized wealth management products based on this data.Although this is quite a far-fetched thought, if it clicks with people, a digital investment advisor from Amazon may send jitters across wealth management firms. Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote Notably, Amazon’s digital assistant Alexa has the ability to answer economic questions thanks to a partnership with UBS Wealth Management. The company has been focusing on expanding fintech services to provide more facilities to Prime members, which is now more than 100 million.Reportedly, Amazon has already held discussions with several large banks, including JP Morgan, to launch a checking-account like product primarily for underserved customers and millennials. A checking account would help it to provide further benefits to Prime members, persuading them to buy more on Amazon’s e-commerce platform.Moreover, the millennial focus is significant. Per comScore's 2017 US Mobile App Report, Amazon App is more popular among millennials (aged 18-34) compared with Gmail and Facebook.Notably, millennials as prospective customers hold most potential for any wealth management firm due to their need for retirement savings. They are also more likely to switch investment advisors as compared with older investors. According A.T. Kearney, in 2017, “53% of mass affluent investors aged 18 to 24 switched primary investment firms.”Moreover, per consulting firm Bain, 75% of responding millennials in a recent survey stated that they are likely to test a technology firm’s deposit account, credit card and other products.Hence, Amazon’s popularity gives it an edge in this regard over legacy financial services providers.Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

889,SCHW,"It was widely reported on Wednesday that a trading desk at Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) had made a profit of $200 million dollars in a single day trading the CBOE Volatility Index.Goldman is reported to have been long the index on February 5th, a day the S&P 500 sank more than 4% and the VIX more than doubled.  Though it was not disclosed exactly which instruments the firm was trading, in the wake of the news, this seems like an appropriate time to examine how the VIX works, who trades it and why, and how an individual investor might take advantage of opportunities in VIX options.VIX HistoryThe Chicago Board Options Exchange - now CBOE Global Markets (CBOE  -  Free Report) - introduced the VIX index in 1993 as a single number that would allow traders and the investing public to know the level of implied volatility in options on the broad markets.  The original VIX was calculated from 8 front-month options on the OEX (the CBOE’s index on the S&P 100.)  Historical values going back several years were also made available at that time.  In 2003, the calculation of the VIX was modified to use the more liquid options on the S&P 500 - the SPX - and the basket of options in the calculation was expanded to a weighted average of all the at-the money and out-of-the-money options in the front two months with an average of 30 days to expiration. The intention was to make the index a more representative sample of the option market’s prediction of future volatility.In 2004, the CBOE introduced futures contracts on the VIX.  Because no physical commodity or instrument can be exchanged, VIX futures are cash settled, with the two counter-parties to a trade exchanging the cash value of the difference between the traded price and the settlement price of the index at expiration.  In 2006, the CBOE first listed options on the VIX.  Like the VIX futures, the options are cash settled with the difference between the settlement price and the strike price of in the money options exchanged.  Other than the fact that they are cash-settled and are European exercise (they cannot be exercised prior to expiration - which is a basically inconsequential detail to most individual investors) they trade just like options on individual stocks. Several ETFs have subsequently been introduced that allow traders to gain long or short exposure to the VIX, including some that are double or triple leveraged.For reference, the highest value ever recorded in the VIX intraday is 89.53% and the highest close is 80.86%, both occurring during the financial crisis of 2008.  The all-time intraday low is 8.56%, and the lowest close ever is 9.14%, both occurring in late 2017.The long-term average price of the VIX is slightly less than 19.9%. The average over the past few years has been closer to 12%, but with a few huge spikes.Although it is commonly referred to as the market’s “fear gauge”, high VIX values could actually mean an expectation of a large move in either direction, but because of the well-documented belief that markets fall faster in bad times than they rise in good times, the VIX tends to increase most in times of market panic when stock prices are moving down.VIX Futures PricesThe VIX futures are almost always higher than the cash VIX value in a price relationship known as contango.  As the expiration of a futures contract nears, the price of the futures steadily converges with the cash (or “spot”) price of the index.  At expiration, the settlement price used is the cash price.In quiet and steadily rising markets - like we saw between 2016 and February of 2018 - this contango relationship creates an opportunity to make easy profits selling VIX futures.  Because observed volatility was very low during this period and the VIX mostly stayed in the low teens, traders could make money by selling VIX futures and simply waiting for them to converge with the (lower) cash VIX price.  In many cases, instead of selling the actual futures, traders purchased the XIV, an ETF that replicated a short position in near term futures - except with 2X leverage.There are several factors that contributed to the extremely low volatility experienced during this period, but it is widely agreed that a major factor was the growing propensity of individual investors to eschew actively managed funds and instead pour their money into broad-based index funds.  Consistent inflows into a diverse basket of stocks tends to dampen the price volatility of the basket.Look Out for the SteamrollerWith the benefit of hindsight, we can see how this trade ultimately turned out.  Selling VIX futures turned out to be what is commonly known in the industry as “picking up nickels in front of a steamroller,” meaning taking a succession of small profits, while ignoring the probability of an out-sized loss that wipes out all of the accumulated profits and potentially much more.Why would a trader take risks that eclipsed the potential rewards?  There are two main reasons.  One is that the trader is ignorant of the risk - or at least vastly underestimates it.  The other possible reason is that the trader does understand the risk, but because of a contractual arrangement with either investors (in the case of a hedge fund manager) or the trader’s employer (in the case of a firm proprietary trader) it is in the trader’s immediate best interest to book easy profits while taking outsized risk - because he will be paid a portion of the profits if the trade works, but is not made to personally bear a share of the losses if it doesn’t.  Hint: In the long run, it’s profitable to be on the other side of the trades of either of those traders.In an August 2017 article on the growing popularity of leveraged VIX and inverse VIX ETF products despite the risks, the New York Times profiled a trader who had quit his job as a manager at a Target store to sell the VIX full time.  He claimed to have started with $500K and grew the account to $12 million over the preceding few years.  When the Times interviewed that trader again, one day after the VIX experienced its biggest single-day spike ever (on February 5th, the same day Goldman Sachs took in that $200M haul), he admitted to feeling pain in the trade, but said he was still betting 21% of his portfolio – or $600,000 – in continuing to sell the VIX.  If 21% of his portfolio was then worth $600K, some quick math would suggest that he had already lost $9 million - a 75% drawdown.The double short XIV ETF was closed down completely in February by the issuer after losing over 80% of its value in a short period of time. Many traders who were short the VIX faced margin calls and had to either post additional capital to maintain their accounts, or have their trades liquidated at steep losses.Online broker Charles Schwab (SCHW  -  Free Report) reported a $15M non-recurring charge in the first quarter of 2018 to cover the negative account values of customers who were selling VIX products and suffered losses in excess of funds on deposit.Profit and ProtectionEven if you buy the premise that selling VIX instruments for short term profits is ultimately a losing trade, doing the opposite can be painful in a different way. Investors who own VIX futures or ETFs tend to suffer constant losses for months or even years before experiencing an increased volatility event that makes the trade profitable.Admittedly, this can be an emotionally difficult way to trade.When considered as a hedge against a diversified portfolio of equities however, owning calls on the VIX starts to look like a wise decision.  Though they are likely to decline in value during steadily rising markets, those options will rise significantly in value at exactly the times during which the broad markets are experiencing the most difficulty.Goldman Sachs had the prescience and discipline to stay long fairly inexpensive VIX instruments in order to be able to sell them out at hugely profitable prices when the rest of the market needed them most.In the end, the decision come down to a simple question.  Do you want to be positioned like Goldman - one of the most sophisticated and successful firms on the street, or do you want to be positioned like a short-sighted day trader who will soon be looking for a new day job?Owning VIX calls is a fairly simple way for an individual investor to protect gains in the equity markets, knowing that the long term odds of success are on your side.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.  Click for details >>

892,SCHW,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, primarily driven by an increase in equity market volatility, lower level of fee waivers and absence of provisions were among the positives. These were, however, offset by higher expenses.The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history, delivering an average beat of 2.1% in the trailing four quarters.Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 9% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Investment-Brokers industry’s almost flat performance. The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteWill the stock’s rally continue post second-quarter earnings release?

These assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, may have helped Schwab experience higher net interest revenue during the quarter.Decline in Fee Waivers: Following the rate hikes in December and March, Schwab witnessed a decline in almost all its fee waivers. This should have helped the company earn more in the to-be-reported quarter.Activities of Schwab during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence.

895,SCHW,"In order to attract young investors, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS  -  Free Report) launched robo-advisory services through its NatWest Invest platform. This is a new digital and low-cost option aimed at helping customers who prefer managing their investments themselves.This new investment program is a blend of technologies and provides access to professional advice from the company’s advisory department. It also seeks to target the existing customers of Royal Bank, who are yet to open an investment account. Thus, revenue generated from this will be split between the bank’s retail banking operations and its asset management operations as they provide investment platform and investment manager, respectively.People can start investing using the new platform with a minimum investment of £500 and monthly contribution of £50. This will be managed at a minimal annual advisory fee of 0.95% of funds for a year.The company’s incremental operating costs for providing these services are expected to be much lesser than the expected revenues. As a result, RBS’s private banking division is expected to obtain the benefits in the form of rising assets under management and fee revenues.Royal Bank claims to be the first in the U.K. to launch robo-advisory service.  However, banks in the United States started this fairly early. A few U.S. banks having similar services include Charles Schawb (SCHW  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report). These have existed for some time now and provide services at a cheaper rate.While other large banks in the U.K. are working on it, HSBC Holdings (HSBC  -  Free Report) had announced its plans to initiate robo-advice earlier this year. It is expected to launch the service early next year.Shares of Royal Bank have gained 44.6% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s rally of 21.7%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Notably, price reaction during the full trading session will provide a better idea about how investors accepted the results.Revenue growth (driven by a rise in interest income and trading revenues) and absence of fee waivers were among the positives. Further, there was an impressive rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts. However, higher expenses remained a headwind.Net income available to common shareholders was $746 million, up 42% year over year.Revenue Improvement Offset by Expense RiseNet revenues were $2.40 billion, climbing 15% year over year.

906,SCHW,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) along with some of its mutual funds have successfully convinced the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan to revive the lawsuit, which was filed against 17 banks and financial institutions, alleging them of manipulating the benchmark Libor interest rate.The London Interbank Offered Rate, popularly known as Libor, is used by banks as a benchmark rate to set the interest rates for various financial instruments and is also the average rate at which major banks borrow money from each other.Schwab claims that the banks had suppressed the Libor rates between August 2007 and May 2010, because of which its mutual funds that bought floating-rate debt during that period earned lower returns.Talking in favor of Schwab, Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch recently said that he disagreed with the decision of a lower court judge made in October 2015, who had dismissed Schwab’s claims and hence the appeals court has remanded the case for further proceedings.On Friday, Lynch, in his 64-page decision, said that District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald was ""wrong to assume, at the pleading stage, that Schwab was not harmed by, and may have even benefitted from, Libor manipulation.""Lynch also said that Buchwald was incorrect in concluding that she did not have jurisdiction over various claims made by Schwab under California law.Schwab is seeking damages for $665 billion worth of transactions relating to these floating-rate instruments, which includes over $40 billion of debt issued by finance companies like Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report), Deutsche Bank AG (DB  -  Free Report), HSBC Holdings plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Royal Bank of Canada, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, UBS Group AG and a few others.Schwab’s shares have gained 32.9% in the past year, outperforming 21.5% growth of the industry.Currently, Schwab carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

For 2017, it was $2.18 billion, up from $1.75 billion in the prior year.Revenue Improvement Offset by Expense RiseNet revenues were $2.24 billion for the reported quarter, climbing 14% year over year, supported by asset management and administration fees (up 8%) and net interest revenues (up 26%) and other revenues (up 26%).

911,SCHW,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 16, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, lower level of fee waivers and no provisions were among the positives. However, higher expenses and a decline in trading revenues remained headwinds.The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.1%.However, activities of Schwab during the third quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 41 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 19.6%.Additionally, the company’s revenues for the to-be-reported quarter are projected to be $2.19 billion. The figure is expected to witness growth of 14.2% year over year.Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 40.9% in a year’s time, outperforming the 38.2% growth for the industry it belongs to.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteWill the stock’s rally continue post third-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is +0.20%.Zacks Rank: Schwab currently carries a Zacks Rank 3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsGrowth in Trading Revenue to Remain Muted: Owing to an unchanged monetary policy standpoint of the Fed, most part of the third quarter did not witness much volatility. Moreover, overall trading activities remained sluggish in the quarter in the absence of any tangible development on the reforms proposed by the Trump administration. However, Schwab opened 107,000 and 123,000 new brokerage accounts in July and August 2017, respectively, indicating that investors were somewhat interested in entering the market. Moreover, the company’s efforts to lower trading fees should have also helped add more brokerage accounts. Thus, the overall slump in trading revenues should not have affected Schwab much. Its trading revenues are expected to remain more or less stable.Asset Growth Should Boost Net Interest Revenue: Schwab witnessed a rise in average interest-earning assets in July and August on a year-over-year basis. This should get reflected in the company’s results for the quarter as well. Hence, higher assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Decline in Fee Waivers: Following the rate hikes in December 2016 and March 2017, Schwab witnessed a 98% year-over-year decline in its fee waivers in the second quarter, which helped the company, earn more. Moreover, we believe that following the latest rate hike in June, the company should have been able to waive off all of its fees. This should further boost its top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

912,SCHW,"Welcome to Episode #102 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Zacks ETF Strategist Eric Dutram and by Zacks Podcast Producer Danny MacPherson, two Millennials, to discuss how they started investing and what apps and platforms are out there for new investors.With the S&P 500 (SPY  -  Free Report) and the small caps (IWM  -  Free Report) hitting new highs nearly every day recently, many Millennials are starting to wonder if they shouldn’t be investing.But where do you start?Millennials may think they don’t have enough money to invest. But many of these platforms don’t have a minimum requirement and are fairly low cost.Here’s some ideas for those who want to invest, not simply trade.For Those Who Don’t Want to Think About Anything1.      AcornsBoth Eric and Danny use acorns.com. Their tagline is “automatically invest spare change.”It operates only as an app. You link it to your credit or debit card and it will round up to the next dollar amount. For example, if you buy a coffee that is $3.75, it will round up to $4.00 and take the $0.25 and put it into your investing account. You can also set up a recurring investment, either daily, weekly or monthly, to boost your balance.It has pre-set ETF portfolios you can invest in that range from aggressive to conservative.The cost is $1 a month up to $5,000 in the account wherein there’s a yearly fee of 0.25%.2.      StashStashinvest.com allows you to buy into pre-set ETF portfolios including ones titled “The Activist”, “The Techie”, “The Globetrotter” and “The Trendsetter.”This is thematic investing.Stash also offers ROTH IRA accounts that you can start with as little as $50.Similar to Acorns, it also charges $1 a month and the 0.25% yearly fee when the account reaches $5,000.Want to Move Up to the Next Level?Motif offers investing in portfolios, trading and IPOs so it is more advanced than the other two platforms.Through its portfolio program, you can invest in a preset plan or you can create your own. This means you already have to know something about stocks.It appears to have a minimum of $1,000 and the cost is $9.95 a month.Actual Trading PlatformsAlready have an idea of stocks or ETFs you want to buy?You probably need a platform that allows you to trade.Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) offers the Sharebuilder Plan which allows you to do a recurring investment each month in stocks, ETFs or mutual funds for just $3.95 per investment.For example, it can buy $100 worth of shares of Alibaba on the third Tuesday of every month.Tracey has used this plan for nearly 17 years. You might be surprised at how quickly this type of investing adds up to something substantial if you do it a few years in a row.For those who want to do more active trading, Capital One Investing has a trading platform as well, as do the well-known brokerage firms such as eTrade (ETFC  -  Free Report) and Schwab (SCHW  -  Free Report).That’s where you put in an actual order on the open market to buy, for example, Alibaba.This is more advanced investing and trading.The Hardest Part is StartingThere are a lot of investing platforms available now and it may seem confusing.But as Eric and Danny discuss, the key is to just start.Eager to Learn How to Trade Options?Have you always wanted to trade stock options but are unsure where to begin or what to look for?Each week, Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak will bring you a detailed explanation of the trades “live” on YouTube.Watch him go through the trade as he answers your questions in real time.Become one of Dave’s minions.

913,SCHW,"Believe it or not, investments can actually begin with just $100. True, there are plenty of stocks available for less than a penny, but investing $100 in stocks may not always provide investors the diversity that mutual funds can assure. Moreover, risks associated with penny stocks are much higher.On the other hand, there are low-cost mutual funds with decent returns where investors can invest just $100. These funds are even offered by prominent firms like BlackRock Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) and Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW  -  Free Report). Mutual funds are an affordable option for diversity as well as a safer investment bet.Investing in Mutual FundsMutual funds are great options for investors looking for a relatively less risky way to earn at least more than what fixed income instruments offer. Money from individuals and even organizations are invested in stocks, bonds, or other assets covering diverse industries globally.One of the benefits of mutual funds is that it allows a small investor to invest in a basket of securities at one go. Investors need not worry about investing a large chunk in securities separately. Moreover, these are less risky than any individual asset class as underperformance of a security gets mitigated by outperformance of others in the portfolio. In addition to the asset diversification, mutual funds also provide liquidity, economies of scale, and are professionally managed.A $100 investment cannot make an investor rich. This can only be to get someone started with investments, with the actual returns coming when an investor decides to invest a certain amount of money for a considerable time. So, this can double up as a great retirement plan as well.3 Best Bets NowA $100 bet will make more sense when the bulk of that amount is invested and no charges are paid from it. Funds that carry no sales load and have relatively low expense ratios should be preferred. It is also important to look at the performance track record.The following funds hold either a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #2 (Buy), as we expect the funds to outperform its peers in the future. Remember, the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers.

915,SCHW,"Per an article by Bloomberg, The Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report) is in talks to acquire a New York-based startup, Clarity Money. The bank plans to fuse the personal finance services that the startup offers with its digital consumer lending platform — Marcus by Goldman Sachs.People familiar with the matter disclosed that no deal had been finalized so far. Also, there are possibilities of the deal coming to nothing.This uncertainty is assumed to have provoked a negative reaction from investors as reflected by the 4.2% drop in Goldman Sachs’ share price last trading session.Brief on the Two Digital PlatformsLaunched in October 2016, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, has been delivering good results so far. The platform exceeded the bank’s expectation of lending about $2 billion in loans by year-end 2017.Moreover, in a bid to expand its offerings, the company acquired Oakland, CA-based startup, Final, which helped in reducing fraud by offering customized credit card numbers. After introducing credit card offering feature, the online lending platform began to provide home improvement loans. The fintech startup, Clarity Money was founded by Adam Dell, the brother of Dell Inc. founder Michael Dell. The application helps draw attention to recurring charges and allows cancellation of unwanted bills.Per the article, the startup which started about a year ago, has about 50 employees and more than 500,000 users.Our TakeGoldman Sachs’ efforts to provide consumers with a cheaper personal finance option are encouraging. This step, a far cry from its traditional retail deposits and investment management services, is likely to bolster its financial health. Lately, weakness in trading activity has kept its revenues under pressure.Also, these strategic investments might help the bank reach its $5 billion revenue target that was disclosed in September 2017, to be achieved by 2020.Nevertheless, costs arising from brokerage and market development remain near to medium-term headwinds.Shares of Goldman have gained 9.3% over the past six months, underperforming 15.3% rally for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
