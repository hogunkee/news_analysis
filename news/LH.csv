3,LH,"In the wake of a solid month for the broad market and U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, some fund managers are tilting toward value-oriented stocks.X Having lagged growth stocks, value stock valuations are increasingly attractive, says Tom Galvin, lead manager of $4.1 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth (ELGAX). Yet their prospects are bright as the U.S. and key foreign economies continue to grow, Galvin added.In November, the broad market got a lift from such Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Walt Disney (DIS) and Home Depot (HD).With the S&P 500 climbing 3.07% last month, the broad stock market made it 13 straight month of gains, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds rode along, advancing 2.62% on average, their 15th monthly gain in the past 16 months and third positive month in a row. That lifted their year-to-date gain to 17.40%.Both the S&P 500 and Dow hit all-time highs to that point on Nov. 30.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersBest Performing Mutual Fund CategoriesWhy Fidelity Gave This Mutual Fund Manager More Money To InvestWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Bond Fund Decline In November: Turning Of The Tide?The November gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, generally better-than-expected corporate profits, benign inflation and heightened prospects for U.S. tax reform with a lowering of the corporate tax rate, said Galvin, whose fund finished among the top 16% in large-cap growth fund performance last month.Wall Street's approval of reforms that lighten corporate regulatory burdens also boosted the stock market last month, said John Rogers, chairman, CEO and chief investment officer of Ariel Investments and lead manager of flagship $2.2 billion Ariel Fund (ARGFX).But market leadership is poised to shift to value-oriented categories of stocks and mutual funds in the coming months, away from growth-oriented ones, added Rogers, whose fund's 7.01% return last month topped 98% of its midcap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.That tilt toward value already seemed underway in November. With a 3.27% gain on average, midcap value funds led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories. Small- to midsize companies tend to derive a larger portion of their revenue and earnings from the U.S., so they're likely to benefit more than large-cap companies from tax reform. ""There was a rotation into smaller stocks and value stocks as the prospect for successful passage of tax reform grew,"" Galvin said.That tax-reform tilt was also why U.S. diversified stock funds outpaced world stock funds, which averaged just a 1.03% gain last month. Japanese funds, averaging a 2.95% advance, led foreign stock funds.Industrials funds averaged a 3.10% gain in November, leading all major sector categories. They were driven by the rotation into value-oriented stocks.U.S. taxable bond funds were slightly above break even on average in November. U.S. Treasury funds led other categories, averaging a 0.08% gain. World income funds averaged a 0.54% gain. Muni bond funds lost ground overall last month.While GDP growth, corporate profits, tax reform and regulatory reform should benefit all corporations, longtime outperformance by growth stocks has left value stocks more attractively valued, Rogers said.The Russell 2500 Value index was trading at 18 times next year's earnings as of the first week of December. In contrast, the Russell 2500 Growth index was trading at a lofty 32 times. ""It's one of the biggest gaps I've seen in my career between value and growth,"" Rogers said. ""And there will be an inevitable reversion to the mean when things go too far.""In addition, the Federal Reserve's widely expected tax hikes should boost margins for banks, which generally are categorized as value stocks, Rogers said.Already, his firm's researchers are getting bullish input from industrial companies. ""A lot are describing recoveries and business momentum building,"" Rogers said.Further, Amazon's (AMZN) widespread competitive influence is helping to keep retail prices low, which is preventing inflationary pressure from growing, he said.In at least the near term, one area in which he expects to see many investment opportunities is among industrials, what he calls light cyclicals and manufacturers. In that group, he holds Kennametal (KMT). ""It's a favorite,"" he said. ""They make cutting tools and cutting blades that are used for everything from coal mines to rebuilding highways and infrastructure. They should be a prime beneficiary whenever we get an infrastructure (spending) bill through Congress.""Going forward, financial services should also outperform, ""especially money managers and private equity funds that are public,"" he said, adding, ""They're cheap because they're not in popular indexes.""Among those, he cites KKR (KKR). ""They are a large private equity firm run by Henry Kravis,"" he said. ""They're cheap and private equity is one of the best performing asset classes.""Rogers also owns Lazard (LAZ). ""They're an investment banking franchise,"" he said. ""They have money management and mutual fund subsidiaries that focus on emerging markets and international investing.""He also likes the beleaguered media space. Many investors are afraid that cable companies are suffering subscriber attrition, which creates downward pressure on fees to content providers. Rogers nevertheless like MSG Networks (MSGN). The New York City-area sports network broadcasts games for nine sports teams including the professional basketball Knicks. ""The fear has been overdone,"" Rogers said. ""Live sports, whether seen on smartphones, computers or TV, one way or another that content will be viewed and monetized.""Health care is his fourth-largest sector. He prefers systems and instruments maker Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) and clinical testing services provider Laboratory Corp. of America (LH). ""We're not involved in the riskier, more complicated parts of health care,"" he said.Growth-oriented fund managers still see opportunities on their side of the market ledger.""In the consumer space, where we're overweighted, Costco (COST) continues to demonstrate very strong traffic gains and sales growth,"" Galvin said. ""Roughly one-third of their customers are small-to-medium size businesses, which could benefit from tax reform.""Galvin also likes apparel maker Nike (NKE) and coffee-shop chain Starbucks (SBUX). After lagging in 2017, both ""could be potential winners in 2018,"" Galvin said. ""Each has issues, but each could benefit from accelerating GDP growth, helped by fiscal stimulus, stronger consumer confidence fueled by lower consumer tax rates and better jobs growth.""In health care, the CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) could signal that ""more consolidation is forthcoming,"" Galvin said. Also, a looser regulatory environment and tax reform that motivates companies to repatriate profits held outside the U.S. could increase the attractiveness of more health care companies.And new opportunities could emerge in the tech sector if tax reform and corporate profit escalation encourage more companies to spend on technology. ""For example, Salesforce.com (CRM): it was the fastest company to get to $10 billion in revenues, and it's likely to be the fastest to double revenues within five years as they continue to go broader and deeper in (finding customers among) Fortune 1000 companies at home and abroad,"" Galvin said. ""Salesforce is already by far the market leader in cloud dominance.""The firm's cloud software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships.And take $1.5 billion Champlain Small Company Fund (CIPSX) — an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner in the growth, small-cap and diversified equities categories. The growth-oriented fund owned Innospec (IOSP) as of July 31, a specialty chemicals firm that has a 92 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Earnings per share rose 8%, 13% and 28% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Innospec's SMR Rating means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.RELATED:Looking For Winning Stocks?

20,LH,"You get the feeling Michael Cartwright has spent a lot of time trying to clear up misconceptions about drug and alcohol addiction. Cartwright is CEO and co-founder of AAC Holdings (AAC). It's the parent of American Addiction Centers, which provides inpatient substance abuse treatment services to people with drug, alcohol and other addictions.AAC's therapy services include everything from motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy to family intervention services. It also provides personal training, yoga sessions, massage therapy and other amenities.At the end of the first quarter, AAC operated 12 substance abuse treatment facilities and one mental health facility specializing in binge eating disorders. It also made a series of acquisitions during the quarter to expand its operations.There aren't a lot of companies that do this on a large scale.Acadia Healthcare (ACHC), best known for its psychiatric services and treatment facilities, also offers treatment of addiction and chemical dependency. Other leading players include Elements Behavioral Health and Foundations Recovery Network.Cartwright estimates that there are around 6,700 treatment providers in the U.S. The vast majority are small mom-and-pop operations.IPO Serves ExpansionAAC currently has facility operations in Texas, Nevada, Florida and California, but intends to become a national brand. That's one reason for its initial public offering in October.""To expand nationally, you need capital, so we went public to raise capital,"" Cartwright told IBD.When it's suggested that there doesn't seem to be much of a model for operating a large, national brand of addiction treatment centers, Cartwright quickly strikes that notion down.""The American Society of Addiction Medicine has been building out a model over the last 25 years regarding the clinical science of how you treat drug and alcohol addiction with different levels of care,"" he told IBD. ""There's lots of data out there. It's just like diabetes — it's treated very scientifically.""The problem, Cartwright says, is that too many people equate alcoholism or drug addiction treatment with Alcoholics Anonymous. AA is a nonprofessional organization with a 12-step program that incorporates fellowship and spiritual elements.""That's more post-treatment,"" Cartwright said. ""People who say there's not a model (for a clinical approach) are not looking at the science or the research out there.""Addiction, like any disease, is the same anywhere you go, he says. The science behind its diagnosis, care and treatment is no different in Maine than it is in Oregon. So developing a national model for addiction treatment is no different than developing a national model for hospitals or diabetes centers, Cartwright says.""The diabetes industry has aggregated over the last 10 years, but the alcohol and drug addiction treatment industry is very unaggregated throughout the United States,"" Cartwright said. ""I think it's ripe for a consolidator like you saw in the diabetes space or the psychiatric hospital space.""Addressable MarketRyan Daniels, an analyst at William Blair & Co., noted in a research report that AAC has plenty of room to grow in a U.S. substance abuse treatment industry estimated to bring in around $35 billion a year.""The company has an active pipeline of organic growth opportunities ... as well as ample M&A opportunities of both facilities and marketing vehicles,"" he said. ""We believe AAC should be one of the faster-growing health care services companies in the public markets over the coming years.""AAC has made numerous moves this year to expand its footprint.In February it bought a former convent and a total of 96 acres in Ringwood, N.J., for $6.4 million in cash to be converted into the future site of a 150-bed residential treatment facility. Renovation of the existing structure and grounds should begin this summer.A month later, AAC agreed to buy the operating assets of Sunrise House Foundation, a nonprofit, in-network provider of substance abuse treatment in New Jersey.In April, AAC closed on its $13.5 million acquisition of an 84-bed hospital near Laguna Beach, Calif., which will be renovated into a Chemical Dependency Recovery Hospital with 124 beds. The renovation and construction work should be done during the first half of 2016.Meanwhile, the company expects to complete construction of a 164-bed, $18.1 million residential facility in Tampa, Fla., during the second half of 2015.Most of AAC's acquisitions are considered ""de novo,"" meaning the company buys properties and converts them into facilities rather than buying facilities that are already open and producing revenue.However, AAC occasionally acquires facilities that are already up and running. In February it completed a $13.1 million buyout of Recovery First, operator of an inpatient substance abuse treatment facility in the greater Fort Lauderdale, Fla., area. That facility is undergoing an expansion that should be completed in the fourth quarter.Last month, AAC completed its purchase of Clinical Services of Rhode Island, an operator of three outpatient treatment facilities in the state.AAC's expansion strategy is not that different from any other type of business. It eyes markets where there is sufficient population density to support a treatment facility.Some regions of the country have huge populations of addicts and an influx, Cartwright notes.Due partly to ObamaCare and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 — which made it easier for addicts to get insurance coverage for their conditions — a lot more people have access to treatment, Cartwright says.""Before 2008, insurance companies could deny or not offer coverage for substance abuse,"" he said. ""Now you can't be denied coverage for this disease. That's been a huge uplift in terms of people who can access care.""Revenue RisingFinancially, AAC saw its revenue balloon to $133 million in 2014 from less than $30 million three years earlier. On April 29, the company posted first-quarter revenue of $42.8 million, up 42% from the previous year. Earnings came in at 15 cents a share.There's no magic formula to AAC's financial growth, Cartwright says: ""As long as your facilities are filled up and you provide great clinical care, the financial part will take care of itself.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect AAC to post full-year EPS of 64 cents in 2015 and $1.04 in 2016. The company's stock price trades near 31, down from a high of 38.43 set on Feb. 26 but up more than 26% since March 11.AAC has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It belongs to IBD's Medical-Services group, which ranks No. 28 out of 197 industries tracked.The group features a pretty diverse range of stocks, including pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holdings (ESRX), pharmacy distribution and consulting firm Omnicare (OCR) and clinical testing services provider Laboratory Corp. of America (LH).

"
65,LH,"Air Methods (AIRM) has seen that happen more than a few times — including twice in the past three months.
"
66,LH,"The company provides air medical transport and other services via a fleet of owned and leased helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.

"
71,LH,"Planning For Emergencies
"
72,LH,"Air Methods' medical business is divided into two basic service areas: hospital-based and community-based.
"
73,LH,"Its hospital-based division provides medical helicopter and airplane services, primarily on fixed contracts paid by hospitals.
"
74,LH,"With this business, Air Methods typically provides only the aircraft and the pilot.
"
75,LH,"The main challenge with the hospital-based business is that foul weather can hamper Air Methods' ability to transport patients.
"
76,LH,"""A lot depends on the weather — whether you can actually go in and respond,"" said Richard Close, analyst at Avondale Partners. ""Someone might call in for a helicopter, but if the visibility is really low you can't go out and get them. When it doesn't fly, it doesn't get paid.""
"
77,LH,"The community-based service unit is designed to serve whole communities and operate independently of hospitals. Air Methods not only provides the aircraft and crew, but also critical-care medical staff trained in areas such as burns, cardiac, pediatrics, respiratory and trauma, and can help out with specialty-team transports.
"
78,LH,"This side of the business carries higher margins than the hospital-based division. It's even more volatile because in addition to having to deal with the weather, Air Methods must handle issues with medical care and billing.
"
79,LH,"As anyone in the health care business knows, billing for medical service doesn't necessarily mean getting the money.
"
80,LH,"""There's a big variance in net revenue based on the payer mix — who has commercial insurance, who depends on Medicare, who has no insurance at all,"" Close told IBD. ""Not everyone pays on time, or even at all. That dynamic has a really big impact.""
"
81,LH,"Air Methods saw the good and bad of it during the first two quarters of 2014.
"
82,LH,"On Aug. 7, the company posted better-than-expected revenue and profit for the second quarter, and the next day its stock popped more than 12% to a record closing high of 59.81. Shares currently trade near 59.

85,LH,"""Traditionally, Q1 and Q2 are a little more challenging with respect to weather, so there's more volatility there,"" he said.
"
86,LH,"Trends Lend A Lift
"
87,LH,"The good news for Air Methods is that its second-quarter results reflected positive trends for the company, says CEO Aaron Todd.
"
88,LH,"These include more hospitals outsourcing their transport services to a third party. ""We've seen an acceleration of that activity, and in a great majority of cases our hospital partners have chosen Air Methods to outsource,"" Todd told IBD. ""Second-quarter earnings reflect an underlying quality in that they were driven by positive trends and top-line expansion of more patients being transported.""
"
89,LH,"Air Methods reported Q2 earnings of 73 cents a share, up 49% from the prior year and 7 cents above analysts' consensus estimates. Revenue gained 14% to $258.5 million, also beating views.
"
90,LH,"Revenue from the Air Medical Services Division rose 7% to $219.6 million, while tourism revenue nearly doubled to $31.4 million. Revenue from the United Rotorcraft unit climbed 51% to $7.4 million.
"
91,LH,"Second-quarter total patient transports rose 7% to just less than 15,000, while net revenue per patient transport also improved 7% to $11,353.
"
92,LH,"Much of the company's growth can be traced to the move by more hospitals to a community-based model to save costs, Close says.
"
93,LH,"""Under a community-based contract, the costs for clinicians and other expenses get shifted to Air Methods, which has to hire the nurses and paramedics,"" he said. ""That's the advantage to the hospital, but it also has a positive financial impact for Air Methods.""
"

Walgreens halted using Theranos lab testing services at its Palo Alto, Calif., location in January amid growing allegations that Theranos' claims did not hold up.“In light of the voiding of a number of test results, and as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has rejected Theranos’ plan of correction and considers sanctions, we have carefully considered our relationship with Theranos and believe it is in our customers’ best interests to terminate our partnership,” said Brad Fluegel, Walgreens Senior Vice President and Chief Health Care Commercial Market Development Officer.Walgreens stock climbed 2.3% to 84.36 by the closing bell on the stock market today.Multiple regulatory and health agencies are investigating Theranos over the accuracy of its blood tests.

Bloomberg reported that diagnostics giant Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings (LH) is in preliminary talks to acquire INC.INC's earnings per share grew at a triple-digit pace in six of the past eight quarters.

111,LH,"Analysts expect another solid quarter from INC Research Holdings (INCR) when it reports first-quarter results next week, but much of Wall Street’s focus is on how much longer the contract research organization will remain an independent company.INC’s future came under scrutiny earlier this month when Bloomberg reported the company has been in talks with Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings (LH) about a possible merger.The Bloomberg story, citing unidentified sources, said INC and LabCorp have been in ""preliminary"" talks about a deal, but that the two companies “may choose not to proceed with a transaction.”
"
112,LH,"No further details were provided, and neither company has commented on the matter.Even so, investors perked up when the news hit on April 18. INC’s stock price rose as much as 15% to a record high of 57.11 that day, on heavy volume. Shares later settled down to close at 49.68 -- near where they had been trading before word of a possible merger -- and still are hovering at that level.A deal between INC and LabCorp would make strategic sense for a few reasons, analysts say. For one, both are headquartered in North Carolina: INC in Raleigh, and LabCorp in nearby Burlington.Both companies also operate in the same type of business. INC provides contract research organization services that focus exclusively on Phase I through IV clinical development for the biopharma and medical device industries. LabCorp provides clinical lab tests and procedures through two segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.LabCorp is much the larger of the two, with a market cap of around $9.3 billion vs. about $2.7 billion for INC. LabCorp has been on the lookout for acquisition opportunities as a way of solidifying its position as the nation’s No. 1 diagnostics company, industry watchers say.In an April 21 research report, JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill quoted LabCorp Chief Executive Dave King as saying that ""M&A opportunities are going to be excellent in the next year,"" with targets in both the diagnostics and contract research segments. Last year his company acquired Covance for around $6 billion.""(King) said the priority for Covance is growing the clinical business (which INCR would do),""  said Gill, who covers LabCorp but not INC. ""Management has left open the possibility of doing another significant deal following last year’s Covance acquisition, saying its plan to deleverage further and resume share repurchases in the second half of this year is contingent on M&A opportunities.""Adding more scale in the late-stage contract research business ""would make strategic sense"" for LabCorp and provide needed revenue and cost synergies for the Covance business, Gill added.""We also note INCR has a lot of biotech exposure, which would complement Covance’s heavier focus on pharma,"" he said.At the same time, INC would make a valuable target for any company looking to rapidly expand its business, noted fellow JPMorgan analyst Tycho Peterson, who covers INC.""We expect INC to outgrow industry peers, aided by a diversified global footprint and therapeutic expertise in high-growth segments within clinical development, including (central nervous system), oncology and complex diseases,"" Peterson wrote.Regardless of whether LabCorp or some other industry heavyweight, like Quest Diagnostics (DGX), end up making a bid for INC, the recent rumors only underscore its value as an acquisition target.That value is partly due to INC’s strong financial performance. The company went public in November 2014. Since then, it has delivered four full quarters of double-digit or better earnings per share and revenue growth. That streak is expected to continue at least through 2016.INC is due to report first-quarter results before the open on May 2. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect year-over-year earnings to rise 26% to 53 cents a share and net service revenue to increase 12% to $237.8 million.During 2015's fourth quarter, INC reported earnings of 54 cents a share, topping consensus analyst views by 4 cents. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBITDA, climbed 40% to $56.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 23.4% from 18.9% the previous year.INC’s net service revenue for the quarter rose 13% to $241.4 million, also above expectations. Excluding foreign currency headwinds, net service revenue increased 17% year-over-year. The company also recognizes reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses as a separate revenue source.Meanwhile, INC continues to expand its operation. It has more than doubled its annual revenue over the past four years, and its employee count keeps growing. The company ended 2015 with a staff of 6,400, up from 5,600 at the end of 2014.""We have made significant announcements to our talent acquisition and training and development programs to support our continued growth in a competitive labor market,"" Chief Executive Jamie Macdonald said on a fourth-quarter conference call with analysts.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect INC to report full-year 2016 earnings of $2.37 a share, up 19% from a year earlier. Earnings for 2017 are expected to rise another 17% to $2.77 a share.

Meanwhile, Medicare and private insurers are paying lower reimbursement rates.Lab test outsourcers such as Laboratory Corp. of America (LH) say they can save their hospital clients 15% to 20% because they are more efficient, having sufficient capital and data tools to implement best practices.That's a savings of $3 million to $4 million per year for a community hospital with 300 beds, with a laboratory center that costs $20 million to run, said Steve Rusckowski, CEO of Quest Diagnostics (DGX), a Madison, N.J.-based lab service outsourcing firm.""It's very unusual that we don't have a second, third or fourth conversation (with potential customers) about this topic,"" he said.Quest in recent years has inked contracts to handle lab service for several nonprofit hospital systems, including MemorialCare Health System of Fountain Valley, Calif., and UMass Memorial Medical Center.In general, expectations are bullish for health care outsourcing.Information technology outsourcing in health care is expected to grow 15.5% a year through 2019, with cloud-based service being a big growth area, according to research firm TechNavio.Meanwhile, the outsourcing market for managing medical claims, payment and revenue generation is expected to grow at a solid clip, reaching $10 billion by the end of next year, according to market research firm Black Book.Send Out The BillAmong hospitals with more than 200 beds that outsourced billing, more than 80% saw revenue gains, roughly by 5%, Black Book said.Meanwhile 78% of hospitals with fewer than 200 beds saw their revenue grow by about 7%.Meanwhile, an aging population, more Americans with health insurance and an improving economy are driving the need for more medical staff.San Diego-based AMN Healthcare Services  (AHS), the largest U.S. health care staffing firm, has seen double-digit growth in its staffing segments. AMN also provides recruiting and staffing management services for health care providers that may have many facilities across the country.Earnings growth has accelerated for the past three quarters, from 0% to 79%.Revenue growth has sped up for the past four periods, from -1% to 40%.AMN is growing rapidly due to increased demand from clients, as well as from its own acquisitions.Meanwhile, the flurry of hospital mergers in the past several years can benefit outsourcers when the combined entities inevitably seek to eliminate redundancies.""They have enhanced power to offer a larger contract and get some more substantial savings in return when they outsource,"" said Debbie Wang, an analyst at Morningstar.

144,LH,"With a market capitalization of approximately $20.26 billion, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report) has been benefiting from consistent strategic buyouts, a solid balance sheet and positive demographic trends. However, with the recently implemented PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act) rule, a persistent decline in healthcare utilization rate, softer volume, commercial pricing pressure and cutthroat competition in the niche space are denting the stock’s growth.Pressure on volume due to a difficult macro-economic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Nevertheless, we have observed some changes in the volume trend over the past couple of quarters. In the last reported quarter, volume measured by a number of requisitions increased 2.2% year over year, driven by acquisitions while organic growth remained essentially flat.Per the company, the impact of weather presented a headwind of approximately 60 basis points to volume in first-quarter 2018.We also expect a low level of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives to continuously affect the company’s overall improvement until the economy rebounds.Buoyed by the above mixed trends, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a quick look at the major factors responsible for continuously ailing Quest Diagnostics and also the brighter prospects indicating a near-term recovery.Factors Plaguing Quest DiagnosticsComing back to PAMA, the year opened with the first quarter operating under the clinical IP schedule, accounting for approximately 12% of the company’s revenues last year. The company still expected the impact of the final rates under PAMA to cause an approximate 4% revenue reduction in 2018 while nearly 10% in both 2019 and 2020 as well.Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition, primarily from Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), other commercial laboratories and hospitals. Hospitals control an estimated 60% of the diagnostic test market compared with Quest Diagnostic’s 15% share.While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service including accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs, primarily on the basis of service quality.Why Should You Hold?We are optimistic about Quest Diagnostics’ consistent efforts to refocus on core diagnostic information services business and a disciplined capital deployment. The company’s latest acquisitions and collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers.We are also upbeat about the company entering into an expanded long-term strategic partnership agreement with UnitedHealthcare, a business of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to operate as a preferred national laboratory for all the company’s members starting Jan 1, 2019. This extended pact will provide in-network access to Quest Diagnostics’ complete portfolio of laboratory services to more than 48 million eligible members.Under the widened tie-up, the companies are going to join forces on a variety of value-based programs. Further, Quest Diagnostics’ merger and acquisition activity is being executed successfully. Recently, the company completed the acquisition of MedXM, a leading national provider of home-based health risk assessments related services.In 2017, the company announced seven acquisition activities, which should help exceed Quest Diagnostics’ long-term M&A objective of 1-2% top-line growth for 2018. Among these buyouts, worth noting is the company’s recently-closed buyout of the Cleveland HeartLab from Cleveland Clinic.Price PerformanceQuest Diagnostics has outperformed its industry in a month's time.

146,LH,"It takes just one super deal to turn the odds in your favor. Did the clinical laboratory services market just spin the wheel of fortune? Let’s see what happened.On May 24, Quest Diagnostics announced an expanded long-term strategic partnership agreement with UnitedHealthcare, a business of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to operate as a preferred national laboratory for all of the company’s members starting Jan 1, 2019. This expanded agreement will provide in-network access to Quest Diagnostics’ complete portfolio of laboratory services to more than 48 million eligible members.Under the expanded tie-up, the companies are going to join forces on a variety of value-based programs. At the same time, Laboratory Corporation of Americas Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp, has been hogging the spotlight on the news of the company losing its exclusive right to serve UnitedHealthcare post Jan 1. Meanwhile, LabCorp announced the extension of its partnership agreement with Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) the next day. Per the expanded agreement, LabCorp will serve as a preferred national laboratory for almost all of the company’s members starting next year. The extended agreement will provide in-network access to LabCorp’s complete portfolio of laboratory services to over 20 million eligible members.According to CNBC, Quest Diagnostics will lose its exclusivity to serve as a preferred laboratory partner to Aetna’s members.Notably, both the diagnostic testing lab stalwarts’ stocks have been trading higher than the S&P 500 index since May 24.Per Morgan Stanley’s analyst Ricky Goldwasser, these deals will result in the elimination of the long-time problem of contract overhang and will thereby result in a cognitive environment for pricing in the near term. He also commented ""... Labs are relative safe havens within the health care services sector.""Conforming to this idea, we believe that there are other factors which work as growth drivers for the clinical laboratory services market. Let’s delve deeper.Here we need to consider MarketsandMarkets data which shows that the global clinical laboratory services market is headed to reach a worth of $146.41 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 5.2% between 2017 and 2022.Most of the analysts believe an aging demography is primarily acting in favor of this. Per an article commissioned by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, 8.5% of the global population is aged 65 years and above.Strengthening emerging markets are also going to provide impetus to the burgeoning global clinical laboratory services market. According to an article published in Report Buyer, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will be the largest market for the clinical laboratory services between 2017 and 2022. Growing disposable income among the middle-class people along with increasing access to state-of-the art clinical laboratory technologies will drive the upside.According to some analysts, technological advancements in the form of integrated workflow management systems and database management tools are helping the companies expand their sample processing ability every year. Meanwhile, enhancements in laboratory testing technology will continue to boost demand for laboratory services.Stocks to Watch Out ForHere we highlight three companies that are striving to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the clinical laboratory services market.Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report): Based in Redwood City, CA, Genomic Health develops and markets genomic-based clinical laboratory services that analyze the underlying biology of cancer, enabling physicians and patients to make treatment-related decisions.This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 226.4%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Secaucus, NJ, Quest Diagnostics is a leading provider of diagnostic testing information and services in the United States and globally.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average earnings beat being 3.4%.DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Denver, CO, DaVita is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure or end stage renal disease. It also provides related lab services in outpatient dialysis centers.This Zacks Rank #3 company has delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 0.9%.PAMA: A DownerLike all other markets, the clinical lab space has its own issues to deal with.Changes in governmental regulations may have a significant impact on company operations. In the last couple of years, several reimbursement issues have been hurting revenues. Majority of the companies are concerned about the CMS' (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) latest Medicare reimbursement reduction as a result of the implementation of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA).This has been a major dampener for testing laboratories. As said by LabCorp earlier, the new PAMA rates published by CMS do not reflect the intent of Congress when it directed CMS to implement market-based Medicare rates for lab testing. The statement says, “The process CMS followed to determine these rates was fatally flawed and failed to account for significant segments of the lab market by excluding 99 percent of all U.S. labs from reporting data and limiting data collection to 1 percent of laboratories, dominated by independent labs.”However, per an article on GenomeWeb, companies like Myriad Genetics (MYGN  -  Free Report), Veracyte and Luminex Corporation among others, which have their own proprietary tests, will for obvious reasons enjoy an edge and more control over pricing.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

This alliance will help bringing advanced lab services in accountable care arrangements between UnitedHealthcare and more than 1,100 hospitals plus 110,000 physicians.Progress on Strategic CollaborationsSignificantly, LabCorp has fortified its footprint in the diagnostics space through both organic and inorganic means plus plans to coordinate with leading companies and academic institutions to build a wider portfolio of tests.The company continues to increase its scale and competencies in clinical laboratory medicine via acquisitions ranging from routine capabilities to highly esoteric testing. Among its recent associations, LabCorp has formed one multi-year, comprehensive laboratory teamwork with Appalachian Regional Healthcare. Also, under the new agreement with Interpace Diagnostics, Dianon Pathology, a member of the LabCorp Specialty Testing Group, the company will perform the thyroid biopsy analysis.Additionally, worth mentioning are the company’s two major health systems partnerships, Mount Sinai Health System and PAML, respectively. PAML is a Pacific Northwest-based market-leading reference and outreach laboratory. Per LabCorp, these anchor health systems will gradually emerge as research hubs, improving access to trials as well as Covance's site activation and investigator besides patient recruitment capabilities.Other recent coalitions include a strategic partnership with Thermo Fisher (TMO  -  Free Report), which enabled the launch of Thermo Fisher Oncomine Dx target panel for non-small cell lung cancer patients.

149,LH,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is LH due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsLabCorp reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.78, up 30.5% from the year-ago quarter. The bottom line also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.3%.On a reported basis, LabCorp’s net earnings came in at $1.67 per share as compared to $1.75 in the year-ago period.Revenues for the first quarter increased 18% year over year to $2.85 billion. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78 billion. The year-over-year rise in revenues was owing to 13.4% growth from acquisitions, organic growth of 3.2% and a benefit of approximately 150 basis points from foreign currency translation.Quarter Under ReviewLabCorp reports under two operating segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.In the reported quarter, LabCorp Diagnostics reported revenues of $1.77 billion, up 8% year over year, fueled by tuck-in acquisitions, organic volume (measured by requisitions) and a gain from foreign currency translation of roughly 30 basis points. This was partially offset by lower Medicare reimbursement as a result of the implementation of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) and the impact from adverse weather.The company reported a 6.9% rise in total volume (measured by requisition) and a 0.7% increase in revenue per requisition in the concerning quarter.Covance Drug Development reported a 39.3% rise in revenues to $1.08 billion in the first quarter. This upside was primarily on the back of acquisitions, organic growth and the foreign currency translation benefit of nearly 390 basis points.Gross margin deteriorated 211 bps to 27.3% in the reported quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 3.3% year over year to $382 million. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 190 bps from the year-ago quarter to 13.4% on a 16.3% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses to $397 million.LabCorp exited the first quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $361.8 million compared with $316.7 million at the end of 2017.

On Apr 24, 2018, the board authorized an increase in LabCorp’s share repurchase program to a total of $1 billion.OutlookLabCorp has updated its 2018 guidance considering the adoption of ASC 606.Revenue growth is expected to remain in the band of 10-12% from 2017 (earlier projected band was 9.5-11.5%) including a likely improvement of 90 bps (from projection of 60 bps improvement earlier) from a foreign currency translation. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year revenues is pegged at $11.48 billion.Adjusted EPS projection for 2018 however, has been kept unchanged in the range of $11.30-$11.70. However, this guidance now includes the projected negative impact of 20 cents to 30 cents for the full year 2018 from ASC 606, offset by strong first quarter results and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year. The consensus mark of $11.55 for the metric falls within the guided range.Free cash flow has been anticipated within $1.1-$1.2 billion, growth in the band of 0-9.1% from the prior year (unchanged).How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to seven lower.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, LH has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A.

We are upbeat about the continued strength in Invisalign volumes. In North America, the company continued to witness an expanding GP Dentist customer base along with sustained strength in Invisalign utilization by orthodontists. We are also encouraged by the solid performance in the EMEA and Asia Pacific markets.Within Scanners and Service, the company witnessed rapid uptake of iTero scanners across all geographies.

Further, foreign currency headwinds and intense competition have been dampening the company’s performance since long.Baxter’s cyclophosphamide performance over the last five years lacked luster.

155,LH,"On Jan 2, we issued an updated research report on LabCorp (LH  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).This Burlington, NC-based healthcare diagnostics company, providing comprehensive clinical laboratory services and end-to-end drug development support, has been grappling with multiple issues of late. Economic uncertainties, including a challenging volume environment for testing laboratories and softness in utilization, are looming headwinds for LabCorp.Changes in governmental regulations had a significant impact on LabCorp’s operations. The company raised certain objections in response to the Sep 22 publication by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS) mandated by the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA).Also, if the latest clinical lab fee schedule draft by CMS gets implemented without any amendment in favor of testing laboratories, the projected growth at LabCorp’s Covance, the benefit from Chiltern, the benefit from PAML and Mount Sinai and the Covance LaunchPad process will all be adversely impacted.Moreover, LabCorp faces intense competition from other commercial laboratories and hospitals. In a $55-billion U.S. lab market, hospitals control an estimated 55% of the diagnostic test market, compared to LabCorp’s 10% share. While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including accurate testing results. As a result, LabCorp and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs primarily on the basis of quality of service.On a positive note, LabCorp's Diagnostics business continues to remain strong on improving price, mix, acquisition and favorable foreign exchange. Also, after several quarters of dull show, Covance Drug Development reported strong growth on the back of Chiltern acquisition, strong organic growth and favorable foreign currency translation. Also, over the past six months LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 7.1% as against the industry’s 0.5% fall.  Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks from the same space are Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and Integer Holdings Corporation (ITGR  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

We are also impressed by the strong strategic and financial goals which the combined entity expects to reach.However, the company’s declining sales at its Knees, Hips and other segments at CER disappoint.

157,LH,"Healthcare diagnostic majors and arch-rivals Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report) and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp are on the same page regarding the much contentious topic of Protecting Access to Medicare Act (“PAMA”) on clinical lab fee schedule. Recently, both the companies as members of the American Clinical Laboratory Association (“ACLA”) have come forward to support a lawsuit filed by ACLA against the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). The lawsuit charged that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), operating under the purview of HHS, have failed to follow a congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system.Per the lawsuit claims, CMS ignored the Congress directives stated under PAMA and instituted a highly flawed data reporting process of setting market rates in advance.This prohibited the overwhelming majority of laboratories from reporting the private payer data used to determine Medicare rates for lab tests. The move has instead resulted in new Medicare lab rates, which are not market-specific. Hence, the entire process clearly demonstrates CMS’ failure to protect access to laboratory services for Medicare beneficiaries.Per the press release from LabCorp, if the new rates are allowed to come into effect, it will affect the Medicare beneficiaries as well as disrupt the healthcare system. Per Quest diagnostics, “this flawed process could cause serious financial harm to potentially thousands of hospitals, independent and physician office laboratories and make it harder for Medicare beneficiaries to get access to medical testing, particularly in remote rural areas and in nursing homes that depend on laboratory testing services”. Earlier during the third quarter earnings release, both LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics had issued certain objections in response to the Sep 22 publication by CMS on the proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS) mandated by PAMA. Per the companies, only 1% of all laboratories submitted data and over 99% of hospitals and physician office laboratories were prevented from reporting their rates.The above-mentioned 1% of laboratories majorly denoted independent labs. To convey the severity of the situation in clear terms, Quest Diagnostics stated that based on data submitted through CMS, the company alone represented nearly 40% of all the market data that CMS collected.Among other possibly badly hit clinical laboratories, thanks to the latest CMS mandate on clinical lab fee schedule, two names emerge as DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report). While Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp and PerkinElmer carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), DaVita has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

Revenues were well ahead of the company’s guided range of $400-$410 million.Per management, the top line was driven by a 30.8% year-over-year increase in Invisalign case shipments to 272,235 in the quarter. The upside was supported by growth in North America and international regions on an expanded customer base and increased utilization along with a solid worldwide teen case growth. Moreover, increased revenues from iTero scanner contributed majorly.Segments in DetailRevenues at the Clear Aligner segment (88.2% of total revenues) soared 36.5% year over year to $385.5 million in the reported quarter, primarily driven by continued strong Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographical regions.In the first quarter, Invisalign case shipments amounted to 272,235, up 30.8% year over year, aided by growth across all regions as well as expansion of customer base. During the quarter, Align Technology Invisalign cases were shipped to 46,805 doctors worldwide, of which 27,105 were to North America and 19,700 to international regions.Align Technology, Inc.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2018 EPS is $1.03 on revenues of $452.4 million. While the earnings estimate is within the projected range, the estimate for revenues falls below the same.Our TakeAlign Technology ended the first quarter on a solid note. We are upbeat about the continued strength in Invisalign volumes. In North America, the company continued to witness an expanding GP Dentist customer base along with sustained strength in Invisalign utilization by orthodontists. We are also encouraged by the solid performance in the EMEA and Asia Pacific markets.Within Scanners and Service, the company witnessed rapid uptake of iTero scanners across all geographies. Moreover, the company continues to see increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Further, Align Technology recently announced the receipt of China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) approval for the commercial launch of the iTero Element intraoral scanner.We are also upbeat about the company expanding the iTero Element portfolio with the lauch of iTero Element 2 and iTero Element Flex scanners in the United States and majority of European countries, covering France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.Align Technology has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchases and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, the company is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward expansion of geographical presence and portfolio.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAlign Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season, are Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

159,LH,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), or LabCorp, reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.78, up 30.5% from the year-ago quarter. The bottom line also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.3%.On a reported basis, LabCorp’s net earnings came in at $1.67 per share as compared to $1.75 in the year-ago period.Revenues for the first quarter increased 18% year over year to $2.85 billion. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78 billion. The year-over-year rise in revenues was owing to 13.4% growth from acquisitions, organic growth of 3.2% and a benefit of approximately 150 basis points from foreign currency translation.Quarter Under ReviewLabCorp reports under two operating segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.In the reported quarter, LabCorp Diagnostics reported revenues of $1.77 billion, up 8% year over year, fueled by tuck-in acquisitions, organic volume (measured by requisitions) and a gain from foreign currency translation of roughly 30 basis points. This was partially offset by lower Medicare reimbursement as a result of the implementation of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) and the impact from adverse weather.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteThe company reported a 6.9% rise in total volume (measured by requisition) and a 0.7% increase in revenue per requisition in the concerning quarter.Covance Drug Development reported a 39.3% rise in revenues to $1.08 billion in the first quarter. This upside was primarily on the back of acquisitions, organic growth and the foreign currency translation benefit of nearly 390 basis points.Gross margin deteriorated 211 bps to 27.3% in the reported quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 3.3% year over year to $382 million. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 190 bps from the year-ago quarter to 13.4% on a 16.3% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses to $397 million.LabCorp exited the first quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $361.8 million compared with $316.7 million at the end of 2017. Operating cash flow at the end of the first quarter was $154.7 million, down 31.5% from $225.9 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow came in at $82.8 million in this period, down 46.5% from the year-ago period.During the quarter under discussion, the company returned $75 million to shareholders via share repurchases. On Apr 24, 2018, the board authorized an increase in LabCorp’s share repurchase program to a total of $1 billion.OutlookLabCorp has updated its 2018 guidance considering the adoption of ASC 606.Revenue growth is expected to remain in the band of 10-12% from 2017 (earlier projected band was 9.5-11.5%) including a likely improvement of 90 bps (from projection of 60 bps improvement earlier) from a foreign currency translation. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year revenues is pegged at $11.48 billion.Adjusted EPS projection for 2018 however, has been kept unchanged in the range of $11.30-$11.70. However, this guidance now includes the projected negative impact of 20 cents to 30 cents for the full year 2018 from ASC 606, offset by strong first quarter results and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year. The consensus mark of $11.55 for the metric falls within the guided range.Free cash flow has been anticipated within $1.1-$1.2 billion, growth in the band of 0-9.1% from the prior year (unchanged).Our TakeLabCorp posted a strong first-quarter performance with adjusted earnings and revenues both exceeding the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong year-over-year growth in both earnings and revenues were encouraging. LabCorp Diagnostics business was solid on the back of increasing acquisitions, organic volume expansion and a favorable foreign exchange scenario.Also, after several quarters of dull performance, Covance Drug Development has been reporting sturdy growth over the past few of terms. This uptrend was primarily owing to strategic acquisitions, robust organic growth and a positive foreign currency translation. The 2018 guidance also looks promising.We believe that with the integration of newer acquisitions, LabCorp is perfectly positioned to drive long-term profitable growth through a combination of world-class diagnostics, drug development expertise and knowledge services.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include Abaxis, Inc.

160,LH,"On Nov 28, we issued an updated research report on Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last six months, LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry. Over this period, The stock has gained 9.1% compared with the industry’s rise of 5.4% during the period. Notably, LabCorp’s third-quarter earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A strong year-over-year increase in both earnings and revenues was encouraging too.LabCorp Diagnostics business was strong on the back of improving price, mix, acquisition and a favorable foreign exchange scenario.We are also encouraged by the successful closure of the Chiltern International Group’s buyout, a specialty contract research organization. Chiltern is a major partner of LabCorp, serving the top 20 biopharma segments and helping the company focus on the high-growth emerging and mid-market biopharma segments. Following this takeover, the company’s Covance Drug Development reported strong growth in the third quarter after lying low for several quarters. This apart, effective organic flourish and a favorable foreign currency translation boosted the segment’s performance during the period.Notably, LabCorp is steadily progressing on its three-pronged strategy to drive growth. First, the company strongly focuses on research and development in collaboration with academic institutions in order to gain traction in the growing lab testing market.Secondly, LabCorp increasingly deploys its integrated testing capabilities, industry leading science and innovative technology offerings to establish strategic partnerships with providers of medical testing. Moreover, investors are looking forward to a long-standing strategic collaboration with 23andMe, which has already demonstrated an impressive growth trajectory.Finally, LabCorp's core diagnostic scheme is based on innovation in data integration and in tools to support enhanced connectivity, reporting and decision support. The company also lays emphasis on extending its core testing capabilities beyond the traditional health care setting.On the flip side, the current economic uncertainty including a challenging volume environment for testing laboratories and utilization weaknesses are looming large as headwinds.Additionally, the company operates in a stiff competitive landscape. Meanwhile, apprehensions about a tough reimbursement scenario further intensify concerns for the company.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) and Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report).

161,LH,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp recently announced that Agilent’s Dako pathology division’s development — the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay — is now available in the United States for new expanded use. Per LabCorp, this test has got the U.S. approval to be used as a complementary diagnostic with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) OPDIVO (nivolumab) for two new indications — metastatic urothelial carcinoma or bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck — respectively.It is encouraging to note that tests of the clinical studies that supported approval of the new indications for the assay were performed at the company’s Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology laboratory. Per LabCorp, OPDIVO is already approved for the two aforementioned indications without use of the test. However, the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test provides vital information about those patients, who are most likely to respond positively to OPDIVO. Earlier, the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay was approved for use as a complementary diagnostic with OPDIVO to treat certain patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma. At that time too, LabCorp’s central clinical trials laboratory was the only provider of testing to support the clinical trial for the 2015 approval of the non-squamous NSCLC treatment indication. Per the company, this successfully demonstrates how the combined capabilities of LabCorp’s clinical laboratory infrastructure and Covance’s central clinical trials laboratory are paving new ways for clinical trials.LabCorp’s consistent efforts to expand in the growing field of complementary and companion diagnostics is gradually fetching unmatched results. Notably, the company has adopted this strategy to work closely with health systems that have expressed interest in becoming preferred partners in LabCorp and Covance’s clinical trials. In this regard, the company has signed agreements with several major health systems recently. Earlier this year, the company entered into an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific to join its NGS Companion Diagnostics Center of Excellence program. It has also inked an exclusive deal to distribute OmniSeq’s immune profile and tumor profiling tests. Within Diagnostics, LabCorp has made a strong progress with consumer and patient-facing initiatives. The company’s LabCorp-Walgreens collaboration is off to a terrific start with respect to patient volumes, Net Promoter Scores and patient feedback riding on years’ experience at these sites.Within drug development business, the company is focused on driving future profitable growth through expanded solutions and enhanced operational capabilities. The acquisition of Chiltern closed on Sep 1, is significantly strengthening LabCorp’s strategic position in clinical development as well as accelerating revenue and profit growth within Covance.  LabCorp was trading above the broader industry over the last six months.  The stock has gained 8.1% compared with the industry’s 4.7% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Two better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report), both sporting  a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

162,LH,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) stock or LabCorp into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, LabCorp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, LabCorp’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that LabCorp has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.6, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for LabCorp stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, LabCorp has a P/S ratio of about 1.7. This higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. However, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, LH is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, LabCorp currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes LabCorp a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though LabCorp might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D. This gives LH a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat. The current year has seen no estimate revisions in the past sixty days, while the next year estimate has seen one up and three down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has decreased by 0.1% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has inched lower by 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus   Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineLabCorp is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 21% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence.However, with a Zacks Rank #3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

The market seems to be upbeat about the Diagnostics business, which has delivered promising performance over the recent past in spite of persistent softness within the company’s Covance drug development business.We are also encouraged by the successful closure of the acquisition of Chiltern International Group, a specialty contract research organization.Chiltern is a major partner serving the top 20 biopharma segments, helping the company focus on the high-growth emerging and mid-market biopharma segments.  Notably, LabCorp is steadily progressing on its three-pronged strategy to drive growth.

165,LH,"IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2018 results on May 4, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.48%. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 7.3%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Catalysts IDEXX is expected to continue with its gain momentum in the first quarter, courtesy of a strong global rise in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics’ revenues. Last time, this upside was driven by consistent strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumables plus owing to a high-single-digit increase registered in rapid assay sales. Management vouches for this trend to be retained further.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about IDEXX enhancing its commercial capabilities in the United States to maintain recurring revenue growth at CAG Diagnostics. We expect first-quarter results to reflect a rise in productivity as new sales representatives establish fresh customer relationships. Also, we anticipate the company to report exceptional customer retention rates for reference labs as well as instrument consumables in the United States and worldwide.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $460 million for CAG Diagnostics revenues represents a 5.9% improvement from the last-reported quarter.Notably, IDEXX’s 13-14.5% revenue growth projection for the quarter to be reported  highlights its organic gains of 9.5-10.5%. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total quarterly revenues is pegged at $525 million..Other factors predicted to influence IDEXX’s first-quarter results are:We pin considerable hopes on progress in the Water Business, lying on a growth trajectory of late, backed by encouraging test results in the United States as well as benefits drawn from the global go-direct initiatives. Moreover, the business witnessed 16% organic growth last quarter. Management also eyes gains from two favorable regulatory developments pertaining to wastewater in the United States and drinking water in Europe. The company earlier stated that it is perfectly on track for a continued high-single digit organic revenue boost in this business through 2018. The consensus mark for Water revenues stands at $28.3 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter.IDEXX carries on to expand its global footprint. It has been significantly drawing advantages from the bountiful opportunities in the emerging companion animal diagnostics markets. Further, management’s consistent share buybacks underscores its robust free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will bear reflection on first-quarter conference call.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern is the company’s heavy reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors leave a significant impact on the company’s sales of instrument consumables as well as its rapid assay products. Moreover, IDEXX has been witnessing a rise in operating expenses due to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development and expansion in the United States plus internationally.Additionally, a competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX’s performance. Thus, the struggle to gain market traction might be a drag on first-quarter results.Here’s what the quantitative model predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of -0.90% leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:Baxter International Inc.

167,LH,"We are in the thick of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with 251 S&P 500 members having reported their numbers. The current earnings season has seen an above-average proportion of positive surprises, a favorable revision trend for the present and upcoming quarter along with a strong revenue momentum.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies that have reported so far are up 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues. Of the total, 80.5% beat earnings and 78.1% surpassed revenue estimates. With 92 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.MedTech Earnings So FarMedical, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to stand out this quarter. The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.This is evident from the results of MedTech heavyweights like Laboratory Corporation Of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report). The companies ended the fourth quarter on a solid note with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.An upbeat FY18 guidance also instills confidence. In this regard, LabCorp’s adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 is in the range of $11.30-$11.70. Further, Becton, Dickinson and Company expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of $10.85-$11.00, up from the previous $10.55-$10.65.For the fourth quarter, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 6.6% on 5.7% revenue growth.CAH or HOLX: Which Will See Stronger Earnings?Let’s take a look at two major MedTech stocks Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report) and Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) slated to release their quarterly reports on Feb 8:Cardinal Health is scheduled to release results before the market opens. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues is pegged at $34.66 billion, up 4.6% year over year. With a diverse product portfolio, Cardinal Health is one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.14, down 14.9% year over year. The company faces the risk of losing considerable business in case of loss of a major customer, which will severely impair the bottom line. In fact, Cardinal Health announced the loss of a large mail-order customer, Prime Therapeutics. This dented revenues at the company’s Specialty and Pharmaceutical Distribution segment in the last quarter.Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteMoreover, our quantitative model does not conclusively show a beat for Cardinal Health. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Cardinal Health has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -0.70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. (read more: What's in Store for Cardinal Health in Q2 Earnings?).Hologic is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, after market close. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is at 49 cents, down 5.8% on a year-over-year basis. The Diagnostics segment is expected to record revenues of $285 million, down 12.3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $279 million shows a 14.2% decline year over year. This can be blamed on the estimated loss from the divested blood screening franchise. Also, the company has been seeing weak sales of cytology and perinatal products of late.On the bright side, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $787.7 million, up 7.3% year over year. The company is expected to see stellar performance by Molecular Diagnostics, a major sub-segment of Diagnostics. In the United States, the company is expected to gain from an expanding market and utilization of fully automated Panther system.Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hologic, Inc. QuoteOur quantitative model indicates an earnings beat for Hologic this quarter as it has a favorable combination of an Earnings ESP of +1.42% and a Zacks Rank #3.

168,LH,"Markets closed higher on Friday, the last trading session of the first half of the year, as energy stocks rallied. However, trade war fears saw all three major indexes ending lower for the week. Friday also marked the end of the month, the second quarter and the first half of the year.  Markets saw mixed performance during this period.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.2%, to close at 24,271.41. The S&P 500 rose 0.8% to close at 2,718.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,510.30, increasing 0.9%. A total of 7.16 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.28 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.51-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow gained 55.36 points, with shares of Nike, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) soaring as much as 11.1% to touch an all-time high. The company reported a return to growth in North America. Nike has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The S&P 500 added 2.06 points, lead by a rally in energy stocks. The blue-chip index rose as much as 200 points at one point but shed most of the gains in the afternoon. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) gained 0.7%, on concerns of oversupply, while the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) increased 0.4%. The tech heavy Nasdaq gained 6.62 points.For the week, the Nasdaq lost 2.37%, while the Dow and S&P 500 lost 1.26% and 1.33% respectively. The Dow declined for the third consecutive week, the first time in more than two years.Energy Stocks Gain, Late Selloff Hit Bank Stocks Energy and materials stocks helped markets on Friday, which saw the Dow increase as much as 293.47 points at one point. However, a huge selloff in banks stocks erased early gains. Bank stocks performed well almost throughout the day after the Fed announced the second round of the stress test results. This saw most major U.S. lenders announcing high dividend payouts and share buybacks, which saw bank shares rallying.However, a late session selloff saw markets shedding the initial gains. Shares of Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) lost 1.7%, 0.7%, 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively.Monthly RoundupMost of the month saw volatility in markets with stocks returning mixed performances. Trade war fears, which have gripped markets for quite some time, took its toll on stocks throughout the month. President Donald Trump once again threatened to impose tariffs of $200 billion worth of goods imported from China, which led top huge selloffs.June was also an eventful month that saw the historic meeting between Trump and North Korea’s premier Kim Jong-un. However, markets had high expectations from the meeting but not much impact was seen with stocks tumbling the day after the meeting.Moreover, as anticipated the Fed increased interest rates by 0.25% and hinted at two more hikes by the end of this year. Also, the Fed announced the annual stress test results for banks and gave OK to 32 of the 35 biggest banks in the United States to raise their dividends and buy back shares. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 gained 0.9% and 0.5% for the month, while the Dow lost 0.6%.Quarterly Round UpThe second quarter was marked by tremendous volatility in markets. Trade war fears, which had started taking its toll on stocks in the end of first quarter, escalated in the second quarter. While Trump continued to create pressure on China to decrease the trade deficit by imposing tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports, China too imposed retaliatory tariffs.This dented investors’ confidence leading to huge sell offs. Tech stocks, which have been driving markets for quite some time, too weren’t spared with all major tech gains suffering. However, a series of meetings between U.S. and China to reach a possible agreement saw trade war fears easing for some time, resulting in a rally in stocks.However, the quarter again ended with geopolitical tensions escalating as Trump continued with his tariff threats.  Despite trade related concerns, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow gained 2.9%, 6.3% and 0.7%, respectively, for the quarter.Half-Yearly Round UpAfter an outstanding 2017, markets touched record highs in January. However, the joyride came to a halt in February, when Trump for the first time announced his plans of imposing additional tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from China. Things soon took the shape of a trade war, as China too threatened to retaliate.The EU, Canada and Mexico too opposed Trump’s plans of imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum. After the United Stated finally imposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese goods, China retaliated with tariffs worth $50 billion worth of U.S. goods. This raised fears of a trade war making investors jittery and leading to huge selloffs.Moreover, tech stocks, which have been on a rally since 2017 also took a hit after Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) got embroiled in a data-misuse scandal that affected more than 80 billion users. This saw not all tech stocks plummeting on fears of regulatory clampdown.That said, the U.S. economy showed signs of bullishness. The unemployment rate hit a 18-year low. The Fed, as expected, raised interest rates twice and hinted at another two hikes by the end of this year. The last week of the first half of the year also saw U.S. inflation rate hitting a six-year high. The Fed preferred price gauge, PCE, rose 2.3% from the year ago, the most in six years.Stocks That Made HeadlinesBHP Board Approves South Flank Project to Replace YandiLaboratory Corporation of Americas Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp, recently collaborated with Royal Philips (PHG  -  Free Report).

169,LH,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Laboratory Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.5. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Laboratory Corporation’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 15.3) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Laboratory Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Laboratory Corporation’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Laboratory Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 1.6. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Laboratory Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes LH a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Laboratory Corporation is just 1.7, a level that is noticeably lower than the industry average of 2.2. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.9, which is somewhat better than the industry average of 12.8. Clearly, LH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Laboratory Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B. This gives LH a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days and four lower, while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and two downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 1.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus  Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineLaboratory Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 32% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

170,LH,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp recently announced the successful closure of the acquisition of Chiltern International Group Limited, a specialty CRO (contract research organization). Earlier, the company had entered into a definitive agreement with Chiltern’s shareholders to purchase the company for an all-cash transaction valued at roughly $1.2 billion.LabCorp expects Chiltern to generate 2017 revenues of roughly $550 million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of around $95 million. Excluding transaction related one-time costs and cost synergies, LabCorp expects this deal to boost adjusted earnings and free cash flow in the first year and help earn cost of capital by the third year.Post acquisition, Chiltern will form part of LabCorp’s Covance Drug Development segment. Per management, Chiltern will be a major partner serving the top 20 biopharma segments and helping LabCorp focus on the high-growth emerging and mid-market biopharma segments. Per LabCorp, the buyout is expected to strengthen its position in innovative diagnostics and drug development solutions.We encouragingly note that the new combined entity will have approximately 11,100 employees in the Americas — 7,100 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and 2,400 in the Asia Pacific.LabCorp has been consistently on the headlines owing to the Chiltern buyout deal. Earlier, the company had announced that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has granted its request for early termination of the waiting period for Chiltern’s buyout under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act).Moreover, apart from the substantial buyouts like Covance, LabCorp has been consistently enhancing and adding capabilities via strategic mergers. In this regard, the company recently announced plans to acquire the analytical testing services business of ChromaDex Corporation (CDXC  -  Free Report). The company also announced the renewal and extension of agreement with Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. (IDXG  -  Free Report) aimed at boosting its cancer portfolio.Moreover, over the last three months, LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry. Over this period, the stock has rallied 12.6% as against the industry’s 2.6% decline. We believe the Chiltern buyout will help the stock scale higher. Zacks Rank & Key PickLabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked medical stock is Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Edwards Lifesciences has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.2%.

171,LH,"On Aug 28, we issued an updated research report on Burlington, NC-based Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp. The company is a major player in healthcare diagnostics space, providing comprehensive clinical laboratory services and end-to-end drug development support.Last three months, LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has surged 10.6% as against the industry’s 1.2% loss during this period. Despite the continued dull performance within the company’s Covance drug development business, the market is upbeat about the Diagnostics business which has successfully demonstrated a solid show over the recent past.Although Covance Drug Development’s financial performance was down year over year in the recently reported second-quarter 2017, the company is currently on track to achieve its target of $100 million in cost synergies through the three-year period ending in 2017. It has also completed the remaining consolidation of central lab facilities in Europe and the United States.Notably, the company’s strategic focus on women’s health and reproductive genetics, besides the acquisition of Sequenom, a leader in non-invasive prenatal testing, has reenergized its larger genetic testing portfolio within Diagnostics. Also the market is looking forward to the long-standing strategic collaboration with 23andMe, which has already demonstrated an impressive growth trajectory, providing further strategic collaboration opportunities.On the flip side, an unfavorable foreign exchange remains a drag of late. The reduced guidance for 2017 also fails to indicate chances of any respite soon. There is also apprehension about a tough reimbursement scenario which the company is already facing to some degree.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71 billion by a close margin.The year-over-year rise in net revenues was owing to 10% growth from acquisitions, organic growth (net revenue growth minus revenues from acquisitions for the first twelve months after the close of each acquisition) of 2.6% and a benefit of approximately 60 basis points from foreign currency translation.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Net revenues for the year 2017 were $10.21 billion, up 8.2% over the preceding year’s number. The metric is also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.19 billion by 0.2%.Quarter Under ReviewLabCorp reports under two operating segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.In the reported quarter, LabCorp Diagnostics reported net revenues of $1.82 billion, up 8.6% year over year, fueled by tuck-in acquisitions, organic volume (measured by requisitions excluding requisitions from acquisitions for the first 12 months after the completion of each acquisition) and a gain from foreign currency translation of roughly 30 basis points. The company reported a 6.6% rise in total volume (measured by requisition) and a 1.8% increase in revenue per requisition in the concerning quarter.After several quarters of drag in sales, Covance Drug Development reported a 23.8% rise in net revenues to $886.1 million in the fourth quarter.

Adjusted operating income declined 3.6% year over year to $328.6 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year revenues is pegged at $11.06 billion.Adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 has been projected in the range of $11.30-$11.70. The consensus mark of $10.67 for the metric falls below the guided range.Free cash flow has been anticipated within $1.1-$1.2 billion, growth in the band of 0-9.1% from the prior year.Our TakeLabCorp posted a mixed fourth-quarter performance with adjusted earnings topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate and net revenues falling short of the mark. On a positive note, strong year-over-year growth in both earnings and revenues were encouraging. LabCorp Diagnostics business was solid on the back of increasing acquisitions, organic volume expansion and a favorable foreign exchange scenario.Also, after several quarters of dull performance, Covance Drug Development has been reporting sturdy growth over the past couple of terms. This uptrend was primarily owing to the Chiltern takeover, robust organic growth and a positive foreign currency translation. The 2018 guidance also looks promising.We believe that with the integration of newer acquisitions, LabCorp is perfectly positioned to drive long-term profitable growth through a combination of world-class diagnostics, drug development expertise and knowledge services.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

174,LH,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has taken center stage, with 251 S&P 500 members having reported their numbers. The season has turned out to be favorable so far, especially on the revenue front. A sturdy revenue momentum was witnessed in the season, above-average proportion of positive surprises along with favorable revisions trend for the present and the upcoming quarters.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies that have reported their results, are up 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues. Of the total companies, 80.5% beat earnings and 78.1% surpassed revenue estimates. With 92 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.Medical, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to fare impressively. For the fourth quarter, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 6.6% on 5.7% revenue growth. Let us take a look at the major factors that are likely to influence the earnings results of Medical Product companies within the broader Medical universe.Factors Influencing MedTech in Q4Tax BenefitsAs part of the tax overhaul, corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21% from 35%, providing a huge relief for all sectors. Needless to say, the medical device companies cheered the legislation as well.Further, the news of Congress delaying the 2.3% medical-device tax for another two years was a huge boost for industry players and investors. Manufacturers appreciate the delay as it is likely to favor the companies’ R&D activities.Favorable Consumer BehaviorDespite political issues in the healthcare space, the change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the entire U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, rising demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Let’s take a look at four major Medical Product stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Feb 6:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.05 billion, up 4.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is $2.40, up 3% on a year-over-year basis.The quarter is expected to show sluggishness in BD Medical — one of the major revenue components. While this can majorly dampen earnings in the first quarter, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments will help the company generate solid results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BD Medical revenues is pegged at $2.03 billion. This indicates a decline of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.The company’s innovative product pipeline is a key catalyst. A plethora of regulatory approvals in the United States and international markets are expanding the company’s product portfolio.

Considering the bountiful opportunities in this niche space, we believe this is a strategic move by the company.Of late, LabCorp has been taking strategic initiative to specialize tests. It recently started offering a new proprietary ADAMTS13 test to distinguish diseases characterized by life-threatening, acute thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Notably, TMA is relatively rare but serious syndrome. In TMA, small blood vessels develop blood clots, which result in the mechanical destruction of red blood cells.The company also announced the availability of the PreTRM test in the United States. The PreTRM test is developed by Sera Prognostics, Inc.It is the only validated blood test that offers an early and individualized prediction of preterm birth risk in pregnant women.Further, LabCorp announced a significant enhancement to its proprietary VistaSeq Hereditary Cancer portfolio, with ten new test panels focusing on the risk of specific hereditary cancer syndromes.In majority of the last three months, LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry. Over this period, the stock has gained 10.6% as against the industry’s decline of 1.2%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

176,LH,"Healthcare diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp continues to expand through inorganic means. Apart from huge buyouts like Covance, the company is on a steady spree to add complementary capabilities via strategic mergers.Following the company’s announcement to acquire analytical testing services business of ChromaDex Corp. (CDXC  -  Free Report) last week, LabCorp is again on the headlines with the earlier-announced impending acquisition of Chiltern International Group Limited, a specialty CRO (contract research organization).Per the company sources, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has granted its request for early termination of the waiting period for Chiltern’s buyout under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act). The closing of the acquisition is expected on or around Sep 1, 2017 and is still subject to other customary closing conditions.Notably, last month, LabCorp had entered into a definitive agreement with Chiltern’s shareholders to purchase the company for an all-cash transaction value of $1.2 billion approximate. Per LabCorp, the consolidation will strengthen its position in innovative diagnostics and drug development solutions.The buyout of Covance has already demonstrated the value of combining diagnostics with CRO capabilities. With this, LabCorp’s CRO business has grown to nearly $3 billion in annual revenues.Chiltern’s addition is expected to further promote this development and will also provide LabCorp with enhanced capabilities across a broader client base. The combined entity will have approximately 11,100 employees in the Americas — 7,100 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, while 2,400 in Asia-Pacific.With the closure of the transaction, Chiltern will become a part of LabCorp’s Covance segment. The former’s integration will enhance the latter’s offerings. Chiltern will be a major partner serving the top 20 biopharma segments and assist LabCorp to focus on the high-growth emerging and mid-market biopharma segments.Last three months, LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry.

177,LH,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), also known as LabCorp, is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before market opens on Feb 6. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.9%. It has an average earnings beat of 2.3% for the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlaySimilar to last quarter, LabCorp is expected to gain on strength in the LabCorp Diagnostics segment in the fourth quarter  Notably, in the third quarter, revenues at this segment grew primarily banking on favorable price, mix, tuck-in acquisitions and organic volume.After several quarters of a weak show, Covance Drug Development has started to report revenue growth from the third quarter, on the back of the Chiltern acquisition, strong organic growth and favorable foreign currency translation. Chiltern has added highly complementary capabilities to LabCorp’s offerings, including scale expansion in Asia Pacific, broader reach in the fast-growing emerging and mid-tier biopharma customer segment and expertise in oncology drug development. All these factors should continue to benefit LabCorp’s Covance Drug Development topline in the yet-to-be reported quarter as well.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteWe are also looking forward to the company’s latest deal with Agilent to make the latter’s cancer diagnostic test available for expanded use. This development should start to contribute to LabCorp’s top line from the fourth quarter itself. Also the company’s comprehensive laboratory partnership with Capital Health is a positive.As per LabCorp’s earlier-provided guidance for 2017, net revenue is now expected in the band of 8-8.5% year over year. This includes a 10-bps impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $10.19 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to remain in the range of $9.40-$9.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.53 is within the guided range.However, over the last two years, LabCorp has faced several reimbursement issues that have hurt revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). We believe reimbursement pressure will affect the company’s performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.LabCorp has been constantly trying to check the rise in operating expenses, which affected operating margin in the last reported quarter. Chances of a turnaround in the scenario any time soon are slim.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:LabCorp does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for LabCorp is -0.07%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: LabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Myriad Genetics (MYGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.42% and a Zacks Rank #3.Henry Schein (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.09% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

We believe that applications like athenaClinicals, athenaClinicals-Streamlined, athenaInsight, athenaCommunicator, athenaOne, athenaCollector for Hospital and Health Systems and the brand promise of ‘Unbreak Healthcare’ are fortifying its market position in terms of exclusiveness of services provided. A strong client base has been a key catalyst. Business and Services revenues witnessed year-over-year growth while the same in the Implementation and other segment declined.Among major concerns, athenahealth’s EHR solution faces significant competition from the likes of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions and others. Further, athenahealth fell short of its bookings goals in the quarter under review. Deteriorated client retention rates also add to the company’s woes.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are, Baxter International Inc.

183,LH,"Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) recently announced a definitive agreement to buy a leading national provider of home-based health risk assessments and related services — Mobile Medical Examination Service (MedXM). The financial terms of the deal, slated to close in the first quarter of 2018, have been kept under wraps.Based in Santa Ana, CA, MedXM has an extensive national network of more than 1,700 medical professionals. It provides enhanced member satisfaction for health plans, particularly Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid, and also enriched quality of care. Thus, the acquisition will strengthen Quest Diagnostics’ position in extended care and widen its scale and reach in the mobile/home segment as well.Going by data published in a report by Grand View Research, the deals seems to be lucrative as well as strategic. Per the report, the global home healthcare market is likely to see a CAGR of 7.8% between 2014 and 2025. Growth will mainly be driven by factors such as rising old-age demography across the globe, growing need of cost-effective healthcare, rising incidences of chronic diseases and technological advancements in devices.We are also optimistic about the company’s focus on its two-point strategy. According to Quest Diagnostics, its planned divestiture of the Focus Diagnostics products business is part of its strategy to refocus on diagnostic information services. Additionally, several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks have turned out to be major growth drivers in the past. In this regard, we are encouraged by the company’s completion of thebuyout of outreach laboratory service operations of Hartford HealthCare hospitals — The William W. Backus Hospital and The Hospital of Central Connecticut. The company has also completed the acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point in Texas forming a national precision oncology center of expertise. Moreover, the company’s agreement to purchase Shiel Medical Laboratory and plans to acquire the outreach laboratory services business of Cape Cod Healthcare buoy optimism.We are also upbeat about Quest Diagnostics and Clinical Genomics, a major player in the field of colorectal cancer detection, jointly announced FDA clearance of the latter’s InSure ONE. Notably, with the FDA approval, Quest Diagnostics will make InSure ONE available to its broad base of physicians, organized provider groups and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in the United States. InSure ONE is expected to be commercially available in early 2018. This development is in line with Quest Diagnostics’ consistent efforts to grow in cancer diagnostics.The company’s relationship with PeaceHealth has also been fortified. The partnership entails the acquisition of an outreach laboratory as well as a professional laboratory service agreement to manage laboratories at 11 PeaceHealth Medical Centers in Washington State, Oregon and Alaska.Per the company, these tuck-in acquisitions fit well within the ambit of the M&A guidelines. Quest Diagnostics’ takeover plans are consistent with its goal of contributing 1-2% to revenues annually through accretive acquisitions. Thus, we believe this latest buyout will widen the customer base of this leading diagnostic services information provider.Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition in diagnostic testing laboratory space, primarily from Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) and other commercial laboratories and hospitals.  Moreover, in the clinical laboratory market some of the major players are Myriad Genetics (MYGN  -  Free Report) and Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

185,LH,"Healthcare diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp successfully continues to expand through acquisition strategy. Apart from huge buyouts like Covance, the company continues to add complementary capabilities through targeted tuck-in mergers.Latest on the list is the company’s agreement to purchase the analytical testing services business of ChromaDex Corp. (CDXC). The transaction is expected to complete in early September. This newly acquired entity will become part of LabCorp’s Covance Food Solutions business.Notably, ChromaDex is a natural product company working on health, wellness and nutritional ingredients, creating science-based solutions for dietary supplement, food and beverage, skin care, sports nutrition and pharmaceutical products.Although both the companies haven’t disclosed the deal’s financial terms through press release, per a report by American City Business Journals, the deal value has been fixed at $8.5 million. Per this report, “Covance will buy the analytical testing business for $7.5 million. Under the agreement, ChromaDex is also able to receive an earnout payment of up to $1 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.”It is important to make a note of LabCorp’s $5.6 billion mega buyout of Covance by virtue of which, the company is full on force to expand a range of diagnostic offerings and create a new industry leader in both laboratory testing and CRO (contract research organization) spaces, slated to act as a leading provider of medical testing besides operating as a premier full-service drug development organization.Per the company, Covance Drug Development is the only CRO, providing full spectrum of drug development capabilities — from research to real-world evidence studies — creating commercial and scientific advantage for LabCorp’s partners.Apart from Covance, another recent significant buyout is Sequenom, a prominent player in the field of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for reproductive health. Sequenom’s NIPT and genetic testing capabilities has further added an impetus to LabCorp’s extensive women’s health test menu. This inclusion has also expanded the company’s geographic reach both domestically and internationally (particularly in the EU and Asia-Pacific region).In May, the company acquired Pathology Associates Medical Laboratories (PAML) from former owners Providence Health & Services (Providence) and Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI). PAML is one of the nation’s premier medical reference laboratories and a healthcare solutions company. All these acquisitions are consistent with the company’s efforts to strengthen foothold in the personalized diagnostics testing market.Last three months, LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry. Over this period, the stock has gained 9.2% as against the industry’s 1.1% loss.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

186,LH,"Leading healthcare diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp recently inked a distribution agreement with Roswell Park Cancer Institute’s molecular diagnostics subsidiary, OmniSeq, Inc.Per the deal terms, LabCorp will distribute OmniSeq’s Immune Report Card and OmniSeq Comprehensive clinical assays across the United States and outside.The company will get an exclusive right to distribute these OmniSeq tests to U.S.-based physicians through Integrated Oncology, a member of the LabCorp Specialty Testing Group, and globally to biopharmaceutical customers via its Covance Drug Development arm.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price  Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings price | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteAlso, the chief scientific officer of LabCorp Diagnostics, Marcia Eisenberg, will join OmniSeq’s board of directors. Plus, LabCorp has plans to participate in OmniSeq’s Series B financing round. This financing will be used to conduct OmniSeq’s ongoing retrospective and prospective clinical trials as well as to generate further evidence of the clinical utility of OmniSeq’s comprehensive genomic and immune profiling services.Notably, Immune Report Card is a comprehensive immune profiling test, designed to inform oncologists regarding checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) treatment decisions. This combines results for all common biomarker assays relevant to checkpoint inhibitors as well as other informative analyses. Per OmniSeq, this assessment will provide a comprehensive immune profile to help in identifying 20-40% patients, who are likely to respond to CPI monotherapy.On the other hand, OmniSeq Comprehensive assay is a 144-gene, pan-cancer, next-generation sequencing tumor profiling diagnostic panel. It helps oncologists to determine a particular line of treatment.Considering the fact that both Immune Report Card and OmniSeq Comprehensive trials have received the New York State’s Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program’s approval, we expect this alliance to help LabCorp broaden its customer base in cancer immunotherapy diagnostics space. Notably, this market is growing in leaps and bounds in recent times.Per the data provided by Radiant Insights, Inc. as published in Cision PR Newswrites, global cancer immunotherapies market is expected to witness a CAGR of 23.9% by 2022. Hence, we believe LabCorp’s latest decision to widen its position in this market is perfectly strategic.As part of its key tactical plans, LabCorp is consistently working hard on new innovations with academic institutions to capture the growing lab testing market with its advanced assays and tools.During the second quarter of 2017, the company has opened a state-of-the-art companion diagnostics laboratory in North Carolina and delivered a double-digit increase in year-over-year revenues aided by continued growth in immuno-oncology services.The company also won $100 million in companion diagnostic-related awards during the first half of the year. Its pipeline comprises a diverse range of oncology and non-oncology indications with new and established clients that might position it well for consistent growth in the future.LabCorp’s latest partnership with OmniSeq as well as its decision to invest for latter’s research and development should add further momentum to the company’s growth trajectory.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

188,LH,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.47, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter. The quarter’s adjusted EPS also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8%. On a reported basis, LabCorp’s net earnings came in at $1.82 per share, a 7.1% decline year over year.Net revenue for the second quarter increased 4.9% year over year to $2498.4 million. The quarterly revenue number also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.47 billion.Strong growth in LabCorp Diagnostics, solid acquisition related growth as well as organic volume growth contributed to the year-over-year top-line improvement. However, this was partially offset by poor show in Covance Drug Development. Also, while adverse foreign exchange movement hampered the quarterly top-line number to the tune of 60 basis points (bps), the year-over-year comparison to a Leap Year and the timing of the Easter holiday hindered the reported quarter’s growth by 1%.Organic revenue growth (net revenue growth minus revenue from acquisitions excluding the currency impact) was 1.9%.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Quarter Under ReviewCurrently, LabCorp reports under two operating segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.In the reported quarter, LabCorp Diagnostics reported net revenue of $1.80 billion, up 8.4% year over year, fueled by price, mix, tuck-in acquisitions and organic volume (measured by requisitions excluding requisitions from acquisitions for the first 12 months after the close of each acquisition). The company reported 5% increase in total volume (measured by requisition) and a 3.6% increase in revenue per requisition in the quarter.Covance Drug Development reported a 3.1% drop in net revenue to $699.7 million in the second quarter. This was due to the impact of cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in late 2016 — for which, Covance Drug Development used to provide central laboratory services — and a negative impact of 140 bps from foreign currency translation. At Constant Exchange Rate (CER), net revenue declined 1.7% year over year.Gross margin contracted 22 bps to 34.5% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 2.2% year over year to $426.5 million. Adjusted operating margin contracted 45 bps from the year-ago quarter to 17.1% on a 6.3% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses to $435.3 million.LabCorp exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $299.9 million compared with $365 million at the end of 2016. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $544.5 million, up from $477.1 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow came in at $403 million, up from $338.7 million in the year-ago period. During the quarter, the company returned $108 million to shareholders through share repurchases and currently has $489.5 million of authorization, remaining under its existing share repurchase plan.OutlookDespite a dull show within Covance Drug Development, the company increased its earlier provided 2017 outlook.Net revenue growth is now expected to remain in the band of 5-6.5% year over year, ahead of the earlier range of 3.5−5.5%. This includes a 10 bps impact (earlier the projection was 40 bps impact) from an unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.86 billion.Adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 has also been increased to the range of $9.30−$9.65 (previous range: $9.20−$9.60). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.42 falls within the guided range.However, free cash flow expectation remains unchanged in the band of $925−$975 million (up 3–9% from the prior year).Our TakeLabCorp posted a better-than-expected quarter with second-quarter earnings and revenues, both topping the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. While LabCorp Diagnostics business was strong, Covance Drug Development provided dull numbers. Per the company, the impact of the cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in late 2016 affected the results. This apart, an unfavorable foreign exchange continues to hamper the company’s overall results. However, an increased guidance for 2017 boosts investors’ confidence indicating chances of respite anytime soon.Nonetheless, we believe that with the integration of newer acquisitions, LabCorp is perfectly positioned to drive long-term profitable growth through a combination of world-class diagnostics, drug development expertise and knowledge services.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

However, revenues from Covance Drug Development segment declined by 3.1% year over year to $699.7 million because of sluggish revenue conversion  and adverse effect of the cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in late 2016.Major Factors: Per management, LabCorp made impressive progress and performed outstandingly in the Diagnostics business on back of excellent organic growth and strategic acquisitions during the quarter. However, the Drug Development business performed as per the company's expectation due to increased net orders and improving net book-to-bill.

190,LH,"Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), or LabCorp, is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Jul 26.Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 1.37% with an average beat of 0.36% for the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at Play  The last-reported first quarter 2017 dented LabCorp’s overall top line performance, heavily on dull numbers registered in Covance Drug Development business. This was due to sluggish early development and central lab businesses, affected by a slower revenue conversion from backlog and cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in 2016.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteRight now, although the company is trying to execute its strategy to focus more on higher-value therapeutic areas such as oncology and CNS (central nervous system) disorders, this procedure is tied to complex studies which will take time to generate revenue. We believe, the Covance Drug Development will continue to remain a drag for LabCorp’s overall business.Earlier, the company noted that from a timing perspective, both Covance Drug Development’s revenue and margins will be down on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2017, before showing favorable growth in the second half of 2017.This apart, unfavorable foreign exchange remains a bother. Previously, the company viewed that it expects an impact of approximately 40 basis points of negative currency on 2017 revenues. Covance Drug Development’s net revenue is estimated to feel the impact of approximately 130 basis points of negative currency while the LabCorp Diagnostics segment will be affected approximately 10 basis points of negative currency in 2017. This should be reflected in the numbers of the quarter yet to be reported.We are also highly disappointed with the CMS proposal related to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act.On a positive note, we are upbeat about the company’s ongoing cost-reduction initiatives related to project LaunchPad, which currently has over 100 projects at various stages of implementation. Recently, the company has expanded the LaunchPad initiative to now include Covance Drug Development. This initiative will be a three-year program for Covance that consists of two phases. The company has already initiated the first phase to ‘right-size’ Covance Drug Development’s resources, primarily head count and facility footprint.This phase is projected to generate pre-tax savings of approximately $20 million in 2017 and approximately $45 million on an annualized basis thereafter. The pre-tax cost to achieve these savings is estimated to be approximately $30 million in 2017, of which, around $20 million is presumed to be cash expenditures.This should get reflected in the second-quarter results as well.The company’s companion diagnostics portfolio, which grew a robust 35% in the last couple of years, should also maintain its momentum in 2017. Notably, within immuno-oncology drug development, it doubled the number of study awards from 2015 to 2016 and also performed a number of PD-L1 tests through Diagnostic and Drug Development segments.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that LabCorp is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: LabCorp has a Zacks Rank #4 which lowers the predictive power of ESP. Note that we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider, as our proven model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

The quarter’s adjusted EPS also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4%. Simultaneous hurricanes in the reported quarter, adversely affected adjusted EPS by 9 cents approximately.On a reported basis, LabCorp’s net earnings came in at $1.74 per share, a 1.8% increase year over year.Net revenue for the third quarter increased 9.5% year over year to $2.59 billion. The increase in net revenues was due to growth from acquisitions of 6.9%, organic growth (net revenue growth less revenue from acquisitions for the first twelve months after the close of each acquisition) of 2.3%, and the benefit from foreign currency translation of approximately 30 basis points. However, this was partially offset by a 0.7% adverse impact of multiple hurricanes during the quarter.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Quarter under ReviewCurrently, LabCorp reports under two operating segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.In the reported quarter, LabCorp Diagnostics reported net revenue of $1.84 billion, up 9.9% year over year, fueled by price, mix, tuck-in acquisitions, organic volume (measured by requisitions excluding requisitions from acquisitions for the first 12 months after the close of each acquisition) and the benefit from foreign currency translation of approximately 20 basis points. The company reported 7.3% increase in total volume (measured by requisition) and a 2.4% increase in revenue per requisition in the quarter.After several quarters of drag in sales, Covance Drug Development reported an 8.6% rise in net revenue to $761.1 million in the third quarter. This was primarily on the back of the acquisition of Chiltern, organic growth and the benefit from foreign currency translation of approximately 60 basis points.Gross margin expanded 75 bps to 33.9% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 7.6% year over year to $417.5 million. Adjusted operating margin contracted 28 bps from the year-ago quarter to 16.1% on a 16.2% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses to $465.3 million.LabCorp exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $409.3 million compared with $299.9 million at the end of the second quarter. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $895.4 million, up from $727 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow came in at $678.6 million, up from $522.4 million in the year-ago period. During the quarter, the company returned $42.1 million to shareholders through share repurchases and currently has $444.7 million of authorization, remaining under its existing share repurchase plan.OutlookBased on a strong third-quarter show and considering a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario, the company increased its earlier provided 2017 outlook.Net revenue growth is now expected to remain in the band of 8-8.5% year over year, ahead of the earlier range of 5-6.5%. This includes a 10 bps impact from an unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $10.13 billion.Adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 has been narrowed to the range of $9.40−$9.60 (previous range: $9.30−$9.65). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.51 falls within the guided range.Free cash flow expectation has been raised to a new band of $970−$1010 million (previous range: $925−$975 million) up 8–13% from the prior year.Our TakeLabCorp’s third-quarter earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong year-over-year increase in both earnings and revenues were encouraging too. LabCorp Diagnostics business was strong on improving price, mix, acquisition and favorable foreign exchange scenario.Also after several quarters of dull performance, Covance Drug Development reported strong growth. This was primarily on the back of the acquisition of Chiltern, strong organic growth and favorable foreign currency translation. An increased guidance for 2017 boosts investors’ confidence indicating chances of this bullish trend to be maintained in the fourth quarter too.We believe that with the integration of newer acquisitions, LabCorp is perfectly positioned to drive long-term profitable growth through a combination of world-class diagnostics, drug development expertise and knowledge services.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, LabCorp has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

192,LH,"The first-quarter earnings season saw a starry start with most of the 87 S&P 500 members beating earnings and maintaining revenue momentum as of Apr 20. However, the number of positive revenue surprises is lagging the preceding year’s numbers but is on par with the sequential figures.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies that have reported so far are up 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. Of the total, 82.8% beat earnings and 67.8% surpassed revenue estimates. This week, 178 S&P 500 members are lined up to release their quarterly results. We expect to get a clearer picture of what the first-quarter earnings season has in the offing by the end of the week.Medical Sector in a SnapshotMedical, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to stand out this quarter. The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Broadly speaking, the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which among many other changes, slashed corporate tax rates to 21% from the earlier 35%, has also buoyed optimism among inventors.The Medical Product space, which is part of the broader Medical sector, has been hogging a lot of limelight on certain favorable developments. Considering favorable demographics, changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) & big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector has been going strong.Further, the Senate’s decision to defer the implementation of an industry-wide excise tax for another couple of years, known as the Medical Device tax, has instilled confidence in investors. The tax will be put into effect on Jan 1, 2020. The bill also delays the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on employer insurance, until 2022.Moreover, MedTech companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, growing consolidation and focus on emerging market.Against this backdrop, let’s take a look at the major Medical Product stocks scheduled to release results on Apr 25:Per the quantitative Zacks model, stocks with the advantageous combination of a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP have higher chances of beating estimates.

193,LH,"CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.6%. Its trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise is 2.5%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCVS Health has so far progressed well with its 2018 PBM selling season. Per the last-reported numbers, gross new business wins totaled $6.2 billion while net new business wins grossed $2.4 billion along with an impressive client retention rate. This momentum is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Despite tough pricing competition, CVS health is currently gaining on high level of service and execution, competitive pricing along with unique integrated model.The company is also upbeat about sustaining the solid year-over-year earnings trend in the first quarter of 2018 on gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment. The performance is being driven by higher specialty pharmacy and pharmacy network claim volumes as well as brand inflation.Management stated that CVS Health’s specialty business is its top priority to help the company expand its customer base. CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings, including Specialty Connect.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteFurther, the company expects drug price inflation, product launches and higher utilization to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.CVS Health also projects better-than-expected performance in the to-be-reported quarter primarily on the back ofscript utilization at retail. The company has projected a 1.5-3.25% rise in consolidated net revenues for the first quarter.Further, a strong flu season has led to the improved outlook. Overall, for the first quarter of 2018, the company expects to register adjusted operating profit growth in the range of 0.5% to 4.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $45.82 billion reflects a 2.9% increase year over year.Although CVS Health’s Retail/LTC business registered revenue growth after several quarters of a slump in the last reported quarter, there are multiple factors raising concerns. Firstly, the year-over-year growth was just a marginal 0.3%.Further, continued reimbursement pressure, increasing generic dispensing rate andrecent generic drug introductions have been affecting the business. This apart, marketplace changes that kept CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 320-basis point negative impact on same-store prescription volumes in the previously reported quarter.However, CVS Health has been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that the company is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card.The company also expects to witness revenue growth of 4% to 5.5% and operating profit growth in the low to mid-single digits range, within the Retail/LTC business.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that CVS Health will beat estimates this earnings season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  CVS Health has an Earnings ESP of +1.94%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CVS Health carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Please note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) should never be considered going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.40 reflects a 19.7% increase year over year.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank #2.Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.53% and a Zacks Rank #3.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.96% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

194,LH,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results on May 2 after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 12.24%. Notably, Hologic’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the past four quarters with an average beat of 6.26%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystWithin Diagnostics, Hologic once again expects a stellar performance banking on molecular diagnostics.In the United States, the company is likely to gain from an increasing market share as well as utilization of fully automated Panther system along with market expansion by conforming to the testing guidelines.Global growth within molecular diagnostics can be attributed to the Panther system, Hologic’s fully automated molecular diagnostics instrument and also owing to a frequent utilization of Aptima women’s health assays. Notably, Aptima assays have gained a huge customer base in testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV (human papillomavirus) and trichomonas. We are also hopeful about Hologic’s expanded market for sexually transmitted disease testing.Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hologic, Inc. Quote Further, we are upbeat about Diagnostics business earning a regulatory clearance for several new products in the United States over the last six quarters. These include the first three respiratory assays on new Fusion platform and three viral load tests for HIV (for human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis C and hepatitis B. This steady pace of domestic assay innovation strengthens the company’s position to consolidate molecular testing on the Panther system. In January, the company again announced the PMA approval for the Aptima HBV Quant Assay for quantitation of hepatitis B viral load on the fully automated Panther system.All the above developments are anticipated to contribute significantly to the company’s topline in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $155 million for Molecular Diagnostics revenues reflects an increase of 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.Other few factors likely to influence Hologic’s results in the fiscal second quarter are as follows:Hologic is optimistic about sustaining a solid earnings trend in 2018 courtesy of gains from the Breast Health segment. Sales from the same have improved on the basis of an established clinical superiority of the segmental products over the last three quarters. The company has witnessed a consistent rise in market share within Breast Health on the back of direct-to-consumer initiativesand insurance coverage.Additionally, the company’s adoption of new mammography systems, 3Dimensions and 3D Performance, encourages us. These new products have already started to leverage the company’s Genius brand and also lured customers to upgrade their existing 2D systems. The company is building a broader portfolio of Breast Health products and services around the core of Genius systems so that it can play an instrumental role in the Breast Health continuum of care. Noteworthy in this regard is the recent PMA approval from the FDA for Clarity HD high-resolution 3D imaging and Intelligent 2D imaging technology. These products are now available in the 3Dimensions breast tomosynthesis system.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $293 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 remains 4.3% ahead of the prior-year tally.On the flip side, Hologic confronted challenges related to unfavorable foreign currency movement over the past few quarters. Escalating operating expenses and an intense competition, particularly in the tomosynthesis market, continue to raise a concern.What Our Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Hologic has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +0.94%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to also surpass estimates this time around:Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.86% and a Zacks Rank #2.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

195,LH,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation’s (EW  -  Free Report) Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy segment (THVT) business has been on a strong growth trajectory of late. The company has been witnessing continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the United States, over the past few quarters.We expect this strength to get reflected in first-quarter 2018 results, which are scheduled for release after the market closes on Apr 24.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q1 performance is expected to be.Spotlight on THVT BusinessThe THVT business includes technologies designed to treat heart valve diseases using catheter-based approaches as opposed to the open surgical techniques. Over the past few quarters, the THVT business has been a major contributor to the top line. Further, management continues to be bullish on the business. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of $575 million reflects an increase of 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.In recent times THVT is on a strong growth trajectory in the United States. The company has been gaining from the receipt of FDA approval for aortic and mitral valve-in-valve procedures, using SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve which is expected to boost the top line at the THVT segment in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteFurther, the company is expected to continue to gain from strong SAPIEN 3 clinical performance in the United States, as well as strong therapy implementation across all regions. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for transcatheter heart valves (THV) sales in the United States of $471 million shows an increase of 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.Outside the United States, the underlying growth rate was impressive with contributions from all regions. Edwards Lifesciences continued to see strong TAVR therapy adoption in Japan driven by SAPIEN 3.The company has been fortifying its THVT business in Europe as well. In this regard, the company maintained double-digit procedure growth in Europe last reported quarter. Further, Edwards Lifesciences announced the receipt of CE Mark for its self-expanding CENTERA valve in February. The latest development is likely to enhance the company’s prospects in Europe.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for THV sales outside the United States of $212 million reflects a 11.7% drop from the year-ago quarter. We believe the recent developments in THV space will help the company deliver superior performance compared to the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for THV sales outside the United States reflects a sequential rise of 9.8%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderEdwards Lifesciences carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp and Abiomed, Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

197,LH,"The third-quarter earnings season has commenced on an encouraging note for most sectors, with releases from 87 S&P 500 participants (24.7% of the total market cap) till October 20.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these members rose 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues. With 180 S&P 500 members lined up for releasing their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to put up an impressive show in the quarter. For Q3, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 2.2% on 4.8% revenue growth. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate during the second-quarter of 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.Medical Products Amid Political UncertaintiesHowever, the Medical Product space, within the broader Medical universe, has been a precarious game for the Republicans since day one, courtesy of President Trump’s repeated failure to repeal and replace Obamacare.However, major MedTech players have been pinning their hopes on the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though the elimination of this tax is far from being achieved.Considering these tax issues, investors interested in the Medical Product space will likely keenly await earnings reports from MedTech bigwigs like Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report), Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., (TMO  -  Free Report) and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report). Notably, all the companies are expected to release their earnings results on Oct. 25.For the third quarter, Baxter anticipates sales growth of about 4% at constant currency (cc). Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the range of 58-60 cents versus the year-ago figure of 56 cents.

Revenues were driven by a 0.7% increase in the average net Medicare reimbursement rate and a 6.1% rise in average daily census. Further, a decrease in Medicare Cap drove revenues by 0.6%.

199,LH,"ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after market close on Apr 26. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 28.2%. Moreover, the company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 8.6%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsResMed is expected to gain from a strong performance on the domestic as well as international front like the previous quarter. In the past few earnings, the company’s domestic revenues were driven by solid growth in devices and masks as well as a continued double-digit software sales rise. Moreover, the sleep apnea patient volume consistently witnessed steady growth. We expect these trends to find reflection in the impending third-quarter results as well.Internationally, revenues across Europe, Asia and other markets are likely to register a solid increase, banking on a strong device and masks performance. Within devices, sleep apnea patient volume should continue to expand through the company’s marketing efforts and channel partners. In Canada and Latin America, a sturdy uptake of AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software platform should further add value to the company’s portfolio.ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ResMed Inc. Quote In France, the company’s receipt of French reimbursement approval for telemonitoring buoys optimism in the stock. The company believes, this reimbursement grant will continue to drive the uptake of Air Solutions ecosystem including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, the company keeps investing and expanding its footprint in the high-growth markets of China, South Korea, India, Brazil and several countries in Eastern Europe.Within mask and accessories outside the United States, the company is expected to benefit from nasal and full face categories, namely AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20, respectively.Per ResMed, with more than 1.5 billion nights of medical sleep and medical respiratory care data, the company is successfully working on simplifying workflow and improving patient outcomes. This improvement should drive the company’s top-line performance in the quarter, yet to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $217 million for international revenues indicates a rise of 19.2% from the year-ago quarter.Domestically, ResMed is extremely upbeat about the latest tax reform, which sees a transformation into a territorial tax system. This  in fact allows the company to invest its global cash assets without any artificial constraints. Per ResMed, it is now free to invest in three new ways: firstly, growing upon its existing strong U.S. manufacturing footprint; secondly, expanding its existing U.S.-based research and development capability and finally, building upon its existing valuable U.S.-based intellectual property assets. Effective January, this is expected to remain accretive to the company’s operational result in the fiscal third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $366 million for domestic revenues (including contributions from Brightree) reflects an increase of 10.2% from the year-ago quarter.Other Factors Likely to Influence ResMed's Q3ResMed continues to progress on the back of its three-pronged growth strategy. In this regard, the company diligently aims at growth in the adjacent product and geographic markets including homecare ventilation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other respiratory disorders as well as the emerging markets of China, India and Brazil. ResMed still considers portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) an important addition to its menu of respiratory care products.Moreover, since ResMed’s acquisition of Brightree in fiscal 2016, the former has strongly progressed with the latter’s software-as-a-service business’ latest offerings targeting the home health and hospice market. We expect this upside to further boost ResMed’s top line in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.7 million for Brightree revenues marks an increase of 13.4% from the year-ago quarter.Here’s what the quantitative model predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.ResMed has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an Earnings ESP of +0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

200,LH,"Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on Apr 25, after market close.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 24%. Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 22.6%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Invisalign System — A Major Growth DriverSimilar to prior quarters, Align Technology is expected to gain from continued adoption of Invisalign Technology in the first quarter of 2018 as well. Accordingly, the company projects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 264,000-269,000 in the to-be-reported quarter, up 26.9-29.3% from a year ago.Notably, in November 2017, Align Technology announced the achievement of a milestone of five million patients undergoing treatment with its Invisalign system.Interestingly, considering the fast-expanding market for clear aligner therapy, Align Technology has undertaken several strategies to drive the adoption of its core Invisalign product line. These include product/technology development, extending clinical effectiveness, promoting the Invisalign brand name and boosting international growth.The company has also been focusing on increasing the Invisalign utilization by orthodontists. Particularly targeting the teenagers, Align Technology has adopted marketing strategies to accelerate consumer demand by allowing GP dentists to treat increased number of cases with the Invisalign system.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteStrength in Scanner and Service BusinessAlign Technology has also been witnessing strong revenue growth from the Scanner and Service business over the past few quarters. Moreover, the company has been witnessing increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to reflect in the company’s first-quarter results as well.At the same time, Align Technology has been focusing on expanding workflow options of iTero scanners. In this context, last November the company signed an agreement with Glidewell Dental to distribute the iTero Element intraoral scanning system with the latest glidewell.io In-Office Solution in North America.Align Technology had also signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental to make available its iTero Element intraoral scanning system as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada.Solid Global Prospects Align Technology had introduced a clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in 2017. These are indicative of the growing popularity of its dental products in the international market.Further, over the recent past, Align Technology reported strong international Invisalign Technology volumes on continued strong performance in both EMEA and APAC regions.In the last reported quarter, EMEA, volumes were up on continued adoption of Invisalign Technology in core markets like the U.K., Spain and France, as well as rapid growth in smaller markets like Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Middle East and Africa. In the Asia-Pacific region, the company witnessed an impressive volume growth led by China, Japan and Australia. We expect to see a similar trend in the yet-to-be-reported quarter result as well.Overall, Align Technology projects EPS of 94-98 cents on revenues of $400-$410 million in the first quarter of 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $408 million in first-quarter 2018 indicates a rise of 37.4% from the year-ago quarter.What Our Quantitative Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Align Technology has an Earnings ESP of +0.97% and a Zacks Rank #2, a combination that suggests the company to likely beat on earnings this quarter.

201,LH,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), also known as LabCorp, is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results, before market opens on Oct 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.8%. It has an average earnings beat of 1.1% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLabCorp’s top-line performance continues to be affected by softness in its Covance Drug Development business, as was the case in the last reported quarter as well. The weak performance was led by sluggish early development and central lab businesses, which were affected by a slower revenue conversion from backlog and cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in 2016. Also, adverse foreign exchange rates affected the numbers to the tune of 140 basis points (bps) at this segment.Meanwhile, we are upbeat about the company’s expectations of an improvement in the Covance Drug Development arm starting the second half of 2017. This should get reflected in the third-quarter performance.Over the last two years, LabCorp has faced several reimbursement issues that have dented its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). We believe reimbursement pressure will affect the company’s performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise   Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteNotably, the company are not positive about the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). However, this will most likely have no impact on its third-quarter results.Unfavorable foreign exchange continues to be a pressing concern for the company. Previously, LabCorp had anticipated an approximate 40-bps negative currency impact on 2017 revenues. The company currently expects a 20-bps impact from adverse foreign exchange on net revenue at Covance Drug Development in 2017.LabCorp has been continuously grappling with the issue of rising operating expenses which has affected its margins in the last reported quarter. Also, the chances of a turnaround in the scenario any time soon are slim.Meanwhile, on a positive note, LabCorp is focusing on research and development in collaboration with academic institutions in order to gain traction in the growing lab testing market. In July 2017, LabCorp launched ADAMTS13 test to distinguish diseases characterized by life-threatening, acute thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Also, in May, company expanded its VistaSeq Hereditary Cancer portfolio through the addition of 10 new test panels with focus on the risk of specific hereditary cancer syndromes.LabCorp recently teamed up with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) to set up specimen collection service stations at various Walgreens stores across the United States. The company also expanded its reach by closing the acquisition of Mount Sinai Health System Clinical Outreach Laboratories in May 2017. LabCorp’s highly differentiated portfolio will be used by the existing customers of Mount Sinai. These developments are expected to boost the top line in the third quarter.LabCorp’s companion diagnostics portfolio, which grew a robust 35% in the last couple of years, should maintain its momentum in 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that LabCorp is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  LabCorp has an Earnings ESP of -1.84%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.35 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.40. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: LabCorp has a Zacks Rank #2 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.43% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Henry Schein, Inc.

202,LH,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) also known as LabCorp, is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.38%. It has an average trailing four-quarter beat of 2.87%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLabCorp is likely to repeat its success trend from the last quarter. The company is expected to gain from a strong LabCorp Diagnostics segment in the period to be reported, banking on a favorable price, mix, tuck-in acquisitions and organic volume. Particularly, we are looking forward to the company’s partnership with Mount Sinai and the former owners of Pathology Associates Medical Laboratories (PAML), Providence and Catholic Health. Earlier, the company anticipated these three partnerships to benefit from a full-year ownership and growth to generate approximately $500 million as incremental profitable revenues in 2018. We expect this likely upside to get reflected in first-quarter results itself.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Within Covance Drug Development, we note that after a dull show for several quarters, the segment has started to report revenue growth from third-quarter 2017 onward on the back of the Chiltern acquisition, strong organic growth and a favorable foreign currency translation. With its buyout, Chiltern proved accretive to LabCorp’s portfolio, adding highly complementary capabilities to the company’s offerings including scale expansion in the Asia Pacific belt, a broader reach in the fast-growing emerging and mid-tier biopharma customer segments as well as expertise in the oncology drug development. All these factors should together continue to benefit the top line at LabCorp’s Covance Drug Development in the yet-to-be reported quarter as well.Significantly, the company is putting more emphasis on creating new growth opportunities in women's health, medical drug monitoring, genetics and oncology testing apart from critical collaborations such as Walgreens and 23andMe. Within Covance Drug Development, LabCorp expects these efforts to help fortifying its book-to-bill and net orders, driving its 2018 revenue conversion in the process.Also, the multi-year project LaunchPad, a business process improvement initiativeof LabCorp looks promising. The company’s last-year savings already achieved $20 million from the platform and further projects an additional net savings of $130 million through the three-year period ending in 2020, thereby substantially expanding the Drug Development margins.However, downsides might surface from the ongoing reimbursement issue. As stated by the company, the new PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act) rates published by CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) do not reflect the intent of Congress when it directed CMS to implement the market-based Medicare rates for lab testing. The statement reads that “The process CMS followed to determine these rates was fatally flawed and failed to account for significant segments of the lab market by excluding 99 percent of all U.S. labs from reporting data and limiting data collection to 1 percent of laboratories, dominated by independent labs”.We are therefore quite apprehensive about the entire scenario amid this current uproar. If the latest clinical lab fee schedule draft by CMS finally gets enforced sans amendment in favor of the testing laboratories, the continuation of LaunchPad, the projected growth at Covance, benefits from the Chiltern purchase and that from PAML and Mount Sinai plus the Covance LaunchPad process will all be offset by reduced PAMA rates.Per LabCorp’s previously provided guidance for 2018, revenue growth is expected to remain in the band of 9.5-11.5% from 2017 including a likely improvement of 60 bps from a positive foreign currency movement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year revenues is pegged at $11.48 billion. Adjusted EPS outlook for 2018 has been projected in the $11.30-$11.70 range. The consensus mark of $11.55 for the metric falls within the company’s forecast.What the Quantitative Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.LabCorp has an Earnings ESP of +2.08% and a Zacks Rank #2, a combination that suggests the company to likely beat on earnings this quarter.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:Myriad Genetics, Inc.

Among its recent alliances, under the new agreement with Interpace Diagnostics, Dianon Pathology — a member of the LabCorp Specialty Testing Group — will perform the thyroid biopsy analysis.This apart, worth mentioning are the company’s two major health systems partnerships, Mount Sinai Health System and PAML, a market-leading reference and outreach laboratory based in Pacific Northwest. Per LabCorp, these anchor health systems will gradually emerge as research hubs, improving access to trials as well as Covance's site activation and investigator, and patient recruitment capabilities.Other recent collaborations include a strategic partnership with Thermo Fisher (TMO  -  Free Report), through which, the Thermo Fisher Oncomine Dx target panel was launched for non-small cell lung cancer patients. Also, riding on its partnership with drug retailer Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report), the company works on developing and operating patient service centers within select Walgreens stores. Besides these, significant is its tie-up with Japan-based Sysmex Corporation, a foremost clinical laboratory services provider and Roche, the world's reputed biotech company.Share Price Performance Over the past three months, shares of LabCorp have outperformed its industry.

204,LH,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Laboratory Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Laboratory Corporation’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 15.7) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 18.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Laboratory Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Laboratory Corporation’s stock in the near term too.   P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Laboratory Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 1.7. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Laboratory Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes LH a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Laboratory Corporation is just 1.4, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.8. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 11.3, which is somewhat better than the industry average of 12.4. Clearly, LH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Laboratory Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B. This gives LH a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen nine estimates go higher in the past sixty days, compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen eleven upward and one downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 8.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has improved nearly 9.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus  Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteThe stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term. However, Laboratory Corporation is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment, as indicated by the positive estimate revisions, and this works in the company’s favor.Bottom LineLaboratory Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 17% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite positive estimate revision activity, investors should wait for broader factors and industry trends to turn around first.  When they do, this stock could be a compelling value pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

205,LH,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings or LabCorp (LH  -  Free Report) has recently entered into a national agreement with Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. (IDXG  -  Free Report) in the field of cytopathology. On one hand, this win-win alliance will expand Interpace’s nationwide network of cytology providers, supporting its Thyroid molecular business unit. While on the other, it will be helpful in strengthening LabCorp’s core specialty diagnostics arm.Notably, this is not the first time that LabCorp has partnered with Interpace. In fact, this latest agreement builds upon the original deal inked in 2016. The earlier contract enabled electronic ordering and result reporting via LabCorp for the Interpace’s proprietary ThyGenX and ThyraMIR tests. The reports provided more specific diagnostic information about the presence of thyroid cancer in patients, whose initial biopsy fails to indicate if a thyroid nodule is malignant or benign.Under the new agreement, Dianon Pathology — a member of the LabCorp Specialty Testing Group — will perform the thyroid biopsy analysis. If the result is indeterminate, then Interpace will perform the molecular tests. This apart, doctors can order an automatic reflex to Interpace’s tests from Dianon in the event of an indefinite biopsy assessment. In either case, Dianon will automatically refer those samples to Interpace to perform the company’s proprietary assays, ThyGenX and ThyraMIR.It is important to note that LabCorp works hard on new innovations with academic institutions as part of its three key strategic plans to capture the growing lab testing market through advanced assays and tools.In Diagnostics, the company successfully continues to provide foundation for new collaborations with health systems, large physician groups and managed care partners.  It constantly increases its scale and competency levels in clinical laboratory medicine by resorting to acquisitions ranging from routine capabilities to highly esoteric testing.Among the company’s other recent tie-ups, worth mentioning are its two major health systems partnerships namely Mount Sinai Health System and PAML, a Pacific Northwest-based market-leading reference and outreach laboratory.Per LabCorp, these anchor health systems will gradually become research hubs, improving access to trials as well as Covance's site activation and investigator and patient recruitment capabilities.LabCorp has also created ample growth opportunities for women's health with medical drug monitoring, genetics and oncology testing as well as effected critical collaborations such as Walgreens and 23andMe. Also, its partnerships with Mount Sinai and PAML's former owners, Providence and Catholic Health, continue to expand.Additionally, LabCorp expects the above three transactions to benefit from full-year ownership and growth to generate approximately $500 million in incremental profitable revenues for 2018.Share Price Performance Over the past three months, shares of LabCorp have outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 6.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 0.1%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Two better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

206,LH,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.05% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is LH due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsLabCorp reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.45, up 13.9% from the year-ago quarter. The bottom line also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4%. One-time benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the reported quarter, affected adjusted EPS by 5 cents, approximately.On a reported basis, LabCorp’s net earnings came in at $6.81 per share as compared to $1.75 in the year-ago period.Full-year adjusted EPS was $9.60, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.19. However, the metric registered 8.7% growth over the year-ago adjusted number.Net revenues for the fourth quarter increased 13.2% year over year to $2.70 billion. However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71 billion by a close margin.The year-over-year rise in net revenues was owing to 10% growth from acquisitions, organic growth (net revenue growth minus revenues from acquisitions for the first twelve months after the close of each acquisition) of 2.6% and a benefit of approximately 60 basis points from foreign currency translation.Net revenues for the year 2017 were $10.21 billion, up 8.2% over the preceding year’s number. The metric is also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.19 billion by 0.2%.Quarter Under ReviewLabCorp reports under two operating segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.In the reported quarter, LabCorp Diagnostics reported net revenues of $1.82 billion, up 8.6% year over year, fueled by tuck-in acquisitions, organic volume (measured by requisitions excluding requisitions from acquisitions for the first 12 months after the completion of each acquisition) and a gain from foreign currency translation of roughly 30 basis points. The company reported a 6.6% rise in total volume (measured by requisition) and a 1.8% increase in revenue per requisition in the concerning quarter.After several quarters of drag in sales, Covance Drug Development reported a 23.8% rise in net revenues to $886.1 million in the fourth quarter. This upside was primarily on the back of Chiltern buyout, organic growth and the foreign currency translation benefit of nearly 140 basis points.Gross margin deteriorated 92 bps to 30.4% in the reported quarter.

207,LH,"With smart investment becoming the buzzword in today’s investment world, millennials are frequently inclining toward hybrid investment patterns rather than traditional pure play theories like value or growth.The logic behind this is the effectiveness of a mixed investment strategy as value or growth investing approaches come with their own share of pitfalls. A pure play value investor misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long-term prospects. The same way, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks. In other words, to make a long-term investment more effective, the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined.The quest for a mixed investment strategy led to the introduction of the GARP (growth at a reasonable price) approach. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).One of the fundamental metrics for finding GARP is the price/earnings growth ratio (PEG). Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn't consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%:Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B:Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening:Pfizer Inc.

208,LH,"The MedTech space received a sudden jolt on late night Thursday when White House pulled the plug on Obamacare subsidies that reduce health care costs for Americans with low incomes. This comes as no surprise for the lukewarm response to its replacement, The American Health Care Act (AHCA), has forced Republicans to continue to seek new avenues. In a bid to save its face, the Trump administration attempted a “skinny"" repeal bill along with a Graham-Cassidy bill, which failed to make any headway in the senate.We believe that the impasse is slated to continue as President Trump has always been an outspoken critic of the ACA. Our apprehension comes from the uncertainty regarding the outcome of a slew of events. This includes the possibility of a rate hike by the Fed, a stronger dollar, and the stance of healthcare insurance companies over ACA. These are expected to spark bouts of volatility.As of now, plenty of speculation has been made regarding the extent of interest rate hike by the Fed before the end of the year. Though, the Federal Reserve officials remained largely divided over raising interest rates, majority of the bankers vouched in favor of raising rates. The ones debating against increasing rates stated that hiking rates at a time when inflation is lower than the target of 2% — an indication of a healthy economy — might cause major setbacks to the U.S. economy. However, investors may also feel that, even if Fed decides to increase rate, it will hardly have any impact over the long term.Nevertheless, it would be foolish to claim that volatility has vanished from the market, just because the global market has started to recover since yesterday. No doubt, such market uncertainty has made investors increasingly cautious about spending on stocks.Interestingly in this phase of massive global sell-offs, the MedTech sector has not only held its own, but also maintained a stable uptrend. This is based on some of its powerful long-term tailwinds, including mergers & acquisitions, emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and innovation of new products.In fact a closer look at this sector’s history will reveal the companies’ undaunting spirit to expand their business whatever the market scenario is. Despite political conundrum over Obamacare, we have witnessed some big cross-border mergers in recent times like the impending take over of C.R. Bard Inc  by Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).What’s the Rewarding Strategy?  We believe investors can earn handsome profits by extrapolating the current bullish trends of the market into the future. Henceforth, seeking refuge in momentum investment strategy is a strategic investment gamble at this moment.However, picking the right momentum stocks may baffle seasoned investors, let alone the new ones, who are planning to enter the uncharted world of jam-packed trades.Here, at Zacks, we use our Style Score System to single out stocks which can aid in beating the market.The Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success.Our PicksAmid the present volatility across the global economy, we have found a handful of top Zacks Rank momentum stocks for you from the Medical Devices space that are going to gain from this share market turbulence.
