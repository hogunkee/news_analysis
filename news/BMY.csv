0,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA granted approval to the combination of its blockbuster immuno-oncology drug Opdivo (nivolumab) 3 mg/kg plus low-dose  Yervoy (ipilimumab) 1 mg/kg (injections for intravenous use) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that has progressed following treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan.Opdivo plus Yervoy is the first immune-oncology combination therapy approved for this type of colorectal cancer. Approval for this indication has been granted under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR).The approval was based on positive data from a cohort of patients with MSI-H or dMMR mCRC, treated with the combination in the phase II CheckMate-142 study. In this cohort, 82 patients received prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Among these patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 46%. Among the 38 responders, there were 3 complete responses (CRs) and 35 partial responses (PRs). The median duration of response (DOR) was not reached. theseThe data showed that, 89% of the responders had a response of greater than 6 months, with 21% having a response ≥12 months.Shares of the company declined 9% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 2.4%.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications.The Opdivo plus Yervoy combination is also approved in two other tumor types. The Opdivo (3 mg/kg) plus low-dose Yervoy (1 mg/kg) combination is approved for previously untreated patients with intermediate- or poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma. Opdivo (1 mg/kg) with Yervoy (3 mg/kg) is approved for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma under accelerated approval, based on progression-free survival. However, Opdivo faces stiff competition from Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, which is approved in the first-line lung cancer setting.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBristol-Myers currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved the label expansion of oncology drug Sprycel.Consequently, the drug is now approved for the treatment of children and adolescents aged one year to 18 years with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP). It also includes a powder for oral suspension formulation.An approval was on the cards as the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had given a positive opinion on the same in April 2018.The approval was based on positive data from CA180-226 (NCT00777036) study, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Sprycel in pediatric patients newly diagnosed with CP-CML, and in those who are resistant to or intolerant of Gleevec.We note that Sprycel is already approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP). The drug also received the FDA approval for adults with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who are resistant to or intolerant of prior therapy. The FDA also approved Sprycel for treatment in pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP in November 2017.Label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Bristol-Myers.Bristol-Myers’ shares have declined 6.9% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 1.1%. While its blockbuster drug Opdivo continues to perform well and the label expansion of the drug will further boost the top line. Pricing concerns and stiff competition in the immuno-oncology space are major causes of concern. In particular, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq pose stiff competition.Hence, the label expansion of other drugs of the company should maintain the top-line momentum. The cancer portfolio also got a major boost with the launch of immuno-oncology drug, Empliciti, for the treatment of multiple myeloma in December 2015. Bristol-Myers is co-developing Empliciti with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBristol-Myers has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2,BMY,"Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the phase III study, IMpower133, on immuno-oncology drug, Tecentriq, met its co-primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at its first interim analysis for the indication of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).The study enrolled 403 people who were randomised equally (1:1) to receive either Tecentriq in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (Arm A), or placebo in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (Arm B, control arm).The results of the study showed that initial (first-line) treatment with the combination of Tecentriq and chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) enabled patients with ES-SCLC live significantly longer compared to chemotherapy alone.  The combination also reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) compared to chemotherapy alone.IMpower133 met its OS and PFS co-primary endpoints as per the study protocol. At present, Roche has eight ongoing phase III lung cancer studies, which are evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination with other drugs. Among these, this is the fourth phase III study, evaluating Tecentriq combination study, to come out with data and the fifth one to demonstrate positive results.We note that Tecentriq is already approved in the United States and European Union for patients with previously-treated metastatic NSCLC and for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC), who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy or who have had disease progression during or following platinum-containing therapy.Roche plans to submit the data to the regulatory bodies. Per the company, IMpower133 is the first phase III study with an immunotherapy-based combination to show improvement in OS and PFS in the initial treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) which increases the likelihood of a potential approval.The label expansion of the drug will boost sales.Meanwhile, the FDA has accepted for priority review of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) supplemental Biologics License Application for Opdivo for the indication of SCLC, whose disease has progressed after two or more prior lines of therapy. The FDA’s action date is Aug 16, 2018.Hence, competition will be stiff in the SCLC market for Roche.Roche’s stock has lost 9.3% so far this year, as against the industry's decline of 2.5%. Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin and MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe.  Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA accepted its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the label expansion of its blockbuster immuno-oncology drug Opdivo for the indication first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with tumor mutational burden (TMB) ≥10 mutations per megabase (mut/Mb). The FDA set an action date of Feb 20, 2019.The filing was based on the phase III CheckMate -227 study, evaluating Opdivo-based regimens versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy in patients with first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer across squamous and non-squamous tumor histologies. There are two co-primary endpoints in Part 1 for Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy versus chemotherapy: overall survival (OS) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with TMB ≥10 mut/Mb across the PD-L1 spectrum. The primary endpoint in Part 2 is OS, and the study is ongoing.Shares of the company declined 11.9% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 5.0%. We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan, for several cancer indications.Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classical Hodgkin's lymphoma — in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016). The drug has been performing impressively, due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and second-line NSCLC.Non-small cell lung cancer occurs in 85% of patients with a lung cancer condition, the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Notably, About 25% to 30% of all lung cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, and non-squamous NSCLC accounts for approximately 50% to 65% of all lung cancer diagnoses.Moreover, despite a significant progress made in this space, the disease is associated with low survival rates. Hence, the label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.We remind investors that, Opdivo faces stiff competition from  Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, which is approved in the first-line lung cancer setting. We also note that in March 2018, Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) presented data on Tecentriq in novel combinations across a broad range of tumors including lung cancer.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBristol-Myers has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the same space is Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc.

4,BMY,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AVEO  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 loss of 8 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 7 cents but narrower than the year-ago loss of 12 cents. However, excluding gains related to a change in fair value of warrant liability, the company reported a loss of 6 cents per share.AVEO’s first drug, Fotivda (tivozanib) received EU approval in August 2017 for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). The company is focused on launching the drugs in the European countries. Currently, the drug is available in Germany, Austria and the United Kingdom. The company is entitled to receive double-digit royalty payments from EUSA Pharma on net sales of the drug in Europe. However, Fotivda is not yet approved in the United States for RCC.The company did not record any Fotivda sales during the quarter. AVEO’s top line comprises collaboration and licensing revenues and partnership royalties. Total revenues in the first quarter were approximately $1 million, down 59.5% from the year-ago figure. Revenues were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.98 million.Shares of the company crashed 10% on May 8, presumably as the company said it is postponing the data readout from key phase III TIVO-3 study. AVEO’s share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the industry so far this year. Specifically, the company’s shares have lost 20.3% compared with the industry’s decrease of 11.9%.Operating ExpensesResearch & development expenses were down 32.1% to about $5.4 million. However, general and administrative expenses increased 12% year over year to $2.6 million.Cash GuidanceAVEO expects that its present cash resources of $27 million will allow the company to fund its planned operations through the first quarter of 2019.Pipeline UpdatesConcurrent with the earnings release, the company announced that it is deferring the anticipated topline data readout from TIVO-3 study evaluating Fotivda in first-line RCC in the third quarter of 2018. It was previously expected in the second quarter. AVEO is conducting the study to address the overall survival concerns from the TIVO-1 study identified by the FDA. Data from TIVO-3 study along with TIVO-1 study will be included in the regulatory application for approval of Fotivda in the United States.In April, AVEO announced the launch of Fotivda by its partner EUSA Pharma in Austria. In February, the drug was launched in the United Kingdom which triggered a milestone payment of $2 million from EUSA Pharma.In February 2018, AVEO announced data from the phase II portion of TiNivo study evaluating tivozanib in combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) PD1 inhibitor, Opdivo, in metastatic RCC. Data from the study showed that 64% patients achieved ORR. The disease control rate achieved by the combination therapy was 100%. In January, data presented from a phase I/II study evaluating Fotivda in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma showed that Fotivda achieved a median PFS of 5.5 months at week 24. The median OS achieved was 7.5 months.Apart from Fotivda, AVEO is also developing ficlatuzumab in combination with Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Erbitux in a phase II study for treating metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Another phase Ib study is evaluating ficlatuzumab in combination with Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in treatment-naive pancreatic cancer. These studies were initiated in December last year.Other UpdatesIn February, the company appointed industry veteran, John H. Johnson, with over 30 years of experience to its board of directors.In January, AVEO announced that it has refinanced its existing debt facility of $20 million with Hercules Capital.

5,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) delivered a stellar first-quarter 2018, wherein both earnings and revenues beat estimates on strong performance of Cabometyx.Following the announcement of the results, shares of Exelixis gained 5.97% in the after-market trading session. Exelixis’ shares have lost 6.5% over a year compared with the industry’s decline of 12.2%.  The company reported earnings of 37 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents, up from 5 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.Net revenues came in at $212.3 million, up from $80.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The reported number surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $146.4 million and was up from $120.1 million reported in the previous quarter. Exelixis, Inc. Price and Consensus  Exelixis, Inc. Price and Consensus | Exelixis, Inc. Quote Quarter in DetailThe FDA approved a tablet formulation of cabozantinib, (distinct from the capsule form) under the brand name Cabometyx in April 2016 for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) in patients who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy.Net product revenues came in at $134.3 million, up from $68.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The upside was driven by growth in the second and later-line advanced RCC business and the impact of additional sales following the FDA’s approval in December 2017 of the expanded indication for Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC.Cabometyx generated $128.9 million net product revenues driven by growth in demand due to expanded indication. Demand was driven by increases in market share, refills for patient already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base (20% sequential increase).Cometriq (cabozantinib) capsules for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer generated $5.3 million in net product revenues.Total collaboration revenues were $78.1 million compared with $12 million earned in the year-ago quarter as the company recorded $45.8 million in revenues for a $50.0 million milestone payment due from Ipsen Pharma SAS (Ipsen) in the second quarter of 2018 for the potential approval of cabozantinib for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC by the European Commission.In the reported quarter, research and development expenses increased 62.9% to $37.8 million stemming from higher personnel expenses, clinical trial costs and consulting and outside services. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $52.6 million, significantly up from $34.3 million driven by increases in corporate giving, personnel expenses and marketing activities resulting primarily from an increase in general and administrative headcount to support the company’s commercial and research and development organizations.Pipeline UpdateIn March 2018, Exelixis submitted its sNDA to the FDA for Cabometyx as a treatment for patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) based on positive results from the CELESTIAL trial. The FDA had previously granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of advanced HCC.Exelixis’ European partner Ipsen received a positive opinion from the CHMP, the scientific committee of the EMA, for Cabometyx for the first-line treatment of adults with intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC. Ipsen also announced its application for variation to the Cabometyx marketing authorization had been validated by the EMA for the addition of a new indication for patients with previously treated advanced HCC. Exelixis is entitled to receive a $10.0 million milestone payment upon the acceptance of this filing payment as per the terms of the collaboration agreement with Ipsen.Exelixis inked agreements with Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents in 2017. In January 2018, Exelixis announced an amendment to the protocol for the phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The amendment added four new expansion cohorts to the trial, which now includes patients with non-small cell lung cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer, in addition to previously included patients with RCC and urothelial carcinoma. The primary objective in the expansion stage of this trial remains to determine the objective response rate in each cohort.Meanwhile, the IMspire150 (TRILOGY) trial, which evaluates the combination of Cotellic, Tecentriq, and Xelboraf in first-line BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma has completed enrolment while IMspire170, the trial evaluating the combination of Cotellic and Tecentriq versus Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in first-line BRAF wild-type metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma, is currently enrolling.2018 GuidanceExelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2018 in the range of $430-$460 million.Our TakeExelixis’ first-quarter results were impressive wherein both earnings and sales beat estimates by a wide margin.  Demand for Cabometyx grew by approximately 30% sequentially driven by increases in new patient starts and refills for patients already on therapy.We expect sales to get a further boost in 2018 as the drug is now approved for first-line RCC which will increases the eligible patient population for Caobometyx in the United States by approximately 14,000 patients and grab market share from two key drugs — Sutent and Votrient in the first-line RCC market. However, competition has further stiffened up with the recent approval of Opdivo and Yervoy for the treatment of poor and intermediate risk first-line RCC.We expect investors focus to remain on further label expansion of cabozantinib and Cotellic. A potential label expansion for advanced HCC will further boost the growth prospects of the company.Zacks RankExelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

6,BMY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) reported a net loss of 1 cent as against a net income of 14 cents in the year-ago quarter. Incyte had received a milestone payment in the year-ago quarter which boosted the bottom-line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was of an earnings of 8 cents.Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation QuoteQuarterly revenues were $382.2 million, up 30% year over year. The reported figure, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $382.9 million.The year-over-year growth was driven by higher sales of Jakafi.Incyte’s stock has lost 50.3% over the past year compared with the industry’s 1.9% decline. Following the disappointing results, shares were down. Quarter in DetailJakafi sales grew 25%, year over year to $313.7 million driven by strong patient demand. Net product revenues of Iclusig amounted to $20.7 million, up from $13.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Product royalty revenues from Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex-U.S. markets grew 41.4% to $41 million.R&D expenses were up to $266 million from $177 million in the year-ago quarter. SG&A expenses amounted to $109 million, up 39.7% year over year.2018 OutlookThe company continues to expect Jakafi revenues in the range of $1,350-$1,400 million. Iclusig revenues are expected in the range of $80-$85 million.R&D expenses are now expected in the range of $1,013-$1,108 million, down from $1,077-1,172 million. SG&A expenses are now expected in the range of $340-$355 million, down from the earlier expectation of $465-$480 million.Pipeline UpdateThe phase II trial, REACH1 trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD”) has completed enrolment and results are expected in the first half of 2018. Incyte expects to submit sNDA seeking approval of Jakafi for this indication in the second half of 2018.Data from the trial evaluating INCB54828 in patients with cholangiocarcinoma are expected in second half of 2018.However, Incyte suffered a setback with epacadostat. The external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) review of the pivotal phase III study, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat in combination with Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma determined that the study did not meet the primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival in the overall population compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy.  The phase III trial, ECHO-301 was evaluating epacadostat plus Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma study’s second primary endpoint of overall survival also was not expected to reach statistical significance. Consequently, based on the disappointing data and the recommendation of the eDMC, Incyte stopped the study to enable patients and their physicians to consider alternative therapeutic options. Incyte is also significantly downsizing the epacadostat development program.As a result, Incyte and its collaboration partners have decided that the two pivotal trials of epacadostat in combination with Keytruda in lung cancer (ECHO-305 and ECHO-306) will be converted into randomized phase II trials. Enrollment will be discontinued in the four additional pivotal trials of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab.  The two pivotal trials of epacadostat in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo will be amended to enable patients and their physicians to consider alternative therapeutic options. The pivotal trial in combination with durvalumab in Stage 3 lung cancer will not be initiated.However, in April 2018, the FDA convened its Arthritis Advisory Committee to discuss the resubmission of the baricitinib NDA, which recommended approval of the 2mg dose of baricitinib as a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis for adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate.While the Advisory Committee unanimously supported the efficacy of the 4mg dose of baricitinib, it did not recommend approval of the 4mg dose of baricitinib for the proposed indication based on the adequacy of the safety and benefit-risk profiles. The FDA action date for baricitinib is in June 2018.The European Commission has already approved baricitinib as Olumiant in February 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to or are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.Our TakeIncyte performance in the first quarter was disappointing. The company suffered a huge setback with failure of the phase III study, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat in combination with Keytruda failed as it was one of the most promising candidates for Incyte.Further, the approval of the 4mg dose of baricitinib is also doubtful.Zacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

7,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after the market closes.Exelixis, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Exelixis, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Exelixis, Inc. QuoteThe company has a pretty good earnings surprise history, having surpassed expectations in the three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 247.9%. However, investors weren’t much impressed when the company came up with in-line earnings numbers in the last reported quarter. Let’s see what is in store for this quarter.Exelixis’ shares have lost 18.2% in the last six months as against the industry’s fall of 9.4%. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Exelixis is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +26.7% since the Most Accurate estimate is 19 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 15 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Exelixis carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with positive ESP increases the chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Likely to Impact ResultsExelixis’ stock received a major boost when the FDA approved Cabometyx tablets in April 2016 for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”).The drug’s uptake was encouraging and is expected to propel the top line in the forthcoming quarters. New patient market share in the second-line plus setting increased to 42% at the end of 2017. The recent FDA approval of Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC should further boost demand. The approval comes two months ahead of schedule.RCC is the most common form of kidney cancer in adults. Per statistics, approximately 30,000 patients in the United States and 68,000 around the world need a first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer. As many as 14,000 patients need the same annually in the United States.Since the drug is now approved for first-line RCC as well, the company can now target the entire patient population with the disease. We expect sales to get a further boost as the company will launch the drug for first-line RCC which will increase the eligible patient population for Caobometyx in the United States by approximately 14,000 patients and grab market share from two key drugs — Sutent and Votrient in the first-line RCC market.Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program comprising more than 45 clinical studies across multiple indications. The CELESTIAL study for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is also ongoing.  Exelixis has submited an sNDA to the FDA for HCC. The EMA accepted the company's application for the addition of HCC indication.Exelixis inked agreements with Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents in 2017.These collaborations entitle Exelixis to earn milestone payments and royalties that will boost its top line. Exelixis and Bristol-Myers initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER, in July 2017 which is evaluating the combination of checkpoint inhibition therapy, combined with a cabozantinib, compared to Sutent.Exelixis has also initiated a phase Ib study (investigator-sponsored) on cabozantinib (in combination with Opdivo (nivolumab) or Opdivo plus Yervoy) in patients suffering from genitourinary tumors, including bladder cancer and RCC.However, expenses continue to increase and raise concerns. Exelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2018 in the range of $430-$460 million.Another Stock to ConsiderHere is another company that you may consider, as our model shows that it also has the right combination of elements to deliver a beat this quarter.Emergent Biosolutions Inc.

8,BMY,"The Q1 earnings season has started to gather steam. Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 S&P 500 members — accounting for 17.4% of the index — have already released financial figures as of Apr 20, 2018.Total earnings for the 87 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 25% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues, with 82.8% beating EPS estimates and 67.8% beating revenue estimates.

9,BMY,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Bristol-Myers is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BMY in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 85 cents per share for BMY, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BMY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.82% heading into earnings season.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

10,BMY,"We expect Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.71%.The pharma giant has a strong record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 4.97%.Pfizer Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Pfizer Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pfizer Inc. QuotePfizer’s shares have risen 2.3% this year so far against a decrease of 4.3% for the industry. Factors at PlayIn the Innovative Health (IH) segment, new products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) should contribute to the top line meaningfully. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Ibrance (worldwide), Lyrica (IH), Xeljanz and Chantix are $973 million, $1.19 billion, $396 million and $272 million, respectively.In the Essential Health (EH), biosimilars and emerging markets are expected to support sales.However, the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products, primarily Pristiq in the United States will continue to hamper top-line growth.Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Enbrel is $540 million.The Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise may continue to see lower sales in United States while lower demand and generic competition should continue to hurt sales of Viagra.Pfizer is facing supply shortages for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio mainly due to capacity constraints and technical issues. We expect supply shortages will continue to hurt sales. Pfizer expects to cut down the sterile injectable shortages in 2019.New cancer drugs Bavencio/avelumab, Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin and Mylotarg are likely to contribute to overall sales this time around.Xeljanz, Sutent and Bosulif were approved for line extensions in the fourth quarter of 2017. All these new products and line extensions are like to boost Q1 sales.The bottom line is expected to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks.We also expect management to provide an update on initial launch uptake for Pfizer and partner Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) newly approved oral SGLT-2 inhibitor, Steglatro (ertugliflozin) tablets. Apart from being approved as a monotherapy to treat type II diabetes, Steglatro has also been approved for use in combination with metformin under the brand name Segluromet and with Januvia under the brand name, Steglujan.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate (75 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (74 cents) is +1.36%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of Pfizer’s Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some large health care stocks worth considering per our model.

11,BMY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.26%.Merck’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 8.54%Merck & Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Merck & Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Merck & Co., Inc. Quote Merck’s shares have risen 6.8% this year so far against a 4.3% decrease for the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMerck’s new products like cancer drugs Keytruda and Lynparza and Bridion Injection are likely to drive the top line. However, loss of market exclusivity for several drugs, softness in the diabetes (Januvia/Janumet) franchise, and lower sales of key products like Zostavax and Zepatier due to competitive pressure may hurt sales.Keytruda sales are being driven by the launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the indication of first-line lung cancer as it is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the setting.The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with regulatory approvals for six new indications in the United States, four in Europe and three in Japan. The approvals expanded the patient population, driving sales higher in the second half of 2017. This momentum is expected to be maintained in 2018 as well. Strong demand in most markets continues to drive sales of Bridion (sugammadex) Injection.However, rising competitive pressure has begun to hurt sales of relatively newer drugs like Zepatier. In the fourth quarter, Zepatier sales declined sequentially due to reduction in share and volume due to increasing competition. On the call, Merck had warned that the negative trend will continue in 2018 as most markets outside the United States will start to come under pressure.Among the older products, while continued pricing pressure is hurting sales of Januvia, lower demand due to competition is hurting sales of Isentress.Among the vaccines, Zostavax sales will continue to be hurt by strong competition from Glaxo’s (GSK  -  Free Report) newly approved shingles vaccines, Shingrix. Gardasil/Gardasil 9 sales were soft in the fourth quarter due to lower sales in the United States. Nonetheless, on the fourth-quarter call, the company had mentioned that underlying growth and increased coverage rates were still strong in the United States. It remains to be seen if Gardasil sales improve in the soon-to-be reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of the Vaccine segment is pegged at $1.5 billion.Animal health franchise sales are likely to remain strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Animal Health segment sales is $1.05 billion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Merck will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate estimate are pegged at 99 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Merck’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some large-cap health care stocks worth considering per our model.

12,BMY,"We expect AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.78%.Shares of AbbVie have marginally outperformed the industry so far this year. While the stock has declined 4.1%, the industry has decreased 4.3%. Notably, AbbVie’s earnings history is quite impressive with the pharmaceuticals company having outpaced estimates in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.81%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAbbVie expects first-quarter 2018 earnings in the range of $1.77-$1.79 per share. Revenues are estimated to grow in a mid-teen range on an operational basis. Foreign exchange is anticipated to gain a 3% favorable impact on sales in the period to be reported.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain a key growth driver in the first quarter, backed by strong demand trends for the drug. AbbVie expects Humira sales to reflect a rise in the low-teens band in the imminent earnings release while internationally, the growth rate is projected in a mid-single-digit range, operationally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humira is pegged at $4.7 billion.Significantly, on first-quarter conference call, investors’ focus will also be on the performance level as well as the label expansion updates of AbbVie’s another cancer drug, Imbruvica. The drug has been recording strong sales since the past few quarters, a trend that we expect to continue even in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Imbruvica stands at $759 million.Other drugs, namely Duopa and Creon are also likely to maintain an encouraging performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, AbbVie’s Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira, will continue to see declining sales, affected by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Moreover, in March 2018, AbbVie’s rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T fell short of expectations in a phase II TRINITY study, evaluating it in third-line therapy for later small cell lung cancer (SCLC). On first-quarter conference call, we expect management to provide updates on the same.Notably, AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret, secured an approval in the United States, EU, Canada as well as Japan in the second half of 2017. Importantly, Mavyret recorded $500 million global sales last year. The initial uptake of the drug has been commendable and we expect its higher sales in the first quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks ESP: AbbViehas an Earnings ESP of +0.06%.

13,BMY,"We expect Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.78%.Allergan’s share price has declined 2.3% this year so far, compared with the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Allergan’s earnings performance has been strong, with the company beating expectations in each of the past four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 1.81%.Allergan plc Price and EPS Surprise  Allergan plc Price and EPS Surprise | Allergan plc QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOn the fourth-quarter 2017 conference call, the company guided first-quarter 2018 revenues  between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion while earnings per share are expected to be between $3.20 and $3.40. These numbers indicate the lowest revenue and earnings quarter for the year.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the favorable timing of physician rebating program benefited sales of Allergan’s facial aesthetics products. This benefit was absent in the first quarter of 2018, which will hurt revenues. As such, the company expects first-quarter revenue growth rate to be somewhat lower than the annual 2018 growth rate. Also, generic competition for Estrace and Namenda XR will hurt sales sharply in the first quarter.While a generic version of Namenda XR was launched by Indian company, Lupin in February that of Estrace cream was launched by Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) in January.Allergan expects a generic version of Restasis, its second best-selling drug, to be launched between April and July of 2018. Meanwhile, a generic version of Delzicol is expected to be launched in early second-quarter 2018.Investor focus on the call will be on management’s comments on the potential impact of generic competition on key growth drivers, Restasis and Namenda XR. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Restasis is $295 million.Nonetheless, Allergan’s established products like Botox, Linzess, Lo Loestrin and Juvéderm collection of fillers and new products like Juvéderm collection of fillers should support sales in Q1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Botox is $771 million.In fact, recent label expansions for Botox (FDA approval for forehead line treatment) and Vraylar (FDA approval for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia) and Avycaz (FDA approval for HABP/VABP) should add to sales of these drugs in Q1. Meanwhile, the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from Zeltiq (April 2017) acquisitions should continue to support the top line in the quarter.However, we believe sales erosion of Aczone due to generic pressure on the branded acne category and loss of exclusivity (LOE), mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin 24, will continue to hurt the top line.We remind investors that on the Q4 call, the company had said that it does not expect any significant M&A activities in 2018. Allergan expects to reevaluate its M&A strategy in the second half of the year once it gets through the LOEs. An update is expected at the upcoming conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Allergan is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($3.37 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($3.36 per share) is +0.14%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allergan has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Allergan’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some large-cap health care stocks worth considering per our model.

15,BMY,"AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that it has secured an FDA approval for the label expansion of its marketed drug, Tagrisso (osimertinib), for first-line treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have EGFR mutations.Notably, Tagrisso is approved in the United States, European Union, Japan and China as second-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC, who showed progress following treatment with an EGFR TKI due to the EGFR T790M resistance mutation.Shares of AstraZeneca have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 3.7% versus the industry’s decline of 3.3%. We remind investors that last December, the FDA accepted and granted a priority review to the company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Tagrisso for the aforementioned indication.The FDA nod was based on positive data from the phase III FLAURA study, which compared Tagrisso with the standard-of-care EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in the first-line lung cancer setting.Data from the trial showed that the chance of progression or death risk was reduced by more than half in the Tagrisso arm compared with the commonly-used EGFR inhibitors. The median progression-free survival was 18.9 months for patients on Tagrisso compared with 10.2 months in the comparator arm. Tagrisso was well-tolerated in the trial with a safety profile, consistent with the previous experience.Importantly, a similar application for Tagrisso’s label expansion is under review in the EU as well as Japan with a decision expected in the second half of 2018.Tagrisso registered sales of $955 million in 2017, reflecting growth of 126% from the year-ago period and accounting for 5% of total sales. A potential approval in the first-line setting will further boost the drug’s prospects. However, the lung cancer market is crowded with several companies developing or marketing treatments. While Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) /Astellas’ Tarceva is approved for treating NSCLC, Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is developing its drug Dacomitinib in a phase III study as a first-line treatment for the indication. Moreover, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) is developing Opdivo as a treatment for NSCLC and AstraZeneca too has Iressa approved for treating NSCLC and is also developing Imfinzi for the same indication.AstraZeneca PLC Price AstraZeneca PLC Price | AstraZeneca PLC Quote Zacks RankAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

16,BMY,"We expect Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before market open.Bristol-Myers’ shares have decreased 16.5% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 4.7%.Bristol-Myers’ track record has been mixed so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters and missed expectations once. The average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters is 4.23%. In the last reported quarter, Bristol-Myers delivered a positive surprise of 1.49%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter. What Will Drive Growth in Q1?Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo is expected to remain the main sales driver in the first quarter, following several line extensions in 2017. In the soon-to-be reported quarter, the company announced encouraging results from a phase III study evaluating Opdivo in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Opdivo in combination with Yervoy significantly improved progression free survival in patients compared to chemotherapy. A potential approval in this indication will be a significant boost for the drug, given the immense scope in the lung cancer market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug’s sales in the first quarter is pegged at $1.38 billion.In January 2018, the European Commission approved the label expansion of Yervoy injection in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The FDA approved the drug for this indication in July 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug’s sales in this quarter is $291 million.In November 2017, the FDA approved line extension of Sprycel in pediatric patients with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. The drug, which registered growth of 6.7% in the previous quarter, is expected to receive a boost this quarter due to the expanded label. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprycel sales stands at $507 million. Cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, came up with a strong performance in 2017, with sales growing 44% year over year. Sales are expected to remain robust in the first quarter too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eliquis sales is pegged at $1.43 billion.On the other hand, the decline in Hepatitis C franchise is expected to continue due to intense competition from multiple drugs including Epclusa as its label was expanded to include HIV co-infection in August. Moreover, the HIV business continues to face competitive pressure. Recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hepatitis C franchise sales is pegged at $52 million this quarter, down 67.9% from the year-ago quarter actual figure.ConclusionSeveral label expansions of Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster cancer drug, Opdivo, drove the company’s sales last year and are expected do so this year as well. Moreover, cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, also demonstrated strong performance in 2017. We expect this trend to continue this quarter. Label expansion of leukemia drug, Sprycel, approved in November 2017, should bring in more sales for the drug. Moreover, continued strong performance of Yervoy and Orencia will have a favorable impact.However, genericization of Plavix, Avapro/Avalide and Baraclude in the United States due to loss of exclusivity is significantly hurting the company’s top line. The company also faces stiff competition in the immuno-oncology space. The HIV business continues to face competitive pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $5.17 billion and 84 cents, respectively.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.82%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Bristol-Myers has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some biotech stocks that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its results on May 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.36% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its results on Apr 26.

The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% and a Zacks Rank #2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

17,BMY,"This week was ruled by cancer data presentations by drug companies at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Chicago. Other than that, J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) kicked off 2018 pharma earnings on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales in the first quarter of 2018.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJ&J Beats on Q1 Earnings, Raises Sales Guidance: J&J’s first-quarter 2018 earnings came in at $2.06 per share while sales were $20 billion. Both the numbers increased 12.6% year over year. Though quite a few key products in J&J’s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta faced generic competition, we believe that new products like plaque psoriasis drug, Tremfya (guselkumab), cancer drugs, Darzalex, Imbruvica and Zytiga, currency tailwinds and contribution from acquisitions helped J&J deliver strong sales and profit in the first quarter of the year and led it to raise the sales outlook for the whole year. (Read more: J&J Tops Q1 Earnings Estimates, Raises Sales Guidance).Novartis’ first-quarter earnings came in at $1.28 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25. Revenues increased 10% year over year to $12.7 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.3 billion. Strong performance of key drugs Cosentyx and Entresto led to the impressive performance in the quarter. Novartis re-iterated the previously issued guidance for 2018. (Read more: Novartis Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q1).Merck Presents Successful Keytruda Data: At AACR, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) presented full data from the pivotal KEYNOTE-189 study, which evaluated Keytruda, in combination with Alimta (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. The data showed that the Keytruda combo significantly improved overall survival, reducing the risk of death by half (51%) compared to chemotherapy alone.In January, Merck had announced that the study met both its primary endpoints, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS (co-primary endpoint).Notably, in May 2017, this combination therapy was granted an accelerated approval by the FDA for the aforementioned indication. The approval was based on tumor response rate and PFS data from the KEYNOTE-021 study. Hence, the positive readouts from the KEYNOTE-189 confirmatory study will help the company gain continued approval for the combo therapy, which should support uptake and sales.  (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Betters Survival in Lung Cancer Combo Study).Merck also presented updated data from the phase III EORTC1325/KEYNOTE-054 study, which evaluated Keytruda monotherapy in high-risk stage III melanoma patients in the adjuvant setting. Data from the study demonstrated that as an adjuvant treatment, Keytruda increased recurrence free survival (“RFS”), reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 43% over placebo after surgery in such patients. (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Reduces Death Risk in Melanoma Patients).Separately, Merck and AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced final overall survival (“OS”) data from a phase III study evaluating PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, in metastatic breast cancer at the AACR. The median OS was 19.3 months in the Lynparza arm, compared to 17.1% for chemotherapy.Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo in Focus: Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) presented initial results from the phase III study, CheckMate-227, which evaluated a combination of its PD-L1 inhibitor Opdivo plus Yervoy for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC in patients with high tumor mutational burden. The initial results showed that the one-year PFS rate was more than triple with the combination versus chemotherapy (43% vs. 13%). However, while the results were encouraging, investors were disappointed as Merck’s Keytruda seemed to have fared better than Opdivo and Yervoy combination. (Read more: Bristol-Myers Down as Merck NSCLC Study Fares Better).Opdivo also demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival (primary endpoint) benefit compared to chemotherapy in a late-stage study (CheckMate-078) evaluating it in a predominantly Chinese population with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer. Opdivo reduced the risk of death by 32% versus chemotherapy. (Read more: Bristol-Myers Reports Positive Data in NSCLC Trial on Opdivo).In another development, Opdivo was approved in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of intermediate- and poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma in previously untreated patients. Also, Bristol-Myers’ supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to expand the use of Opdivo monotherapy to previously-treated patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was granted priority review by the FDA. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Aug 16, 2018. Separately, Bristol Myers struck a collaboration with Illumina, Inc. to develop and commercialize companion diagnostics for Bristol Myers’ oncology immunotherapies.Bristol-Myers also inked a deal with Johnson & Johnson for the development and commercialization of Bristol Myers’ factor XIa (FXIa) inhibitor, BMS-986177 for the prevention and treatment of major thrombotic conditions. Both companies are expected to advance BMS-986177 into phase II trials in the second half of 2018.Roche’s Hemlibra Gets BTD for New Indication: Swiss pharma giant Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) haemophilia drug, Hemlibra was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors based on positive data from the phase III HAVEN 3 study.Hemlibra (emicizumab) was approved for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in EU in February and in the United States in November last year. It has been successfully launched in the United States. (Read more: Roche Hemophilia Drug Gets Breakthrough Therapy Designation).Shire Agrees to Sell Oncology Unit: Shire announced a definitive agreement to sell its Oncology business to French company, Servier for $2.4 billion. The Dublin, Ireland drug giant plans to return the proceeds from the sale to its shareholders through a share buyback. Japan’s Takeda considered taking over Shire and the latter’s oncology business was one the key areas of interest to Takeda. (Read More: Shire Sells Oncology Unit Ahead of Takeda's Potential Offer). Shire, however, on Thursday, rejected Takeda’s third offer of 46.50 pounds per share as well saying that it undervalued Shire’s growth prospects and pipeline.Meanwhile, Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) issued a press release on the same day saying that it is in the “early stages of considering a possible offer for Shire”.  However, later in the day, it issued another press release saying it does not intend to make an offer for Shire.Bayer Sells Stake to Singapore’s Temasek: Germany’s Bayer has struck a deal to sell its 3.6% stake to Singapore's investment company Temasek for total gross proceeds of 3 billion euro. With the latest purchase, Temasek will own approximately 4% of Bayer’s stock. The equity sale raises funds for Bayer’s upcoming merger with seed maker Monsanto Company.AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso Gets FDA Nod in First-Line Setting: AstraZeneca’s lung cancer drug Tagrisso gained FDA approval for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR mutations. The sNDA was based on data from the phase III FLAURA study.A similar label expansion application is under review in the EU. Until now, Tagrisso was approved in the United States, European Union, Japan and China as a second-line treatment option for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.

18,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted and granted a priority review designation to the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the label expansion of Opdivo (nivolumab) to treat patients with small cell lung cancer (“SCLC”) whose disease has progressed after two or more prior lines of therapy. The FDA set an action date of Aug 16, 2018.The submission was based on safety and efficacy data from the SCLC cohort of the phase I/II CheckMate-032 trial evaluating Opdivo monotherapy or Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) in advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including SCLC. The primary goal was to ascertain the objective response rate as assessed by a blinded independent central review. Secondary objectives included safety, overall survival, progression-free survival and duration of response.Shares of the company have declined 0.5% over a year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 11.2%. We note that, Opdivo, became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval in July 2014. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classical Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy. Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions. The drug has been performing impressively due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and second-line NSCLC. The FDA also approved Opdivo for intravenous use for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) who have been previously treated with Nexavar and Opdivo has rapidly penetrated the second line HCC market.Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.However, Opdivo faces stiff competition from Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteZacks Rank & Another Stock to ConsiderBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Another top-ranked stocks from the same space worth considering is Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

20,BMY,"Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) shares increased 2.59% on Apr 16 after it presented full data from the pivotal phase III KEYNOTE-189 study. Data from the same showed that Keytruda combined with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) significantly improved overall survival, thereby reducing the death risk by half (51%) compared with chemotherapy alone.The study evaluated the combination therapy for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of PD-L1 expression. The combo treatment showed progress in overall survival irrespective of PD-L1 expression including patients with tumors testing negative for PD-L1.Meanwhile, a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) was observed with decrease in death risk by 48% in the Keytruda combination arm compared with the chemotherapy arm. The median PFS was 8.8 months in the Keytruda arm compared with 4.9 months in the chemotherapy one. A PFS improvement was also observed in patients, whose tumors tested negative for PD-L1.The results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research.Notably in January this year, Merck had announced that the study met both its primary endpoints, PFS and OS as well.Importantly, Keytruda is the first PD1 inhibitor in combination to show OS in patients with NSCLC.Last May, this combination therapy was granted an accelerated approval by the FDA for the aforementioned indication. The nod was based on tumor response rate and PFS data from the KEYNOTE-021 trial. Hence, the positive readouts from the KEYNOTE-189 confirmatory study will help the company gain a continued approval for the combo therapy, which should in turn support uptake and sales.We remind investors that in the third quarter of 2017, Merck had mentioned that it is including the overall survival (OS) as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 program, which could defer the readout from the study to 2019. It was then estimated that the evaluation would be completed by February 2019. However, the company released data from KEYNOTE-189 study a year earlier than expected in January 2018.Merck’s shares have gained 6.2% so far this year versus the 2.7% decline of its industry. Concurrently, Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) also reported data from a phase III study on its blockbuster drug Opdivo for NSCLC.

21,BMY,"Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) fell 7.8% as investors were not much impressed with the company’s initial results from the phase III study, CheckMate -227. The study was evaluating the Opdivo 3 mg/kg plus low-dose Yervoy (1 mg/kg) combination in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) ≥10 mutations/megabase (mut/Mb).The combination demonstrated a superior benefit for the co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) versus chemotherapy. The initial results showed that the one-year PFS rate was more than triple with the combination versus chemotherapy (43% vs. 13%).The overall response rate with the combination was 45.3% while that of 26.9% the chemotherapy arm. 68% of responders had ongoing responses at one year (25% with chemotherapy). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse event rate with the Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy combination was 31% versus 36% with chemotherapy.While the results were encouraging, investors were disappointed as Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda seem to have fared better than Opdivo and Yervoy combination.  Merck announced results from a phase III study, KEYNOTE-189, evaluating anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda, in combination with pemetrexed (Alimta) and cisplatin or carboplatin for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. The results showed that the Keytruda-pemetrexed-platinum chemotherapy combination significantly improved overall survival (“OS”), reducing the risk of death by half compared with chemotherapy alone.Consequently, shares of Bristol-Myers declined. The first-line NSCLC market competition is stiffening with quite a few companies trying to capture additional market share.     Shares of the company have gained only 4.8% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 10.7%. Concurrently, Bristol-Myers announced that it obtained FDA approval for Opdivo plus Yervoy (injections for intravenous use) as the first immuno-oncology combination therapy for previously untreated patients with intermediate- and poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma. The phase III trial, CheckMate-214 demonstrated a significant and unprecedented increase in OS for the abovementioned combination in this patient population compared to a current standard of care, Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent.Moreover, Opdivo demonstrated sustained OS advantage over standard of care in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the Head and Neck in CheckMate-141. Patients treated with Opdivo experienced a 32% reduction in the risk of death after two years minimum follow-up.We note that Opdivo is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions. The drug has been performing impressively due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and second-line NSCLC. Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.Bristol-Myers announced a worldwide collaboration with Johnson & Johnson’s  (JNJ  -  Free Report) Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) on a Factor XIa (FXIa) inhibitor program that includes the development and commercialization of the former’s factor XIa (FXIa) inhibitor, BMS-986177.We note that BMS-986177, an investigational anticoagulant compound is being evaluated for prevention and treatment of major thrombotic conditions. Both companies are expected to advance BMS-986177 into phase II trials in the second half of 2018 for the study of secondary stroke prevention.Zacks RankBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

22,BMY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) announced the failure of its lead pipeline candidate, glembatumumab vedotin, in a phase IIb breast cancer study – METRIC. The candidate failed to meet the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) benefit over Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) chemotherapy, Xeloda, in the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancers that overexpress gpNMB.An assessment of the data from the mid-stage study showed that glembatumumab vedotin achieved a PFS of 2.9 months versus 2.8 months for Xeloda. The candidate was also not able to demonstrate significant advantage in key secondary endpoints, including overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival.Following the failure, Celldex has decided to discontinue studies evaluating glembatumumab vedotin across all indications. The company is currently restructuring its pipeline to focus on five candidates in ongoing clinical studies, which includes varlilumab. It may also reduce its workforce.With no approved products in Celldex’s portfolio, the discontinuation of clinical studies following the failure of its lead candidate came as a major setback, pulling the stock down by more than 60% on Apr 16. The stock has declined 73.2% so far this year, compared with the industry’s decline of 8.2%.Celldex is evaluating varlilumab, a CD27 agonist, in combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in a mid-stage study in several indications.

23,BMY,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from a proof-of-concept study of experimental combination therapies for patients with advanced fibrosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (""NASH""). The data were presented at The International Liver Congress 2018 in Paris.Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor selonsertib was combined with either the Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (""ACC"") inhibitor GS-0976 or the selective, non-steroidal Farnesoid X receptor (""FXR"") agonist GS-9674 as therapies.Patients diagnosed with NASH and liver fibrosis stages F2 to F3 based on biopsy, or by magnetic resonance elastography (""MRE"") and MRI proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) enrolled in the study. They were treated with either selonsertib 18 mg plus GS-0976 20 mg (n=20), selonsertib 18 mg plus GS-9674 30 mg (n=20), or each monotherapy (n=10 per group) once daily for 12 weeks.Post treatment the most notable change that were observed was the decrease in liver fat content (measured by MRI-PDFF), which occurred in regimens containing GS-0976. The results also showed improvements in liver biochemistry and/or markers of fibrosis across both combination arms of the study compared to baseline.  Moreover, patients treated with selonsertib plus GS-0976, kinetic labeling showed reduction in the fractional synthesis rate of lumican, a marker of fibrogenesis.Hence, the favorable results suggest that combination therapy with selonsertib and either GS-0976 or GS-9674 can be evaluated further in patients with NASH and F3 and F4 fibrosis.Gilead also announced completion of enrolment in the phase III trials, STELLAR selonsertib.  Gilead’s NASH pipeline include selonsertib, GS-9674 and GS-0976, alone and in combinationConcurrently, Gilead presented data from a pre-clinical study of another combination treatment approach for NASH, evaluating GS-9674 and GS-0976 together and as single-agents in rodent models of NASH and liver fibrosis. The data indicate that combining agents had greater anti-fibrotic and anti-steatotic effects and led to improvements in liver biochemistry and fibrosis markers, compared with either agent alone.As a result, Gilead has initiated a larger phase IIb study in combination treatment with selonsertib, and/or GS-0976, and/or GS-9674 in patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH.Given the persistent decline in the HCV franchise, Gilead is looking to foray into markets like NASH and CAR-T as they hold great potential. Per estimates, NASH is expected to surpass hepatitis C as the leading reason for liver transplants in the United States and Europe.  Gilead’s stock has lost 4.6% in the last six months as against the industry's decline of 15.5%.Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT  -  Free Report) is also evaluating its lead candidate, obeticholic acid, in a phase III study in subjects with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) has a mid-stage candidate in the NASH space. BMS-986036, an investigational pegylated analogue of human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a key regulator of metabolism, in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F1-F3) achieved its primary endpoint of significant reduction in liver fat versus placebo.Swiss major Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) is conducting a phase IIb involving the combination of a Novartis FXR agonist and cenicriviroc with for the treatment of NASH.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

24,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced results from the phase III trial, CheckMate -078 trial on blockbuster drug Opdivo in a number of people, the majority of whom were from China.This late-stage multinational, randomized study compared Opdivo to docetaxel in the treatment of patients with stage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) whose disease has progressed after platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.Results showed that Opdivo demonstrated a statistically significant benefit versus docetaxel on the primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”) as an OS benefit was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression or tumor histology. Opdivo reduced the risk of death by 32% versus chemotherapy.Additionally, the two secondary endpoints of objective response rate and median duration of response demonstrated durability with Opdivo compared to docetaxel.  Objective response rates quadrupled with Opdivo (17%) versus docetaxel (4%); median duration of response not reached with Opdivo versus 5.3 months with docetaxel.The results will be updated in Immuno-Oncology Trials session at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting 2018 in Chicago (Abstract #CT114).We remind investors that the China Food and Drug Administration accepted the company’s Biologics License Application for Opdivo for the proposed indication of previously treated NSCLC in November 2017. A tentative approval will further boost the geographic reach of the drug.The efficacy and safety of Opdivo in a predominantly Chinese patient population with advanced NSCLC were consistent with the results of the global CheckMate -017 and -057 studies. Shares of the company have rallied 13.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 10.6%.Opdivo, became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval in July 2014. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classical Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy. Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions. The drug has been performing impressively due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and second-line NSCLC. The FDA also approved Opdivo for intravenous use for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) who have been previously treated with Nexavar and Opdivo has rapidly penetrated the second line HCC market.Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.Earlier, the company stopped its phase III combination study, CheckMate-214, earlier than expected after it met its co-primary endpoint. The phase III study evaluated Opdivo plus Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma and met its co-primary endpoint. The study showed superior OS compared to current standard of care sunitinib in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. The FDA accepted the company's sBLA for the same and will take a decision by Apr 16, 2018.However, Opdivo faces stiff competition from Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq.Concurrently, Bristol-Myers announced a collaboration with Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) to use the latter’s next-generation sequencing technology to develop and globally commercialize in-vitro diagnostic assays in support of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s oncology portfolio.Zacks RankBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

25,BMY,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from a phase III study, EORTC1325/KEYNOTE-054, evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, in high-risk stage III melanoma patients in the adjuvant setting. Data from the study demonstrated that as an adjuvant treatment, Keytruda significantly increased recurrence free survival (“RFS”) after surgery compared to placebo in such patients. The drug reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 43% over placebo.In the study, RFS was achieved in 75.4% of the patients treated with Keytruda over a year, compared to 61% for placebo. Keytruda also significantly prolonged RFS in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors by reducing risk of recurrence or death by 46% over placebo.Data from the study will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (""AACR"") Annual Meeting 2018 and will be published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Shares of Merck have outperformed the industry so far this year. Shares have returned 1.6% against the industry’s decline of 2.7% in the said period.The study is being conducted in collaboration with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer.Merck claimed that Keytruda is the first anti-PD1 therapy to achieve RFS benefit in stage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC melanoma patients. The drug has achieved RFS benefit in patients irrespective of BRAF-mutation.Merck is evaluating Keytruda in a broad clinical development program for melanoma comprising 10 clinical studies across all settings and stages of the disease.In a separate press release, Merck and AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced final overall survival (“OS”) data from its phase III OlympiAD study evaluating PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, in metastatic breast cancer at the AACR Annual Meeting 2018. The median OS was 19.3 months in the Lynparza arm, compared to 17.1% for chemotherapy.Please note that Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo, had received approval for intravenous administration in melanoma patients as adjuvant treatment in December 2017. However, Keytruda has achieved RFS benefit in higher proportion of patients, compared to Opdivo in clinical studies.Merck & Co., Inc. Price  Merck & Co., Inc. Price | Merck & Co., Inc.

26,BMY,"The last week has been an eventful one for pharma stocks with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announcing that it is acquiring gene therapy company AveXis while Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced successful study results. In other news, Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) kidney cancer drug, Inlyta missed primary endpoint in a phase III study.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesNovartis to Buy AveXis for $8.7 Billion: The big news early in the week was Novartis’ $8.7 billion deal to buy AveXis whose lead product candidate AVXS-101 is a one-time gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). A regulatory filing for AVXS-101 in the United States is expected in the second half of this year. AVXS-101 has the potential to generate millions of dollars for Novartis, if approved. The company agreed to pay $218 for each share of AveXis, representing a whooping premium of 88% to AveXis’ closing price on Friday.With boards of both the companies having approved the deal, the buyout is anticipated to close in the second half of the year. (Read More: Novartis Inks $8.7 Billion Gene Therapy Deal to Buy AveXis)Merck’s Keytruda Succeeds in Another Key Lung Cancer Study: A pivotal lung cancer study, KEYNOTE-042, on Merck’s blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda met the primary endpoint. The KEYNOTE-042 study evaluated patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous or squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 1 percent or greater  (TPS of ≥1 percent). In such patients, Keytruda showed a significant survival benefit compared with platinum-based chemotherapy.Notably, Keytruda monotherapy is already marketed for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater (TPS of ≥50 percent).If the OS data from KEYNOTE-042 study are approved to be included in Keytruda’s label, the drug can be prescribed to treat an expanded lung cancer patient population, further reinforcing its position in the lung cancer market.

27,BMY,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) has announced initiation of dosing in a phase I/II study, evaluating the combination of its two novel immuno-oncology agents, NKTR-262 and NKTR-214, on patients with advanced solid tumors.While NKTR-262 is a toll-like receptor agonist designed to invite an innate immune response to fight the cancer, NKTR-214 is an immuno-stimulatory CD122-biased agonist.Shares of Nektar have soared 72.1% so far this year, substantially outperforming the industry’s decrease of 2.2%. The phase I/II REVEAL study is an open-label, multicenter dose escalation program, designed to evaluate the NKTR-262/NKTR-214 combination regimen, administered as an initial intratumoral (directly into the tumor) injection of NKTR-262 followed by an intravenous (IV) infusion of NKTR-214. The company believes that this combination therapy will enable it to provide an alternative treatment option to its patients.Moreover, the company also plans to assess this NKTR-262/NKTR-214 combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo (nivolumab) in the given patient population.We remind investors that in September 2016, Nektar entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers under which, Nektar’s NKTR-214 will be examined in combination with the latter’s Opdivo across nine tumor types including melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer plus 20 potential indications in phase I/II trials.Meanwhile, in September 2017, the company announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).It is also important to note that Nektar is developing several other candidates across important therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology aong others. The company has made a significant progress with its lead candidate Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102), currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treating adults with advanced breast cancer as well as brain metastases. A response is anticipated within the first half of 2018.A couple of other interesting candidates is NKTR-181 and NKTR-358. While NKTR-181 is being analyzed in a phase III program for treatment of chronic pain, the company initiated a phase I clinical study on NKTR-358 to treat a wide range of auto-immune diseases and inflammatory disorders.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics Quote Zacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

29,BMY,"Last year turned out to be pretty good for pharma and biotech stocks as far as FDA decisions are concerned. The regulatory body approved 46 novel drugs, easily surpassing 2016’s total tally of 22.Landmark decisions last year include the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.With just a quarter gone by this year, the FDA has already granted approval to six new treatments. Key approvals include J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor Erleada (apalutamide) for pre-metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) third medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, Gilead’s once-daily single tablet HIV regimen Biktarvy and Novartis’s Lutathera for certain gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming, plus requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Let’s take a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of April.Note that this month, the FDA has already approved Pacira Pharmaceuticals’s Exparel for a new indication as a nerve block for regional analgesia and Clovis Oncology’s PARP inhibitor Rubraca as maintenance therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer.Second Indication for Novartis’ Kymriah: On Apr 30, the FDA is expected to give its decision on Novartis’ supplemental biologics license application (BLA) looking for approval of Kymriah for its second indication. With the latest filing, Novartis is looking to get Kymriah approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC) — most common form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma — who have failed two or more prior therapies. Kymriah was approved for the treatment of a deadly cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia last August. According to the company’s annual report, 10-15% of DLBLC patients do not respond to initial therapy or relapse within three months of treatment, indicating the significant market potential for Kymriah in the DLBLC indication.FDA Decision on Mallinckrodt’s Label Expansion of Amitiza in Children: Mallinckrodt plc’s (MNK  -  Free Report) supplemental new drug application (sNDA) looking to get its constipation drug Amitiza approved for paediatric functional constipation between six and 17 years, is under review. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Apr 28. Amtiza was added to Mallinckrodt’s portfolio with the February acquisition of Sucampo Pharmaceuticals.Amitiza is already approved for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) among adult women and opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. According to the company’s press release, Amitiza, if approved for paediatric functional constipation, would be the first and only prescription medication specifically approved for such patients, who have limited treatment options to address their disease.Will an FDA Panel Back GW Pharmaceuticals’ Epidiolex and Incyte/Lilly’s Olumiant? An FDA panel is expected to give its opinion on GW Pharmaceuticals’ lead cannabinoid pipeline candidate, Epidiolex, next week. GW Pharmaceuticals is looking to get Epidiolex approved as an adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome. Both are highly treatment-resistant forms of childhood-onset epilepsy.With the FDA granting priority review to Epidiolex’s NDA, a response from the FDA is expected by Jun 27, 2018. Epidiolex represents blockbuster potential especially if it is approved across all possible indications.An FDA panel is also expected to give its opinion this month on Incyte/Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant (baricitinib) for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. In April 2017, the companies had received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for baricitinib. The FDA required additional clinical data. TheNDA for Olumiant was re-submitted in January. Olumiant has already been launched in select European countries and in Japan, and fetched sales of $46 million in 2017.Although the FDA takes the recommendations of its panels/advisory committe into account while reviewing applications, it is not bound to follow the same.FDA Decisions for Rigel’s Tavalisse and Ultragenyx’s Burosumab on April 17: The FDA is expected to give its decision on Rigel Pharmaceuticals NDA for Tavalisse (fostamatinib) for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) on Apr 17. Rigel is preparing for the launch of this oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor in the second quarter, if approved. Existing therapies to treat chronic ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPOs) and splenectomy. However, still the disease remains inadequately treated in many patients. This means that if approved, Tavalisse should enjoy significant market potential.Another FDA decision expected on Apr 17 is on Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical’s BLA for burosumab to treat pediatric and adult patients with X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH). Burosumab was approved for treating XLH by the trade name of Crysvita in the EU in February.FDA to Decide on Prometic’s Ryplazim: This FDA decision, expected on Apr 14, will be on Canadian biotech Prometic Life Sciences’ biologics license application (BLA) for Ryplazim for the treatment of congenital plasminogen deficiency. Ryplazim enjoyed Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designations by the FDA for the said indication.Bristol Myers’ Opdivo+Yervoy Combo to Get FDA Approval? Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) has filed an sBLA looking get its blockbuster drug Opdivo approved in combination with its another cancer drug Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). The FDA decision is expected in Apr 16.In clinical studies, the combination has demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) compared with the current standard of care sunitinib in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. This bodes well for the drug given the potential in the targeted market.The PD-1 inhibitor is presently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Label expansion should boost Opdivo’s sales further. Opdivo generated sales of almost $5 billion in 2017.Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

30,BMY,"The biggest news this week was Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) announcement of its plans to spin off its eye care division, Alcon, into a new public company. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave positive recommendations for granting marketing approval to several drugs this week. AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) relatively new cancer drugs, Lynparza and Imfinzi, were granted marketing approval in Japan.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesNovartis to Spin Off Alcon: Novartis announced its intention to spin off its eye care division, Alcon, into a separately-traded standalone company.Novartis had acquired Alcon in 2011. Novartis was conducting a strategic review of this business for long, which included retaining the business or a separation via sale, spin-off or an initial public offering.The decision to spin off Alcon looks prudent as the business was not performing per management’s expectations. Alcon management believes that creating a standalone company via a capital markets exit could create additional shareholder value. The divestiture of this unit should also help Novartis focus on its drugs business. Novartis plans to retain ophthalmic pharmaceuticals as part of its pharmaceuticals portfolio.Concurrently, the company announced that it will initiate a share buyback program of $5 billion to be executed by the end of 2019. (Read more: Novartis to Spin Off Alcon as Separate Trading Company)CHMP Gives Positive Opinion to Several Drugs: Bristol Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo gained a positive CHMP opinion, recommending expanded approval for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with melanoma. The CHMP also gave a nod to AstraZeneca’s new formulation of once-weekly Bydureon in a pre-filled BCise device to help improve glycaemic control. This new formulation is already approved in the United States. Sanofi (SNY) also gained positive CHMP opinion for Cablivi (caplacizumab) for treatment of a rare blood disorder called acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Cablivi was added to Sanofi’s portfolio with its latest acquisition of Ablynx. Novartis’ filing looking for label expansion of its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah, for two B-cell malignancies was also given a positive opinion by the CHMP. The final decision by the European Union on these products is expected in the coming months.AstraZeneca Gains Japan Approvals for Two New Cancer Drugs: AstraZeneca’s PARP inhibitor, Lynparza gained approval for the second indication in Japan. Lynparza (olaparib) tablets, which are already approved for advanced ovarian cancer, are now approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with unresectable or recurrent BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer in patients who have received prior chemotherapy.Also, AstraZeneca’s new PD-L1 inhibitor was approved by the Japanese regulatory authorities for locally-advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Imfinzi is already approved in the United States in this indication while an application in the EU is under review, with a decision expected in the second half. (Read more: AstraZeneca’s Two New Cancer Drugs Get Approval in Japan)Merck’s Keytruda sBLA Gets Priority Review: Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) looking to expand the label of Keytruda for first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC —a difficult-to-treat lung cancer patient population —was granted priority review by the FDA. The FDA’s decision is expected on Oct 30. The sBLA filing was based on data from the KEYNOTE-407 study. We remind investors that data presented from this study stole the limelight at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology earlier this month. Data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival regardless of PD-L1 expression. (Read more: Merck’s Keytruda Gets Priority Review in Difficult Lung Cancer)Bristol-Myers Leukemia Drug Gets EU Nod for Expanded Indication: Bristol-Myers announced that the European Commission has given marketing approval to its leukemia drug Sprycel for a new patient population and as a new formulation.

31,BMY,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BMY due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Bristol-Myers Beats on Q1 Earnings, Opdivo ImpressesBristol-Myers Squibb first-quarter 2018 earnings of $0.94 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.85 and the year-ago quarter earnings of $0.84.Total revenues of $5.19 billion were slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion and increased 5% from $4.93 billion recorded in the year-ago period. Strong sales of Opdivo and Eliquis contributed to the top line in the reported quarter.Quarterly DetailsRevenues were up 1% year over year when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. Revenues increased 1% to $2.8 billion in the United States and 10% outside the country. Ex-U.S. revenues were up 1% when adjusted for foreign exchange impact.Leukemia drug Sprycel raked in sales of $438 million, down 5% year over year. U.S. sales for the drug were down 13% to $214 million. A label expansion of the drug in pediatric patients in the United States last November presumably did not have much impact on sales.Rheumatoid arthritis drug, Orencia, was up 11% in first-quarter 2018 to $593 million. Melanoma drug, Yervoy contributed $249 million to the top line during the reported quarter, down 25%. U.S. sales for the drug were down 33% to $162 million.Opdivo, which is approved for multiple cancer indications, generated revenues of $1.51 billion, up 34% from the year-ago period.Sales of cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, were $1.51 billion during the reported quarter, up 37% year over year. Multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti recorded sales of $55 million, up 4% year over year.However, the performance of key drugs in the Virology unit continues to disappoint. Sales of Baraclude declined 20% to $225 million. The Reyataz and Sustiva franchises deteriorated 36% and 54% year over year to $124 million and $84 million, respectively. The Hepatitis franchise lost 98% of its year-ago quarter sales and contributed a mere $3 million to revenues.Research and development (R&D) expenses in the quarter decreased 4.1% to $1.25 billion. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 9.7% to $980 million.Gross margin was 69.5% in the quarter compared with 74.3% in the year-ago quarter due to change in product mix.Regulatory UpdateSubsequent to the quarter in April, the FDA approved Opdivo+Yervoy combination regimen for treating intermediate- and poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma in patients who have not received any prior treatment. In March, the FDA had granted priority review to a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking approval of the combination regimen for treating microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer.CollaborationsIn April 2018, Bristol-Myers collaborated with Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiary, Janssen, to develop and commercialize its Factor Xia inhibitor program, including BMS-986177, for treating major thrombotic conditions. In the same month, Bristol-Myers and privately-held Illumina, Inc. announced a collaboration to utilize the latter’s next-generation sequencing technology.In February, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar Therapeutics entered into a strategic development and commercialization collaboration for Nektar’s lead immuno-oncology program, NKTR-214. Per the collaboration, the companies will develop and commercialize NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy in more than 20 indications across nine tumor types, as well as potential combinations with other anti-cancer agents from either of the respective companies and/or third parties. Both the companies plan to initiate studies in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma in mid-2018.Pipeline UpdateIn April 2018, Bristol Myers announced data from a phase III study, Checkmate-227, which showed superior progression-free survival in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) treated with Opdivo – Yervoy combination compared to chemotherapy. In January 2018, Bristol-Myers announced positive data from Phase II CheckMate-142 study evaluating the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in patients with DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).The company also announced data from the phase III study, CheckMate-078, evaluating Opdivo in Chinese population. Data showed that the drug achieved superior overall survival in previously-treated patients with NSCLC as compared to docetaxel.Data from a long-term follow up phase III study – CheckMate -141 – showed that Opdivo reduced risk of death by 32% in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after a minimum two years of follow-up compared to standard chemotherapy.In March, Bristol-Myers along with Pfizer announced data from a real-world data analysis of different direct oral anticoagulants including Eliquis, J&J’s Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. Data showed that Eliquis achieved significantly lower rates of both stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding compared to both Xarelto and Pradaxa.2018 Guidance UpdatedBristol-Myers increased its adjusted earnings expectations for 2018. The company now projects earnings in the range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share (previously $3.15 to $3.30). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.22. The company expects worldwide revenues to increase in mid-single digits. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions higher for the current quarterBristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and Consensus  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and Consensus | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, BMY has a strong Growth Score of A and a grade with the same score on the momentum front. The stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for growth and momentum investors while value investors may want to look elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, BMY has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

32,BMY,"Shares of NewLink Genetics Corp. (NLNK  -  Free Report) plunged about 43% after it announced that it conducting a review of studies evaluating its IDO pathway inhibitor, indoximod in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents in several cancer indications including melanoma. Shares of the company have also declined 77% over a year compared with the industry’s decline of 11.5%. NewLink’s decision came in response to the Incyte Corp.’s (INCY  -  Free Report)  and partner Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announcement of the failure of a key melanoma combination study on Friday Incyte and Merck said that a combination of Incyte’s epacadostat and Merck’s Keutruda failed in achieving improved progression free survival over Keytruda alone in phase III study ECHO-301/KEYNOTE-252. The study was evaluating the combination drugs for the treatment unresectable or metastatic melanoma.An external data monitoring committee recommended the termination of the study following the review of the data from the pivotal study.Data from the phase III study demonstrated that a combination of IDO1 inhibitor and PD-1 antagonists may not hold potential in treatment of melanoma which obviously raised doubts over the potential success of indoximod combination studies with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent.Newlink will provide an update when the review is complete. Newlinkclaims that indoximod has a differentiated mechanism of action (MOA) and it has demonstrated that it can improve the outcomes for patients with cancer in combination studies.The results of the ECHO-301 study also affected several companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) which are developing combination immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.NewLink Genetics Corporation Price NewLink Genetics Corporation Price | NewLink Genetics Corporation QuoteZacks Rank NewLink carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Incyte’s stock has been down 32.4% so far this year compared to the industry’s loss of 11.8% in the period.Epacadostat, an IDO1 inhibitor immunotherapy, is a late stage pipeline candidate of Incyte which is being developed in combination with other immunotherapies, which include Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo, and CTLA-4 inhibitor, Yervoy. Incyte is developing the combination therapies in several other indications which includes non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and bladder cancer.Epacadostat combination therapies have achieved improved response rates in mid-stage studies. However, failure in the pivotal melanoma study with larger patient population increases the risk of setback in other late-stage studies for other indications.Following the news of this failure, shares of NewLink Genetics Corporation (NLNK  -  Free Report), a small IA-based biotech company, sank nearly 43% on Friday. Newlink is also developing an IDO pathway inhibitor, indoximod, in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents in several cancer indications, including melanoma.Incyte Corporation Price  Incyte Corporation Price | Incyte Corporation QuoteZacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The candidate is being studied in a pivotal clinical trial, EV-201 (NCT03219333), as monotherapy in this patient setting and in an early-phase clinical trial in combination with CPI therapy, EV-103 (NCT03288545). Both companies are also evaluating enfortumab vedotin in other solid tumors, including ovarian and non-small cell lung carcinoma.Biohaven Pharma Plunges Despite Positive Trial: Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. ’s (BHVN  -  Free Report) shares plunged significantly despite the company announcing positive top-line results from two phase III trials (BHV3000-301 and BHV3000-302) on migraine candidate rimegepant (formerly known as BHV-3000). Rimegepant is an oral CGRP receptor antagonist which is being evaluated for the acute treatment of migraine. CGRP receptor antagonists represent a novel class of drug candidates for the treatment of migraine.The results were statistically significant and clinically meaningful across multiple outcome measures as the candidate met the co-primary efficacy endpoints of superiority to placebo, at two hours post-dose, on pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome symptom. The company is on schedule to submit an NDA for rimegepant in 2019. However, the investors were not much impressed with the data when compared to rival Allergan’s migraine candidate ubrogepant.Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index lost 4.98% over the last five trading sessions.

36,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) has announced that its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for its PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo (nivolumab), in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab) has been accepted by the FDA under priority review.The company seeks an approval for label expansion of the combination therapy for addressing patients, previously treated with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A response from the regulatory body is awaited on Jul 10, 2018.The Opdivo/Yervoy combo regimen has also been granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the aforementioned indication.Notably, Opdivo acquires a nod in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications.Shares of the company have rallied 11.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.4%. The acceptance of the application was based on positive data from Phase II CheckMate-142 study, announced in January 2018, evaluating the combination therapy for the given indication.Results from the study showed that the primary endpoint of objective response rate per investigator assessment was 55% with a median follow-up of 13.4 months. The overall survival rate at one year was 85% and the median OS was not yet reached. The outcomes showed that Opdivo plus Yervoy provide a durable clinical relief in patients with dMMR or MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer.The data demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in key patient reports including symptoms, functioning and quality of life.Significantly, this combination procedure is also under assessment in a phase III, Checkmate-227 trial as a first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Last month, Bristol Myers announced positive data from the program, reflecting superior progression-free survival in first-line NSCLC patients compared with chemotherapy. This is the first study to examine combination regimes of two immune-oncology drugs in first line NSCLC patients with high tumor mutation burden.Per the company’s press release, colorectal is one of the most common cancer types and the third leading cause for terminal disease-related deaths in the United States. Approximately, 140,000 new cases of CRC are expected to be diagnosed annually in the country. Moreover, patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic CRC have mild possibility to benefit from conventional chemotherapy treatment. Hence, approval of this combo treatment will provide the company with access to a huge patient-population base, in need of an alternative treatment option to apprehend the disease.However, Bristol-Myers faces a fierce competitive pressure in the immuno-oncology space. In fact, Opdivo battles against stiff rivalry from Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) anti-PD-1 immunotherapy Keytruda and Roche’s Tecentriq. Merck’s Keytruda is also being analyzed in a phase III study for CRC. Hence, label expansion of Opdivo/Yervoy combination will lend the company a wider population base of patients for Opdivo.A few approved drugs to treat patients with CRC are Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Cyramza, Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Amgen’s Vectibix.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Quote Zacks RankBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

37,BMY,"Merck KGaA  announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has granted SAKIGAKE 'fast-track' designation to its pipeline candidate, tepotinib. The company is developing the candidate for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”).The SAKIGAKE designation is granted to expedite a candidate’s development and review in Japan and focuses on new or unmet areas and regenerative medicines.Merck KGaA’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 14.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.6% in that period.The designation was granted to tepotinib based on data from a phase II study evaluating it in NSCLC patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutations. There is no approved treatment for this indication.Data from the study will be presented at a future medical congress.Apart from tepotinib, Merck KGaA‘s oncology pipeline includes M7824, which is a bifunctional immunotherapy as it simultaneously blocks 2 immuno-inhibitory pathways that are commonly used by cancer cells. The company is evaluating the candidate in several tumors. However, the most advanced candidate in oncology pipeline, avelumab, is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in several indications, including lung, gastric, ovarian and kidney cancer.Per the press release, lung cancer is the most common cancer globally. NSCLC occurs in 80% to 85% of lung cancer patients. However, tepotinib targets only 2% to 3% of NSCLC patients, who have MET exon 14 skipping mutations.However, several big pharma companies are already marketing their drugs to treat NSCLC. These include Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda; Pfizer’s Xalkori and Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo.Merck KGaA Price  Merck KGaA Price | Merck KGaA QuoteWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

38,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc.’s (EXEL  -  Free Report) European partner Ipsen received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) for the use of Cabometyx (cabozantinib) 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg for the first-line treatment of adults with intermediate- or poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The CHMP is the scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). The decision will now be reviewed by the European Commission.We remind investors that Exelixis entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen in February 2016 for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib whereby Ipsen received exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications outside the United States, Canada and Japan.Per the terms, Exelixis is eligible to receive a milestone payment of $50 million for the approval of the first-line treatment of advanced RCC, of which approximately $46 million will be recognized as collaboration revenues in the first quarter 2018. This payment will be paid by Ipsen within 70 days after notification of the approval decision by the European Commission.The FDA approved a tablet formulation of cabozantinib, (distinct from the capsule form) under the brand name Cabometyx in April 2016 for the treatment of advanced RCC in patients who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy.The drug was also approved in Euorpe in September 2016 for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy. The CHMP recommendation to expand the indication is based on results of the CABOSUN trial, which met its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival compared with sunitinib in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC determined to be intermediate- or poor-risk by the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium criteria.In December 2017, the FDA also approved Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC, approximately two months ahead of the assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date. A potential approval in Europe will further boost Exelixis’ top line through milestone payments.  Exelixis’ shares have rallied 6.2% over a year, outperforming the industry’s decline of 8.4%.Exelixis recently submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA for Cabometyx tablets as a treatment for patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.Exelixis has also inked agreements with Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents in 2017.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderExelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock from the same space is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

39,BMY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental Biologics License Application seeking label expansion of Adcetris to include treatment of treatment-naive stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), in combination with chemotherapy. The decision comes more than one month earlier than expected.The FDA also approved the conversion of accelerated approval of Adcetris to regular approval for treatment of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) in patients who have failed at least one multi-agent chemotherapy regimen therapy.The approvals came on the basis of a head-to-head study, ECHELON-1, of Adcetris plus chemotherapy compared to current standard of care.Seattle Genetics’ shares have returned 2.5% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 0.9% in the period.The phase III ECHELON-1 study evaluated Adcetris in combination with a chemotherapy regimen, AVD (Adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine), against ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine), the current standard of care chemotherapy regimen for treatment of newly diagnosed advanced cHL.Data from the study showed that Adcetris combination therapy achieved statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (“PFS”) compared to ABVD. The combination therapy reduced the risk of progression, death or need for additional anticancer therapy by 23% in patients who did not achieve complete remission.The overall survival (“OS”) rate was favorable for the Adcetris regimen.  However, it did not show significant difference. Complete remission was achieved in 73% of the patients treated with Adcetris regimen compared with 70% for ABVD therapy.Per the American Cancer Society, approximately half of 8,500 newly diagnosed patients with Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States will have Stage III/IV disease.Adcetris was already approved in four indications including second or later line treatment for cHL. The drug is the only marketed drug of the company and a major revenue generator. The label expansion will certainly boost its prospects going forward.However, the drug has several competitors including Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, which are approved for relapsed or refractory cHL.Seattle Genetics, Inc.

40,BMY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) incurred first-quarter 2018 loss (excluding goodwill impairment charges) of 19 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 17 cents but narrower than the year-ago loss of 28 cents. Lower costs and higher revenues led to the year-over-year improvement.Total revenues in the quarter soared 165% year over year to $4.1 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03 million. The manufacturing service agreement with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and Frontier Biotechnologies drove the top line.Shares of the company fell 6.5% on May 10 on the wider-than-expected loss and discontinuation of development of three candidates including earlier announced glembatumumab vedotin.However, the stock has not done too well so far this year. It has declined 74.6% compared with the industry’s 11.3% decrease. Quarterly DetailsResearch and development expenses were down 15.1% year over year to $21.9 million during the quarter. General and administrative expenses were $5.6 million, down 22.2% year over year.As of Mar 31, 2017, Celldex had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $123.2 million compared with $139.4 million as of Mar 31, 2018. The biotech company’s weakened cash position was due to higher operating expense, partially offset by net proceeds raised from sales of its common stock this month under a contract with Cantor.2018 OutlookCelldex expects that its cash position as of the end of December plus $6.1 million in net proceeds generated from the sale of its common stock in the last two months and the anticipated proceeds from any future sales of common stock under the agreement with Cantor will be adequate to fund the working capital requirements as well as planned operations through 2020.Discontinued Clinical StudiesIn April 2018, the company announced the failure of its antibody drug conjugate (“ADC”) candidate, glembatumumab vedotin in phase IIb METRIC study, evaluating it in breast cancer. Following the failure, the company has decided to discontinue the development of the candidate across all indications, including metastatic melanoma.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, Celldex announced in its earnings release the discontinuation of development of early phase ADC candidate, CDX-014 and antibody fusion protein candidate, CDX-1401. The company has taken this decision for better allocation of its resources.Pipeline FocusCelldex is now focusing on development of CDX-1140 and CDX-3379. Varlilumab and CDX-301 will be evaluated externally through investigator-sponsored studies. However, the company will evaluate varlilumab and CDX-301 internally in combination studies. There are several preclinical candidates in its pipeline, including CDX-0159.In January 2018, the company closed enrollment for phase II trial, evaluating varlilumab with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo including cohorts in five indications namely colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma.A phase II study is currently evaluating CDX-3379, a human monoclonal antibody, in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Erbitux for the treatment of advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer.A phase I study is evaluating CDX-1140 in several solid tumors and Celldex is planning to add cohorts to evaluate CDX-1140 in combination with CDX-301 or varlilumab.

41,BMY,"This week Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) announced an all-cash deal tobuy immuno-oncology biotech, ARMO Biosciences, Inc. . J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug Darzalex gained FDA approval for combination use in first-line setting while Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced a couple of regulatory/pipeline updates on its PD-L1 inhibitor, Tecentriq. AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) sold rights to a schizophrenia product and its PARP inhibitor, Lynparza gained marketing approval in the EU.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly to Expand Immunotherapy Pipeline with ARMO: Eli Lilly announced a definitive agreement to buy California-based immuno-oncology biotech ARMO BioSciences for $50 per share or approximately $1.6 billion in an all-cash deal. The acquisition will add ARMO's lead product candidate, pegilodecakin to Lilly’s cancer pipeline. Pegilodecakin, a PEGylated IL-10, is being studied in a late-stage study in pancreatic cancer as well as early-stage studies in lung and renal cell cancer, melanoma and other solid tumor types. ARMO BioSciences went public in January this year.Lilly has a well laid out oncology strategy, which involves building on key cancer treatments like Cyramza, Lartruvo and Verzenio as foundational agents while focusing on developing new standard-of-care changing therapies and combination regimens, including immuno-therapies. The ARMO BioSciences acquisition, which adds a promising next generation immunotherapy pipeline asset to Lilly’s portfolio, is in line with this strategy. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018J&J Darzalex Gets FDA Nod in First Line Setting: J&J’s multiple myeloma drug, Darzalexgained FDA approval in first-line setting. With the latest approval, Darzalex can now be prescribed in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP) for the treatment ofpatients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. With theapproval in first-line setting expected this year, it is expected that Darzalex saleswill improve further,going forward.J&J also announced data from two phase III studies evaluating its investigational compound esketamine nasal spray in combination with newly initiated oral antidepressant (“NIOD”) in patients with treatment-resistant depression compared to placebo nasal spray and the NIOD. The combination demonstrated a statistically significant, clinically meaningful rapid reduction of depressive symptoms on treatment with flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray plus NIOD compared to placebo plus NIOD in the study in adults. However, in the study conducted on elderly patients aged 65 and older, though the esketamine arm witnessed clinically meaningful effects compared to the placebo arm, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint. The results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.AstraZeneca Sells Seroquel Rights to Luye Pharma: AstraZeneca announced an agreement to sell Seroquel and Seroquel XR, a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, rights in the UK, China and other international markets to Luye Pharma Group. The total consideration is $538 million, which includes upfront payment of $260 million as well as certain future payments to AstraZeneca. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter, is part of the company’s efforts to focus on its three main therapy areas of Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism and Respiratory.Sales of Seroquel/Seroquel XR have been declining as the drug is facing generic competition since November 2016. In 2017, Seroquel XR recorded sales of $332 million, representing a year-over year decline of 55%.AstraZeneca& Merck’s PARP inhibitor, Lynparza(tablets) gained EUapproval for use as a maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, regardless of patients’ BRCA mutation status. The approval thus expands the eligible patient population for Lynparza. Approval for the same indication in the United States was received in August last year.Roche’s Tecentriq in Focus: Roche’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for label expansion of its PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq was granted priority review by the FDA. With the latest application, Roche is looking to get Tecentriq approved in combination with Avastin (bevacizumab) plus carboplatin and paclitaxel for first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The FDA’s decision is expected on Sep 5, 2018.Tecentriq is presently marketed for the treatment of second-line metastatic NSCLC. Label expansion in first-line setting should boost the drug’s sales further. Tecentriq is also approved for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy. The drug recorded sales of CHF457 million in 2017.In another news on Tecentriq, Roche announced that a late-stage study evaluating the drug in combination with Cotellic in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) compared to regorafenib.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 1.6% in the last five trading sessions. Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Here is how the seven major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions:All stocks were in the green last week except Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), which declined 0.6%.

42,BMY,"Total earnings for 83.1% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 14.7% on revenue growth of 8.1%. The growth rates seem unimpressive when compared with some of the other sectors. Earnings and revenue beat ratios of 88.9% and 75%, respectively, are also not great either.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on Apr 17, followed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) on Apr 24 and Apr 26, respectively. Other major U.S. drug companies — Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) — reported on May 1.

Earnings per share came in at $2.06, 5 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 12.6% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 12.9% year over year to $20.01 billion and edged past the estimated $19.4 billion. Johnson & Johnson raised its revenue guidance from $80.60-$81.40 billion to $81.0-$81.8 billion but maintained its earnings per share outlook of $8.00-$8.20, which reflects growth of 6.8%-9.6% (read: Healthcare ETFs in Focus After Johnson & Johnson Q1 Earnings).PfizerThe U.S. drug giant surpassed earnings estimates but lagged on revenues. Earnings per share of 77 cents came in 3 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $12.9 billion fell shy of the estimated $13.1 billion. On an annual basis, earnings per share and revenues rose 12% and 1%, respectively. For 2018, Pfizer expects revenues in the range of $53.5-$55.5 billion and earnings per share of $2.90-$3.00.MerckMerck also beat earnings estimates but missed on revenues. Earnings per share came in at $1.05, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents and improving 19.3% from the year-ago quarter.

The company has an impressive track record with earnings beating estimates thrice and meeting the same once, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 18.94%.However, Celldex Therapeutics’ shares have lost 72.2% so far this year compared with a 10.8% decline for the industry during this period.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCelldex earns revenues entirely from product development and licensing agreements, and contracts and grants. The company recognizes revenues under its clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) for varlilumab. The company will continue to record revenues from these sources in the first quarter of 2018.With no approved product in its portfolio, investor focus will remain on pipeline development.In April 2018, Celldex had a setback when its lead pipeline candidate, glembatumumab vedotin, failed in the phase IIb breast cancer study – METRIC. The candidate was also not able to demonstrate significant advantage over chemotherapy.In the first quarter, Celldex added a fourth cohort – glembatumumab plus CDX-301 arm – to a phase II study evaluating glembatumumab vedotin in metastatic melanoma.The combination will be evaluated in melanoma patients who have failed prior failed prior checkpoint therapy.The company has another oncology candidate, varlilumab, in its pipeline. In January 2018, the company closed enrollment for a phase II trial, evaluating varlilumab with Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo in several inidcations.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin and varlilumab, Celldex has several promising candidates in its pipeline, including CDX-1401/CDX-301 (phase II—multiple solid tumors) and CDX-014 (phase I—advanced renal cell carcinoma) among others.In January, Celldex expanded its phase I study on CDX-014 in advanced renal cell carcinoma to include patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma.Though R&D and SG&A costs declined in the last reported quarter, operating expenses may vary on a quarterly basis.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Celldex is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 17 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although Celldex’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.

44,BMY,"Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Q1 earnings season which has already crossed the half way mark is gaining strength with earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in seven years.Total earnings for the 267 S&P 500 members that have already reported results are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating top-line estimates and 73.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both earnings and revenue estimates is 61.4%.The ongoing earnings season seems to have started off on a solid note for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among the major large cap players that have reported results, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings as well as sales.Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) also surpassed both earnings and revenue expectations this quarter.Higher demand is expected to boost new product sales. Also, innovation and successful product line expansion along with positive clinical study results, FDA approvals, and consistent performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing population as well as an increased healthcare expenditure are some of the factors that are expected keep the sector on a growth trajectory.Also, according to the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 7% year-over-year growth in revenues and witness a 12.9% rise in earnings in the quarter under review.Four pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report Q1 earnings results on May 1. Let's see, how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is slated to releaseresults before the market opens. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.71% in the last reported quarter. The company’s performance has been impressive in the recent past with its earnings surpassing expectations in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.97%.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.  The combination of the company’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.36 Earnings ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings for the quarter under review is pegged at 74 cents per share.In the Innovative Health segment, new products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are expected to drive the top line. In the Essential Health, biosimilars and emerging markets are expected to support sales. The bottom line is expected to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks.(Read More:Will Pfizer's Earnings Beat Estimates Again in Q1?)Pfizer Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pfizer Inc.

The combination of Gilead’s Zacks Rank of 2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.32% makes us confident about an earnings beat in the upcoming report. The consensus mark for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.66 per share.The company’s Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter as well. The franchise received a further boost with the FDA approval of once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection in February 2018.

The sales guidance for 2018 was also impressive. In October 2017, the FDA approved a label update of the drug to include the addition of new patient-reported outcome data from the COMFORT-I study, as well as updating the warning related to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The pivotal REACH1 trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease has completed enrollment and results are expected in the first half of 2018.Assuming successful results, Incyte expects to submit an sNDA seeking approval of Jakafi for this indication.

45,BMY,"The biggest news this week was Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) announcement of its plans to re-organize its business into three new segments, effective next year. J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) was ordered by a St Louis jury to pay approximately $4.7 billion to nearly two dozen women in a lawsuit related to its talc-based products. Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) provided updates on their cancer drugs.Pfizer to Re-Organize Business Units: Pfizer is re-organizing its business into three business segments, separating its consumer healthcare business into a standalone unit. Beginning 2019, Pfizer will report under three new business units — Innovative Medicines, Established Medicines and Consumer Healthcare. Presently, Pfizer has two reporting segments namely Innovative Health and Essential Health.The present Innovative Health unit will be called the Innovative Medicines unit and will now include biosimilars and a new hospital business unit for anti-infectives and sterile injectables — both of which are presently reported under Essential Health. The Essential Health unit will now be renamed to Established Medicines. This unit will include Pfizer’s legacy brands that have lost or will lose market exclusivity. (Read more: Pfizer to Reorganize Business Into Three New Units)J&J to Pay $4.7 Billion in Talc Lawsuit: J&J was ordered by a jury in a St. Louis court to pay $4.69 billion in damages to 22 women who alleged that its talc-based products, including its baby powders, contained asbestos, which caused them to develop ovarian cancer. The damages comprised $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages. J&J, in an official statement, said the verdict was unfair and it would appeal against it. It also said its talc products neither contained asbestos nor caused cancer. J&J faces more than 9,000 cases for its talc products. Trump Slams Pfizer for Price Hikes; Pfizer Defers Increases: In a tweet, President Donald Trump slammed Pfizer for raising prices of several of its prescription drugs, effective from Jul 1. Trump said Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers should be “ashamed” that they had raised drug prices for “no reason.” The tweet also said that by raising drug prices in the United States, these drug companies were offering “bargain basement prices” overseas. He warned that the administration will respond. A day after this tweet was published, Pfizer issued a statement saying it will defer the price increases until the President’s drug pricing blueprint goes into effect or until the end of the year, whichever is earlier. AbbVie’s Imbruvica Lymphoma Study Fails: AbbVie announced that a late-stage study evaluating its cancer drug Imbruvica for the first-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) failed to meet the primary endpoint.The study evaluated the addition of Imbruvica to R-CHOP (combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), which is the existing standard of care for DLBCL, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) versus R-CHOP plus placebo. However, the study data showed that adding Imbruvica to R-CHOP did not improve event-free survival (EFS) in the targeted patient population. Imbruvica is presently FDA approved for eight indications including five B-cell blood cancers, as well as in chronic graft-versus-host-disease. The drug, which AbbVie markets in partnership with J&J, recorded sales of $762 million in the first quarter of 2018. This included U.S. sales of $624 million, up 36.7%, and $138 million (up 47.2%) of international profit sharing with J&J.AbbVie also filed a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for a label expansion of Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  AbbVie is looking to get Venclexta approved in combination with a hypomethylating agent (“HMA”) or with low-dose cytarabine (“LDAC”) in AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. (Read more: AbbVie's Imbruvica Fails in Phase III Blood Cancer Study)Merck’s Keytruda sBLA Gets Priority Review: Merck’s supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) looking to expand the label of Keytruda for previously treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, was granted priority review by the FDA. The FDA’s decision is expected on Nov 9. The sBLA filing was based on data from the phase II KEYNOTE-224 study.

The combination is now approved for previously treated patients with DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer. The Opdivo + Yervoy combination is also approved in two other tumor types — first-line treatment of intermediate or poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma and unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

46,BMY,"There were not many developments in the pharma sector this week. Swiss pharma giant Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that it is buying the remaining stake in molecular information company, Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI  -  Free Report) for $2.4 billion. Small drugmaker, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (PTCT  -  Free Report) unveiled promising early-stage data on its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) candidate.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRoche to Buy Remaining Stake in Foundation Medicine: Swiss pharma giant Roche said it will buy the remaining stake in molecular information company, Foundation Medicine for $137 per share, which adds up to a total transaction value of $2.4 billion. The price of $137 marks a premium of 29% on the closing price of Foundation Medicine on Jun 18 and values the Cambridge, MA-based company at $5.3 billion. The deal aims to strengthen Roche’s development efforts of personalized therapies to treat cancer by leveraging Foundation Medicine’s high quality comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) testing and innovative data services. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year. Roche initially had bought roughly 57% stake in Foundation Medicine in 2015 for around $1 billion. (Read More: Roche to Buy Rest of Foundation Medicine for $2.4 billion)PTC Therapeutics Unveils Promising Early-Stage Data on SMA drug: PTC Therapeutics presented encouraging preliminary data from an early-stage study evaluating its gene therapy candidate, risdiplam in babies with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). The early-stage data demonstrated improved muscle performance in nearly 90% of babies treated with risdiplam. Shares of PTC Therapeutics rose almost 28% in response to the news.However, shares of PTC Therapeutics declined sharply on, the day following the announcement. This was because rival company, Sarepta Therapeutics announced better-than-expected results from an early-stage study, evaluating its gene therapy as a treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). PTC Therapeutics also markets therapies to treat DMD.FDA Accepts Bristol-Myers sBLA for Opdivo/Yervoy Combo in Lung Cancer: Bristol Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for label expansion of its PD-L1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) in combination with low-dose Yervoy in first-line lung cancer was accepted by the FDA. Bristol Myers is looking to get this combination of two immunotherapy drugs approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in patients with tumor mutational burden ≥10 mutations per megabase. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Feb 20 next year.Shire’s HAE Drug Gets FDA Nod for Pediatric Population: Shire gained FDA approval for label expansion of its hereditary angioedema (HAE) drug Cinryze to include use in pediatric patients 6 years and older. Cinryze was approved in the United States in October 2008 for routine prophylaxis, against attacks in adolescents and adults living with HAE, a rare genetic disorder that causes painful swelling to various parts of the body. The approval for the pediatric population should drive sales of the drug higher in future quarters.Novo Nordisk Signs Deal with Kallyope; Presents Positive Diabetes Studies Results: Denmark based pharma giant Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) entered into a collaboration with New York based biotech Kallyope Inc. to discover peptide therapeutics for obesity and diabetes. Per the deal, Kallyope will receive an upfront payment and potential research, development and sales milestones depending on the terms of the deal. Novo Nordisk also has an option agreement to license exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize up to six products discovered as part of the collaboration. In case, Novo Nordisk exercises the option, Kallyope will be entitled to receive a license fee. Novo Nordisk also presented headline results from two phase III studies on the oral formulation of its type II diabetes medicine, semaglutide. While the first study (PIONEER 4) compared oral semaglutide to Novo Nordisk’s other diabetes medicine Victoza, the other study (PIONEER 7) compared oral semaglutide to Merck’s (MRK) Januvia (sitagliptin). Both the studies showed that oral semaglutide led to statistically significant reductions in HbA1c and weight compared to Victoza and Januvia, respectively. Semaglutide is presently sold as Ozempic, a weekly injection in several countries.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1% in the last five trading sessions. Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Here is how the seven major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions:All the stocks recorded a decline last week, except Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers, which were flat.

47,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced positive results from the phase II study, ELOQUENT-3, on oncology drug, Empliciti.The study is evaluating the addition of Empliciti to Pomalyst and low-dose dexamethasone (EPd) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The international study is evaluating Pomalyst-based triplet combination in patients with RRMM, who received at least two prior therapies, including Revlimid and a proteasome inhibitor.The study achieved its primary endpoint as the results show a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients treated with EPd compared with only Pomalyst and dexamethasone (Pd).The data were also presented at the 23rd Congress of the European Hematology Association.Data from the study showed that patients randomized to EPd experienced a 46% reduction in risk of disease progression compared with patients randomized to Pd alone, with median PFS of 10.3 months compared with 4.7 months in Pd patients.Additionally, the PFS benefit experienced among patients randomized to EPd was consistent among patients who had received two to three prior lines of therapy and four or more prior lines of therapy.The combination therapy, if approved, can provide an important treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma whose disease has progressed after treatment with lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.Bristol-Myers is co-developing Empliciti with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). Bristol-Myers’ shares have declined 9.4% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 1.8%.Earlier, the company announced that the China National Drug Administration has approved its blockbuster immuno-oncology drug Opdivo, for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior platinum-based chemotherapy in adult patients without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.Per the company, this is the first and only PD-1 inhibitor approved in China. The approval was based on data from the pivotal phase III study, CheckMate-078 trial, in which 90% of the patients enrolled were from China.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications.Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classical Hodgkin lymphoma — in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).  The drug has been performing impressively, due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and second-line NSCLC.Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.However, Opdivo faces stiff competition from Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq which can limit market share gains.Zacks Rank & Another Stock to ConsiderBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

48,BMY,"This week was ruled by cancer data presentations at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) in Chicago by pharma bigwigs like Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report), among others. JAK inhibitors were in the news this week with Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) finally gaining FDA approval for its rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) candidate Olumiant (baricitinib) in the United States while AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) presented positive top-line data from its fifth late-stage study on upadacitinib in RA.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesUpdate from ASCO: Merck stole the show at ASCO after presenting data from several cancer studies of its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda. Key presentations were from two pivotal lung cancer trials. KEYNOTE-042 study evaluated Keytruda monotherapy in newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients while KEYNOTE-407 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy in difficult-to treat squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Both the studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to improved survival. Particularly, data from the KEYNOTE- 407 study, which evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC was considered “practice changing” by investors.Four and five years follow-up data presented from two advanced melanoma studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to long-term survival benefit. Interim data from a cohort of a phase II study, KEYNOTE-158, evaluating Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) demonstrated encouraging response rates in the overall population of SCLC patients as well as in patients whose tumors express PD-L1. Keytruda also demonstrated encouraging ORR in studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types and Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC.Bristol-Myers and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) presented preliminary data from a mid-stage study evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Bristol-Myers’PD-L1 inhibitor, Opdivo in several tumor types. The response rates in melanoma and kidney cancer patients did not impress investors, resulting in a 42% drop in Nektar’s stock on Monday.  (Read more: Nektar and Bristol-Myers Present Data on Cancer Study)Bristol-Myers also presented data on Opdivo at ASCO. In a late-stage study evaluating Opdivo versus Yervoy in a broad range of patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma, Opdivo demonstrated sustained, superior recurrence-free survival versus Yervoy. In another study, Opdivo plus chemotherapy showed improved PFS versus chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer patients with PD-L1 expression <1%.Novartis (NVS) announced positive data from a combination study on breast cancer drug Kisqali and from two long-term leukemia studies on Tasigna. (Read more: Novartis Announces Positive Data on Kisqali and Tasigna).Roche presented data from a late-stage study, which showed that Tecentriq (atezolizumab) plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 29% in advanced squamous NSCLC patients versus chemotherapy alone.AbbVie presented early data from a phase II study evaluating a combination of its cancer drugs Imbruvica plus Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The data demonstrated high rates of responses in such patients. Also, interim data from a late-stage study evaluating Imbruvica plus Roche’s Rituxan in Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, a rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, showed that the combination significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 80% compared to placebo plus Rituxan.Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca and J&J also made some cancer data presentations at the meeting.Lilly Gets FDA Nod for Lower Dose of Olumiant: Eli Lilly and partner Incyte gained FDA approval for the lower dose of (2 mg) of the companies’ JAK inhibitor, Olumiant. The FDA did not approve the higher dose (4 mg) and the drug’s label was approved with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis. Olumiant is already marketed in Europe and Japan and generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. In the United States, Lilly faced significant trouble in getting FDA nod for Olumiant. In April last year, the FDA had issued a complete response letter for the new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant, requesting additional information to determine the most appropriate doses. This year in April, an FDA advisory committee had recommended approval of the lower dose of the drug while not recommending the higher dose of 4 mg on inadequate safety profile to support an approval relative to its benefits. (Read more: Eli Lilly's Olumiant Gets FDA Nod for Rheumatoid Arthritis).AbbVie’s 5th Late-Stage Upadacitinib Study Succeeds: AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, met all primary as well as secondary endpoints in the fifth phase III study from its SELECT program. Top-line data from the study showed thata significantly higher proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib in both 15 and 30 mg doses achieved superior responses compared to chemotherapy agent methotrexate. AbbVie plans to submit regulatory applications for upadacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of the year.  (Read more: Abbvie’s Upadacitinib Fifth RA Study Data Positive)Allergan Under Activist Pressure to Split CEO-Chairman Roles: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) was under pressure this week after two hedge-fund firms, Senator Investment Group and Appaloosa, disclosed a letter urging the company to engage in a management and board overhaul. The firms asked the pharmaceutical company to split its chairman and chief executive roles, both presently held by Brent Saunders, among other management changes. Appaloosa run by David Tepper and Senator Investment Group run by Douglas Silverman, suggested an outsider should be hired for either of the roles. The letter comes on the heels of Allergan’s strategic plan announced last week to divest its women's health and infectious disease units. Allergan responded by saying that the board has been refreshed with the addition of three members in the last 16 months.

49,BMY,"The world of cancer research is changing fast. This space is seeing huge developments and companies are taking great strides in treating a variety of cancers.Cancer research is definitely an exciting area and one that investors will keep a close watch on in the coming years. This is because the disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world preceded only by heart disease.The five-day ASCO conference in Chicago, which is basically the most important annual cancer research event, concluded yesterday. The conference featured clinical updates from several companies about the latest developments in treating the disease.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) stole the limelight at ASCO after presenting data from several cancer studies of its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda.The data presentation from Merck, which garnered the most attention from physicians and investors was from a second interim analysis of a pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda — phase III KEYNOTE-407 study. The study evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC, which is a difficult-to-treat lung cancer patient population. The data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival regardless of PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 is a protein present on the surface of cells.The risk of death (OS) was reduced by 36% compared to chemotherapy alone. The PFS improvement was nearly half for patients in the Keytruda combination group compared with chemotherapy alone.The data was termed “practice changing” by CNBC – changing the way doctors look at prescribing these drugs to cancer patients. It further cemented Merck’s position in the lung cancer market, which is the most lucrative oncology sector.In this context, we must mention that Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) also presented data from a similar late-stage study, which showed that Tecentriq (atezolizumab) plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 29% in advanced squamous NSCLC patients versus chemotherapy alone.Coming back to Merck, the company also presented data from another pivotal lung cancer study (KEYNOTE-042) evaluating Keytruda monotherapy in first-line NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression of at least 1%. This study also showed that treatment with Keytruda led to improved survival. Meanwhile, four and five years follow-up data presented from two advanced melanoma studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to long-term survival benefit. Interim data from a cohort of a phase II study, KEYNOTE-158, evaluating Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) demonstrated encouraging response rates in the overall population of SCLC patients as well as in patients whose tumors express PD-L1.Meanwhile, Keytruda also demonstrated encouraging ORR in studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types and Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC. Merck & partner AstraZeneca also presented positive Lynparza combo data in breast cancer. Shares of Merck have gone up by more than 3% since Friday, Jun 1 on ASCO strength.Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) was the biggest loser at ASCO. Nektar along with partner Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), presented preliminary data from a mid-stage study evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Bristol-Myers’ PD-L1 inhibitor Opdivo in several tumor types. The response rates in melanoma and kidney cancer patients did not impress investors, resulting in a 42% fall in Nektar’s stock on Jun 4, which was probably the worst performance by an S&P 500 Index member in the last five years. (Read more: Nektar and Bristol-Myers Present Data on Cancer Study).Merck, Bristol-Myers and Nektar currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bristol-Myers also presented data on Opdivo at ASCO. In a late-stage study evaluating Opdivo versus Yervoy in a broad range of patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma, Opdivo demonstrated sustained, superior recurrence-free survival versus Yervoy. In the study, Opdivo plus chemotherapy showed improved PFS versus chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer patients with PD-L1 expression <1%.Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) and partner Bluebird Bio presented early-stage data for the CAR-T cell therapy bb2121 in patients with late-stage relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Though the study showed a median PFS of 11.8 months in this heavily pre-treated patient population, the data did not impress investors.Celgene also presented data on another CAR-T therapy - liso-ce (JCAR017) - which it acquired from its acquisition of Juno earlier this year. The data showed that at six months, 49% of the patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remained in remission while 46% maintained a complete response. (Read more: Celgene Presents Data on CAR T Therapy, Revlimid & Pomalyst)Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced positive data from a combination study on breast cancer drug Kisqali and from two long-term leukemia studies on Tasigna. (Read More: Novartis Announces Positive Data on Kisqali and Tasigna).AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) presented early data from a phase II study evaluating a combination of its cancer drugs Imbruvica plus Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  The data demonstrated high rates of responses in such patients. Also, interim data from a late-stage study evaluating Imbruvica plus Roche’s Rituxan in Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, a rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, showed that the combination significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 80% compared to placebo plus Rituxan.Pfizer, Amgen, AstraZeneca and J&J also made some cancer data presentations at the meeting.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

50,BMY,"Nektar Therapeutics ((NKTR  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) announced preliminary data from the ongoing PIVOT phase I/II study at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. The study is evaluating the combination of Nektar's lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214 with Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab).  The company presented data for patients enrolled in the phase I dose-escalation stage of the study and for the first patients consecutively enrolled in select dose expansion cohorts in phase II.   The PIVOT study showed that pre-specified efficacy criteria were achieved in three tumor types: first-line melanoma, first-line renal cell carcinoma (a type of kidney cancer) and first-line urothelial cancer. Both the companies plan to commence a phase III registrational study in first-line advanced melanoma patients in the third quarter of 2018, and pivotal studies are also being designed in renal cell carcinoma and urothelial cancer.  If the efficacy criteria at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is met in the first stage (N1) of patients consecutively enrolled or in the second stage (N1 + N2) of patients consecutively enrolled, the combination regimen would be advanced to registrational trials in that tumor type.   Results in treatment-naïve patients with Stage IV metastatic melanoma showed that the objective response rate (ORR) in the first part of the study was 85% in 13 treated subjects, while responses were observed in 50% of 28 patients in stage two of the study.Further, data showed that in treatment-naïve patients with Stage IV metastatic renal cell carcinoma-, the ORR in stage one of the study was 64% in 11 patients, while responses were seen in 46% of 26 patients in the second phase of the study. Finally, results in treatment-naïve patients with Stage IV metastatic urothelial carcinoma showed that the ORR in the first part of the study was 60% in 10 patients, with the same response rate in both PD-L1 negative patients and in those with PD-L1 positive tumours.The companies added that enrolment is also continuing in the second stage of the PIVOT trial with over 400 patients with melanoma, renal cell, urothelial, non-small-cell lung and triple negative breast cancers. The companies added that overall in the study, at week three, 53% of 17 patients with a PD-L1 negative status at baseline were converted to PD-L1 positive status. Results showed that of these subjects, 78% achieved either stable disease, partial response or a complete response.Shares of the company were down by more than 40% as the response rates in melanoma and kindney cancer studies were below market expectations.       The companies believe that NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo can potentially expand the treatment benefits we can bring to patients with cancer. The companies added that enrolment is also continuing in the second stage of the PIVOT trial with over 400 patients with melanoma, renal cell, urothelial, non-small-cell lung and triple negative breast cancers.Shares of Nektar have decreased 33.3% year to date, compared with the industry’s gain of 3%.We note that, Opdivo, became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval in July 2014. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classical Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.We also note that in February 2018, Nektar inked an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb to jointly develop and commercialize NKTR-214 in combination with the Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) in more than 20 indications across 9 tumor types.Nektar is also conducting a phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab). Notably, this PROPEL study complements the company’s ongoing PIVOT trial.Stocks That Warrant a LookNektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

51,BMY,"Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INFI  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 14 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2017, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents. The company had reported a loss of 46 cents in the year-ago quarter.Since Infinity does not have any approved product in its portfolio, the company earns revenues in the form of royalties, license and milestone payments as well as research and development (R&D) support fees paid by its partners.Infinity’s shares have declined 15.7% over a year against the industry’s gain of 3.8%. Quarter in DetailIn the quarter, R&D expenses plummeted to $3.6 million from $14.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline was mainly due to the company's 2016 restructuring activities and out-licensing of duvelisib to Verastem Inc. (VSTM  -  Free Report).General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $4.5 million for the quarter, down from $8.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to the company's 2016 restructuring activities.2018 Outlook Infinity expects net loss for 2018 to be in the range of $35-$40 million. The company anticipates year-end cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities balance in the $15-$25 million range. Moreover, Infinity expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities as of Dec 31, 2017 should be adequate to fund the company's capital needs through third-quarter 2019.2017 ResultsThe company reported a loss of 83 cents in 2017 compared with a loss of 61 cents in 2016.Collaboration revenues in 2017 came in at $6 million, down from $18.7 million in 2016.Other UpdatesInfinity is evaluating IPI-549 as a monotherapy and in combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in a phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors.The phase I/Ib monotherapy and combination dose escalation components of the study have been completed and the monotherapy expansion component has been fully enrolled. Further, six disease-specific combination expansion cohorts are enrolling at the recommended phase II dose of 40 mg once daily of IPI-549 plus Opdivo at 240 mg every two weeks in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, mesothelioma, and adrenocortical carcinoma.An additional combination expansion cohort of patients pre-selected for having high baseline blood levels of myeloid derived suppressor cells is expected to open for enrollment in the next few weeks.In November 2017, Infinity announced updated data from the monotherapy dose-escalation component of the Phase I/Ib study of IPI-549 at the SITC Annual Meeting 2017. These data demonstrated that IPI-549 dosed once daily was well tolerated and clinically active.The company believes that IPI-549 has the potential to increase the number of patients who respond to immunotherapies as well as to increase the duration of those responses.The company expects to report data from the monotherapy expansion and combination dose escalation components of its study and from seven combination expansion cohorts which will help define the development and regulatory strategy for IPI-549.Our TakeThe restructuring initiatives taken by the company have lowered operating expenses. We expect the initiatives to have a significant positive cumulative effect on the company’s margin.Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

52,BMY,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AVEO  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 8 cents per share (excluding gains due to a change in fair value of warrant liability), wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents as well as the year-ago loss of 13 cents. However, including gains related to a change in fair value of warrant liability, the company reported earnings of 3 cents.AVEO’s first drug, Fotivda (tivozanib) received EU approval in August 2017 for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Subsequently, in November 2017, AVEO along with its partner EUSA Pharma, launched the drug in Europe, starting with Germany. The company is entitled to receive double-digit royalty payments from EUSA Pharma on net sales of the drug in Europe. However, Fotivda is not yet approved in the United States for RCC.AVEO’s top line mainly comprises collaboration revenues, milestone and other payments. Total collaboration revenues in the fourth quarter were approximately $0.08 million, down 20% compared with the year-ago figure. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 million.Shares of the company have declined more than 4% on Mar 13, following the earnings release, due to wider loss and lower sales. However, on a year-to-date basis, AVEO’s share price movement shows that the stock has outperformed the industry. Specifically, the company’s shares have gained 3.9% compared with the industry’s increase of 3%.Quarterly HighlightsResearch & development expenses were down 26% to about $5.7 million. However, general and administrative expenses increased 26.3% year over year to $2.4 million.Pipeline UpdatesIn October 2017, AVEO announced results of a pre-planned futility analysis of phase III TIVO-3 study, comparing Fotivda to Bayer’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) Nexavar, as treatment for patients with refractory advanced RCC. Based on the results, the company will continue the study unmodified. The data from this study along with the previously completed TIVO-1 study will support the regulatory application for approval in the United States.In December 2017, the company announced the completion of enrollment in phase II portion of phase Ib/II TiNivo study, evaluating Fotivda in combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in RCC. The company expects to provide updates from the study in the second half of 2018.Apart from Fotivda, AVEO is also developing ficlatuzumab in combination with Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Erbitux in a phase II study for treating metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Another phase Ib study is evaluating ficlatuzumab in combination with Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in treatment-naive pancreatic cancer. These studies were initiated in December last year.2017 ResultsFull-year sales stood at $7.6 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.3 million. However, the top line drastically increased 204% compared with the year-ago figure of $2.5 million.The full-year earnings of 61 cents per share were narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents.

53,BMY,"The cancer/oncology space has always been keenly watched by investors interested in the pharma/biotech sector. This is because the disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world preceded only by heart disease.Major players in this field include Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report). Cancer drugs are the most important revenue drivers for these bigwigs as well as their smaller counterparts like Clovis Oncology, Tesaro, and Puma Biotechnology among othersEvolution of the Cancer SpaceA lot of progress has been made in this area in the last few years. Companies are aiming to bring out newer and better treatments like immunotherapies, gene therapy, targeted therapy and other novel therapies.In fact, focus in this area has increased with the FDA approval of CAR-T therapies - Novartis’ Kymriah and Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta - last year. The path-breaking immunocellular therapy is a one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T-cells to fight cancer. The acquisitions of Kite by Gilead and Juno by Celgene have led to renewed interest in this area.Interest in PARP inhibitors has also increased considerably as they could well be the next major class of therapeutics in oncology.According to IMSQuintiles, 68 new cancer drugs were approved for 22 indications from 2011 to 2016. Worldwide costs for cancer therapeutics and supportive care drugs shot up from $91 billion in 2012 to $113 billion in 2016 with the United States accounting for 46% of the costs. More than 600 molecules are in late-stage development, with the majority being targeted therapy, which attack a specific feature, or target, in cancer cells.New Cancer DrugsNew oncology brands including Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo, Merck’s Keytruda, Pfizer’s Ibrance and AbbVie/J&J’s Imbruvica are fast catching up  and giving tough competition to category stalwarts such as Avastin, Herceptin, and Rituxan. New cancer drugs approved last year include Pfizer/Merck KGaA’s Bavencio for bladder cancer, Eli Lilly’s Verzenio, Novartis’ Kisqali, Puma Biotechnology’s Nerlynx for breast cancer and Tesaro’s Zejula for ovarian cancer.The most common indications for new drugs are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma, and breast cancer.Is the Patient Population Benefiting?It goes without saying that these new drugs bring in millions of bucks for the companies as these are sold for a huge amount of money. However, are these doing enough to cure patients or help them live longer or better? Are these relieving them of pain or fatigue, considering the fact that these come at a premium?While the FDA has approved a number of oncology drugs in recent years and also lowered the bar for clinical study goals of cancer candidates, the disease still remains the top cause of death in many populations. Here’s probably why.A few of these drugs have been successful in allowing patients with limited life expectancies to live for years. However, the efficacy of several others is being questioned as they have led to only marginal benefits with not much improvement in survival or quality of life.Many drugs are being approved based on progression free survival - the amount of time the patients live without their tumors growing larger - without evidence of benefit on survival or quality of life. This is specially the case for drugs that aim to treat terminal cancers with few treatment options. However, overall survival (OS) data, once available, sometimes shows that the drug does not help people live longer.  Also, when drugs do offer survival benefits, the gains are often marginal. The risks and long-term side effects of some drugs have also been underestimated.Overall cancer survival has barely changed over the past decade, which raises concerns about the push to get more drugs approved instead of getting effective drugs approved.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

54,BMY,"AstraZeneca, plc (AZN  -  Free Report) has announced that final overall survival data from the pivotal phase III MYSTIC study, evaluating its PD-L1 inhibitor Imfinzi in the first line lung cancer, will be presented in the second half of 2018, delayed from the first half expected previously.The MYSTIC study evaluated Imfinzi, both as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, in treatment-naïve non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.AstraZeneca’s shares have inched up 0.2% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s growth of 1.7%. This is the second negative update from AstraZeneca in relation to the MYSTIC trial. Last July, the pharma company had reported about the study’s failure to meet its primary endpoint of progression-free-survival, sending the company’s shares tumbling.The study showed that Imfinzi in combination with tremelimumab could not improve progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients, whose tumors express PD-L1 on 25% or more of their cancer cells. Imfinzi monotherapy also fell short of showing a benefit on PFS.However, the MYSTIC study continued thereafter as planned to assess the additional primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) for both monotherapy and combination regimen. Final OS data from both primary endpoints were initially expected during the first half of 2018.Imfinzi is a key drug in London-based AstraZeneca’s immuno-oncology (IO) pipeline, currently being evaluated for multiple cancers either alone or in combination with other regimens including Incyte’s (INCY  -  Free Report) epacadostat. Key phase III trials in combination with tremelimumab for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer), NSCLC, small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) among others are under way.Imfinzi was launched in the United States for the first indication — second-line advanced bladder cancer — in May 2017. It was approved for the second indication in the United States — early stage lung cancer (NSCLC) — in February 2018. The drug generated sales of $19 million last year.Talking about PD-L1 inhibitors, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Bristol Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo have been notable successful launches. While Keytruda fetched in sales of $3.8 billion in 2017, up almost 172% year over year, Opdivo recorded $1.36 billion of revenues during the period, up 4%.AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

55,BMY,"Last week, U.S. Senator Tina Smith expressed concerns that big pharma companies plan to use their large corporate tax savings to reward shareholders instead of bringing down costs of expensive drugs and benefiting consumers. The Senator questioned through letters to CEOs of five big pharma companies — Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) — how they plan to use their extra cash.Please note that on their Q4 conference calls held earlier this year, most big pharma companies discussed what they plan to do with the extra cash they save from the new tax bill. These companies plan to invest the extra cash in capital expenditures, products/pipeline, in-licensing or acquisition deals or rewarding shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. Not many talked about taking any steps to lower prescription drug costs.This apart, key announcements this week included the failure of Dermira, Inc.’s (DERM  -  Free Report) acne candidate in two pivotal late-stage studies, Merck’s oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai, expansion of Jardiance clinical studies by Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and FDA committee backing for Pfizer’s Xeljanz for the third indication.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesDermira Shares Sink as Acne Candidate Fails: Shares of Dermira plunged after it announced that its acne candidate, olumacostat glasaretil, surprisingly failed to meet the primary endpoint in either of the two pivotal phase III studies -- CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2. The company said that it will likely stop olumacostat glasaretil’s development following this failure.

56,BMY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) has incurred fourth-quarter 2017 loss (excluding income tax benefit of $19.1 million) of 17 cents per share, narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents as well as the year-ago loss of 30 cents. Lower costs and higher revenues led to this upside.Total revenues in the quarter soared 84.4% year over year to $3.5 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.91 million. The manufacturing service agreement with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative drove the top line.Shares of the company rose 2% in after-hours trading on Mar 7.However, the stock has not done too well in the past year. Shares of the company have underperformed its industry, having declined 28.4% compared with the industry’s 3.9% decrease. Quarterly DetailsResearch and development expenses declined 4.5% from the year-ago period to $23.5 million. General and administrative spend improved 50.6% to $5.9 million.As of Dec 31, 2017, Celldex had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $139.4 million compared with $140.5 million as of Sep 30, 2017. The biotech company’s weakened cash position was due to higher operating expense, partially offset by net proceeds raised from sales of its common stock this month under the contract with Cantor.2017 ResultsTotal revenues for the year surged 87.8% to $12.7 million, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.57 million.Net loss for 2017 (excluding income tax benefit of $24.3 million) came in at 91 cents per share, slightly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. However, the company had reported $1.27 of loss a year ago.2018 OutlookCelldex expects that its cash position as of December 2017-end plus $6.1 million in net proceeds generated from the sale of its common stock in the last two months and the anticipated proceeds from any future sales of common stock under the agreement with Cantor will be adequate to fund the working capital requirements as well as the planned operations through 2018.Pipeline UpdateCelldex’s most advanced pipeline candidate is antibody drug conjugate, glembatumumab vedotin, currently under evaluation for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (phase IIb METRIC study) and metastatic melanoma (phase II). Enrolment in the key METRIC study was completed in August 2017 with top-line data expected in the second quarter of 2018. The company also plans to file a biologics license application in the second half of 2019.In the melanoma study, Celldex added a fourth cohort, a glembatumumab plus CDX-301 arm. The combination will be studied on patients with failed prior checkpoint therapy.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, promising candidates in the company’s pipeline include varlilumab, CDX-3379 and CDX-014.In January 2018, the company closed enrollment for phase II trial, evaluating varlilumab with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo including cohorts in five indications namely colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma.Celldex expanded its phase I study in January, assessing CDX-014 in advanced renal cell carcinoma to include patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma.In November 2017, the company initiated a phase II program on CDX-3379 in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Erbitux in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, having developed resistance to Erbitux.The company also commenced a phase I study in the same month to evaluate CDX-014 for treating locally advanced or metastatic solid tumorsCelldex Therapeutics, Inc.

57,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA approved Opdivo label update for flexible flat-dosing options every two weeks (240 mg) or every four weeks (480 mg) for a majority of approved indications.  Opdivo is now the first and only FDA-approved PD-1 Inhibitor for every four-week dosing. Further, Opdivo also was approved for a shorter 30-minute infusion across all approved indications.Bristol-Myers’shares have returned 15.7% over a year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 8.4%.  The new dosing schedule is available for use in patients with metastatic melanoma, either as monotherapy or monotherapy phase after combination treatment with Yervoy (ipilimumab). It will also be available for patients with previously treated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, advanced renal cell carcinoma following prior anti-angiogenic therapy and previously treated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma following disease progression during or after platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also available for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma, recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as an adjuvant therapy for patients with completely resected melanoma with lymph node involvement or metastatic disease. We remind investors that Opdivo became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval in the world in July 2014. Notably, the drug became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classic Hodgkin lymphoma — in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions.  It also received approvals for several indications including melanoma, head and neck, lung, kidney and blood cancer. In fact, the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen is approved in multiple markets for the treatment of melanoma.Opdivo, generated revenues of $1.36 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 4% from the year-ago period. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report), Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report) and Enanta Pharma (ENTA  -  Free Report).

58,BMY,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AVEO  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 28.Last quarter, AVEO delivered a positive surprise of 60%.The company significantly outperformed the industry last year. The stock surged 207.1% against a decline of 2.8% for the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayIn November 2017, AVEO launched Fotivda in Europe starting with Germany, making the drug its first commercial product. The company will receive double-digit royalty payments from EUSA Pharma on net sales of the drug in Europe. However, the impact on the top line remains to be seen.In August 2017, the European Commission approved Fotivda (tivozanib) for treating first-line treatment for renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) in adults. The drug has demonstrated superiority over Bayer’s Nexavar in treating RCC.In October 2017, AVEO announced results of a pre-planned futility analysis of phase III TIVO-3 study comparing Fotivda to Bayer’s Nexavar as treatment for patients with refractory advanced RCC. Based on the results, the company will continue the study unmodified. The data from this study along with previously completed TIVO-1 study will support the regulatory application for approval in the United States.In December 2017, the company announced completion of enrollment in phase II portion of phase I/II TiNivo study evaluating Fotivda in combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in RCC.Apart from Fotivda, AVEO is also developing ficlatuzumab in combination with Lilly’s Erbitux in a phase II study for treating metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Another phase Ib study is evaluating the candidate in combination with Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in treatment-naive pancreatic cancer. These studies were initiated during the quarter.We expect research & development expenses to increase in the quarter due to initiation of ficlatuzumab studies and continuation of TIVO-3 study.Investor focus will likely remain on updates related to Fotivda’s launch and progress of ficlatuzumab.Surprise HistoryAVEO’s performance over the last four quarters has been mixed with the company surpassing expectations thrice and missing once with an average positive surprise of 16.37%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AVEO is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% with both pegged at a loss of 3 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although AVEO’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

With this designation, a candidate is expected to be granted a priority review once it files a new drug application.Calithera’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 25.7% compared with the industry’s fall of 0.6%.Calithera’s CB-839, a selective, potent inhibitor of glutaminase, is being evaluated in a phase II study – CANTATA – in combination with Cabometyx in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) in patients previously treated with at least one vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor or the combination of Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo (nivolumab) and Yervoy (ipilimumab).The study is currently enrolling patients and the primary endpoint is improved progression free survival.Per the press release, there are a number of therapies approved for RCC. However, there still remains a significant unmet need in advanced stage patients who have failed prior systemic therapy.Kidney cancer is among the top 10 common cancer types globally, per the American Cancer Society.

60,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) entered into a research collaboration agreement with Harvard Fibrosis Network of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.Both companies have teamed up to discover and develop potential new therapies for fibrotic diseases, including fibrosis of the liver and heart.Per the terms of the agreement, leading academic investigators of hepatic and cardiac fibrosis from the Harvard Fibrosis Network will collaborate with leading scientists from Bristol-Myers Squibb on four projects over three years. These projects will focus on applied fibrosis biology, identification of noninvasive biomarkers, and novel targets for potential anti-fibrotic therapies, in the areas of hepatic and cardiac fibrosis.Bristol-Myers is building a robust pipeline of investigational candidates to address areas of high unmet need in fibrosis, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (“IPF”).Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster drug Opdivo continues to perform well. Several label expansion applications for Opdivo are under review in the United States and Europe. Potential approval will boost the prospects of the drug further.   Shares of the company have rallied 14.3% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 10.8%.However, with generic competition looming large over the company, Bristol-Myers’ pipeline needs to deliver.  Hence, the company is looking to diversify its portfolio in the promising space like NASH.In 2017, Bristol-Myers extended its strategic partnership with TARGET PharmaSolutions, Inc. The partnership has been extended for TARGET-NASH for a multi-year deal.We note that both companies announced two new collaborations in November 2016 for the treatment of NASH and HCC.Bristol-Myers already has a mid-stage candidate in the NASH space. BMS-986036, an investigational pegylated analogue of human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a key regulator of metabolism, in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F1-F3) achieved its primary endpoint of significant reduction in liver fat versus placebo in April. The company was entitled the rights to research, develop and commercialize BMS-986036 from Ambrx, Inc.Other major companies with promising candidates for NASH are Intercept Pharma (ICPT  -  Free Report), Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

61,BMY,"Discouraging results from a phase II study evaluating AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) promising cancer candidate rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T in third-line or later small cell lung cancer (“SCLC”) grabbed headlines this week. Other news included a purchase offer for J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) diabetes device unit and successful study results announced by Heron Therapeutics (HRTX  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAbbVie’s Rova-T Falls Short in Key Lung Cancer Study: AbbVie’s promising cancer candidate, rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T fell short of expectations in a phase II TRINITY study evaluating it in third-line or later small cell lung cancer (SCLC). AbbVie said it will not seek accelerated approval of Rova-T in the third-line setting after consulting with the FDA. Rova-T was added to AbbVie’s portfolio, following the $5.8 billion acquisition of Stemcentrx in June 2016. AbbVie had significant confidence in Rova-T’s potential. The failure of TRINITY has raised skepticism on Rova-T’s potential and has brought into question the viability of the Stemcentrx deal.

62,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from the phase III CheckMate -214 study on Opdivo.CheckMate-214 study is an ongoing study evaluating   Immuno-Oncology combination Opdivo (nivolumab) and low-dose (1mg/kg) Yervoy (ipilimumab) compared with  Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent (sunitinib) in intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) over a two-year follow-up period.  The treatment with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy led to statistically significant differences in patient-reported outcomes from baseline versus sunitinib through two years of follow-up. The study demonstrated that patients showed significant benefits in disease-related symptoms and improvements to their cancer-related quality of life and well-being.These benefits occurred early during Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy combination therapy and were largely maintained throughout the treatment period and through Opdivo maintenance therapy.The CheckMate-214 study for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma had earlier shown efficacy benefit of Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy across a number of measures, including overall survival, objective response rate and progression-free survival. However, the results presented now showed that patients treated with this Immuno-Oncology combination also reported significant improvements in disease-related symptoms, as well as positive changes to their physical, emotional and functional well-being.An additional analysis showed similar results with a significant benefit seen for Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy relative to sunitinib on change from baseline at a pre-planned 25-week landmark.Bristol-Myers’ shares have declined 16% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4.4%.We note that, Opdivo, became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval in July 2014. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classical Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Meanwhile, the company continues to evaluate Opdivo alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Label expansion of the drug into additional indications would give the product an access to a higher patient population and increase its commercial potential significantly.However, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.In a separate release, Bristol-Myers announced that the FDA lifted a partial clinical hold placed on CA209-602 (CheckMate -602), a phase III study evaluating the addition of Opdivo to pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The decision follows consultation with the FDA and agreement on amendments to the study protocol.The FDA put clinical hold on three studies evaluating Opdivo-based combinations in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in September 2017 as an FDA precaution following risks identified in trials studying another anti–PD-1 agent, Keytruda, in patients with multiple myeloma. Stocks That Warrant a LookBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the same space is Illumina, Inc.

63,BMY,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) announced the submission of a new drug application (“NDA”) for its analgesic opioid candidate, NKTR-181, for the treatment of chronic low back pain. The candidate exhibited reduced incidence of euphoria associated with opioids, which can lead to abuse and addiction.Shares of the company are up 2.4% in pre-market. Nektar’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has soared 34.5% against the broader industry’s decline of 6.5%.The NDA included data from 15 clinical studies, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of NKTR-181 in patients with chronic low back pain who were not treated with any opioid therapy and non-cancer pain. Two studies evaluating NKTR-181 for human abuse potential showed significantly less abuse potential compared with oxycodone.Per the press release, low back pain is the second most common factor causing disability in adults in the United States.However, Nektar is expected to face intense competition in the pain market with several companies developing therapies. Its competitors include Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s (COLL  -  Free Report) Xtampza and Teva Pharmaceutical’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) Naproxen.Apart from NKTR-181, Nektar’s pipeline also has several early and late-stage candidates. The lead pipeline candidate, Onzeald is being evaluated in a phase III study for treating adults with advanced breast cancer with brain metastases. The company is developing NKTR-358 in phase I study for treating autoimmune disease and NKTR-214 in phase I/II study in solid tumors. Nektar has collaborated with Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) to develop NKTR-214 in combination with the latter’s immune-oncology drug, Opdivo, in more than 20 indications in nine tumor types.Nektar Therapeutics Price  Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteNektar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

64,BMY,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to its lung cancer drug, Xalkori (crizotinib) for two new indications.Xalkori is already marketed for the treatment of ALK+ or ROS1-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In-fact, it is only FDA-approved treatment indicated for both ALK-positive and ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC.The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Xalkori for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC with MET exon 14 alterations with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The designation for this indication was supported by results from an expansion cohort of the phase I PROFILE 1001 study, in which Xalkori showed antitumor activity.Another indication for which Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted to Xalkori was for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) that is ALKpositive. The designation for this indication was supported by two studies — Study ADVL0912 (NCT00939770) and Study A8081013 (NCT01121588).  The studies showed compelling antitumor activity in pediatric and adult patients treated with Xalkori.The designation from the FDA is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs with early evidence of substantial potential clinical benefit to patients.Shares of Pfizer have declined 1.5% year to date, compared with the industry’s decline of 6%. NSCLC is a difficult-to-treat disease, accounting for about 85% of lung cancer cases. At present, the lung cancer treatment market is highly crowded with drugs like Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Alecensa, Novartis’ Zykadia and Taxotere among others.Zacks RankPfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

65,BMY,"Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the phase III study, IMpower130 on immunotherapy Tecentriq, met its co-primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).The multicentre, open-label, randomized study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel versus only chemotherapy in chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The study results showed that the combination of Tecentriq plus chemotherapy (carboplatin and Abraxane [albumin-bound paclitaxel; nab-paclitaxel]) helped patients live significantly longer compared to chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Moreover, the Tecentriq combination reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival or PFS) as compared to chemotherapy alone.We note that Tecentriq is already approved in the United States and European Union for previously-treated metastatic NSCLC and for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC), who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy or who have had disease progression during or following platinum-containing therapy.At present, Roche has eight ongoing phase III lung cancer studies, which are evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination with other drugs. Among these, this is the third phase III study evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination to demonstrate an OS benefit for people with NSCLC, which has demonstrated positive results.The label expansion of the drug will boost sales.However, competition is stiff in the NSCLC market with the likes of Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo.Roche’s stock has lost 17.3% over a year, as against the industry's gain of 4.7%. Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin and MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. The FDA also approved for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

66,BMY,"AstraZeneca PLC. (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that a phase III PACIFIC study evaluating its oncology candidate, Imfinzi (durvalumab), for an early stage lung cancer indication met its second primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). The study was conducted on patients with locally-advanced, unresectable (stage III) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiation therapy (CRT). Please note that Imfinzi was approved in the United States for this indication in February this year based on positive progression free survival dataA planned interim analysis showed that patients receiving Imfinzi experienced statistically significant OS benefit with clinically meaningful improvement compared to placebo. The OS data will be added to the label of Imfinzi which can drive sales of the drug higher.Imfinzi is also marketed in the United States for second-line advanced bladder cancer.Interim data from the study, presented in September last year, showed that Imfinzi led to superior progression-free survival to standard of care in the above-mentioned patients. Treatment with Imfinzi improved PFS by more than 11 months in comparison to standard of care. Imfinzi also led to significant reductions in the risk of deterioration of health or death per data from the study. Astrazeneca’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. Shares of the company have gained 6.7%, while the industry declined 4.9%. AstraZeneca is also developing Imfinzi as monotherapy as well as combination therapy for treatment of NSCLC in first-line or adjuvant setting. The drug is also being developed for several other cancer indications including head and neck, gastric, pancreatic, hepatocellular and blood cancers.However, lung cancer is a competitive segment as it attracts several players due to the huge market opportunity. Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) received approval for their respective drugs, Zykadia and Alecensa, in 2017 for treating metastatic NSCLC in first-line setting.Other immunotherapies for treating various cancer indications include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo and Merck & Co.’s Keytruda.Zacks RankAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. AstraZeneca PLC Price  AstraZeneca PLC Price | AstraZeneca PLC Quote5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

67,BMY,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that its pivotal study – KEYNOTE-407 – evaluating Keytruda-chemotherapy combination in first-line metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) met its dual primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”) and progression free survival (“PFS”). The drug in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated significantly longer OS and PFS versus chemotherapy alone.Merck’s supplemental Biologics License Application (“sBLA”) seeking continued approval of Keytruda combined with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta and platinum chemotherapy for treating metastatic non-squamous NSCLC is under review in the United States. The sBLA was filed based on encouraging data from another phase III study, KEYNOTE-189.The company plans to share data from the KEYNOTE-407 study with FDA and may expand the sBLA to include patients with squamous histology.The company will present detailed data from the KEYNOTE-407 study at the upcoming annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology next month.Shares of Merck were up 0.2% in after-market trading after the news was announced. This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 5.1% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4%.Notably, Keytruda is already approved as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 50% or greater. Keytruda also has accelerated approval to treat first-line patients with metastatic NSCLC in combination with Alimta and chemotherapy.Merck remains focused on developing Keytruda as monotherapy or combination therapy for the treatment of lung cancer with various mutation or histology in first-line setting in a bid to further reinforce its position in that segment. Lung cancer is an attractive market as it is the largest cause of death among all cancer patients.Moreover, Keytruda is the only immune-oncology drug, which is approved for the treatment of lung cancer in the first-line setting. We remind investors that Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) is also developing its immune-oncology drug, Opdivo, in first-line lung cancer. However, Keytruda’s early entry and positive data readouts from several phase III studies in expanded first-line lung cancer patients bode well for the company’s top line.We note that Keytruda is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies.

68,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc.’s (EXEL  -  Free Report) European partner Ipsen announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted approval to Cabometyx (cabozantinib) for an expanded indication. The EC approved Cabometyx 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg for the first-line treatment of adults with intermediate- or poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) — a kind of kidney cancer in the European Union.The approval was expected in March. The company received positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) for the use of Cabometyx for the above indication.The EU approval in the first-line setting was based on results of the CABOSUN trial, which met its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival compared with Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent (sunitinib) in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC.Cabometyxis already marketed in the EU for advanced RCC in adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy. In the United States, Cabometyx was approved for first-line treatment of advanced RCC in December last year, approximately two months ahead of the assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date.Cabometyx generated $128.9 million net product revenues in the first quarter of 2018 driven by growth in demand following U.S. approval in the first lien setting. An approval in Europe will further boost Exelixis’ top line.Per the terms of the collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen, Exelixis will receive a milestone payment of $50 million for the EC approval, of which about $46 million was recognized as collaboration revenues in the first quarter of 2018. The payment will be made by Ipsen within the next 70 days.Exelixis’ shares have lost 32.8% over a year, wider than the industry’s decline of 3.6%.We remind investors that Exelixis entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen in February 2016 for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib whereby Ipsen received exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications outside the United States, Canada and Japan.Exelixis has also inked agreements with Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with their immunotherapy agents in 2017.Zacks Rank Exelixis has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Exelixis, Inc.

70,BMY,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 60 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018, which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 52 cents and the year-ago figure of 42 cents due to higher R&D costs.Nektar’s stock was up 2.8% on May 11 following the earnings release. Shares of Nektar have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has risen 33% while the industry is up 0.6%.Quarterly revenues soared 53.8% from the year-ago period to $38 million. This upside can mainly be attributed to a $10 million milestone payment under the collaboration agreement with Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) related to the approval of hemophilia drug, Adynovi, in Europe. The top line came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Quarter in DetailThe top line comprised product sales, royalty revenues, non-cash royalty revenues besides license, collaboration and other revenues.In the first quarter, product sales rose 32.4% to $6.3 million from $4.8 million a year ago.  Moreover, non-cash royalty revenues increased 3.9% to $6.9 million.The company reported royalty revenues of $11.1 million in the quarter under review, registering an improvement of 53.5% from $7.2 million a year ago.License, collaboration and other revenues came in at $13.7 million compared with $6.1 million in the prior year, an upside of 125.3%.Research and development (R&D) expenses escalated 62.8% to $99.4 million, primarily due to investments in pipeline including key candidates NKTR-358, NKTR-214 and NKTR-181.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were up 56% to $18.7 million in the reported quarter primarily due to higher stock-based compensation.Pipeline UpdateThe company received a major boost in February when it announced a global strategic collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report). Per the agreement, the companies will jointly develop and commercialize Nektar’s lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, in combination with Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab).Moreover, pursuant to the contract, the company received $1.0 billion in upfront payment and proceeds of $850 million from share purchase in April.In the same month, Nektar began dosing in a phase I/II study – REVEAL – to evaluate a combination of its two candidates NKTR-262, a toll-like receptor agonist, and NKTR-214, an immuno-stimulatory CD122-biased agonist, in advanced or metastatic solid tumor cancers.Moreover, the company has also collaborated with Takeda to develop NKTR-214 in combination with the latter’s TAK-659, a dual SYK and FLT-3 inhibitor, in liquid and solid tumors. First study under this collaboration is expected to start in the second half of 2018, which will evaluate the combination in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.In May, Nektar initiated a dose ranging phase Ib study to evaluate NKTR-358, a regulatory T cell stimulator, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease.

71,BMY,"Horizon Pharma plc (HZNP  -  Free Report) reported lower-than-expected results for the first quarter of 2018.  Following the news, the company’s shares went down 5.6%. Horizon Pharma’s stock has declined 5.4% year to date compared with the industry’s fall of 12.3%.The company reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of 3 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents and were much lower than 21 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Sales in the first quarter were up 1.4% year over year to $223.9 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $239.45 million.Quarter in DetailThe Orphan unit recorded revenues of $114.7 million, up 2% from the year-ago period. Growth in net sales of Ravicti, which generated $49.1 million in the quarter, up 12% year over year, was partially offset by lower sales of Actimmune, Buphenyl and Quinsair.Additionally, Procysbi contributed to the performance with net sales of $34.9 million, up 2% year over year. Actimmune sales in the reported quarter were $24.9 million, down 5% year over year.Procysbi’s lower sales growth and Quinsair declining sales was due to divesting of marketing rights in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) regionsThe Rheumatology unit generated $57.5 million from sales, up 35% year over year. Also, Krystexxa sales in the quarter were strong and came in at $46.7 million, up 48% year over year, driven by a strong and continued year-over-year vial demand.Primary Care garnered revenues of $51.7 million, down 21% year over year. The decline in net sales was due to greater-than-anticipated seasonality impact and accrual of inventory in sales channel.In the reported quarter, net sales of Pennsaid2%, Duexix and Vimovo were $26.8 million, $15.7 million and $8.4 million, respectively.Adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses were up 40.3% to $15.2 million while adjusted selling, general and administrative expense was $146.1 million, up 10.4% year over year.2018 Guidance IncreasedHorizon Pharma raised its outlook for 2018. It now expects sales in the range of $1.17-$1.2 billion (previously $1.15-$1.18 billion), mainly driven by expected strong growth in its orphan and rheumatology business units, especially Krystexxa.The company expects Krystexxa sales to increase 65% year over year in 2018 due to a one-year delay in implementation of the U.S. Government's Health Resource and Services Administration's Final Rule on 340B drug ceiling price to Jul 1, 2019.Other UpdatesIn February 2018, the company filed a supplemental New Drug Application to expand the age range in the label of Raviciti from two months of age and older to birth and older.In January 2018, the company announced two programs for developing next-generation biologics – HZN-003 and PASylated uricase technology – for the treatment of uncontrolled gout.Currently, Horizon Pharma is evaluating KRYSTEXXA in combination with commonly used two different immunomodulators in two investigator-initiated studies – RECIPE and TRIPLE – for enhancing the response rate of the drug in gout patients.The company is progressing well with the phase III study for the evaluation of teprotumumab in moderate-to-severe active thyroid eye disease. The company expects to complete enrollment in the study by the end of 2018.Meanwhile, the company is working on expanding Actimmune’s label. An investigator-initiated study at the Moffitt Cancer Center is underway and enrolling patients. The study is evaluating Actimmune in combination with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin, Perjeta and Taxol in certain advanced breast cancer patients. A phase I study will evaluate Actimmune in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in kidney and bladder cancer. Actimmune is also being evaluated in combination with Merck & Co’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda to treat cutaneous t-cell lymphoma patients in a phase II study.New Operating StructureIn line with Horizon Pharma’s long-term strategy, management announced that beginning second quarter, it will report its results under two operating segments. The company will separate its strategic growth business, orphan and rheumatology, from the primary care business.The company expects the new structure to help it in better allocation of resources in developing products for unmet treatment needs of patients with rare diseases.Our TakeHorizon Pharma’s first-quarter results were not impressive as the company missed both the top- and bottom-line estimates. However, the sales guidance for 2018 was encouraging. We expect Krystexxa, Ravicti and Actimmune to drive further growth.Although the company’s focus on developing Krystexxa and Actimmune is beneficial for its future, we expect the studies to increase operating expenses.Horizon Pharma Public Limited Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Horizon Pharma Public Limited Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Horizon Pharma Public Limited Company QuoteZacks RankHorizon Pharma currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

72,BMY,"Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INFI  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 18 cents per share in first-quarter 2018, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company had reported a loss of 21 cents in the year-ago quarter.Since Infinity does not have any approved product in its portfolio, the company earns revenues in the form of royalties, license and milestone payments as well as research and development (R&D) support fees paid by its partners.Infinity’s shares have returned 2.5% year to date against the industry’s decline of 2.9%. Quarter in DetailIn the quarter, R&D expenses increased 38.8% to $5.9 million due to higher clinical development charges for IPI-549.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $3.6 million for the quarter, down 43.8% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to a reduction in bonus and stock compensation.2018 OutlookInfinity reaffirmed its outlook for 2018.

73,BMY,"Shares of Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) have rallied a massive 106.6% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 5.2%.  Exelixis’ lead product, Cometriq, the capsule form of cabozantinib, was approved in the United State in 2012 for the treatment of progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. In April 2016, a tablet formulation of cabozantinib, Cabometyx was approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy.Cabometyx posted strong sales in the first nine months of 2017 thereby underlying the increasing demand for the drug. New patient market share in the second-line plus setting increased to 38%.The recent FDA approval of Cabometyx for the treatment previously untreated advanced RCC should further boost demand.The approval comes two months ahead of schedule. We note that Cabometyx (cabozantinib), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, was already approved for the treatment of RCC in patients who have already received anti-angiogenic therapy. Cabozantinib inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinases, including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors, and RET.  The approval came on the back of results from the randomized phase II, trial CABOSUN. The results demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus the current standard of care, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent. Importantly, Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 52% reduction in the rate of disease progression or death. Median PFS for Cabometyx was 8.6 months versus 5.3 months for Sutent corresponding to a 3.3 month (62%) improvement.RCC is the most common form of kidney cancer in adults. Per statistics, approximately 30,000 patients in the United States and 68,000 around the world need a first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer. As many as 14,000 patients need the same annually in the United States.Sutent is widely used as a first-line treatment for RCC. Hence, we expect Cabometyx will pose a challenge to Sutent’s market share for first line RCC in 2018.In addition, the drug is also being evaluated for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the CELESTIAL study. In October 2017, Exelixis announced that the CELESTIAL trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) with cabozantinib providing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared with placebo in patients with advanced HCC. The independent data monitoring committee for the study recommended that the trial should be stopped for efficacy following review of the second planned interim analysis. Exelixis plans to submit an sNDA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018. HCC is the most common form of primary liver cancer, accounting for more than 90% of cases in the United States. reflecting the demand for therapies. Hence, a potential approval of the drug for liver cancer will further boost the growth potential of the drug.In early 2017, Exelixis inked agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to jointly develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents. Exelixis collaborated with Bristol-Myers to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo alone or in combination with Yervoy in a phase III trial in first-line RCC, and potentially in other tumor types including (HCC and bladder cancer). Both companies have initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER in July 2017 to evaluate Opdivo in combination with Cabometyx or Opdivo and Yervoy in combination with Cabometyx versus Sutent in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC. Exelixis has also collaborated with Roche to evaluate Cabometyx in combination with Tecentriq, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with advanced RCC or bladder cancer. In June 2017, Exelixis initiated the dose-escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq. The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  or RCC.While competition might stiffen up a bit in 2018 as the the FDA accepted Bristol-Myers’ supplemental Biologics License Application for priority review of Opdivo plus Yervoy to treat intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced RCC with an action date of Apr 16, 2018, we expect Exelixis to ride high on the performance of Cabometyx in 2018.Hence, this is a must-have stock for investors in their biotech portfolio in 2018.Zacks RankExelixis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

74,BMY,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) along with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its investigational oral SGLT-2 inhibitor, Steglatro (ertugliflozin) tablets, and Steglujan (ertugliflozin + sitagliptin) as an adjunct to diet and exercise for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Steglujan is a fixed combination of Steglatro and Januvia (sitagliptin), which is approved in patients who are eligible for treatment with the combination.Apart from these two drugs, the FDA also approved Segluromet (ertugliflozin + metformin) for the same indication in patients already treated with Steglatro or Glucophage (metformin) with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and patients who are already treated with combination of ertugliflozin and metformin.So far this year, shares of Merck have lost 4.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 16%. The FDA approved the drugs based on data from seven phase III studies, which evaluated Steglatro as monotherapy or in combination with Januvia and/or Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Glucophage. The studies also evaluated Steglatro in combination with insulin and a sulfonylurea. Data from the studies showed that Steglatro as a single agent or in combination with Januvia significantly reduced A1C level, a measure of blood glucose, compared to placebo.Steglatro also significantly reduced body weight in patients who were already receiving a combination of Januvia and Glucophage versus placebo. The drug also achieved significant reductions in systolic blood pressure.The approval of the three new drugs will boost Merck’s diabetes portfolio, which comprises Januvia and Janumet. Both the marketed drugs have seen volume growth in the first nine months of 2017 and have generated sales of $4.4 billion.However, Merck received a complete response letter from the FDA for supplemental New Drug Applications (“CRL”), seeking label expansion of Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR in April 2017. The company is in discussion with the FDA to resolve the issues in the CRL.

75,BMY,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 14 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, substantially narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 38 cents and the year-ago figure of 28 cents.Shares of Nektar have significantly outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has skyrocketed 471.6% while the industry has decreased 2.6%.Quarterly revenues substantially soared 154.7% to $95.5 million from the year-ago period. This upside can mainly be attributed to a massive rise in license and collaboration revenues. The top line also significantly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31 million.Quarter in DetailThe top line comprised product sales, royalty revenues, non-cash royalty revenues besides license, collaboration and other revenues.In the fourth quarter, product sales tumbled 43.1% to $7.8 million from $13.7 million a year ago.  However, non-cash royalty revenues increased 17.9% to $9.2 million.The company reported royalty revenues of $9.6 million in the quarter under review, registering a huge improvement of 50% from $6.4 million a year ago. This uptrend was mainly on the back of royalty revenues received under a license agreement with AstraZeneca for Movantik and Shire plc for Adynovate.License, collaboration and other revenues came in at $68.9 million compared with $9.6 million in the prior year. This upside was mainly due to a receipt of $60 million in non-recurring revenues related to a new sublicense agreement.Research and development (R&D) expenses mounted 62.2% to $81.4 million, primarily due to investments in pipeline including key candidates NKTR-358, NKTR-214 and NKTR-181.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were down 3.9% to $12.3 million in the reported quarter.2017 ResultsFull-year sales jumped 86% year over year to $307.7 million. Sales outpaced the consensus mark of $243.7 million as well as the previously guided range of $250-$255 million.The 2017 loss of 35 cents per share was narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents and the year-earlier figure of 80 cents.Pipeline UpdateThe most advanced candidate in the company’s portfolio is Onzeald, currently under evaluation in a phase III (ATTAIN) study for treatment of adults with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases.Apart from Onzeald, another candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology portfolio is NKTR-214. Last year in September, Nektar announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab). Data from the trial is expected in the second half of 2018.A phase I/II study evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo is also underway. The candidate is being examined across nine tumor types including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder and triple negative breast cancer. The combo therapy will also be evaluated in more than 20 potential indications.Another candidate, NKTR-181, is being evaluated in a phase III program for chronic pain management. Last July, the company reported positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential study, evaluating NKTR-181, to assess the opioid abuse potential compared with oxycodone. The company is planning to submit a new drug application (NDA) for the candidate by April 2018.2018 OutlookNektar estimates revenues in the range of $100-$110 million excluding payments from the collaboration with Bristol-Myers, entered last month. Per the agreement, both companies will jointly develop and commercialize the lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, of the former in combination with the latter’s Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab).Nektar anticipates cash of approximately $1.9-$1.925 billion at year-end 2018 including upfront payments from the collaboration with Bristol-Myers.Notably, cash and investments in marketable securities as of Dec 31, 2017 were $353.2 million in comparison to $389.1 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Nektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor drug, Opdivo, received approval for intravenous administration in patients with completely resected melanoma with lymph node involvement or metastatic disease in the United States. Meanwhile, Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Bosulif has been approved for treating Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (“CML”) in first-line setting. Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) also announced the approval of Cabometyx’s label expansion in previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”).However, Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) suffered a setback when its key drug, Revlimid, failed in a phase III study evaluating it as a maintenance therapy in treatment-naïve follicular lymphoma patients.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced the acceptance of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) by the FDA that sought label expansion of Tagrisso to include first-line treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) whose tumors have EGFR mutations. The sNDA was also granted priority review, suggesting speedy review with a decision in the next six months.Let’s see the major news in details.Roche's Perjeta Gets Approval in Post-Surgery Breast Cancer: The FDA approved Perjeta in combination with Herceptin and chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy for HER2-positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. The drug regimen significantly reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death compared to Herceptin and chemotherapy alone.

78,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 26, after market closes.The company has an outstanding earnings surprise history, having surpassed expectations in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 572.9%. Exelixis, Inc. Price and Consensus  Exelixis, Inc. Price and Consensus | Exelixis, Inc. Quote Exelixis’ shares have rallied 6.8% in the last six months as against the industry’s fall of 2.3%.  Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Exelixis is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +8.94% since the Most Accurate estimate is 13 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 12 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Exelixis carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with positive ESP increases the chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Likely to Impact ResultsExelixis’ stock received a major boost when the FDA approved Cabometyx tablets in April 2016 for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”).The drug’s uptake was encouraging and is expected to propel the top line in the forthcoming quarters. New patient starts, refills for patients already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base for Cabometyx are driving the drug’s sales. Cabometyx delivered strong sales in the first nine months of 2017, underlying the increasing demand for the drug. New patient market share in the second-line plus setting increased to 38%. The FDA’s approval of Cabometyx for untreated advanced RCC is likely to boost demand further. The drug demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS versus the current standard of care, Sutent.Meanwhile, Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program comprising more than 45 clinical studies across multiple indications. The CELESTIAL study for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is also ongoing.  Exelixis also announced collaboration agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) for the development of cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents in early 2017. These collaborations entitle Exelixis to earn milestone payments and royalties that boost its top line. In June 2017, Exelixis initiated the dose-escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq. The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma or RCC.However, expenses continue to increase and raise concerns. Exelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2017 in the range of $285-$295 million.Stock to ConsiderHere is one company that you may consider, as our model shows that it also has the right combination of elements to deliver a beat this quarter.Gemphire Therapeutics (GEMP  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 21.

79,BMY,"AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a second indication for its PD-L1 inhibitor, Imfinzi. It is now approved for unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). The drug is meant for patients whose disease has not progressed following concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy.AstraZeneca’s shares have returned 16.3% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 13% in that period.The approval comes on the back of impressive progression free survival data (“PFS”) in patients treated with Imfinzi in the phase III PACIFIC study. Data showed that Imfinzi improved PFS by more than 11 months in comparison to placebo in the concerned patient population. The median PFS was 16.8 months for patients on Imfinzi compared with 5.6 months for placebo.Imfinzi was launched in the United States for the first indication - second line advanced bladder cancer - in May 2017. The drug has brought in sales of $19 million in 2017.Per the press release, globally 30% of NSCLC patients have Stage III disease with the majority of the patients diagnosed with unresectable tumors. Currently, the patients are treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, followed by active surveillance to monitor for progression. Imfinzi, the first immunotherapy approved in this indication, will be a better treatment option for these patients and represents a better market opportunity for AstraZeneca.AstraZeneca is also developing Imfinzi as monotherapy as well as combination therapy for treatment of NSCLC in first-line or adjuvant setting. The drug is also being developed for several other cancer indications including head and neck, gastric, pancreatic, hepatocellular and blood cancers.However, lung cancer is a competitive segment as it attracts several players due to the huge market opportunity. Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) and Roche received approval for their respective drugs, Zykadia and Alecensa, in 2017 for treating metastatic NSCLC in first-line setting.Other immunotherapies for treating various cancer indications include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo and Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda.Astrazeneca PLC Price Astrazeneca PLC Price | Astrazeneca PLC QuoteZacks RankAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

80,BMY,"Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) incurred an adjusted loss of $1.54 per share in the first quarter of 2018, which was wider than the year-ago loss of $1.33 per share as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.34.Clovis’ only marketed drug, Rubraca, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in December 2016 for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have received prior chemotherapies.Net revenues, entirely from Rubraca, were approximately $18.5 million in the quarter, up 10.1% sequentially amid competition from other PARP inhibitors which are approved in patients irrespective of BRCA mutation. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.5 million. The company had recorded total revenues of $7 million entirely from Rubraca sales in the year-ago quarter.Importantly, the company registered 1700 new patients on Rubraca therapy since its approval. Approximately, 300 new patients were registered in the first quarter.Shares of the company declined almost 1.2% on May 8 on wider-than-expected loss. Moreover, Clovis has underperformed the industry in the past year. While the stock has lost 37.3%, the industry declined 11.8%. Quarter in DetailDuring the first quarter, research & development expenses increased 34.2% year over year to $43.5 million primarily due to increased expenses for clinical studies on Rubraca. However, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses escalated 34.4% year over year to $39.3 million, reflecting increased activities to support commercialization of Rubraca.Cash used in operating activities in the quarter was $100.6 million, higher than $80.4 million in the year-ago quarter, mainly due to higher product supply costs.Clovis ended the quarter with $463.8 million of cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities supported by the proceeds raised through share offerings made in January and June last yearUpdate on RubracaSubsequent to the quarter in April 2018, the FDA approved the label expansion of Rubraca to include maintenance treatment in recurrent ovarian cancer. The drug can now also be prescribed irrespective of BRCA-mutation in the second-line setting.In March 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) issued a positive opinion recommending approval of Rubraca for treating advanced ovarian cancer indication with BRCA mutation. An approval is anticipated in the second quarter.Additionally, Clovis has plans to submit a supplemental application seeking approval for second-line or later maintenance treatment indication in the EU, only if approved for the advanced ovarian cancer indication.A phase II study – ATLAS – was initiated during the quarter to evaluate Rubraca monotherapy in metastatic bladder cancer. The study is currently enrolling patients.In July 2017, Clovis announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to evaluate Rubraca in combination with the latter’s PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo, in multiple tumor types. A phase III study – ATHENA – is expected to start in the first half of 2018 to evaluate Rubraca + Opdivo for treating advanced ovarian cancer in first-line maintenance setting. A phase III study is already evaluating the combination in advanced triple-negative breast cancer.Apart from Rubraca, Clovis is also developing lucitanib for treating breast and lung cancer. The company’s partner, Servier, will return ex-U.S. (excluding China) rights to the candidate in 2018. Following this, Clovis will own global development rights for lucitanib, except China.Our TakeAdoption of Rubraca is expected to increase with the FDA approval for use in ovarian cancer patients irrespective of BRCA-mutation in the United States. This approval brings the drug on par with other approved maintenance therapies including Tesaro, Inc.’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula and AstraZeneca PLC’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Lynparza.We expect operating expense to continue to increase in 2018 as the company will incur higher investments to support Rubraca’s launch in Europe and expanded indication in the United States. Moreover, the company anticipates product supply costs to increase to $44 million in the second quarter, which will affect the bottom line. However, cash position will be better at the end of the second quarter due to addition of net proceeds from common stock and senior notes offering in April.We remind investors that Clovis has to pay $38 million in milestone payment to Pfizer related to two approvals of Rubraca in the United States. Another additional $20 million will be due to Pfizer if approval is received in Europe. We expect further decline in the bottom line due to these costs.Clovis Oncology, Inc.

81,BMY,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AVEO  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3.In the last reported quarter, AVEO delivered a negative surprise of 300%.The company has slightly underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock fell 9.7% compared with a decline of 9.1% for the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayFollowing its launch last year in Germany, Fotivda, a first-line treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) became the first commercial product in AVEO’s portfolio. The company is entitled to receive double-digit royalty payments from its partner, EUSA Pharma on net sales of the drug in Europe. We expect it to boost the company’s first-quarter revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.65 million.In February 2018, Fotivda was granted positive recommendation for approval in the United Kingdom for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC. The recommendation triggered a payment of $2 million from EUSA Pharma.Fotivda is currently being evaluated in a couple of studies for the third-line treatment of RCC and advanced RCC. In December 2017, the company announced completion of enrollment in phase II portion of phase I/II TiNivo study, evaluating Fotivda in combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in RCC. We expect the company to provide an update on these studies on its first-quarter earnings call.Apart from Fotivda, AVEO is also developing ficlatuzumab in combination with Lilly’s Erbitux in a phase II study for treating metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Another phase Ib study is evaluating the candidate in combination with Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in treatment-naive pancreatic cancer. These studies were initiated during the fourth quarter 2017.Investor focus will likely remain on updates related to Fotivda’s launch and progress of ficlatuzumab.Surprise HistoryAVEO’s performance over the last four quarters has been mixed. The company surpassed expectations thrice and missed once with an average negative surprise of 53.08%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AVEO is likely to beat estimates in the soon-to-be reported quarter.

82,BMY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 61 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents and the year-ago quarter loss of 42 cents.Revenues came in at $140.6 million, up 28.8% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $112.06 million.However, Seattle Genetics’ shares have lost 8.7% so far this year, compared with the industry’s decline of 8.3% in the same period.Quarter in DetailSeattle Genetics’ top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company’s only marketed product, Adcetris, generated product sales of $95.4 million, up a significant 36% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 35.4% to almost $29.6 million, mainly driven by strong demand for Adcetris in the international market. Collaboration revenues include fees earned from the company’s agreement with Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues decreased 7.7% year over year to $15.7 million due to adoption of the new accounting standards for revenue recognition.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $152.5 million, up 29% year over year, primarily attributable to tucatinib development activities and upfront costs related to technology licensing with Pieris and PharmaMar. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 72.4% to $66.2 million, mainly due to costs related to acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics and launch of Adcetris in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.2018 Outlook With the launch of Adcetris in the new indication, the company withdrew its revenue expectation for 2018. Currently, Shire expects second-quarter sales to be in the range of $105 million to $110 million.The company increased its outlook for R&D expense to the range of $530 million to $580 million from $460 million to $500 million. SG&A expense is expected in the range of $220 million to $240 million (previously $200 million to $220 million). The rise in R&D will likely be due to increased investments in development of tisotumab vedotin, ladiratuzumab vedotin and the company’s pipeline programs.Pipeline UpdateDuring the quarter, label expansion of Adcetris in combination with chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma was approved in the United States. In January 2018, the drug was approved for treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in Europe following an approval in the United States in November last year.Moreover, top-line data from the ECHELON-2 study (frontline CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma) should be out in 2018. A separate study is also evaluating Adcetris in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma.In addition, the company is enrolling patients in a pivotal study evaluating enfortumab vedotin in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer patients. The candidate was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation during the quarter.Moreover, Seattle Genetics and Astellas Pharma are evaluating enfortumab vedotin in a phase Ib study in combination with CPI therapies, including Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab), in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, in first- or second-line setting. The companies are planning to initiate a phase III study in 2018.Seattle Genetics and Germany-based Genmab are planning to initiate three phase II studies to evaluate tisotumab vedotin in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, metastatic cervical cancer in treatment-naïve women and in a range of other solid tumor types.The company is evaluating another pipeline candidate, polatuzumab vedotin, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The study is being conducted in collaboration with Genentech, a member of Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report).Other ActivitiesIn a bid to boost its pipeline, the company entered into a definitive merger agreement last month to acquire Cascadian Therapeutics for $614 million. The acquisition added pivotal-stage HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer candidate, tucatinib, to its pipeline. The company has initiated a pivotal study to evaluate the candidate in metastatic breast cancer.Seattle Genetics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Seattle Genetics, Inc.

The strong performance was backed by solid net sales of Ravicti, which generated $51.9 million in the quarter, up 57% year over year, driven by continued conversion from older-generation nitrogen-scavenger therapies as well as the addition of treatment-naïve patients due to the recent label expansion.

84,BMY,"We expect Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results next month. Its performance has been encouraging as it beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and met the same in one, delivering an average positive surprise of 15.36%.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 41.67%.However, Celldex Therapeutics’ shares have lost 32.7% in the past year compared with a 2.5% decline for the industry during this period.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCelldex earns revenues entirely from product development and licensing agreements, and contracts and grants. The company recognizes revenues under its clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) for varlilumab. The company will continue to record revenues from these sources in the fourth quarter of 2017.With no approved product in its portfolio, investor focus will remain on pipeline development.In December 2017, the company started patient enrollment in a phase I study, evaluating its new candidate, CDX-1140, for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. Notably, CDX-1140 is a fully human antibody that targets CD40, an immune response activator.In November 2017, Celldex announced data from a phase II study, evaluating a combination of its most advanced pipeline candidate, glembatumumab vedotin, and varlilumab in melanoma. The median progression free survival was 2.6 months, with 52% of patients having stable disease for six weeks or more.The study is also evaluating glembatumumab plus checkpoint inhibitors, including either Bristol Myers’ Opdivo or Merck’s Keytruda.It also initiated a phase II study on its human monoclonal antibody, CDX-3379 in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (""HNSCC""). The phase II study will evaluate CDX-3379 in combination with Eli Lilly’s Erbitux in patients with advanced HNSCC who are Erbitux resistant and previously treated with an anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin and varlilumab, Celldex has several promising candidates in its pipeline, including CDX-1401/CDX-301 (phase II — multiple solid tumors) and CDX-014 (phase I — advanced renal cell carcinoma) among others.Though R&D and SG&A costs declined in the third quarter, operating expenses may vary on a quarterly basis.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Celldex is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +18.28%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 19 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 23 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Celldex currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.

85,BMY,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is one of the reputed names in the pharmaceutical sector, not just for its medicines and vaccines but also for its consumer healthcare products. This New York-based company is known for products like Prevnar, Lyrica, Lipitor and Celebrex among others.Pfizer’s shares have outperformed the large-cap pharma industry in the past six months. The stock has returned 9.9% in that timeframe compared with the industry’s gain of 4.8%.Pfizer’s outperformance was backed by decent quarterly results, positive news flow and regulatory updates.Here are five reasons to invest in the stock this year.Favorable Rank & Earnings Surprise Record: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 6.1% and 4.1%, respectively in the past 30 days.Strategic Acquisitions & Collaborations: Pfizer has been working on strengthening its product portfolio as well as pipeline through acquisitions and licensing deals. The September 2016 takeover of Medivation strengthened Pfizer’s cancer franchise by adding prostate cancer treatment, Xtandi, to its portfolio. Xtandi is also being evaluated for various other types of cancer and holds immense potential. The June 2016 Anacor acquisition added Eucrisa (crisaborole) topical ointment for treating eczema to Pfizer’s pipeline. Pfizer estimates Eucrisa peak sales potential to be at least $2 billion.  The 2015 Hospira acquisition significantly expanded its sterile injectable and biosimilar capabilities.In addition to acquisitions, Pfizer is looking to drive growth through licensing deals and collaborative agreements. It has strategic deals with big names in the pharma sector like Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) (for lung cancer drug Xalkori’s combination and newly approved Steglatro and its fixed-dose combinations for type II diabetes), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) (for Eliquis) and Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) (for its breast cancer drug Ibrance’s combination).Deep Pipeline: Pfizer has committed significant resources toward the development of treatments in the fields of oncology, cardiology, metabolic disorders, neuroscience, pain, rare diseases, immunology, inflammation and vaccines, and immuno-oncology. Most of these signify areas in which the company believes it can take leading positions. Pfizer expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential, including line-extensions for Xtandi, Ibrance & Xeljanz/XR. Half of these potential blockbusters are expected to receive approval by 2020.Pfizer has been working on streamlining its R&D efforts and has several late-stage candidates in its pipeline including many immuno-oncology candidates.A key candidate in its immuno-oncology pipeline is Bavencio/avelumab,which is being evaluated for different types of cancer in collaboration with Merck KGaA. Bavencio is already marketedfor metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and for advanced bladder cancer. Bavencio is being considered a key long-term growth driver for Pfizer.Exploring the World of Biosimilars: Pfizer markets two biosimilar versions of J&J/Merck’s blockbuster medicine, Remicade, in the United States – Inflectra and Ixifi. Inflectra was the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody available in the United States. Other biosimilars in late-stage development include biosimilar versions of Roche’s cancer drugs, Rituxan and Avastin and AbbVie’s Humira. A biosimilar version of Herceptin is under review in the United States and EU. Meanwhile, Pfizer is evaluating 14 biosimilar molecules in various stages of development.Aggressive Cost-Cutting Initiatives: With several of its products either facing or slated to face generic competition, Pfizer is looking toward cost-cutting initiatives to drive bottom-line growth. The company has been undertaking massive restructuring and cost-cutting measures for the past several years. Management is also looking to focus efforts on areas that have high potential like oncology and geographic regions like Asia. Pfizer achieved its cost-reduction goals that were announced in 2009 by the end of 2011, a year earlier than expected, and continues to generate cost savings. The company also achieved its target of bringing about a significant reduction in its annual R&D spend by the end of 2012.ConclusionPfizer faces its share of challenges in the form of genericization of key drugs, supply challenges in the legacy Hospira portfolio, pricing pressure and rising competition. However, we believe Pfizer will be able to overcome these headwinds in 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

86,BMY,"Investors were not much impressed with Exelixis, Inc.’s (EXEL  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 performance, wherein though the company beat on revenues, its earnings were in line with estimates. Following the announcement of the results, shares of Exelixis fell 4% in the after-market trading session.  Exelixis’ shares have rallied 27.9% over a year, outperforming the industry’s decline of 2.5%.The company reported earnings of 12 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and flat year over year.Net revenues came in at $120.1 million, up from $77.6 million from the year-ago quarter. However, the company suffered a sequential decline from $152.5 million generated in third-quarter 2017 as an increase of 5% in overall demand was offset by the reduction of approximately one-week of wholesaler inventory built in the quarter.Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $118.5 million. Exelixis, Inc.

In December 2017, the FDA also approved Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC, approximately two months ahead of the assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date.Cabometyx generated $95.7 million in net product revenues, up 84% y/y, driven by growth in demand for second-line RCC. Demand was driven by increases in market share, refills for patient already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base (15% sequential increase).Cometriq (cabozantinib) capsules for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer generated $5.3 million in net product revenues.Total collaboration revenues were $10.0 million compared with $20 million earned in the year-ago quarter.In the fourth quarter, research and development expenses increased 35.3% to $32.2 million stemming from increases in personnel expenses, clinical trial costs and consulting and outside services. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $46.2 million, significantly up from $13.0 million driven by increases in consulting and outside services to support the company’s marketing activities resulting primarily from an increase in general and administrative headcount to support the company’s commercial and research and development organizations.2017 ResultsRevenues came in at $452.5 million in 2017, up from $191.5 million in 2016 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $451.3 million. Earnings per share came in at 49 cents, up from a loss of 28 cents in 2016 and in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  Cabometyx sales came in at $349 million, up 158% year over year.Pipeline UpdateIn March 2017, the FDA granted cabozantinib orphan drug designation for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In October 2017, Exelixis announced that the CELESTIAL trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”) with cabozantinib providing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared with placebo in patients with advanced HCC. The independent data monitoring committee for the study recommended that the trial should be stopped for efficacy following review of the second planned interim analysis. Exelixis plans to submit an sNDA to the FDA in first-quarter 2018.Exelixis inked agreements with Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents in 2017. Exelixis and Bristol-Myers initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER, in July 2017 which is evaluating the combination of checkpoint inhibition therapy, combined with a cabozantinib, compared to Sutent.Meanwhile, updated results from the ongoing phase I trial of cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo, with or without Yervoy, in patients with refractory genitourinary tumors demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile, and high rates of durable responses in the previously treated metastatic UC and metastatic RCC cohorts.In January 2018, Exelixis announced an amendment to the protocol for the phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The amendment added four new expansion cohorts to the trial, which now includes patients with non-small cell lung cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer, in addition to previously included patients with RCC and urothelial carcinoma. The primary objective in the expansion stage of this trial remains to determine the objective response rate in each cohort.The IMspire150 (TRILOGY) trial, which evaluates the combination of Cotellic, Tecentriq, and Xelboraf in first-line BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma is underway while IMspire170, the trial evaluating the combination of Cotellic and Tecentriq versus Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in first-line BRAF wild-type metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma, has enrolled its first patient.2018 GuidanceExelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2018 in the range of $430-$460 million.Our TakeExelixis’ fourth-quarter results were positive wherein while sales beat estimates, earnings came in line with expectations.  Exelixis put up a strong performance in 2017 driven by gain in market share for Cabometyx. New patient market share in the second-line plus setting grew to approximately 42% at the end of 2017, up from 38% in the third quarter.We expect sales to get a further boost in 2018 as the company will launch the drug for first-line RCC which will increases the eligible patient population for Caobometyx in the United States by approximately 14,000 patients and grab market share from two key drugs — Sutent and Votrient in the first-line RCC market.We expect investors focus to remain on further label expansion of cabozantinib and Cotellic. A potential label expansion for advanced HCC will further boost the growth prospects of the company.Zacks RankExelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

88,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of 94 cents per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents and the year-ago quarter earnings of 84 cents.Total revenues of $5.19 billion were slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion and increased 5% from $4.93 billion recorded in the year-ago period. Strong sales of Opdivo and Eliquis contributed to the top line in the reported quarter.Shares of the company were up almost 0.5% in pre-market trading, possibly on better-than expected earnings. However, Bristol-Myers’ shares have declined 17% so far this year, which compares unfavorably with the industry’s decrease of 4.9%.Quarterly DetailsRevenues were up 1% year over year when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. Revenues increased 1% to $2.8 billion in the United States and 10% outside the country. Ex-U.S. revenues were up 1% when adjusted for foreign exchange impact.Leukemia drug Sprycel raked in sales of $438 million, down 5% year over year. U.S. sales for the drug were down 13% to $214 million. A label expansion of the drug in pediatric patients in the United States last November presumably did not have much impact on sales.Rheumatoid arthritis drug, Orencia, was up 11% in first-quarter 2018 to $593 million. Melanoma drug, Yervoy contributed $249 million to the top line during the reported quarter, down 25%. U.S. sales for the drug were down 33% to $162 million.Opdivo, which is approved for multiple cancer indications, generated revenues of $1.51 billion, up 34% from the year-ago period.Sales of cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, were $1.51 billion during the reported quarter, up 37% year over year. Multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti recorded sales of $55 million, up 4% year over year.However, the performance of key drugs in the Virology unit continues to disappoint. Sales of Baraclude declined 20% to $225 million. The Reyataz and Sustiva franchises deteriorated 36% and 54% year over year to $124 million and $84 million, respectively. The Hepatitis franchise lost 98% of its year-ago quarter sales and contributed a mere $3 million to revenues.Research and development (R&D) expenses in the quarter decreased 4.1% to $1.25 billion. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 9.7% to $980 million.Gross margin was 69.5% in the quarter compared with 74.3% in the year-ago quarter due to change in product mix.Regulatory UpdateSubsequent to the quarter in April, the FDA approved Opdivo+Yervoy combination regimen for treating intermediate- and poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma in patients who have not received any prior treatment. In March, the FDA had granted priority review to a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking approval of the combination regimen for treating microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer.Also, in April, the FDA granted priority review to the sBLA seeking approval of Opdivo monotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer in third or later line setting. A new dosing regimen for Opdivo, 480 mg every four weeks, was also approved for the majority of indications.CollaborationsIn April 2018, Bristol-Myers collaborated with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Janssen, to develop and commercialize its Factor Xia inhibitor program, including BMS-986177, for treating major thrombotic conditions. In the same month, Bristol-Myers and privately-held Illumina, Inc. announced a collaboration to utilize the latter’s next-generation sequencing technology.In February, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) entered into a strategic development and commercialization collaboration for Nektar’s lead immuno-oncology program, NKTR-214. Per the collaboration, the companies will develop and commercialize NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy in more than 20 indications across nine tumor types, as well as potential combinations with other anti-cancer agents from either of the respective companies and/or third parties. Both the companies plan to initiate studies in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma in mid-2018.Pipeline UpdateIn April 2018, Bristol Myers announced data from a phase III study, Checkmate-227, which showed superior progression-free survival in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) treated with Opdivo – Yervoy combination compared to chemotherapy. In January 2018, Bristol-Myers announced positive data from Phase II CheckMate-142 study evaluating the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in patients with DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).The company also announced data from the phase III study, CheckMate-078, evaluating Opdivo in Chinese population. Data showed that the drug achieved superior overall survival in previously-treated patients with NSCLC as compared to docetaxel.Data from a long-term follow up phase III study – CheckMate -141 – showed that Opdivo reduced risk of death by 32% in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after a minimum two years of follow-up compared to standard chemotherapy.In March, Bristol-Myers along with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced data from a real-world data analysis of different direct oral anticoagulants including Eliquis, J&J’s Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. Data showed that Eliquis achieved significantly lower rates of both stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding compared to both Xarelto and Pradaxa.2018 Guidance UpdatedBristol-Myers increased its adjusted earnings expectations for 2018. The company now projects earnings in the range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share (previously $3.15 to $3.30). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.22. The company expects worldwide revenues to increase in mid-single digits.Our TakeBristol-Myers beat earnings expectations, primarily on robust sales of Opdivo and Eliquis in the quarter. The increase in 2018 guidance for adjusted earnings was also encouraging. We are positive on Bristol-Myers’ efforts to develop its pipeline, especially Opdivo. Several label expansion applications for Opdivo are under review in the United States and Europe. Potential approval will further boost the prospects of this blockbuster drug. Also, superiority of Eliquis in real world data analysis is expected to further boost sales of the drug.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

90,BMY,"Nektar Therapeutics’ (NKTR  -  Free Report) shares increased more than 11% on Feb 14 after the company announced a global strategic collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report). Per the agreement, both companies will jointly develop and commercialize the lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, of the former in combination with the latter’s Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab).Pursuant to the contract, Nektar is entitled to receive an upfront payment of $1.85 billion, which includes a payment of $1 billion in cash and an equity investment of $850 million.

While Nektar will jointly commercialize NKTR-214/Opdivo combinations in the United States as well as major markets in the EU and Japan, Bristol-Myers is entitled to solely commercialize the combinations in the other global markets.We remind investors that Nektar is already evaluating NKTR-214/Opdivo in phase I/II PIVOT studies across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications. With this latest deal with Bristol Myers, it has been agreed upon by both companies to evaluate NKTR-214/Opdivo and NKTR-214/Opdivo plus Yervoy combinations in more than 20 cancer indications across nine tumor types.In November 2017, the two companies reported a positive interim data from dose-escalation part of the study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combo therapy on patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancers.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry in a year’s time.

91,BMY,"Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Perjeta (pertuzumab), in combination with Herceptin and chemotherapy (the Perjeta-based regimen), for adjuvant (after surgery) treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) at high risk of recurrence.  Patients should receive the adjuvant Perjeta-based regimen for one year (18 cycles).Perjeta in combination with Herceptin and docetaxel is already approved for use in patients who have HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to different parts of the body (metastatic) and who have not received anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.Coming back to the release, the approval for the indication was based on results of the phase III APHINITY study. The study showed that Perjeta, Herceptin and chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer recurrence or death by 18% compared to Herceptin and chemotherapy alone.  The combination wasalso granted a Priority Review by the FDA in October.While, invasive disease-free survival (DFS),served as the primary endpoint, secondary endpoints included overall and cardiac safety, DFS and health-related quality of life.In addition, the FDA granted full approval to use of that same regimen for neoadjuvant treatment of HER-2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory or early-stage breast cancer. Until now, the neoadjuvant indication had been allowed under accelerated approval. Roche’s stock has rallied 8% year to date compared with industry’s gain of 16.1%.The company has a strong presence in the oncology market. It dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla.  Herceptin’s growth is g driven by improved demand in both the United States and Europe due to longer treatment duration. Moreover, the subcutaneous formulation of Herceptin is being increasingly adopted across Europe. Meanwhile, sales of Perjeta have been strong in Europe largely due to uptake in the neo-adjuvant setting and persistent growth in the metastatic setting. Kadcyla sales are being driven by increasing demand in both the Europe and internationally. Apart from its strong breast cancer franchise, Roche’s oncology portfolio also boasts drugs like Avastin and Tarceva for lung cancer.However, we note that Roche is facing stiff competition from the likes of Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in the immuno-oncology space.Roche Holding AG Price Roche Holding AG Price | Roche Holding AG QuoteZacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderRoche carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same space is Sucampo Pharmaceuticals  carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

92,BMY,"Shares of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $165.18 on Dec 20, closing nominally lower at $163.03. The company has gained 8.4% over the last six months, much higher than the broader industry’s gain of 2.4% with respect to share price. The stock has a market cap of $16.59 billion.Taking the stable stock performance into consideration, we expect LabCorp to scale higher in the coming quarters. Also, the company’s long-term expected earnings growth rate of 9.9% holds promise.Further, the company’s estimate revision trend for the current year is favorable. In the past 60 days, five estimates moved up while four shifted down. Consequently, estimates were up from $9.51 per share to $9.52.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus  Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteThe company also has a trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise of 2.3%.

Per LabCorp, this test received U.S. approval to be used as a complementary diagnostic with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) OPDIVO (nivolumab) for two new indications — metastatic urothelial carcinoma or bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.  Encouraged by a strong third-quarter show and a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario, the company raised its 2017 outlook.Net revenue growth is maintained in the band of 8-8.5% year over year, ahead of the earlier range of 5-6.5%. Free cash flow expectation has been raised to a new band of $970-$1010 million (previous range: $925-$975 million) up 8-13% from the prior year.In the recent past, the company successfully closed the Chiltern International Group’s buyout, a specialty contract research organization. Chiltern is a major partner of LabCorp, serving the top 20 biopharma segments and helping the company focus on the high-growth emerging and mid-market biopharma segments.

93,BMY,"Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PTLA  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has extended the review period of its biologics license application (BLA) for the reversal agent of Factor Xa inhibitors, AndexXa (andexanet alfa), by 90 days. As a result, the regulatory body will now announce its decision by May 4, 2018 instead of the previously set deadline of Feb 3, 2018.Notably, AndexXa has been developed for patients treated with a direct or indirect Factor Xa inhibitor when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.Portola’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has soared 144.5% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 9%.The review date was extended to accommodate the resubmission of additional data provided by Portola in August. The resubmission was requested by the FDA in a complete response letter issued to Portola last August. In the letter, the FDA had requested for extra information related to product manufacturing.Importantly, the regulatory body had also asked for more data to support the inclusion of direct Factor Xa inhibitor, Lixiana (edoxaban), and indirect Factor Xa inhibitor, Lovenox (enoxaparin), on the product label. Hence in view of this, the FDA has logically asked for additional time to review the application.We remind investors that the BLA was based on positive data from two phase III ANNEXA studies that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of AndexXa in reversing the anticoagulant activity of the Factor Xa inhibitors, Xarelto (rivaroxaban), of Johnson and Johnson, Inc. (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Eliquis (apixaban) of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) in older healthy volunteers.Significantly, AndexXa enjoys an Orphan Drug Status in the United States.AndexXa is also under review in the EU with a marketing application filed in the third quarter of 2016. A response from the regulatory body is expected in the first half of 2018.Per the company’s press release, more than 90,000 U.S. patients treated with oral Factor Xa inhibitors in 2016 were admitted to hospital due to excessive bleeding. It has also been estimated that more than 150,000 patients taking the injectable Factor Xa inhibitor, Lovenox, in the United States could benefit from an antidote annually.With no currently approved antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors yet, there is an urgent, gaping unmet need for the same in the market.Going ahead, we expect investors’ focus to remain on further details of AndexXa’s regulatory aspects.Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

94,BMY,"Key announcements this week include the FDA approval of an eye disease drug as well as a diabetes treatment and label expansions for existing products. Regulatory and pipeline updates were also provided by companies like AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAerie’s Rhopressa Gains FDA Approval: Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI  -  Free Report) got a boost with the earlier-than-expected FDA approval of Rhopressa for the lowering of elevated intraocular pressure (“IOP”) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. While approval was expected considering a favorable advisory panel vote in October, approval came about a couple of months ahead of the Feb 28, 2018 PDUFA (Prescription Drug User Fee Act) goal date. Rhopressa is the first product in Aerie’s portfolio and the company expects to launch the product by mid-second quarter of 2018 (Read more: Aerie Gets Early FDA Approval for Lead Drug Rhopressa).Merck/Pfizer’s Diabetes Drug Gets FDA Nod: SGLT2 inhibitor, Steglatro (ertugliflozin), which has been developed by Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), gained FDA approval for the treatment of type II diabetes. Steglatro will be entering the highly crowded diabetes market which already has other SGLT2 inhibitors in the form of Invokana, Farxiga and Jardiance. Steglatro has also been approved for use in combination with metformin under the brand name Segluromet and with Januvia under the brand name Steglujan.Priority Review for AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso Label Expansion: AstraZeneca’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of Tagrisso (osimertinib), for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) whose tumors have EGFR mutations has been granted priority review by the FDA. Approval for this indication would expand the patient population significantly (Read more: AstraZeneca's Tagrisso Label Expansion Filing Accepted by FDA).J&J’s Janssen in CAR-T Deal, Priority Review for Apalutamide: J&J’s Janssen Biotech has inked a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Legend Biotech USA Inc. and Legend Biotech Ireland Limited, subsidiaries of Genscript Biotech Corporation, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of a chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) T-cell drug candidate, LCAR-B38M. LCAR-B38M, which specifically targets the B-cell maturation antigen (“BCMA”), is currently under regulatory review in China for multiple myeloma (“MM”).Meanwhile, clinical studies are being planned for the United States. Under the terms of the deal, global net trade sales, excluding the Greater China area, will be recorded by Janssen. The companies will split costs and profits equally except in Greater China, where Janssen and Legend will have a 30/70% cost-sharing/profit-split arrangement. The deal terms also include a $350 million upfront payment from Janssen and additional payments on the achievement of development, regulatory and sales milestones.This is the latest agreement in the field of CAR-T, which has been attracting a lot of interest in recent quarters.Janssen also announced that it got priority review status from the FDA for its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for apalutamide, the company’s investigational, next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”). With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out in April 2018. Given that there are no FDA-approved treatments currently available for this patient population, timely approval would be a boost for the company’s cancer portfolio.J&J has gained 22.4% year to date, compared to the 16.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Allergan Provides Updates on Vraylar & Seysara: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) provided a couple of updates on the pipeline front. The company and its partner Gedeon Richter said that Vraylar (cariprazine) met the primary endpoint in a late-stage in adults with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression). The companies plan to seek label expansion into this indication in the second half of 2018 (Read more: Allergan's Vraylar Positive for Bipolar Disease in Phase III).Allergan also announced that the NDA for Seysara has been accepted for review. Allergan and partner Paratek Pharmaceuticals are looking to get the antibiotic approved for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age and older. Approval could come in the second half of 2018.FDA Expands Label of Pfizer’s Bosulif, Grants BTD to Bavencio: The FDA has given its nod for the label expansion of Pfizer’s Bosulif for its use in newly-diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph+ CML) patients. Bosulif‘s initial approval was for use in patients with chronic, accelerated or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.The expanded indication will increase the addressable patient population significantly. According to the American Cancer Society, about 9,000 new CML cases were diagnosed in the United States in 2017.Pfizer also announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) for Bavencio (avelumab) for use in combination with Inlyta in treatment-naïve patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). Avelumab is partnered with Merck KGaA. Breakthrough Therapy Designation helps fasten the development and review of drugs which are being evaluated for the treatment of serious conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may be substantially better than existing treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s).This is the second time that Bavencio has received BTD for a hard-to-treat cancer, the first time being for the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) whose disease has progressed after at least one previous chemotherapy regimen.Label Expansion and Clinical Trial Collaboration for BMY’s Opdivo: Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo, gained FDA approval for yet another indication. The regulatory agency granted approval to Opdivo for intravenous use for the adjuvant treatment of patients with completely resected melanoma with lymph node involvement or metastatic disease. Opdivo is already approved for a wide range of indications alone as well as in combination with other agents and is currently in several studies as well.In fact, the company also announced a clinical trial collaboration with TARIS Biomedical for the evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of TARIS’ TAR-200 (GemRIS) in combination with Opdivo. A phase Ib study will evaluate the combination in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (“MIBC”) who are scheduled for radical cystectomy. Opdivo is one of the prioritized brands in Bristol-Myers’s portfolio with the product bringing in sales of $3.6 billion in the first nine months of 2017.Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up slightly (0.4%) over the last five trading sessions.

95,BMY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) announced two clinical collaborations to evaluate SGN-LIV1A in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).SGN-LIV1A is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that being developed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients whose tumors express the LIV-1 protein.Seattle Genetics’ shares have outperformed the industry year to date. While the stock has been up 16.5%, the industry gained 13.7%.  The company will test SGN-LIV1A in combination with Merck and Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in a phase Ib/II study as first line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic TNBC.  The study is expected to enroll up to 72 patients. Per the agreement, Seattle Genetics will retain global development and commercialization rights to SGN-LIV1A and will hold the investigational new drug (IND) for the study.Additionally, SGN-LIV1A will be evaluated in combination with standard chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in the phase II, I-SPY 2 study for newly diagnosed Stage 2 or 3 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. The study is sponsored by Quantum Leap Health Care Collaborative (Quantum Leap) and is expected to enroll up to 75 patients in the SGN-LIV1A treatment arm. In fact, the study is designed in a way so that it can screen the potential treatments for the specific patient subgroups based on molecular characteristics.Furthermore, four clinical studies are planned for SGN-LIV1A in breast cancer with a focus on TNBC.  Apart from this, SGN-LIV1A monotherapy is being evaluated in an ongoing phase 1 trial for patients with metastatic breast cancer including patients heavily pre-treated for TNBC.In fact, breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women and TNBC. Also, it is very aggressive form and associated with poor patient outcomes.  Therefore, a lot of companies are developing products in this space.Last month, Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INFI  -  Free Report) expanded its existing clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) for evaluating IPI-549 in combination with latter’s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo. The collaboration will include patients with TNBC, who have not been previously exposed to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy.Notably, very few patients with triple negative breast cancer respond to checkpoint inhibitors alone and so they are left with very limited therapeutic options. This, in turn, expands the collaboration to include patients with TNBC, who have not been previously exposed to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. This in turn will enable Infinity to test whether IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo can increase the number of patients who respond to checkpoint inhibition.Seattle Genetics, Inc.

96,BMY,"Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) markets blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, while other well-known names in this market are AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak, Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Olysio.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 3.2 million people in the United States are living with chronic hepatitis C infection while many remain unaware of being infected. There are about 17,000 new hepatitis C cases each year in the United States, many of which go unreported.Considering these numbers, it is not a surprise that quite a few pharma and biotech companies are working on bringing new, improved, shorter-duration HCV treatments to the market. The market is thus getting crowded and seeing increased pricing pressure.  A lot has happened in the HCV space of late.  In September 2017, Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi received approval in China, as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. It is the first Gilead HCV drug to be approved in China.  Meanwhile, Gilead’s single-tablet regimen (STR) of Sovaldi, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, Vosevi received approval in the United States, EU and Canada in July/August. Vosevi became the first once-daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1–6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors.Gilead’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 16.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 14.5% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Meanwhile, AbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the past couple of months. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Maviret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history.Abbvie’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 44% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.However, last week, pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing further development of two of its next-generation hepatitis C (HCV) programs — MK-3682B (grazoprevir/ruzasvir/ uprifosbuvir) and MK-3682C (ruzasvir/uprifosbuvir). The company made this decision based on review of available phase II efficacy data and a heavily crowded HCV market.Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 9.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.Besides Merck, another giant Johnson & Johnson also discontinued the development of its investigational HCV treatment regimen JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir. The company took this decision considering that there are several highly effective therapies available for this indication.Johnson & Johnson’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 15.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.It is believed that the discontinuation of Merck and J&J’s combination HCV regimens should act in favor of Gilead and AbbVie. Gilead and AbbVie should benefit from the lack of additional competition entering the market, at least in the near term. However, the companies will continue to face challenges in the form of declining patient volume and intense pricing pressure. The lack of additional entrants in the market should also slow down the rate of decline in sales.Where Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

97,BMY,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares have gained an impressive 16.7% in the past month, comparing favorably with a gain of 4.5% recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news for the company in the past few weeks.Last week, AbbVie announced the resolution of its ongoing patent dispute with Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), which has delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira to 2023. Per the settlement, AbbVie will grant a non-exclusive license to Amgen, which will allow the latter to sell Amjevita in the United States from Jan 31, 2023 and in most countries in the EU from Oct 16, 2018 and in other markets on different dates.Against the license, Amgen will pay AbbVie pre-specified royalties. This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares though the company is still facing a patent challenge from Boehringer Ingelheim, which gained approval for its biosimilar version of Humira, Cyltezo, in August. Moreover, the agreement gives AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.Secondly, AbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the past couple of months. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Maviret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history.AbbVie announced positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL last month. The data showed that Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”).  Label expansion for this indication should expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential.AbbVie also announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) for evaluating a combination of its investigational antibody drug conjugate ABBV-399 and Bristol-Myers's immunotherapy Opdivo in c-met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Lastly, AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494) met primary endpoints in a phase III study for the treatment of RA with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results for both the doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib compared to placebo. Upadacitinib also met primary endpoints in a phase IIb study for the treatment of adult patients with atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. The company plans to advance the candidate into phase III studies next year. Data from both the upadacitinib studies were announced last month.In fact, so far this year, AbbVie’s share price has increased 43.5%, also comparing favorably with a gain of 17.7% for the industry.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

98,BMY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status to its lymphoma drug, Adcetris, as frontline treatment for advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The company recently completed a phase III study – ECHELON-1 – on the drug for this indication.We remind investors that Adcetris is currently approved as second or third-line treatment for classical Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma after at least one failed multi-agent chemotherapy regimen in the United States as well as Europe.The Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted to speed up the development and review of drugs that target serious or life-threatening conditions.The company’s shares closed 7.9% higher on Monday, following the news. Shares of Seattle Genetics have risen 11.3% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 15.4% in that period. In June 2017, the company announced positive top-line data from the ECHELON-1 study, which demonstrated that Adcetris achieved improvement in modified progression-free survival of statistical significance compared to standard of care chemotherapy. The ECHELON-1 study evaluated Adcetris in addition to Adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine in patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma with no prior treatment. The designation was granted based on the above data.The company expects to submit a supplemental biologics license application (“sBLA”) by the end of 2017.Seattle Genetics is developing the drug in more than 70 clinical studies with key studies including evaluation in T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. The company has completed ALCANZA phase III study and submitted a sBLA last month to expand its label to include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A decision is expected in December 2017. Another phase III study is currently evaluating Adcetris in frontline mature T-cell lymphomas and a recently initiated study is evaluating the drug in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.Adcetris is the only marketed product of Seattle Genetics and generated sales of $144.7 million in the first half of 2017, up almost 16% from the year-ago period. Further label expansion in new indications should boost the sales numbers.However, Adcetris faces competition from other drugs, which include Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda that was recently approved in the lymphoma indication.Seattle Genetics, Inc.

99,BMY,"Late last week, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced its decision to discontinue the development of a couple of candidates in its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) program - MK-3682B (grazoprevir/ruzasvir/ uprifosbuvir) and MK-3682C (ruzasvir/uprifosbuvir). The company’s decision was based on a review of available phase II efficacy data and the growing competition in the HCV market. Merck itself has a marketed product in the HCV market in the form of Zepatier (elbasvir and grazoprevir) which brought in sales of $895 million in the first six months of 2017 (including a $40 million favorable adjustment to rebate accruals due to mix of business). While Merck will continue to work on expanding Zepatier’s utilization across the world, uptake will be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition.Gilead and AbbVie in HCV SpotlightMerck’s announcement has now put the spotlight firmly on Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), two key players in this market.Gilead is the undisputed leader in the HCV market with its HCV products bringing in sales of $5.4 billion in the first half of 2017. The company revolutionized the treatment paradigm in the HCV market with the introduction of Sovaldi by cutting down the duration of treatment to as few as 12 weeks instead of the prior standard of care of up to 48 weeks. Moreover, the need for peg-interferon injections, which come with several side effects, was reduced or eliminated completely.Gilead launched Harvoni next, the first once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of the most prevalent HCV genotype in the United States. This was followed by the launch of Epclusa, the first all-oral, pan-genotypic, single-tablet regimen for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. This year, Gilead gained approval for yet another HCV treatment, Vosevi.Although Gilead ruled the HCV market for quite a few years, sales are declining given intense pricing pressure, growing competition, pricing scrutiny and a declining patient population. The approval of newer HCV products has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of patients who were treated and cured followed by a decline in the number of patients seeking care and being able to access HCV treatment. Gilead expects HCV net product sales in the range of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion in 2017 (announced with Q2 results), representing quite a drop from last year’s HCV product sales of $14.8 billion.Meanwhile, AbbVie’s HCV products include Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasivr), Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets co-packaged with dasabuvir tablets) and Viekira XR (dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir). While Mavyret was approved recently, Viekira sales were $488 million in the first half of 2017. Mavyret, the company’s next generation HCV offering, should be a meaningful contributor to sales from 2018.Other HCV drugs include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza (daclastavir) and Janssen Therapeutics’s Olysio (simeprevir).We remind investors that Merck is not the only company to have taken the decision to halt the development of HCV candidates. Last month, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had announced its decision to terminate a collaboration agreement with Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN  -  Free Report) for HCV.J&J’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals said that it would be discontinuing the development of the investigational HCV treatment regimen JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir.With both Merck and J&J dropping their investigational HCV treatments, Gilead and AbbVie should benefit from the lack of additional competition entering the market, at least in the near term. While the companies will continue to face challenges like declining patient volume and intense pricing pressure, the lack of additional entrants in the market should slow down the rate of decline in sales.Gilead has been working on expanding the HCV market by encouraging baby boomers to get tested. According to the company, there has been an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers since the start of this initiative. Increased testing has led to an increase in diagnosis with about 190,000 people being newly diagnosed with HCV in 2016, up 32% from 2015. This represents a significant opportunity for the existing players in the HCV market.Both Gilead and AbbVie are Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

However, the drug is already approved for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.Generally, Priority Review designation from the FDA is granted to drugs that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease. The FDA also previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this application which is the seventh indication for which Opdivo has received this designation.The supplemental Biologics License Application is based on data from the ongoing phase III CheckMate -238 study. Bristol Myers announced encouraging results from CheckMate-238 study, on Opdivo.CheckMate 238 is a randomized double-blind study of Opdivo versus Yervoy in patients, who have undergone complete resection of stage IIIb/c or stage IV melanoma. Results from the study showed that Opdivo 3 mg/kg led to a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to Yervoy 10 mg/kg in patients with stage IIIb/c or stage IV melanoma following complete surgical resection. The results from the planned interim analysis showed that Opdivo met its primary endpoint, with a statistically significant improvement of 35% in RFS compared to Yervoy. In July 2017, the company reported positive results from the same study.So far this year, Bristol-Myers’ stock has rallied 8.9% compared with the industry’s 18.2% gain. In fact, Opdivo became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval anywhere in the world in July 2014. Notably, the drug became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classic Hodgkin lymphoma — in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions.  It also received approvals for several indications including melanoma, head and neck, lung, kidney and blood cancer. In fact, the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen is approved in multiple markets for the treatment of melanoma.The drug has been performing impressively due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications. Opdivo generated revenues of $1.19 billion in the second quarter of 2017, up 42% from the year-ago period.Meanwhile, the FDA has put a partial clinical hold on three clinical trials, CA209602 (CheckMate-602), CA209039 (CheckMate-039) and CA204142. These trials are investigating Opdivo-based combinations in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Also, concerns from AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) failed study on lung cancer drug, Imfinzi, loom large on the company’s CheckMate 227 study on Opdivo.Currently, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, Bristol-Myers is expected to suffer further loss of market share.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

101,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted priority review to its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Cabomteyx. The sNDA seeks approval of Cabometyx for patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The FDA determined the sNDA to be sufficiently complete.Consequently, the FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of Feb 15, 2018.The sNDA is based on data from the phase II trial, CABOSUN, which is being conducted by The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology as part of Exelixis’ collaboration with the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program.The market for advanced RCC is huge. Per the American Cancer Society’s 2017 statistic data, clear cell RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. 30,000 patients in the United States and 68,000 globally require treatment, and an estimated 14,000 patients in the United States are in need of a first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer every year.We remind investors that Cabometyx was approved by the FDA in April 2016 for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC who received prior anti-angiogenic therapy.New patient starts, refills for patients already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base for Cabometyx are driving the drug’s sales. Hence, a potential approval of Cabometyx is expected to boost sales.Concurrently, Exelixis and partner Ipsen announced that the phase III trial, CELESTIAL, met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS), with cabozantinib providing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in median OS compared to placebo in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  Consequently, the independent data monitoring committee for the study recommended that the trial should be stopped for efficacy following review of the second planned interim analysis.  The company's shares moved up 17.2% following the news. Exelixis’ share price has increased 94.6% year to date, higher than the industry’s gain of 14.0%.Exelixis has collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) for the development of the drug in combination with immunotherapy agentsWe note that GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) Votrient is also approved for clear cell RCC.Zacks RankExelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

102,BMY,"The biotech industry has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year. After declining 5.2% last year, the Large Cap Pharma industry has risen 18.9% so far this year, outpacing 14% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up almost 28% year to date after sliding 19.1% in 2016. The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index has risen 15.4% year to date (YTD) after declining almost 10% last year.The pharma/biotech sector has a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals (11 new drugs approved in Q3 alone) and continued strong performance from legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year. Another factor that has contributed to the sector’s surge is that President Trump's expected action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared.These factors are likely to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs.On the broader macro front, the proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last.Meanwhile, the outlook for the upcoming third quarter results looks bright. Per the Earnings Trends article, the broader Medical sector (includes drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.7% in revenues and 0.8% in earnings in Q3.How to Pick Likely Q3 WinnersGiven the enormity of the healthcare space, selecting stocks that have the potential to beat estimates could appear to be quite daunting. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP. More often than not, a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company leads to stock price appreciation.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of delivering a positive surprise in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are five large-cap pharma stocks that are poised to beat estimates in the third quarter according to our methodology. Investing in stocks with large market cap is a much more reliable investment because of the fact that they control a large portion of their given industry. Also companies with a larger market cap have performed well throughout 2017.Our first pick is Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report). This Indianapolis, IN based company has an Earnings ESP of +1.59% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is $1.03 per share. The company has a mixed earnings surprise record. In fact, Lilly’s earnings surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 0.89%.Lilly is scheduled to report results on Oct 24.Our next choice is Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report). Carrying a Zacks Rank #3, the stock has an Earnings ESP of +0.97%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 64 cents per share. New York-based, Pfizer has a mixed earnings surprise track record. The average negative earnings surprise over the four trailing quarters is 0.39%.Pfizer is scheduled to announce results on Oct 31.AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) too has an impressive track record with the company consistently beating earnings expectations. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 146.25%. It looks poised to beat expectations in the third quarter as well. This London, UK based company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +4.43%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 53 cents per share.AstraZeneca is scheduled to report results on Nov 9.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is another solid bet. This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an Earnings ESP of +2.33%. This New York-based company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 7.99% over the trailing four quarters.Bristol-Myers is scheduled to release results on Oct 26, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter pegged at 75 cents per share.Brentford, UK based GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) makes it to our list of likely outperformers in the third quarter by virtue of its Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +6.30%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 85 cents per share. Glaxo is expected to report its results on Oct 25.    Bottom Line  Challenges in the form of competitive and pricing pressure will remain. However, a number of companies in the healthcare space have fared well. Picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP, could lead investors to gain this earnings season.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

103,BMY,"Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) incurred an adjusted loss of $1.27 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was narrower than the year-ago loss of $1.83 per share as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.28.Clovis’ only marketed drug, Rubraca, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in December 2016 for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have received prior chemotherapies.Net product revenues, entirely from Rubraca, were approximately $16.8 million in the quarter, up a mere 1.2% sequentially. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.22 million. Importantly, the company registered 1400 new patients on Rubraca therapy since its approval. In the fourth quarter, 300 new patients were registered. Presumably, adoption of Rubraca was slower due to its approval only in patients population who have BRCA mutation and increased competition from recently approved maintenance therapies including Tesaro, Inc.’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula and AstraZeneca PLC’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Lynparza.In the year-ago quarter, Clovis had generated revenues of $0.08 million.Shares of the company declined almost 1% in after-market trading on Monday on lower-than-expected Rubraca sales. Moreover, Clovis has significantly underperformed the industry in the past year. While the stock has lost 8.9%, the industry declined 2.5%.Quarter in DetailDuring the fourth quarter, research & development expenses decreased 30.2% year over year to $38 million, primarily due to decreased development activities related to Rubraca and rociletinib programs. However, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses escalated 216% year over year to $38.5 million, reflecting increased activities to support commercialization of Rubraca.Cash used in operating activities in the quarter was $65.6 million, higher than $54.7 million in the year-ago quarter.Clovis ended the quarter with $563.7 million of cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities supported by the proceeds raised through share offerings made in January and June in 2017.2017 PerformanceProduct sales for the full year were $55.5 billion. Rubraca had generated sales of $0.08 in the year-ago period, after it was launched in December 2016. Adjusted loss per share narrowed 34.2% year over year to $5.12.Update on RubracaThe supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Rubraca seeking label expansion as a maintenance treatment for patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer was granted priority review in December 2017. The sNDA was submitted based on positive data from ARIEL 3 confirmatory study. A decision is expected in April 2018.After ARIEL 3, another confirmatory study – ARIEL4 – is evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy and is open for enrolment.Rubraca is also under review in the EU for advanced ovarian cancer indication with BRCA mutation. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use is expected to provide a decision in March 2018. Investors can expect a positive recommendation as the CHMP communicated a positive trend vote last week. Additionally, Clovis has plans to submit a supplemental application seeking approval for second-line or later maintenance treatment indication in the EU, only if approved for the advanced ovarian cancer indication.In July 2017, Clovis announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to evaluate Rubraca in combination with the latter’s PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo, in multiple tumor types. The companies initiated a phase II study in December 2017 to evaluate the combination in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.Clovis is also evaluating or planning to develop Rubraca in several studies to expand its label into additional indications like prostrate, breast and pancreatic cancers, among others either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.Clovis Oncology, Inc.

Data from the study showed that people with type II diabetes, who are treated with once-weekly oral semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist), experienced significant and superior blood glucose control compared to placebo for all three doses (3, 7 and 14 mg) evaluated. Meanwhile, significant and superior weight loss versus placebo was observed in patients who were given the highest dose (14 mg). Novo Nordisk expects to file for approval of the oral formulation of Ozempic in 2019, pending data from the remaining nine PIONEER studies.Ozempic (semaglutide) was approved last year in December as a once-daily pre-filled pen to improve glycaemic control in type II diabetes patients. The approval of Ozempic was based on results from the phase III SUSTAIN study.FDA Accepts Acorda’s Inbrija NDA: Accorda Therapeutics, Inc.’s (ACOR  -  Free Report) NDA for its Parkinson’s disease candidate Inbrija was accepted by the FDA. This marked the resubmission of the NDA for Inbrija.

106,BMY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) reported a net loss of 71 cents compared to a net income of 5 cents in the year-ago quarter. The fourth-quarter saw a significant surge in R&D expenses. Excluding one-time charges and stock-based compensation expenses, earnings per share was $0.02.The Zacks Consensus Estimate was a loss of 52 cents.Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation QuoteQuarterly revenues were $444.1 million, up 36.1% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $418.4 million. The top line was driven by higher sales of Jakafi in the United States and Iclusig in Europe as well as royalties from sales of Jakavi and Olumiant outside the United States. Incyte’s stock lost 29.6% over the past year, compared with the industry’s  1.9% decline.Quarter in DetailJakafi sales grew 26.9%, year over year to $302 million driven by strong patient demand for both indications. Net product revenues of Iclusig amounted to $19.5 million, up from $12.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Product royalty revenues from Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex-U.S. markets grew 57.4% to $52.3 million.R&D expenses were up to $447 million from $161.6 million in the year-ago quarter. SG&A expenses amounted to $98 million, up 1.8% year over year.2018 OutlookThe company expects Jakafi revenues in the range of $1,350-$1,400 million. Iclusig revenues are expected in the range of $80-$85 million.R&D expenses are expected in the range of $1,077-1,172 million. SG&A expenses are still expected in the range of $465-$480 million.Pipeline UpdateThe phase II trial, REACH1 trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD”) has completed enrolment and results are expected in the first half of 2018. Assuming the success of the trial, Incyte expects to submit sNDA seeking approval of Jakafi for this indication.The phase III trial, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat plus Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma is now fully-recruited and initial data are expected in the first half of 2018.Incyte has also opened eight new pivotal trials of epacadostat plus PD-1 antagonists in collaboration with Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report).In December 2017, the New Drug Application (NDA) for baricitinib was resubmitted to the FDA. This was classified as a Class II resubmission, which began a new six-month review cycle. A pivotal trial of baricitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis has also been initiated.The European Commission has already approved baricitinib as Olumiant in February 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to or are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.Our TakeIncyte beat on sales in the fourth quarter on strong Jakafi performance. Jakafi sales were driven by patient demand. The sales guidance for 2018 was also impressive.The label expansion of Jakafi for GVHD will further boost sales. Meanwhile, the NDA for Olumiant was resubmitted and a potential approval will further boost the top line.Zacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

107,BMY,"The recent FDA approval of Exelixis, Inc.’s (EXEL  -  Free Report) Cabometyx for the treatment previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma has put the spotlight in this space.RCC is the most common form of kidney cancer in adults. Per statistics, approximately 30,000 patients in the United States and 68,000 around the world need a first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer. As many as 14,000 patients need the same annually in the United States.The approval comes two months ahead of schedule. We note that Cabometyx (cabozantinib), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, was already approved for the treatment of RCC in patients who have already received anti-angiogenic therapy. Cabozantinib inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinases, including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors, and RET.  The approval came on the back of results from the randomized phase II, trial CABOSUN. The results demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus the current standard of care, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent. Importantly, Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 52% reduction in the rate of disease progression or death. Median PFS for Cabometyx was 8.6 months versus 5.3 months for Sutent corresponding to a 3.3 month (62%) improvement.Sutent is widely used as a first-line treatment for RCC along with Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) Votrient. However, the FDA approval of Cabometyx on excellent rates of PFS might weigh on Sutent going forward though Pfizer too is striving hard to retain the drug’s leadership. In November 2017, the FDA approved a label expansion for Sutent. The drug was approved for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent RCC following nephrectomy (surgical removal of the cancerous kidney). The approval was based on results from the S-TRAC trial that demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of a disease-free survival event (defined as the interval between randomization and tumor recurrence, or secondary primary cancer or death from any cause) for patients at high risk of RCC recurrence who received Sutent compared to placebo in the adjuvant setting.Meanwhile, Pfizer’s another drug, Inlyta, a TKI, is also approved for RCC. Bavencio (avelumab), a monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-L1, in combination with Inlyta is being developed for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC, in collaboration with Merck KGaA .Sector Total Return %   Sector Total Return % |  QuoteOn the other hand, immunotherapies are gearing up too for place in this space. In September 2017, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that a phase III study is evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy combination in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC met its co-primary endpoint. The combination demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) compared to Sutent in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. The combination also met a secondary endpoint of improved OS versus Sutent in randomized patients.  Consequently, an independent Data Monitoring Committee has recommended that the trial be stopped early based on a planned interim analysis.  Last week, the FDA accepted Bristol-Myers’ supplemental Biologics License Application for priority review of Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) to treat intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced RCC with an action date of April 16, 2018. The FDA had previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this application which should expedite the review.Additionally, a variety of combination therapies being developed for RCC, including Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Tecentriq. Earlier in the month, Roche announced that the phase III IMmotion151 study met its co-primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS and demonstrated that the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin provided a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death in patients whose disease expressed the PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1: Expression ≥1%) protein compared with Sutent for the first-line treatment of people who have advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Top-line results from the co-primary endpoint of OS are not mature.Eisai Inc. and Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) are also evaluating the combination of the former’s Lenvima a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (including fibroblast growth factor receptors [FGFR] 1 – 4), in combination with the latter’s anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda for treatment-naïve and previously treated patients with metastatic clear cell RCC. The combination is being evaluated for first-line use of the combination in the ongoing phase III study, CLEAR. The combination reported encouraging interim results in September 2017.Hence, we expect investors to keep their focus in this space in 2018 given the stiff competition brewing up.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

108,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) recently announced FDA approval for label expansion of its lead drug Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The approval came on the back of positive results from the randomized phase II, trial CABOSUN on first line kidney cancer. The results demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent.We remind investors that the company received a significant boost in April 2016 when the FDA approved the tablet formulation of cabozantinib (distinct from the capsule form) under the brand name Cabometyx for the treatment of RCC in patients who have already received anti-angiogenic therapy. Cabometyx was also approved in the EU in September 2016 for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults who had earlier received vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy.Cabometyx raked in strong sales in the first nine months of 2017, reflecting the rising demand for the drug. New patient market share in the second-line plus setting rose to 38%.Hence, a label expansion of the drug for first-line treatment of kidney cancer will increase the target market and boost sales.  Exelixis’ share price has increased 78.9% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 4.2%.Meanwhile, the CELESTIAL study for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is in progress and the top-line results are expected shortly. The company obtained orphan drug designation for the same in the United States. HCC is the most common form of primary liver cancer, accounting for more than 90% of cases in the United States. In October, Exelixis announced that the CELESTIAL trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) with cabozantinib providing statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared to placebo in patients with advanced HCC. The independent data monitoring committee for the study recommended that the trial to be stopped for efficacy following review of the second planned interim analysis. Exelixis plans to submit an sNDA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018.Exelixis has also inked agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents.Zacks RankExelixis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

109,BMY,"AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted and granted priority review to its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the label expansion of Tagrisso (osimertinib). AstraZeneca’s sNDA seeks to expand Tagrisso’s label to include first-line treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) whose tumors have EGFR mutations.With the FDA granting priority review, a decision is expected within six months. The drug also enjoys Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this indication, which was granted in October 2017.A similar application for Tagrisso’s label expansion is under review in the EU and Japan.Tagrisso is already marketed as second-line treatment for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in the United States, European Union, Japan and China.AstraZeneca’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 22% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.3% during the period.The sNDA was based on data from the phase III FLAURA study, which compared Tagrisso with the standard-of-care EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) therapy in the first-line lung cancer setting.Data from the study showed that the risk of progression or death was reduced by more than half in the Tagrisso arm compared to the commonly-used EGFR inhibitors. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 18.9 months for patients on Tagrisso compared with 10.2 months in the comparator arm. Tagrisso was well-tolerated in the trial with a safety profile, consistent with the previous experience.Tagrisso registered sales of $651 million in the first nine months of 2017, reflecting growth of 136% from the year-ago period and accounting for 4% of total sales. A potential approval in the first-line setting will further boost the prospects of the drug.The lung cancer market is crowded with several companies developing or marketing treatments. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report)/Astellas’ Tarceva is approved for treating NSCLC while Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is developing its drug Xalkori in a phase III study as a first-line treatment for NSCLC.

115,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results from a phase II investigator-sponsored trial (“IST”) of cabozantinib for the first-line treatment of metastatic radioiodine (“RAI”)-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (“DTC”).The trial is being conducted by the Center for Rare Cancers and Personalized Therapy at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Enrollment for the trial was completed in August 2017.Patients who were enrolled in this single-arm, open-label trial, were administered oral cabozantinib 60 mg, once daily.  The trial enrolled metastatic, RAI-refractory DTC patients.The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate. Partial response was achieved by 54% of patients (n=19), and stable disease was reported in 43% of patients (n=15) per RECIST 1.1.However, one evaluated patient experienced a decrease in tumor target lesions. Secondary endpoints of the trial include progression-free survival (“PFS”), time to progression (“TTP”), duration of response and clinical benefit rate (“CBR”) defined as the number of patients achieving an objective response or stable disease for at least six months.  The CBR at six months was 80% (n=28). With a median follow up for the study of 35 weeks the median PFS has not been reached. The median TTP among those patients who progressed was 35 weeks.Exelixis plans to initiate a pivotal phase III study on cabozantinib in patients with advanced DTC later in 2018 based on the abovementioned results and data from other studies of cabozantinib in previously treated DTC.  Exelixis’ stock has rallied 30.3% over a year against the industry’’s decline of 4.2%.We note that Exelixis’ lead product, Cometriq, the capsule form of cabozantinib, was approved in the United States in 2012 for the treatment of progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (“MTC”).In April 2016, a tablet formulation of cabozantinib, Cabometyx was approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The recent FDA approval of Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC should further boost demand. The drug demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS versus the current standard of care, Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent.Meanwhile, Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program comprising over 45 clinical studies across multiple indications. The CELESTIAL study for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is also ongoing.  Exelixis also announced collaboration agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) for the development of cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents in early 2017.Zacks RankExelixis carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

117,BMY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 41 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents but wider than the year-ago quarter loss of 39 cents per share.Revenues came in at $129.6 million, up 23.1% year over year, primarily on the back of strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $112.06 million.However, Seattle Genetics’ shares have lost 11.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 0.7% in the same period.Quarter in DetailSeattle Genetics’ top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company’s only marketed product, Adcetris, generated product sales of $83.7 million, up a significant 18% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 24.5% to almost $25.9 million, mainly driven by strong demand for Adcetris in the international market. Collaboration revenues include fees earned from the company’s agreement with Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues increased almost 46% year over year to $20 million, attributable to higher international sales of Adcetris by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $110.5 million, up 2.1% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.1% to $48.5 million. Costs were high, primarily due to investment in development of Adcetris in other indications.2018 OutlookThe company provided its outlook for total revenues in the range of $470 million to $505 million. It expects collaboration and license agreement revenues to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million. The royalties are expected in the range of $75 million to $80 million. Net sales of Adcetris are expected in the range of $340 million to $360 million. The company has not included the impact of a potential line extension of the drug in frontline advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma, for which approval is expected in May 2018.The company anticipates R&D expense to be $460 million to $500 million while SG&A expense is expected in the range of $200 million to $220 million. The rise in SG&A will likely be due to the inclusion of expanded commercial activities related to potential line extension of Adcetris.Pipeline UpdateSeattle Genetics continues to work on expanding Adcetris’ label further through three phase III studies.In November 2017, the FDA approved the expansion of Adcetris’ label to include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In January 2018, the drugwas also approved in similar indication in Europe. Moreover, the FDA has granted priority review for a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) seeking approval to include frontline advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma in its label. The sBLA was filed based on data from phase III study, ECHELON-1, which showed that Adcetris achieved statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival. A decision is expected in May 2018.Moreover, top-line data from the ECHELON-2 study (frontline CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma) should be out in 2018. A separate study is also evaluating Adcetris in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma.In addition, the company is evaluating enfortumab vedotin in a pivotal phase II study in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer patients. Moreover, in November 2017, Seattle Genetics and Astellas Pharma initiated a phase Ib study to evaluate the candidate in combination with CPI therapies, including Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab), in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, in first- or second-line setting. The companies are planning to initiate a phase III study in 2018.Seattle Genetics and Germany-based Genmab are planning to initiate three phase II studies to evaluate tisotumab vedotin in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, metastatic cervical cancer in treatment-naïve women and in a range of other solid tumor types.The company is evaluating another pipeline candidate, polatuzumab vedotin, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The study is being conducted in collaboration with Genentech, a member of Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report).Other ActivitiesIn a bid to boost its pipeline, the company entered into a definitive merger agreement last month to acquire Cascadian Therapeutics for $614 million. The acquisition will add pivotal-stage HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer candidate, tucatinib, to its pipeline.Our TakeThe company’s fourth-quarter loss was narrower than estimated and sales also beat expectations. Given the positive developments for Adcetris, investors should focus on updates of its label expansion. Approval for the Hodgkin lymphoma indication his year will boost sales further. Data from clinical studies from other pipeline candidates are also expected during the year.Seattle Genetics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Seattle Genetics, Inc.

118,BMY,"Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations. However, management issued a bleak view for 2018.  Consequently, the stock declined in after-market hours trading and is expected to open in the red given the expectation of a further decline in hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise in 2018.  Nevertheless, Gilead’s stock has gained 10.9% in the last six months as against the industry's  decline of 4.6%.The company’s fourth-quarter earnings of $1.78 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.70. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $2.70 per share.Moreover, total revenues of $5.9 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.8 billion. However, revenues declined 18.7% year over year. Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and Consensus  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and Consensus | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote Harvoni & Sovaldi Plunges FurtherProduct sales came in at $5.8 billion, down 19.1% year over year. The decline was due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 21.2%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $1.5 billion, down from $3.2 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets.Sales of Harvoni declined 60.7% year over year to $644 million in the quarter. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 78.4% to $117 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $565 million in the quarter, down from the year-ago figure of $1.0 billion.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.7 billion, up 8.8% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $1,060 million, up from $563 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $365 million, up from $149 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $325 million, up from $155 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined 42.6% and 25.2% respectively. Viread sales were down at $212 million, down 34.6%.Atripla sales tanked 27.5% to $440 million, while Truvada sales fell 8.2% to $797 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $233 million (up 3.1%), $200 million (down 4.7%), $90 million (down 4.4%) and $39 million, respectively.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 11.9% to $845 million due to the 2016 impact of ongoing milestone payments. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 1.6% to $923 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 83.5% compared to 88.1% in the year-ago period.2017 ResultsRevenues in 2017 came in at $26.1 billion, down from $30.4 billion in 2016 and surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.9 billion. Earnings per share came in at $8.84, down from $11.57 in 2016 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.73.2018 GuidanceGilead now expects net product sales in the range of $20-$21 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $3.4-$3.6 billion and $3.4-$3.6 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 85-87%.AcquisitionsThe company acquired Kite Pharma in 2017. The FDA approval for Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy should Gilead’s prospects.The company recently acquired Cell Design Labs to expand further in the CAR-T space.Dividend and Share RepurchaseConcurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 57 cents per share of common stock for first-quarter 2018, an increase of 10%. The dividend is payable on Mar 29 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Mar 16. During 2017, the company paid cash dividends of $2.7 billion and repurchased shares for $954 million.Our TakeThough the company topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the fourth quarter, the magnitude of the decline in HCV sales was larger-than-expected. The HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition. We expect sales to decline further going forward.  We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR, Bristol-Myers’(BMY  -  Free Report) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Both pricing and market share are expected to stabilize by mid-2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the United States and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting also put up a strong performance as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 153,000 patients using Truvada by the end of 2017. The approval of Yescarta also bodes well for Gilead. We expect the decline in HCV franchise to offset the positive momentum of HIV franchise. Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market with pipeline candidates- selonsertib and filgotinib.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

119,BMY,"Big-time investors of late have been investing a substantial portion of their R&D sources for the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). The market for NASH is poised to witness rapid growth unlike other lucrative but saturated markets like cancer.A chronic liver disease, NASH is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver which in turn is known as steatosis. NASH is known to affect up to 15 million people in the United Stated and could lead inflammation, hepatocellular injury, progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. It is expected to be the leading cause for liver transplantation by 2020. Notably, it is currently the leading cause of liver transplants for people under 50 in the United States.NASH patients are also known to be affected by obesity and type II diabetes. The disease is prevalent in European countries along with developing countries. The market for this disease is projected around $20-$35 billion. With no treatments currently approved for this disease, the market opportunity is significant.Let us take a look at the companies whose candidates are being evaluated at present for the treatment of NASH.Intercept Pharmaceuticials, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) is presently evaluating lead drug Ocaliva. The drug is already approved in the United States for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with an inadequate response to or intolerant to the standard of care, UDCA. The company currently has an ongoing phase III trial, REGENERATE, in non-cirrhotic NASH patients with liver fibrosis and top-line data from interim analysis is expected in the first half of 2019.The company also completed a phase II trial, CONTROL, to evaluate the lipid metabolic effects of Ocaliva and cholesterol management effects of concomitant statin administration in NASH patients. The company also plans to initiate a phase III trial in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017. Given the success of the phase II trial, we expect Intercept to be one of the first companies to obtain an approval for NASH.Biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) also has quite a few programs for patients diagnosed with NASH along with advanced fibrosis. These include selonsertib (ASK-1 inhibitor; phase III), GS-9674 (FXR agonist; phase II) and GS-0976 (ACC inhibitor; phase II). The company plans to initiate combination studies with three agents in 2017.Given the increasing competition in once lucrative hepatitis C market, Gilead is looking to diversify its portfolio and foray into emerging fields of CAR T therapy and NASH. The company earlier acquired Phenex’s farnesoid X receptor program comprising small molecule FXR agonists for the treatment of liver diseases including NASH.Another major player in the biotech space, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) has a mid-stage candidate in the NASH space. BMS-986036, an investigational pegylated analogue of human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a key regulator of metabolism, in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F1-F3) achieved its primary endpoint of significant reduction in liver fat versus placebo in April. The company was entitled the rights to research, develop and commercialize BMS-986036 from Ambrx, Inc.Swiss major Novartis Inc. (NVS  -  Free Report) entered into a clinical trial agreement with Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) to conduct a phase IIb study in April, involving the combination of a Novartis FXR agonist and Allergan's cenicriviroc for the treatment of NASH. The company has a collaboration and license agreement with Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNAT  -  Free Report) for the global development and commercialization of emricasan for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis caused by NASH.Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return  Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnBottom Line Given the potential in the market, there are many other big pharma and biotech companies having pipeline candidates for the treatment of NASH. We expect a lot of activity in the space going forward. A potential approval of any drug for NASH will attract more players.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

120,BMY,"A series of curious events occurred last Friday morning, which continued — Rube Goldberg-like — throughout the day and, it may be argued, even into this morning’s pre-market trading action. Friday’s Dow closed down 673 points, or -2.57%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hived off roughly 2% each. The Down looks to open down another triple digits, although we’ve seen some early buying back from how low we started this morning.The first thing to have happened was the non-farm payroll report Friday morning, which posted another very strong month for employment gains (+200K). Average Hourly Earnings also gained another third of a percent, meaning wage growth is showing signs of adding to overall inflation in the U.S. And talk of a fourth interest rate hike in the next 12 months from the Fed when incoming Chairman Jay Powell takes over added to the already +50% likelihood of three rate hikes, beginning next month.From there we saw the 10-year bond yield spike up past 2.8%. As Zacks Strategist Tracey Ryniec remarked in real time on Friday, “A strong economy and inflation means no more free money.” Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak reacted, “Perhaps this is the bond market telling the US, ‘We’re a little concerned with that debt situation you’ve got now that you’ve cut those tax rates.’” And Senior Strategist Kevin Cook looked at the VIX and said, “Volume still looks tame, no huge fear. Spot VIX is acting like 1% moves could be normal again. Futures are hardly panicked.”Cook also points out that last week was the worst week… of one of the best two-year rallies we’ve ever seen. Markets are up 65%, so this correction is a mere pittance by comparison. Especially considering — if you can remember back to January 2016, not all that long ago — we saw a sell-off of 6.2%. Right now, even with Monday futures again in sell-off mode, we’re only looking at around -5%. Not really in the same ballpark, at least not yet.Earnings Estimates Going UpIf you’re still concerned about markets swooning to start this new week, a good tonic for you might be Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview, where he points out not only is Q4 earnings season the best we’ve seen in years, but future earnings guidance is shooting up for future quarters. So while we do see some near-term pressure on valuations — which outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen did mention was somewhat of a concern going forward — the name of the game is still earnings, and those are only pointing north.Q4 Earnings RoundupLast week saw a host of marquee names posting quarterly earnings reports, with mostly good results. In fact, the only bottom-line misses we saw stemmed from tax-related write-downs, which are essentially near-term in nature, and not a result of missed expectations (Apple’s [(AAPL  -  Free Report)] lower-than-anticipated iPhone X sales notwithstanding). This week, we see just as many reports hitting the tape, even if they are not quite the same household names as last week.Foodservice giant Sysco (SYY  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both its top- and bottom-lines this morning, with 78 cents per share on $14.41 billion surpassing the 65 cents per share and $14.19 billion in revenues expected. Earnings results for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company rose 34.5% year over year. For more on SYY’s earnings, click here.British pharma major Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) also topped expectations, beating on the bottom line by a penny to 68 cents per share, and quarterly sales of $5.45 billion outpaced the $5.31 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Guidance was ratcheted up a bit, but still within the Zacks consensus. For more on BMY’s earnings, click here.And Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report), the engineered products segment that formerly belonged to aluminum giant Alcoa (AA), easily outperformed both sales and earnings estimates. The company saw 31 cents per share on $3.27 billion in revenues, ahead of the 24 cents per share and $3.07 billion we had been expecting. Guidance on the top-line rose past the Zacks consensus, while full-year earnings remain in-range. For more on ARNC’s earnings, click here.

121,BMY,"Cancer, capable of striking fear in even the strongest of hearts, is a malignancy characterized by uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells, which, if not treated, can lead to death. According to the American Cancer Society, there are more than 100 types of cancers, the deadliest among them being breast cancer, skin cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and blood cancer.Presentations at the European Society for Medical Oncology (""ESMO"") 2017 Congress held between Sep 8 and 12 in Madrid, Spain dominated headlines in the cancer space this week. Major presentations included Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca, plc's (AZN  -  Free Report) positive results from ongoing phase III study in melanoma and lung cancer patients, respectively, and Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) disappointing data for its lung cancer candidate.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAstraZeneca’s Imfinzi Positive in Phase III Lung Cancer Study: AstraZeneca announced promising lung cancer data from a late stage study on its new cancer drug, Imfinzi. Interim data from the phase III study – PACIFIC – demonstrated that Imfinzi achieved an improvement of 11 months in  progression-free survival over standard of care in patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following chemoradiation. Data from a separate phase III FLAURA study on another lung cancer drug, Tagrisso, showed that the drug reduced the risk of progression or death by more than half compared with other commonly-used EGFR inhibitors. (Read more: AstraZeneca's Lung Cancer Study Data Promising)Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo Superior to Yervoy in Melanoma Patients: Bristol-Myers announced data from a phase III study, CheckMate -238, comparing Opdivo to Yervoy for treating patients with stage IIIb/c or stage IV melanoma who have undergone complete resection. Interim data from the study showed that Opdivo is superior to Yervoy. Opdivo achieved a statistically significant improvement of 35% in recurrence-free survival compared to Yervoy. (Read more: Bristol-Myers Reports Positive Results from Melanoma Study)Pfizer’s Xalkori Fails Lung Cancer Study/Xtandi Positive in Prostate Cancer Study: Pfizer’s ongoing phase III study (PROFILE 1014), evaluating Xalkori for the first-line treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC, did not meet its secondary endpoint of significant improvement in overall survival (OS) rates. After a median follow-up of 46 months, the median OS for patients treated with Xalkori was 45.8 months while it was 47.5 months for patients randomized to chemotherapy. However, Pfizer’s prostate cancer candidate, Xtandi achieved a statistically significant improvement in metastasis-free survival. The drug is being evaluated in combination with androgen deprivation therapy in a phase III study (PROSPER) for a potential label expansion to include early stage prostate cancer patients.(Read more: Pfizer Lung Cancer Drug's Overall Survival Data Unfavorable)Disappointing Week for Roche: The FDA accepted Sandoz’s, the generics arm of Novartis, biologics license application for a biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) leukemia treatment Rituxan (rituximab). Novartis has received approval for Rituxan’s biosimilar in Europe in June 2017. Rituxan had recorded sales of almost $3.9 billion in the first half of 2017. In another setback, the FDA approved Amgen/Allergan’s biosimilar version of another key drug, Avastin, for treating multiple cancer indications including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer. The biosimilar will be marketed by the trade name of Mvasi. (Read more: Novartis' BLA for Biosimilar of Rituxan Accepted by the FDA)Other UpdatesApart from the abovementioned news, there were a few other updates in the cancer space. The FDA accepted two New Drug Applications (NDAs) of Array BioPharma seeking approval for the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib to treat patients with BRAF-mutant advanced, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The regulatory body also accepted a supplemental NDA for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) Trisenox seeking label expansion of the drug to include treatment naïve acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. Nektar Therapeutics announced the initiation of dosing in a phase I/II study, which evaluates the efficacy and safety of its lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, in combination with Roche's Tecentriq and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

122,BMY,"Key announcements this week were Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) restructuring plan and Eli Lilly and Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) 2018 outlook. Focus also remained on data presentation at the annual conference of the American Society of Hematology (""ASH"") where companies like J&J, Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) and Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) were present.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesASH Highlights: Several companies were at ASH with data on approved and pipeline drugs. Roche presented phase II data showing that polatuzumab vedotin plus bendamustine and MabThera/Rituxan (""BR"") increased complete response rates compared to BR alone in previously treated aggressive lymphoma. Complete response rates increased from 15% to 40% on the addition of polatuzumab vedotin to BR and patients treated with this combination lived longer compared to patients on BR alone (11.8 months versus 4.7 months). Roche also presented data on a Tecentriq-Avastin combination in certain people with advanced kidney cancer (Read more: Roche Reports Positive Data from Tecentriq Combination Study) and a Venclexta/Venclyxto - MabThera/Rituxan combination in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Read more: Roche/AbbVie Report Positive Phase III Results on Venclexta).Bristol-Myers was also present at ASH with data on Sprycel (dasatinib), which when added to standard chemotherapy showed a three-year survival benefit in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Read more: Bristol-Myers Reports Positive Data on Leukemia Drug).The company and partner Seattle Genetics also presented interim results from a phase I/II study on a combination of Adcetris and Opdivo in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. Combination data showed an objective response rate of 83% and a complete response rate of 62%.Lilly Provides 2018 Outlook: Lilly provided its outlook for 2018 saying that it expects recently launched products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance, Verzenio, Cyramza, Olumiant and Lartruvo to drive low-single-digit revenue growth. The company expects 2018 earnings per share of $4.60 - $4.70 on revenues of $23 - $23.5 billion. However, challenges remain for the company in the form of loss of patent exclusivity for products like Cialis and the impact of generic competition for Strattera, Effient and Axiron. U.S. pricing access pressure will also remain a headwind in 2018.Meanwhile, the company continues to expect 2017 earnings of $4.15 to $4.25 per share on revenues of $22.4 - $22.7 billion. Lilly raised its quarterly dividend by 8% as well. The company also reaffirmed its guidance of average annual revenue growth of at least 5% from 2015 to 2020 and said that it expects operating margin of at least 30% in 2020.On the pipeline front, Lilly expects regulatory action in the United States for baricitinib (treatment of rheumatoid arthritis), galcanezumab (migraine treatment) and a new indication for Verzenio (breast cancer), and the launch of a new indication for Taltz in psoriatic arthritis in 2018 (Read more: Lilly Issues Guidance for 2018, New Drugs to Drive Top Line). The stock has gained 17.6% year to date, compared to the 17.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Teva Shares Up on Restructuring Plan: After weeks of speculation that Teva will be cutting down its workforce, the company announced a restructuring plan that will see about 14,000 job cuts (more than 25% of the company’s global workforce) over the next two years with the majority expected in 2018.The new CEO’s goal is to reduce the cost base, simplify the organization and improve business performance, profitability, cash flow generation and productivity. The company expects to cut $3 billion from its $16.1 billion cost base (estimated for 2017) by the end of 2019. The plan also calls for the optimization of the global generics portfolio, especially in the United States, through price adjustments and/or product discontinuation.Several manufacturing plants in the United States, Europe, Israel and Growth Markets as well as R&D facilities, headquarters and other office locations across all geographies will be shut down or divested. As far as the pipeline is concerned, all R&D programs will be reviewed so that core projects can be identified while other projects are terminated immediately.The company also suspended dividend payments and annual bonus and said it will continue to look for opportunities to divest non-core assets.These steps come at a time when Teva is facing several challenges - the company has significant financial obligations in the coming four years while the environment remains challenging in the company’s largest generic market (the United States). Teva also expects fewer generic product launches in the United States.Teva’s shares were up 10.2% on the restructuring announcement as investors cheered the steps taken by the company though execution remains key.  Priority Review for Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo-Yervoy Combination: The FDA has granted priority review to Bristol-Myers’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the label expansion of Opdivo for use in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). With the regulatory agency granting priority review, a response should be out on Apr 16, 2018.R&D Updates from Sanofi: Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) provided an update on its pipeline (71 R&D projects including 37 new molecular entities and novel vaccines) at an analyst meeting this week. The company said that it expects to start at least 10 late-stage studies in 2018. At least 10 pivotal phase III studies are expected to start over the next 12 months. During this period, Sanofi expects to file for regulatory approval of two investigational cancer drugs (cemiplimab and isatuximab), a type I diabetes treatment (sotagliflozin) and a potential treatment for uncontrolled, persistent asthma (dupilumab).In fact, Sanofi and partner Regeneron announced positive topline results from a pivotal mid-stage study on cemiplimab in 82 patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“CSCC”), the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. Overall response rate (“ORR”) of 46.3% was observed in the study. The companies have started submitting a rolling Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for the PD-1 antibody with the submission expected to complete in the first quarter of 2018 (Read more: Regeneron, Sanofi Report Positive Top Line Skin Cancer Data).Meanwhile, Sanofi gained FDA approval for Admelog (insulin lispro injection), a rapid-acting insulin similar to Lilly’s Humalog, for the management of blood sugar levels at mealtime. Admelog was approved in the EU earlier this year in July (Read more: Sanofi Wins FDA Approval for Biosimilar of Lilly's Humalog).Updates on Merck’s Keytruda: Merck provided a couple of updates related to its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, this week. The company said that an sBLA seeking label expansion for the use of Keytruda for the treatment of relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (“PMBCL”) has been granted priority review by the FDA. The company also presented data at ASH which showed that the use of Keytruda resulted in an overall response rate of 41% in this difficult-to-treat patient population. With the FDA granting priority review, a response from the agency should be out by Apr 3, 2018. Approval would make this the second blood cancer indication for Keytruda with the earlier indication being for use in certain patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Gets FDA Priority Review for Rare Lymphoma).However, Keytruda failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival in a pivotal study for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) adenocarcinoma.

123,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced positive data from phase II study, CA180-372, on Sprycel.Patients received Sprycel 60 mg/m2tablets or powder for oral suspension, once daily, in addition to a chemotherapy regimen modelled on a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster high-risk backbone for two years or until the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity in the ongoing CA180-372 (NCT01460160) study.The study evaluated Sprycel in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) when added to a chemotherapy regimen. The combination demonstrated an event-free survival rate, the study’s primary endpoint, of 65.5% and an overall survival rate of 91.5% after three years.Meanwhile, patients who had minimal residual disease (MRD) ≥0.05% at the end of the first block of treatment and those with MRD 0.005-0.05% who remained MRD-positive at any detectable level after three additional high-risk chemotherapy blocks, were eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission.We remind investors that Sprycel was approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib. Sprycel was also approved for adults with Ph+ ALL who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy.The drug is also approved for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML. Sprycel received FDA approval for the expanded indication for treatment in pediatric patients with CP Ph+ CML in November 2017.The label expansion should improve sales further. So far this year, Bristol-Myers’ shares have rallied 11.6% compared with the industry's gain of 20%.Bristol-Myers’ immuno-oncology Opdivo continues to perform well along with Eliquis and Orencia. The company is looking to expand Opdivo’s label further and recently obtained FDA approval for liver and colorectal cancer. However, Opdivo is currently facing competitive challenges in the United States.The virology business is also under pressure.

124,BMY,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced superiority of its breast cancer candidate – talazoparib – over chemotherapy in improving progression free survival (“PFS”) in a phase III study, EMBRACA.Talazoparib is an investigation dual-mechanism poly ADP ribose polymerase (“PARP”) inhibitor. The company will present the data from the study at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.Shares of Pfizer have gained 9.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s rise of 4.4% in that period.The EMBRACA study evaluated talazoparib as a single agent in patients with germline BRCA-positive breast cancer who have received prior chemotherapy treatment. The candidate achieved a significant reduction of 46% in the risk of disease progression as the median PFS was 8.6 months in the talazoparib arm versus 5.6 month in the chemotherapy arm.Moreover, 62.6% of patients in talazoparib arm achieved complete or partial response against 27.2% of patients receiving chemotherapy.PARP inhibition is a new targeted therapy, which inhibits repair of the DNA of the cell, thus destroying the cell. The label expansion application of AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, is under review in the United States. Meanwhile, Clovis Oncology, Inc.

125,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that its late-stage study evaluating Opdivo versus docetaxel was stopped earlier than expected as it met the primary endpoint. The CheckMate-078 study was being conducted on mainly Chinese patients, who were previously treated for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The study showed that the patients receiving Opdivo (nivolumab) demonstrated superior overall survival benefit (OS) compared with them who received the standard care of treatment, docetaxel. Based on these top-line results, Bristol-Myers submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the Chinese regulatory authority seeking approval for Opdivo in previously treated lung cancer patients. If approved, Opdivo will become the first immuno-oncology treatment approved for previously treated lung cancer patients in China.So far this year, Bristol-Myers’ shares have rallied 8.7% compared with the industry gain of 16.3%.We note that Opdivo is already approved for a number of indications. These include classical Hodgkin lymphoma, recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy. Additionally, it is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy.Opdivo is also approved for intravenous use for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), who have been previously treated with Nexavar. The drug received approval for liver and colorectal cancers as well.Meanwhile, the company continues to evaluate Opdivo alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Label expansion of the drug into additional indications would give the product an access to a higher patient population and increase the its commercial potential significantly.However, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic non squamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

126,BMY,"Monday, February 5, 2018A series of curious events occurred last Friday morning, which continued — Rube Goldberg-like — throughout the day and, it may be argued, even into this morning’s pre-market trading action. Friday’s Dow closed down 673 points, or -2.57%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hived off roughly 2% each. The Dow looks to open down another triple digits, although we’ve seen some early buying back from how low we started this morning.The first thing to have happened was the non-farm payroll report Friday morning, which posted another very strong month for employment gains (+200K). Average Hourly Earnings also gained another third of a percent, meaning wage growth is showing signs of adding to overall inflation in the U.S. And talk of a fourth interest rate hike in the next 12 months from the Fed when incoming Chairman Jay Powell takes over added to the already +50% likelihood of three rate hikes, beginning next month.From there we saw the 10-year bond yield spike up past 2.8%. As Zacks Strategist Tracey Ryniec remarked in real time on Friday, “A strong economy and inflation means no more free money.” Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak reacted, “Perhaps this is the bond market telling the US, ‘We’re a little concerned with that debt situation you’ve got now that you’ve cut those tax rates.’” And Senior Strategist Kevin Cook looked at the VIX and said, “Volume still looks tame, no huge fear. Spot VIX is acting like 1% moves could be normal again. Futures are hardly panicked.”Cook also points out that last week was the worst week… of one of the best two-year rallies we’ve ever seen. Markets are up 65%, so this correction is a mere pittance by comparison. Especially considering — if you can remember back to January 2016, not all that long ago — we saw a sell-off of 6.2%. Right now, even with Monday futures again in sell-off mode, we’re only looking at around -5%. Not really in the same ballpark, at least not yet.Earnings Estimates Going UpIf you’re still concerned about markets swooning to start this new week, a good tonic for you might be Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview, where he points out not only is Q4 earnings season the best we’ve seen in years, but future earnings guidance is shooting up for future quarters. So while we do see some near-term pressure on valuations — which outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen did mention was somewhat of a concern going forward — the name of the game is still earnings, and those are only pointing north.Q4 Earnings RoundupLast week saw a host of marquee names posting quarterly earnings reports, with mostly good results. In fact, the only bottom-line misses we saw stemmed from tax-related write-downs, which are essentially near-term in nature, and not a result of missed expectations (Apple’s [(AAPL  -  Free Report)] lower-than-anticipated iPhone X sales notwithstanding). This week, we see just as many reports hitting the tape, even if they are not quite the same household names as last week.Foodservice giant Sysco (SYY  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both its top- and bottom-lines this morning, with 78 cents per share on $14.41 billion surpassing the 65 cents per share and $14.19 billion in revenues expected. Earnings results for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company rose 34.5% year over year. For more on SYY’s earnings, click here.British pharma major Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) also topped expectations, beating on the bottom line by a penny to 68 cents per share, and quarterly sales of $5.45 billion outpaced the $5.31 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Guidance was ratcheted up a bit, but still within the Zacks consensus. For more on BMY’s earnings, click here.And Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report), the engineered products segment that formerly belonged to aluminum giant Alcoa (AA  -  Free Report), easily outperformed both sales and earnings estimates. The company saw 31 cents per share on $3.27 billion in revenues, ahead of the 24 cents per share and $3.07 billion we had been expecting. Guidance on the top-line rose past the Zacks consensus, while full-year earnings remain in-range.

127,BMY,"As fourth-quarter earnings results are pouring in, the focus is back on the healthcare sector. High on President Trump’s agenda was an attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In less than a year, the Trump administration achieved its primary objectives, tax cuts and a new healthcare legislation, through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The new law effectively repeals the individual mandate, which is essential to the proper functioning of Obamacare. (Read More)However, upbeat quarterly results, rise in demand for new product sales, successful innovation, FDA approvals and product line expansion, strong clinical study results as well as continued strong performance of legacy products propelled the large-cap drug sector to new highs in 2017. These tailwinds are expected to drive the sector’s growth even in 2018. (Read More)The healthcare sector jumped 28.8% in the past year, better than the S&P 500’s 23.7% rally. Signs of the sector’s success became more evident in the last three months, when the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index gained 13.7% and 21.1%, respectively. The broader industry grew 9.7% in the same time period.With Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Feb 2 and Feb 27, respectively, this may be a good time to figure out which of these is a better stock. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major pharma earnings scheduled during this period include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) and Astrazeneca PLC (AZN  -  Free Report). Price PerformanceMerck has seen a gain of 7.4% over the past three months, while Sanofi has declined 5.9%.So Merck is a clear winner in this respect with better returns than both rival Sanofi and the broader industry, which rose 4.5% during the same period.ValuationThe most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks in the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma majors, both Merck and Sanofi are undervalued relative to their broader industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 13.74. However, Sanofi holds the edge here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 8.13 compared with Merck’s value of 10.44.Dividend YieldOver last year, Merck and Sanofi offered dividend yields of 3.24% and 2.5%, respectively, while the industry returned a dividend yield of 2.83%. So Merck has taken lead here too, with respect to both Sanofi and the broader industry.Net MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continually draw attention to allegedly exorbitant drug pricing, which helps the sector maintain its steep margins.With a net margin value of 19.94%, Sanofi underperforms rival Merck, which has a net margin value of 26.98%. In comparison, the broader industry has a net margin value of 25.79%.Return on EquityReturn on equity (ROE) is one of the key financial ratios for pharma companies as these entities employ huge amounts of capital to bring its products to the market. In this respect, using ROE will help in evaluating the company’s ability to generate ample profits from its equity capital.Both pharma companies, Merck and Sanofi have a comparatively lower ROE of 27.08% and 25.19%, respectively, than the broader industry’s value of 29.87%. However, while comparing individual performance, Merck holds an edge over Sanofi.Earnings History and ESPConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Merck has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 7.76%. In comparison, Sanofi delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.03% in the trailing four quarters. Merck managed to post earnings beats in all the four trailing quarters.Meanwhile Sanofi registered an earnings beat only in the first quarter of 2017, while results were in line with estimates over the next two.When considering Earnings ESP, Merck is once again the clear winner. With an ESP of -0.29%, Sanofi is at a disadvantage, since Merck’s ESP is +0.67%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Sanofi holds an edge over Merck when considering only EV/EBITDA ratios. However, when considering price performance, ROE and net margins Merck is at an advantage over Sanofi. Additionally, Merck also sports a better dividend yield than Sanofi and with a more comprehensive look at its previous earnings performance, Merck is clearly the better stock.What clinches the case in favorof Merck at this point of time is that it has a positive ESP, which is a leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. This is why it may be better to bet on Merck over Sanofi as both prepare to report earnings over the next few days.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

128,BMY,"Several important developments were reported this week with key highlights including the termination of a hepatitis C virus deal, the approval of the first cancer biosimilar in the United States and the presentation of data by companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) among others.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAchillion Down on HCV Deal Termination: Achillion Pharmaceuticals’s (ACHN  -  Free Report) shares fell on the termination of the company’s partnership agreement with Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals for hepatitis C virus (""HCV""). Janssen said that it will not continue with the development of JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir. The decision to discontinue development does not come as a big surprise given the intense competition and pricing dynamics in the HCV market. Achillion intends to focus on the development of advanced multiple small molecule factor D inhibitors of the complement alternative pathway (Read more: Achillion's HCV Partnership with J&J Terminated, Stock Falls).First Cancer Biosimilar Gets FDA Nod: The FDA approved Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) and Amgen’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). Mvasi can be used for all eligible indications of the reference product. Approval was in line with expectations considering the favorable vote the biosimilar got from an FDA advisory panel recently. The approval is quite a boost for the companies as well as the effort to lower drug prices though so far biosimilars are yet to make a significant dent in referenced product sales in the United States. Mvasi is under review in the EU.Pfizer’s Xtandi PROSPERs in Late-Stage Study: Pfizer and partner Astellas Pharma could well be on the path to boost sales of their prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, with the companies announcing positive top-line data from a late-stage study (PROSPER) in patients with non-metastatic (M0) castration-resistant prostate cancer (""CRPC""). The companies plan to discuss this data with regulatory authorities for the expansion of the drug’s label. Xtandi sales, which have been under pressure, should receive a boost on approval for this patient population.Bristol-Myers Signs Deal, Presents Cancer Data: Bristol-Myers Squibb presented data at the European Society for Medical Oncology (""ESMO"") 2017 Congress showing that treatment with Opdivo led to superior recurrence-free survival (35%) compared to Yervoy in patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Read more: Bristol-Myers Reports Positive Results from Melanoma Study).Meanwhile, the company has signed a deal with Halozyme for the latter’s ENHANZE technology. The global collaboration and license agreement is focused on the use of Halozyme’s technology for the subcutaneous administration of Bristol-Myers’s immuno-oncology drugs thereby providing patients with more flexible and convenient treatment delivery options.Bristol-Myers will shell out $105 million upfront plus make future milestone and royalty payments. The dilutive transaction is expected to hit Bristol-Myers’s 2017 and 2018 earnings by a penny and 2019 earnings by five cents.Lilly’s Baricitinib Fares Well in Mid-Stage Eczema Study: Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Incyte presented new safety and efficacy data from a mid-stage study on baricitinib for eczema at the annual meeting of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (""EADV""). Baricitinib, when combined with a mid-potency topical corticosteroid (""TCS""), significantly improved the signs and symptoms of eczema compared to TCS alone. The companies intend to commence a phase III program for the eczema indication later this year. Baricitinib is currently approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant for moderate-to-severe-active rheumatoid arthritis. However, approval is yet to come in the United States where a regulatory filing will be resubmitted by Jan 2018. Lilly stock has gained 12.9% year to date, compared to the 16% rally of the industry it belongs to.Teva Appoints New CEO: Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) has finally ended its search for a Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) with the company announcing the appointment of Kare Schultz as the company’s President and CEO. A seasoned veteran in the healthcare industry, Schulz will bring with him almost thirty years of experience in this segment. Schulz was recently serving as the President and CEO of H. Lundbeck A/S, where he was responsible for implementing significant restructuring initiatives and launching a robust turnaround strategy. Schulz has a daunting task ahead of him considering the challenges being faced by Teva including generic pricing erosion. The company needs to work on paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track (Read more: Teva Hires Kare Schultz as CEO: Is a Recovery in the Cards?).Positive FDA Panel Vote for Glaxo’s Shingles Vaccine: GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) got a positive vote from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (“VRBPAC”) for Shingrix for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) in adults ages 50 and over. Given the positive vote, chances of gaining approval look pretty high. We note that Merck’s Zostavax, a live attenuated virus vaccine is currently available for the prevention of shingles in the same patient population (Read more: Glaxo's Shingles Candidate Gets Positive FDA Committee Vote).Glaxo is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

129,BMY,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate efficacy and safety of its lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, in combination with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).Notably, the checkpoint inhibitor, Tecentriq, is approved for the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma in the United States and Keytruda was recently approved for refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in both the United States and the EU.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has surged 78.2%, much above the broader industry’s 4% increase.The PROPEL study complements Nektar’s ongoing PIVOT trial under which, NKTR-214 is being evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers' (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo (nivolumab) across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications in phase I/II studies. The PROPEL study is aimed at establishing synergy of NKTR-214 when combined with either Tecentriqor Keytruda.The study will be conducted into two separate arms with 30 patients in each. The first arm will evaluate the combination of NKTR-214 with Tecentriq dose regimen of every three weeks in patients adhering to approved treatment settings of Tecentriq, including patients with non-small cell lung cancer or bladder cancer. On the other hand, the second arm will assess dose regimen of NKTR-214 in combination with Keytruda per three weeks in approved treatment settings of Keytruda including patients with melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer or bladder cancer.Per the company, these combination therapies could provide cancer patients suffering from multiple tumor types with new treatment options combined with approved checkpoint inhibitor therapies.Apart from NKTR-214, another interesting candidate in the company’s portfolio is Onzeald, currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treating adults with advanced breast cancer having brain metastases. However, in July 2017, Nektar filed a request for re-examination of the negative opinion adopted by CHMP on the same.Meanwhile, Nektar initiated a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) on Onzeald, compared with single-agent chemotherapy of the physician’s choice in patients with advanced breast cancer having brain metastases shortly. Positive results from the study could support a regulatory filing in the United States.Other pipeline candidates in the company’s portfolio include NKTR-181 (mu-opioid analgesic candidate for chronic pain conditions; phase III) and NKTR-358 (autoimmune disease; phase I).Successful development and commercialization of these candidates will boost the company’s top line considering the lucrative markets they are targeting.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

131,BMY,"Pipeline and regulatory updates were the focus this week with the FDA approving the first two-drug HIV treatment in the United States and the European Commission (“EC”) granting approval to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Tremfya and expanding the label of Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Tasigna.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJ&J, Glaxo HIV Drug Gets FDA Nod: J&J and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for the first two-drug HIV treatment in the United States. Juluca combines two approved HIV drugs - Tivicay (50 mg) and Edurant (25 mg) – into a single, once-daily pill for the maintenance treatment of virologically suppressed HIV-1 infection. The companies expect to make the drug available in U.S. pharmacies from December 11.Juluca marks the beginning of a new era in HIV treatment with other companies like Gilead also working on bringing better treatments to the market (Read more: J&J & Glaxo Get FDA Approval for First Two-Drug HIV Regimen)..EU Nod for J&J Psoriasis Drug: Janssen-Cilag International NV, a J&J company, gained EU approval for its psoriasis drug, Tremfya, for use in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy. Approval was expected considering the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) had adopted a positive opinion in September. The drug was approved in the United States earlier this year in July.Although the psoriasis market is pretty crowded, about 125 million people across the world are estimated to suffer from psoriasis including 14 million Europeans. 20% of these cases are considered moderate to severe. Tremfya is currently in late-stage development for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.Johnson & Johnson is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Roche Presents Data on Hemophilia and Cancer Drugs: Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) presented positive data on its recently approved hemophilia drug, Hemlibra, from a late-stage study (HAVEN 3) in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years or older) with hemophilia A without inhibitors to factor VIII. The study met its primary endpoint as well as key secondary endpoints with Hemlibra significantly reducing bleeds.Roche also presented positive data on a combination of its two cancer drugs, Tecentriq and Avastin, in patients with a type of advanced lung cancer. The drugs plus chemotherapy were found to significantly cut down the risk of disease worsening or death in the first-line treatment of these patients. Roche intends to submit this data to the FDA as well as other regulatory agencies. Although the data is not fully mature, Roche said that initial observations show encouraging overall survival (“OS”) data. The next OS analysis is scheduled for the first half of 2018 (Read more: Roche Reports Positive Data From Tecentriq Combination Study).Label Expansion for Novartis Cancer Drug: The EC has expanded the label of Novartis’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”), Tasigna (nilotinib), so that it can be used for the treatment of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) and pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including Gleevec (imatinib). Approval for this indication was expected given a positive CHMP opinion issued in September. With treatment options being limited for children with CML, there is significant unmet need in this patient population (Read more: Novartis Receives EC Nod for Tasigna Label Expansion).J&J Seeks Label Expansion for Darzalex: J&J’s Janssen-Cilag International NV is looking to expand the label of its immunotherapy Darzalex so that it can be used in combination with Velcade (bortezomib), melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. Approval would expand the patient population significantly. Regulatory applications have been submitted in the United States as well as the EU. FDA approval would make this the fifth indication for Darzalex in the United States and the first in the frontline setting (Read more: J&J Seeks Darzalex's Label Expansion in First-Line Setting).J&J has gained 19.2% year to date, compared to the 14.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 0.2% over the last four trading sessions.

133,BMY,"There were quite a few important developments this week with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announcing that it is streamlining its operations and cutting down its workforce as it focuses on developing new medicines and improving its cost structure. Meanwhile, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that its CEO will be stepping down in 2018.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly to Streamline Operations, Cut Jobs: Lilly announced a restructuring plan which will see the company streamlining operations so that it can focus on developing new medicines and improving its cost structure. The company will be cutting down 3,500 jobs with most of the reductions expected from a U.S. voluntary early retirement program. Lilly will also be closing down certain sites and will move production from its Larchwood, IA animal health manufacturing facility to an existing plant in Fort Dodge, IA. A research and development office in Bridgewater, NJ, and the Lilly China Research and Development Center in Shanghai, China, will also shut down.Lilly expects to generate annualized savings of about $500 million from 2018 – this will be used toward improving the cost structure, new product launches and label expansion studies. The streamlining program will result in the company incurring pre-tax charges of about $1.2 billion (post-tax charges of 80 cents per share) which will be recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. While this will cut down the reported earnings guidance, adjusted earnings outlook remains unchanged. Lilly also said that with its streamlining efforts, it now expects to achieve an OPEX-to-revenue ratio of 49% or less in 2018, indicating an improvement from its previous forecast.Merck to Buy Rigontec in Immuno-Oncology Focused Deal: The immune-oncology space continues to attract the interest of big pharma players with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announcing its intention to acquire Rigontec in a deal worth up to €464 million including an upfront payment of €115 million. Rigontec's expertise lies in accessing the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway, which is a part of the innate immune system, with the goal of inducing both immediate and long-term anti-tumor immunity. The acquisition will add Rigontec’s lead candidate, RGT100, to Merck’s pipeline. RGT100 is currently in early-stage development in patients with various tumors (Also read: Merck Opts for Buying German Immuno-Oncology Biotech).Merck also announced that the European Commission has expanded the label of its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for the treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer (Also read: Merck's Keytruda Gets EU Approval for Bladder Cancer).BMY’s Opdivo Impresses in RCC Study: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) had some mixed news on its PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo. The company said that  a late-stage study (CheckMate -214) evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy  was stopped early for showing overall survival (“OS”) benefit in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”).Following a planned interim analysis, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”) recommended that the study should be stopped early. The combination would provide RCC patients with a new first-line treatment option. Approval for this indication would boost sales significantly. There is significant unmet need in this area with RCC being the most common type of kidney cancer in adults with a five-year survival rate for the advanced or metastatic stage being 12.1%.The second set of Opdivo related news was not so encouraging with the company saying that a partial clinical hold has been placed by the FDA on three Opdivo-based combination studies in multiple myeloma. The FDA decided to place the studies on partial hold following the identification of risks identified in combination studies evaluating Merck’s Keytruda for multiple myeloma.Mylan Faces 3-Month Delay in Herceptin Biosimilar Decision: Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) and partner Biocon will have to wait a bit longer before they get a response from the FDA for their biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab). The FDA informed Mylan that it is extending the target action date by three months so that it can review some of the clarificatory information submitted to them as a part of the application review process. As a result, the regulatory body will now issue a response regarding the approval status of the biosimilar on Dec 3, 2017.The biosimilar version had received a favorable vote (16-0) in July from the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”). Herceptin is approved for a wide range of indications including HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic and adjuvant settings.Novartis CEO to Retire in 2018, Replacement Announced: Novartis’ CEO, Joseph Jimenez, will be stepping down from his position in 2018. The Board of Directors has appointed Vasant (Vas) Narasimhan, M.D., Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, as his successor, effective Feb 1, 2018 (Also read: Narasimhan to Replace Jimenez as Novartis CEO in 2018). Novartis' stock has gained 17.1% year to date, outperforming the 12.7% rally of the industry it belongs to. Novartis is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FDA Issues Warning Letter to Pfizer: Pfizer got a warning letter from the FDA regarding its manufacturing facility, Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc. at Brentwood, MO. The letter mentions significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (“CGMP”) requirements for combination products. The company has been accused of failing to thoroughly investigate several serious component and product failures for its EpiPen products (manufactured on behalf of Mylan), including failures associated with patient deaths and severe illness.Earlier this year in March, Meridian Medical Technologies had announced a voluntary recall of its EpiPen products following the receipt of two previously disclosed reports outside the United States of failure to activate the device due to a potential defect in a supplier component.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 1.5% over the last four trading sessions.

134,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA put a partial clinical hold on three clinical trials- CA209602 (CheckMate-602), CA209039 (CheckMate-039) and CA204142.The trials are investigating Opdivo-based combinations in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.The FDA put these studies on hold due to risks identified in Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, another anti–PD-1 agent, in patients with multiple myeloma.The FDA maintained that data obtained from non-Opdivo studies indicate that the risks of PD-1/PD-L1 treatment plus Pomalyst or Revlimid and possibly PD-1/PD-L1 treatments alone or with other combinations outweighs the potential benefits for patients with multiple myeloma.Consequently, no new patients will be enroled in the studies but patients who are currently enroled in CheckMate-602, CheckMate-039 and CA204142 and experiencing clinical benefit can continue with the treatment.The company is working in tandem with the FDA to address these issues.We note that in July 2017, the FDA placed a clinical hold on KEYNOTE-183, KEYNOTE-185 and KEYNOTE-023, three combination studies of Keytruda in multiple myeloma. The decision was taken following a review of data by the Data Monitoring Committee in which higher deaths were reported in the Keytruda arms of KEYNOTE-183 and KEYNOTE-185 leading to a halt in enrolment.Our TakeThe news comes as a disappointment for investors. Earlier in 2017, the company suffered a setback in January 2017 when it decided not to pursue the accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the United States based on a review of available data.Bristol-Myers’ stock has gained 7.5% in the year to date against the industry’s 14.5% gain.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classic Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016). In November 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Label expansion into additional indications might give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug. Moreover, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. In addition, concerns from AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) failed study on lung cancer drug Imfinzi loom large on the company’s CheckMate 227 study on Opdivo.Zacks Rank& Key PickBristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Aduro Biotech, Inc.

135,BMY,"Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the U.S. preceded only by heart disease.The traditional cancer treatments include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However, immunotherapy, gene therapy and other new novel therapies are being developed to improve, supplement or replace traditional cancer treatments with the target to reduce or remove cancerous growths.According to a report by the American Cancer Society, almost 1.7 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2017, which creates significant need for effective cancer medication. It goes without saying that all big pharma companies are gearing up to develop and bring innovative cancer treatments to market as well as expand the labels of their marketed oncology drugs. These pharma/biotech giants have significant financial resources at their disposal and have even collaborated to pool their resources and technology.Here we discuss four pharma giants, which possess the industry’s strongest oncology pipeline portfolios.AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report)AstraZeneca is working on strengthening its oncology product portfolio and has several candidates in its pipeline. The company’s target is to launch at least six new oncology medicines between 2014 and 2020, including Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi, which are already approved and marketed.An interesting candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology pipeline is Imfinzi (durvalumab) being evaluated for multiple cancers (either alone or in combination with other regimens), including phase III trials in combination with tremelimumab in first-line urothelial cancer, NSCLC, small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) among others. Imfinzi was launched in the U.S. for the first indication – second line advanced bladder cancer - in May 2017.Other phase III oncology candidates in AstraZeneca’s pipeline include acalabrutinib (blood cancers.), moxetumomab pasudotox (leukaemia), selumetinib (thyroid cancer) and savolitinib (kidney cancer).Lynparza, presently marketed for advanced ovarian cancer, is also in different studies for a range of tumor types including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers as well as earlier-line settings for ovarian cancer. Tagrisso is also being evaluated in earlier-line settings for lung cancer.AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have moved up 10%, comparing unfavorably to a 12.3% increase for the large-cap pharma industry.Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report)Pfizer’s newly approved immunotherapy, Bavencio, is being considered a significant top-line driver for this New York-based pharma giant.Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in March 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio is under review in the EU for MCC with a decision expected in the third quarter of 2017. Pfizer is focusing on continuously growing and expanding Bavencio into new indications and markets globally.Pfizer has also initiated avelumab double/triple combination studies for chemotherapy and targeted therapies and has 11 avelumab combination therapies with immuno-oncology agents under development.Pfizer’s two other oncology candidates have also been approved by the FDA recently – Besponsa - for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in August and Mylotarg for new or relapsed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in September. Other cancer candidates in Pfizer’s pipeline include talazoparib (advanced breast cancer) and dacomitinib (advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations).Pfizer is also aggressively working on expanding the labels of approved cancer drugs like Ibrance and Xalkori.Pfizer also carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So far this year, Pfizer’s shares have moved up 4.1%.AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report)AbbVie is working on expanding and accelerating its presence in oncology and building upon its growing position in hematological oncologyAbbVie’s Imbruvica, currently approved for several cancer indications, has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is positioning Imbruvica as a “pipeline in a molecule” - the treatment is in several company-sponsored studies.With the 2016 acquisition of cancer drugmaker, Stemcentrx AbbVie gained a late-stage candidate, rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T, four additional early-stage compounds in solid tumor indications and a significant portfolio of pre-clinical assets. Rova-T is currently in registrational studies for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A phase I, eight-arm ""basket study"" on Rova-T in neuroendocrine tumors is also ongoing. According to AbbVie, the candidate has blockbuster potential and could be launched in 2018. AbbVie intends to study the candidate for additional indications and estimates peak sales close to $5 billion.AbbVie is also studying marketed cancer drug Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies.AbbVie also carries a Zacks Rank #3. So far this year, AbbVie’s shares have moved up 20.2%.Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report)Bristol-Myers PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo, has been performing impressively while Bristol-Myers is working on expanding the label of Opdivo further, alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents.Further, Bristol-Myers’ cancer portfolio includes multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti and leukemia drug, Sprycel, contributing to the top line. In addition, Bristol-Myers is evaluating other immune system pathways for the treatment of cancer. These pathways may help the company bring to market potentially transformational immunotherapies – in combination or as monotherapy – to help fight different types of cancers.Bristol-Myers also carries a Zacks Rank #3. So far this year, Bristol-Myers’ shares have moved up 2.3%.Others Not Far BehindMerck (MRK  -  Free Report) is also conducting numerous studies to evaluate its highly successful anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies.Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla. Apart from its strong breast cancer franchise, Roche’s oncology portfolio also boasts of lung cancer drugs like Avastin and Tarceva, immuno-oncology drugs like Tecentriq and newly approved multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus. Label expansion efforts are ongoing for all these cancer drugs.Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) also boasts many experimental cancer drugs in its R&D pipeline including a couple of biosimilar versions of popular cancer drugs. Novartis' cancer pipeline was bolstered by the deal to buy most of Glaxo's (GSK  -  Free Report) oncology portfolio in 2014.Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) also laid out its oncology strategy at its Q2 call held in July, which involves building on key treatments like Cyramza, Lartruvo and abemaciclib as foundational agents while focusing on developing new standard-of-care changing therapies and combination regimens, including immuno-therapies.ConclusionCompetition in the cancer market is fierce and not all pipeline candidates will be successful. However, pharma biggies have enough late-stage cancer programs in their portfolios and there are chances of quite a few rollouts in the coming years.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

136,BMY,"The FDA, which approved 22 novel drugs last year, has given its approval to 31 drugs so far in 2017 including five in August. Key approvals this year include Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Some of these drugs have blockbuster potential.A recent landmark approval was that of Novartis’ Kymriah, making it the first gene therapy in the United States. This marks the beginning of a new era for the treatment of cancer and other serious and life-threatening diseases.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of September.Will the FDA Follow the Advisory Panel Vote for Mylan’s Herceptin Biosimilar?Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) should hear from the FDA soon about the approval status of its biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab). The company and its partner, Biocon Ltd. got a favorable vote (16-0) from the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) in July for the biosimilar. Herceptin is approved for a wide range of indications including HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic and adjuvant settings.Earlier this year, Mylan had entered into a global settlement agreement with Roche’s Genentech, and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. for Herceptin (trastuzumab), under which Mylan got global licenses (excluding Japan, Brazil and Mexico) for its trastuzumab product. Mylan could well be the first to launch a biosimilar version of Herceptin in the United States. Approval would boost investor sentiment for the company which has lost 17.3% year to date versus the 17.9% decline of its industry.FDA Advisory Panels to Discuss Glaxo, Pfizer & PTC Therapeutics DrugsQuite a few FDA advisory panel meetings are scheduled for this month. The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Committee (VRBPAC) will be meeting on Sep 13 to discuss the safety and effectiveness of GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) Shingrix. Glaxo is looking to get the non-live, recombinant vaccine approved for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) in people who are 50 years old or above. Shingles, a common and potentially serious condition, can cause lasting pain and other complications such as scarring or visual impairment.Then on Sep 19, the FDA’s ODAC will be meeting to discuss the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) submitted by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) for its cancer drug, Sutent. Pfizer is looking to expand Sutent’s label for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) following nephrectomy (surgical removal of the cancer-containing kidney). The FDA is expected to render a final decision regarding the label expansion in Jan 2018. Sutent brought in sales of $529 million in the first half of 2017.Later this month, on Sep 28, the FDA’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee will discuss PTC Therapeutics’ (PTCT  -  Free Report) new drug application (“NDA”) for Translarna (ataluren) for the treatment of patients with dystrophinopathy due to a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. Translarna is already approved outside the United States. The FDA is expected to give a response regarding the approval status of the drug by Oct 24, 2017.Will the FDA Grant Approval to Amgen/Allergan’s Avastin Biosimilar?Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan are also expecting a decision from the FDA for their biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). With the companies getting a favorable vote from an FDA advisory panel (“ODAC”) recently, chances of gaining approval on the FDA action date of Sep 14 look good. Shares of Amgen have gained 22.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 15.9%.Merck, Bristol-Myers Seek Label ExpansionMerck (MRK  -  Free Report) is looking to expand the label of its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for use in the treatment of recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Keytruda is under priority review for this indication with a response expected on Sep 22. Keytruda, which brought in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017, is a key product in Merck’s portfolio and is being evaluated for a wide range of indications. Merck has gained 8.4% year to date versus the 12.3% growth of its industry.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is also looking to expand the label of its PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo. Opdivo is under priority review for use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) after prior treatment with Nexavar (sorafenib). The FDA is expected to give a response on Sep 24, 2017. Opdivo, one of the prioritized brands in Bristol-Myers’ portfolio, brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017. Bristol-Myers has gained 2.5% year to date versus the 12.3% growth of its industry.Will the FDA Approve J&J’s Plivensia?Johnson & Johnson’s investigational rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor, is under FDA review with a response expected on Sep 23. However, early in August, Plivensia failed to get the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee on safety concerns. J&J is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Considering the safety concerns raised by the panel, it’s quite likely that the agency will ask for additional information before granting approval. Shares of J&J have gained 13.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally.Neos Therapeutics is also awaiting a decision this month for NT-0201, its amphetamine XR liquid suspension product candidate for attention deficit hyperactive disorder (“ADHD”). Approval on Sep 15, 2017 would allow the company to go ahead with its plans to launch the product in Jan 2018.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

137,BMY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) published an abstract containing new and updated data from the ongoing phase I/II ECHO-202 trial on epacadostat.The ECHO-202 study (NCT02178722) is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Incyte’s selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor epacadostat in combination with Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in patients with advanced melanoma.Data from the study revealed robust and durable responses in patients with advanced melanoma treated with the combination of epacadostat and Keytruda.Across all efficacy-evaluable advanced melanoma patients, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.4 months, with PFS rates of 70%, 54%, and 50% at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months respectively. Median PFS was not reached for patients who were treatment-naïve for advanced disease, with landmark PFS rates of 68%, 52% and 52% at 6 months, 12 months and 18 months, respectively.The ECHO clinical trial program is being conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat as a core component of combination therapy in oncology. Incyte is evaluating epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in a broad range of solid tumor types as well as hematological malignancies.ECHO-301 (NCT02752074), a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is investigating Keytruda in combination with epacadostat or placebo for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, is also ongoing and fully recruited.Meawnhile, Incyte has extended its collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) evaluating epacadostat in combination with Opdivo in pivotal studies in two tumor types (planned initiation before 2017 end).In 2014, Incyte signed clinical trial collaboration agreements with Merck, Bristol-Myers, and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) among others to evaluate epacadostat with their respective anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents in phase I/II studies.Incyte’s stock gained 38.7% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 15.3% gain.We believe the agreements not only validate the company’s research approach, they also enhance the company‘s financial position as Incyte stands to earn revenues in the form of milestone payments and royalties on successful development and commercialization.However, in June 2017, Incyte and Roche decided to end the ECHO-110 trial of epacadostat plus Tecentriq for further enrolment because of slow study recruitment.Zacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

138,BMY,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and partner Avillion announced that a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Bosulif has been accepted and granted priority review by the FDA.We remind investors that Bosulif is currently approved for the treatment of chronic, accelerated or blast phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in adults who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy.The company is looking to get the drug approved for the first-line treatment of patients suffering from chronic phase Ph+ CML. A decision from the FDA is expected in December 2017.Additionally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also accepted a similar regulatory application for review.Pfizer shares have gained 3.1% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 11.4% in the same period.The application also includes patients who are not eligible for treatment with Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Gleevec or Tasigna and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Sprycel.The regulatory application in the U.S. and EU based on data from the phase III BFORE study, which evaluated a 400 mg dose of Bosulif in newly diagnosed Ph+ CML patients. The results showed that Bosulif achieved major molecular response at 12 months in significantly higher number of patients compared to Gleevec.Per the press release, there are 48,000 patients with CML in the U.S. and 9,000 new cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2017. This represents an opportunity for Bosulif if approved as first-line treatment for Ph+ CML.Pfizer is expecting a decision from the FDA on label expansion of another leukemia drug, Mylotarg in first-line setting for treating acute myeloid leukemia in September 2017. In July, the FDA’s advisory panel had voted in favor of approval of the sNDA for Mylotarg.Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus  Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus | Pfizer, Inc.

139,BMY,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced the submission of regulatory applications to the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (""EMA"") seeking label expansion of its multiple myeloma (“MM”) drug Darzalex in the first-line setting.A potential approval will allow Darzalex to be used in combination with J&J’s proteasome inhibitor MM drug Velcade (bortezomib), melphalan and prednisone to treat MM in treatment-naïve patients who cannot have autologous stem cell transplantation in bone marrow. If approved, this will be the fifth indication for the drug.We are encouraged by J&J’s efforts to expand Darzalex’s label further, a drug which generated one-sixth of the company’s total oncology sales in the first nine months of 2017. We note that Darzalex was first approved in November 2015 as monotherapy for MM in patients treated with at least three prior lines of therapy, followed by approvals in the past two years as combination therapy in second and third-line settings.J&J’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The company’s shares have gained 20.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 14.8%.J&J has submitted top-line data from the phase III ALCYONE study to support its regulatory applications in both the geographies. Data from the study showed that the Darzalex combination therapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50% when compared to treatment with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (standard of care) alone.J&J will present the data at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology scheduled to be held between Dec 9 and Dec 12.We note that J&J licensed Darzalex from Genmab through its subsidiary, Janssen, in 2012. J&J holds the worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the drug and has to pay milestone payments to Genmab.Per the National Cancer Institute, 30,280 new patients are likely to be diagnosed with MM and it will cause 12,590 deaths in the United States in 2017 alone.Darzalex competes with other approved and marketed treatments for MM, which include Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid, Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Kyprolis and Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Emplicti.Johnson & Johnson Price  Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson QuoteJ&J carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

140,BMY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) announced the initiation of a phase II study on its human monoclonal antibody, CDX-3379 in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (""HNSCC"").With no approved products in its portfolio, investor focus remains on the progress of Celldex’s pipeline candidates.Shares of the company were up more than 2% on Friday following the news. However, Celldex’s shares were down 17.8% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 1.5% in that period.The phase II study will evaluate CDX-3379 in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Erbitux in patients with advanced HNSCC who are Erbitux resistant and previously treated with an anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitorThe company believes that the patient population being evaluated in the study has limited availability of treatment options and a particularly poor prognosis. The study will continue the treatment till progression of the disease starts or patients become intolerant to the combination therapy. The primary objective of the study is to achieve objective response rate.The two-stage study will enroll 13 patients in the first stage and initiate the second stage upon achieving partial or complete response in at least one patient.We remind investors that a completed phase Ib study on the combination therapy had shown promising anti-tumor activity in HSNCC patients including a durable complete response in a single patient whose disease had progressed on Erbitux monotherapy.Celldex is also progressing well with its lead pipeline candidate, glembatumumab vedotin, which is being evaluated in a phase IIb study in patients with triple negative breast cancer and in a phase II study in melanoma patients.

141,BMY,"Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INFI  -  Free Report) provided an update on  lead pipeline candidate-IPI-549 and also issued financial guidance for 2018.Infinity is currently focused on the development of its lead immuno-oncology candidate IPI-549. It is an orally administered treatment that selectively inhibits phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-gamma. Infinity has a clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) to evaluate IPI-549 in combination with the latter’s PD-1 immunecheckpoint inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab), in patients with advanced solid tumors.In January 2018, the company has announced the achievement of four development milestones for IPI-549. In 2018, the company also plans to report data from the monotherapy expansion and combination dose escalation components. The company expects to announce initial data from the combination expansion component of the Phase I/Ib study of IPI-549 with Opdivo in the second quarter of 2018. In the second half of 2018, Infinity expects to report more mature clinical data from the combination expansion component of the study including translational insights from paired tumor biopsies across multiple diseases.The company also announced the expansion of its phase I/Ib study of IPI-549 to include a combination cohort of IPI-549 plus Opdivo that will enroll patients with high baseline levels of myeloid derived suppressor cells. IPI-549 represents a potentially complementary approach to restoring anti-tumor immunity in combination with other immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. If successfully developed, approval of IPI-549 will provide a massive boost to Infinity’s portfolio.The company also provided financial guidance for 2018 and expects to end 2018 with a year-end cash and investments balance ranging from $10-$20 million.Based on its current operational plans, Infinity expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2017, will be adequate to satisfy the company's capital needs into the first quarter of 2019.In October 2016, Infinity entered into a license agreement with Verastem, Inc. under which it granted exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize its oncology candidate duvelisib to the latter. In October 2017, Infinity received $6-million cash payment from Verastem. Verastem plans to submit a new drug application for duvelisib in the first quarter of 2018.Infinity’s progress with the candidate has been impressive. Moreover, clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers has provided Infinity with a strong partner with expertise in the field of immuno-oncology. Further, it will allow Infinity to expedite the development of IPI-549.However, Infinity faces stiff competition in the fields of immuno-oncology from companies like Bristol-Myers, AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche and Eli Lilly among others.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

142,BMY,"Horizon Pharma plc (HZNP  -  Free Report) topped both earnings and sales estimate in second-quarter 2017. The company also raised its sales guidance for 2017. The company’s shares moved up 4.72% on better-than-expected second-quarter results and increased guidance.However, Horizon Pharma’s stock is down 17.8% year-to-date against the industry’s gain of 8.8%.The company reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of 26 cents per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents (including stock based compensation expense but excluding one-time items) but were down from 42 cents in the year-ago quarter. Excluding stock based compensation expense, the company reported EPS of 41 cents.Sales in the second quarter were up 12% year over year to $289.5 million fueled by solid growth across its orphan and rheumatology business units. Reported sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $235 million.Horizon Pharma PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Horizon Pharma PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Horizon Pharma PLC QuoteQuarter in DetailThe Orphan unit recorded revenues of $120.4 million, up 64% from the year-ago period. The strong performance was backed by solid net sales of Ravicti, which generated sales of $47.2 million in the quarter, up 20% year over year driven by continued conversion from older-generation nitrogen-scavenger therapies, as well as the addition of treatment-naïve patients due to the recent label expansion. On Apr 28, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application for Ravicti to expand the age range for chronic management of urea cycle disorders in patients to two months and older from two years and older.Additionally, Procysbi contributed to the performance with its net sales of $36.7 million. Actimmune sales in the reported quarter were $28.8 million, down 4% year over year.The Rheumatology unit generated sales of $51.7 million, up 56% year over year. Also, Krystexxa sales in the quarter were strong and came in at $38.3 million, up 93% year over year, driven by continued strong year-over-year vial demand.Primary Care garnered revenues of $117.4 million, down 22% year over year. The decline in net sales was due to the implementation of a new contracting model, in order to secure broader inclusion of the company’s primary care medicines on formularies. Net sales of Pennsaid2%, Duexix and Vimovo were $51.2 million, $43.6 million and $21.1 million, respectively, in the reported quarter.2017 GuidanceThe company raised its outlook for 2017 and now expects sales in the range of $1.010–$1.045 billion, compared to the earlier estimate of $985–$1.020 billion.Horizon Pharma is significantly increasing investments in one its key growth drivers, Krystexxa and expects net sales for Krystexxa around $400 million in 2017 driven by higher demand .The guidance includes assumption of lower net average net realized price beginning in the second half primarily resulting from the U.S. Government's Health Resource and Services Administration's Final Rule on 340B drug ceiling price implementation scheduled for Oct 1.  The company expects continued double-digit net sales growth for Ravicti in 2017, with room for additional uptake due to the recent label expansion. The drug is also expected to be launched in Europe in the second half. Sales of Procysbi will decline to the divestiture of European rights. Sales of Actimmune are projected to grow in low single-digits driven by a year-over-year growth in the second half. Other UpdatesDuring the quarter, the company acquired River Vision thereby adding its biologic candidate teprotumumab in late stage development for Thyroid Eye Disease. A confirmatory phase III trial is slated to being by year end. The company expects that annual net sales for teprotumumab in the U.S. could exceed $250 million.In Jun 2017, Horizon Pharma sold the marketing rights for Procysbi and Quinsair in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions to Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. as the company focuses on higher-return businesses.Meanwhile, the company is working on expanding Actimmune’s label. The company has collaborated with the Fox Chase Cancer Center to evaluate Actimmune in combination with a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in a phase I dosing study for the treatment of kidney and bladder cancer.  The National Cancer Institute has plans to evaluate Actimmune in combination with Merck & Co (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda to treat cutaneous t-cell lymphoma patients. This phase II study remains on track to begin later this year.Our TakeHorizon Pharma’s second-quarter results were impressive with the company beating on both the top and bottom line estimates. Moreover, the increase in sales guidance for 2017 was encouraging as well. Net sales for rare diseases drug increased 70%. We expect Krystexxa, Ravicti and Actimmune to drive growth in the second half.The acquisition of teprotumumab has further diversified the company’s portfolio. However, key drugs Duexis and Vimovo face competition from Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Celebrex and its generics, and other branded non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cheaper generic versions of NSAID.Zacks RankHorizon Pharma currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

143,BMY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) and partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, announced that the European Commission has extended the current conditional marketing authorization for an expanded indication for its lymphoma drug Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin). The marketing authorization is extended for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma after at least one prior systemic therapy.The decision was based on the positive opinion issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use on Nov 9, 2017.We note that Adcetris is the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics. The drug is approved for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and for patients suffering from classical Hodgkin lymphoma, who are at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation.Over a year, shares of Seattle Genetics have declined 8.6% as against the industry’s gain of 5.8%.  The marketing aurthorization is mainly based on positive data from the phase III trial, ALCANZA study in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Interestingly, the ALCANZA study achieved both the primary and secondary endpoints. The study showed that CTCL patients treated with Adcetris had superior outcomes across all primary and secondary endpoints compared with patients in the control arm, who were treated with either methotrexate or bexarotene standard of care agents.The marketing authorization for Adcetris is valid in 28 countries of the European Union.In November 2017, the FDA has approved Adcetris for the treatment of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides that have received prior systemic therapy. The approval was was based on positive data from the phase III trial, ALCANZA and two phase II investigator-sponsored trials in patients CTCL.  The label expansion is expected to boost the sales of the drug further. Evidently, sales of the drug in the third quarter grew 13% year over year to $79.2 million.Furthermore, Seattle Genetics is developing the drug in more than 70 clinical studies with key studies including evaluation of T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. Another phase III study is also evaluating Adcetris in frontline mature T-cell lymphomas. Again, the drug is being studied in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.However, Adcetris faces competition from other drugs that include Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, which is also approved for the lymphoma indication. Seattle Genetics, Inc.

145,BMY,"Pfizer Inc (PFE  -  Free Report) and partner Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) presented findings from a phase IV study on Eliquis, which demonstrated the oral anticoagulation’s potential in achieving and maintaining normal heart rhythm (cardioversion).The study, EMANATE, compared Eliquis with standard-of-care, Heparin, for reducing the occurrence of acute stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and all-cause death in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients undergoing cardioversion.We remind investors that Eliquis is already approved for the reduction of the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy, and prophylaxis of DVT, which may lead to PE, in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery. However, the drug is not approved for the reduction of stroke in NVAF patients undergoing cardioversion.Pfizer has underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 3% during this period, while the industry gained 11.3%.Coming back to the latest news, cardioversion procedure is associated with a concern for clotting of blood in the heart while travelling to brain (stroke) or other body parts (systemic embolism). The EMANATE study showed that there was no stroke in Eliquis group compared to six strokes in the Heparin arm. However, no systemic embolism was observed for both the drug groups. Eliquis also reduced the number of major bleeding events and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events compared to Heparin.The current standard-of-care – Heparin and Coumadin – requires monitoring and potential dose adjustment while administered for reducing the risk of stroke. However, Eliquis can be administered at a fixed dose of 5mg twice daily.We note that Eliquis, being an anticoagulant, increases the risk of bleeding, which can become serious and potentially fatal.The company also announced data from a real-world analysis of Eliquis in NVAF patients in a separate press release. Per the analysis, Eliquis showed lower risk of stroke/SE and lower rates of major bleeding compared to Coumadin in NVAF patients as well as for each of the selected high-risk patient sub-populations.Eliquis faces competition in the anticoagulant segment from Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. With the approval of Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (PTLA  -  Free Report) Bevyxxa in June 2017competition is expected to intensify.Stroke events are a major concern for NVAF patient. The above findings show that Eliquis may become a preferred treatment for the same which may boost the potential of the drug. If Pfizer and Bristol-Myers try to get the label of Eliquis expanded to include the findings, it will give the drug an edge over other marketed blood thinners.Pfizer, Inc.

Meanwhile, deals involving companies like AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) were also announced this week.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPriority Review for Roche Hemophilia A Drug: Roche’s investigational hemophilia A treatment, emicizumab, got priority review from the FDA with the agency expected to give a decision by Feb 23, 2018. Roche is looking to get emicizumab prophylaxis (preventative) approved as a once-weekly subcutaneous treatment for adults, adolescents and children with hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.According to information provided by the company, about one in three people with hemophilia A develop inhibitors to standard factor VIII replacement therapies. As a result, treatment options are limited and there is an increased risk of life-threatening as well as repeated bleeds (Also read: Roche Hemophilia A Drug Granted Priority Review).Lilly Inks Multi-Year Deal with Topas: Lilly has entered into a multi-year research and option agreement focused on immune tolerance with Germany-based biotechnology company Topas Therapeutics. The initial focus will be on external antigens thought to induce inflammation and/or autoimmune disease. Pre-clinical proof-of-principle studies will be conducted by Topas, which will receive R&D funding from Lilly. Lilly has an option to in-license and develop all candidates produced under the collaboration. The deal signifies Lilly’s focus on immunology. Immune tolerance has been attracting the interest of quite a few large players with Celgene signing an exclusive global research collaboration with Anokion, a privately held company developing novel tolerance-inducing therapeutics for autoimmune diseases, earlier this year.AstraZeneca in mRNA-Focused Deal with Ethris: AstraZeneca entered into a strategic deal with Germany-based Ethris for the development of mRNA therapies for respiratory diseases. The five-year strategic research deal will be focused on the use of Ethris’ proprietary SNIM RNA technology for new stabilized non-immunogenic mRNA therapies for respiratory diseases.AstraZeneca will make an upfront payment of €25 million upfront and provide research funding as well.

Approval was largely expected considering the positive Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) opinion earlier this year in June. According to information provided by the company, about 250,000 women are diagnosed with advanced breast cancer each year across the world and up to one-third of patients with early-stage breast cancer will eventually develop advanced disease. Kisqali was approved in the U.S. in Mar 2017 and Novartis is working on launching a full commercial campaign and gaining formulary coverage.Shares of Novartis have gained 14.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 10.4% rallyPerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 0.7% over the last five trading sessions.

147,BMY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) announced completion of enrollment in a phase IIb study — METRIC — evaluating lead pipeline candidate glembatumumab vedotin for treating patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancers.Shares of Celldex have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has massively plunged 34.4% versus the industry’s 6.9% gain during the period.METRIC is a randomized phase IIb study which enrolled a total of 327 patients with the given indication. Patients in this trial are randomized 2 to 1 to either glembatumumab vedotin or to Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) breast cancer drug, Xeloda (capecitabine).The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS). Top-line data from the study is expected in second-quarter 2018.We remind investors that another phase II study on glembatumumab vedotin is currently underway on patients with metastatic melanoma as a single agent. Data from the study was presented in June, at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).Glembatumumab vedotin performed well in the single agent setting with 11% response rate, a 52% disease control rate and a median duration of response of six months in patients, having failed three or four prior lines of therapy. The study also includes two new cohorts, a glembatumumab plus varlilumab arm and a glembatumumab plus checkpoint inhibitor arm, including either Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo or Merck & Co, Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda.Besides glembatumumab vedotin, Celldex’s pipeline comprises another important candidate, varlilumab.

148,BMY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) announced that it has started patient enrollment in a phase I study, evaluating its new candidate, CDX-1140, for treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. Notably, CDX-1140 is a fully human antibody that targets CD40, an immune response activator.Shares of Celldex have increased more than 1% following the news release. However, the stock has underperformed the industry so far this year. Shares have lost 15.2%, comparing unfavorably with industry’s 2.6% increase during the period.The study is expected to enroll a total of 105 patients with recurrent, locally-advanced or metastatic solid tumors. It is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CDX-1140 at different dose levels ranging from 0.01 mg/kg to 3.0 mg/kg once every four weeks until disease progression or intolerance.Significantly, the company is also planning to evaluate the combination of CDX-1140 with other anti-tumor agents.We remind investors that last November, Celldex presented positive pre-clinical data on CDX-1140 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting. The trial outcomes demonstrated that CDX-1140 binds to CD40 with high affinity and does not block CD40 ligand binding. It also showed direct anti-tumor activity in immune-deficient mice with human lymphomas.Apart from CDX-1140, Celldex has another interesting candidate in its oncology pipeline called varlilumab. The candidate is being evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers' (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in a phase II study including cohorts in five indications namely, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma. Celldex plans to complete enrolment across all cohorts in the phase II portion of the study in the first quarter of 2018.Other promising candidates are CDX-1401/CDX-301 (phase II — multiple solid tumors; in collaboration with CITN) and CDX-014 (phase I — advanced renal cell carcinoma) among others.Importantly, Celldex expects CDX-1140 to add stimulus to the company’s growing immunotherapy pipeline.Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.

149,BMY,"There was no major news in the cancer space this week, except the failure of Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Bavencio in a gastric cancer study. In a setback to Eisai Co., Ltd. (ESALY  -  Free Report), National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”) did not recommend the approval of its breast cancer drug, Halaven, for use in second-line setting in UK.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) filing for label expansion of Tagrisso in first-line setting for treating lung cancer was accepted by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). Apart from this, Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Opdivo, again proved its worth by achieving superior overall survival (“OS”) in a phase III lung cancer study. Moreover, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) also announced initiation of a phase I study on its new oncology candidate, CDX-1140, in solid tumors.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPfizer’s Bavencio Fails in Gastric Cancer Study: Pfizer along with its Germany-based partner Merck KGaA announced the failure of a phase III study evaluating their key pipeline candidate, Bavencio (avelumab), for the treatment of gastric cancer in third-line setting.The study – JAVELIN Gastric 300 – evaluated Bavencio as a monotherapy in patients with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and whose disease has progressed following two prior therapeutic regimens.

150,BMY,"While reports about tech giant Amazon meeting generic drugmakers made the rounds, companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) were in the news with the former reporting late-stage data and the latter announcing leadership and organizational changes.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesIs Amazon in Talks with Generic Drugmakers? According to a CNBC report, tech giant Amazon is in preliminary discussions with generic drugmakers including Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Novartis’s generic arm, Sandoz, about entering the pharmacy market. With not much information being available, there is a lot of speculation and discussion among industry watchers about the way the tech giant is planning to enter the market – as a drug wholesaler or a retailer.Pfizer, Merck KGaA’s Bavencio Fails in Late-Stage Study: Pfizer and Merck KGaA suffered a setback in their efforts to expand the label of their checkpoint inhibitor, Bavencio (avelumab) with the therapy failing to meet the primary endpoint of superior overall survival (“OS”) compared with physician's choice of chemotherapy. The late-stage study was being conducted to evaluate Bavencio for the third-line treatment of unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) adenocarcinoma patients whose disease progressed following two prior therapeutic regimens, regardless of PD-L1 expression.The companies continue to evaluate Bavencio in the first-line switch maintenance setting for gastric cancer. According to information provided by the companies, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world and the third most common cause of cancer death. With survival in advanced disease being poor and usually less than a year, the third-line setting is a difficult-to-treat population (Read more: Pfizer/Merck KGaA's Bavencio Fails in Gastric Cancer Study).Leadership & Organizational Changes at Teva: Teva’s new CEO has announced changes in the organization as well as leadership structure of the company. A key change is that the generics and specialty medicines segments will now operate as a single segment across three regions – North America, Europe and Growth Markets. The Generic R&D and Specialty R&D organizations will also be merged into one global group while a newly formed Marketing & Portfolio function will be set up. With these changes, Dr. Michael Hayden, Dr. Rob Koremans and Dipankar Bhattacharjee will be exiting Teva effective Dec 31, 2017. Several new appointments were also announced while a detailed restructuring plan will be unveiled in mid-December.Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track. Generic competition for Copaxone 40mg is another major setback for the stock.Teva has lost 59.1% of its value year to date versus the 29.2% decline recorded by its industry.Mylan’s Biosimilars under EU Review: Mylan and partner Biocon said that the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) has accepted their marketing applications for biosimilar versions of Roche’s Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Amgen’s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). While Herceptin is used for the treatment of certain HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, Neulasta is used for the reduction of the duration of neutropenia (low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells) and the incidence of fever associated with neutropenia in adult patients treated with chemotherapy in certain types of cancer.Both marketing applications had been withdrawn earlier following an audit that was conducted by the European inspecting authority of Biocon's drug product facility. Biocon said that it has completed the Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPAs) based on the audit – these will be verified during inspection as part of the regulatory review process.Meanwhile, the companies should get a response from the FDA for their regulatory application for their biosimilar version of Herceptin by December 3. Earlier this year in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) had voted in favor of approving the biosimilar. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the recommendations of its advisory panels.J&J and Partners Commence HIV Vaccine Efficacy Study: With focus on World AIDS Day today, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health has initiated the first efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine. The study will evaluate the vaccine’s efficacy and safety in reducing the incidence of HIV infection in 2,600 women in sub-Saharan Africa. There is significant unmet need for a vaccine for HIV – although a lot of progress has been made in treating and managing the disease, almost two million people become infected every year. Developing a vaccine for HIV has proved to be challenging due to the unique properties of the virus including its ability to mutate rapidly. Moreover, genetic diversity with multiple strains and subtypes prevalent in different parts of the world are additional hurdles.We note that another efficacy study evaluating a different vaccine candidate is being conducted in South Africa.J&J is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

151,BMY,"Until 2014, very few options were available to treat ovarian cancer and these primarily included chemotherapy, radiation or surgery. Though effective, these treatments had many side-effects. While chemotherapy can destroy a patient’s immune system, radiation kills normal cells along with cancerous cells. A surgical process is ineffective when the cancer spreads. With the approval of AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report)/Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Lynparza in December 2014, a new targeted therapy for treating ovarian cancer came into the market. The drug inhibits an enzyme in cells – PARP – which helps repair the DNA of the cell, thus destroying the cell.After that, two other PARP-inhibitors were approved by the FDA - Tesaro, Inc.’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula and Clovis Oncology, Inc.’s (CLVS  -  Free Report) Rubraca. PARP inhibitors have shown more tolerability and effectiveness in clinical studies. However, none of the three marketed PARP inhibitors – Rubraca, Zejula and Lynparza – have been approved in the first-line setting to date.There are many other companies developing PARP inhibitors including Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report), among others.Let’s see how the marketed drugs are performing and which one has better prospects.Lynparza with its recent label expansion in August 2017 is indicated for maintenance treatment of patients suffering from platinum-sensitive recurrent (“PSR”) ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA-mutation status. It is also approved for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer beyond the third-line setting. The drug is available in capsule and tablet formulations. The drug recorded sales of $70 million in 2015, $94 million in 2016 and $197 million in the first nine months of 2017, growing over 65% annually. The drug is also being developed as first-line maintenance treatment for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. AstraZeneca and Merck expect to file for label expansion by mid-2018.However, Lynparza sales have fallen lately in the United States after the launch of Zejula in April this year. The label expansion in August – including ovarian cancer patients regardless of BRCA-mutation – has brought it on par with Zejula. Moreover, a potential approval in first-line setting next year will give it an edge over the other drugs. Also, AstraZeneca has collaborated with Merck to co-develop Lynparza in combination immunotherapies. Its successful development will be a boon for patients.Rubraca received accelerated approval from the FDA late last year as monotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer patients with deleterious BRCA mutation, treated with two or more chemotherapies. Clovis is conducting confirmatory studies to convert this approval to a full approval. Meanwhile, the company filed a supplemental New Drug Application last month, seeking label expansion as a maintenance treatment for patients with PSR ovarian cancer. Rubraca is under review in EU. The drug reported sales of $38.5 million in the first nine months of 2017. However, the drug may lag the other two drugs as they are approved to treat ovarian cancer irrespective of the BRCA-mutation. Meanwhile, Clovis is evaluating the drug in a phase III study in combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo as first-line maintenance therapy in stage III/IV high-grade ovarian cancer patients who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.Zejula is the first PARP-inhibitor, which was approved as maintenance treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA-mutation and was launched in April 2017. As the drug can be used in patients who do not have BRCA mutations, it can be prescribed to a broader patient population. Moreover, it also removes the requirement of diagnosis for BRCA-mutation, thereby reducing treatment cost and time.Due to this competitive advantage, Zejula has registered impressive growth since its launch and has also encroached upon Lynparza & Rubraca’s market share. The drug has generated sales of $65.3 million since its launch. The company has also claimed that it is the most frequently prescribed PARP inhibitor for ovarian cancer. Further boosting the prospect of the drug, the European Commission granted marketing authorization earlier this week. TESARO is also developing Zejula in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 drug, Keytruda, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.From the above discussion, it is evident that Zejula has an edge due to non-requirement of BRCA-mutation status and has fared better thus far. However, with an expanded label, Lynparza is set to get back its lost share. We believe that Rubraca could be in a relatively weaker position among the three drugs. There is uncertainty over how it performs in Europe as both Lynparza and Zejula are already approved there. However, we have to wait till 2018 end to see the actual performance of these drugs as a few label expansions are expected next year.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

153,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced new data from a cohort of the phase II CheckMate -142 study on Opdivo.CheckMate-142 study is an ongoing study evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) and Yervoy (ipilimumab) for previously treated patients with DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer. Results from the study showed that the primary endpoint of objective response rate per investigator assessment was 55%, with a median follow-up of 13.4 months. The overall survival rate at one year was 85%, and median OS was not yet reached.  The results showed that Opdivo plus Yervoy provide durable clinical benefit in patients with dMMR or MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer.The data showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in key patient reported outcomes, including symptoms, functioning and quality of life.Bristol-Myers’ shares have rallied 24.5% in the past one year compared with the industry gain of 23.9%.  We note that Opdivo is already approved for a number of indications. These include classical Hodgkin lymphoma, recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy. Additionally, it is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of SCCHN in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy.Opdivo is also approved for intravenous use for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, who have been previously treated with Nexavar. The drug received approval for liver and colorectal cancers as well.Meanwhile, the company continues to evaluate Opdivo alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Label expansion of the drug into additional indications would give the product an access to a higher patient population and increase the its commercial potential significantly.However, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks from the health care space are Exelixis, Inc.

155,BMY,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion for its cancer drug Sutent (sunitinib malate). With this latest approval, Sutent’s label has been expanded as an adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) following surgery. This approval makes it the first and only adjuvant therapy for recurrent RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer.Sutent is marketed for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).We remind investors that the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for the drug was accepted by the FDA earlier in May. Subsequently, in September, the drug’s label for the expanded indication got a mixed response from the FDA’s Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC). The committee voted six in favor and six against the benefit-risk profile for Sutent for the expanded indication. However, the drug’s label expansion was approved earlier than the target action date in January 2018.Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 9.5%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s 14.7% rally during the period.Notably, the FDA approval was based on positive data from a phase III study (S-TRAC), evaluating Sutent as an adjuvant treatment in patients at high risk of recurrent RCC, following nephrectomy (surgical removal of the cancer-containing kidney). Full data presented in October last year, showed that the trial met the primary endpoint of improving disease-free survival (“DFS”), determined by a blinded independent central review in such patients. Data demonstrated that Sutent extended DFS by 6.8 years compared with 5.6 years in the placebo arm, resulting in an overall risk reduction of 24%.An application for use in the same patient population is also under review in the EU.Significantly, the kidney cancer market is already pretty crowded. The drug faces stiff competition from Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo, Novartis' (NVS  -  Free Report) Afinitor and Votrient, Bayer's and Amgen's Nexavar, Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Tecentriq among others.Sutent generated sales of $805 million year to date, down 2% year over year due to competitive pressure. However, with this approval for the expanded patient population, sales of the drug should improve.Per information provided by the company, RCC accounts for around 90% of all kidney cancers. Also, those at high risk of recurrence represent approximately 15% of all patients. It is estimated that 60% of high-risk patients will have RCC recurrence within five years. Hence, the potential market opportunity for the drug is huge for this additional indication.Pfizer, Inc. Price Pfizer, Inc. Price | Pfizer, Inc. QuoteZacks RankPfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

156,BMY,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp recently announced that Agilent’s Dako pathology division’s development — the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay — is now available in the United States for new expanded use. Per LabCorp, this test has got the U.S. approval to be used as a complementary diagnostic with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) OPDIVO (nivolumab) for two new indications — metastatic urothelial carcinoma or bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck — respectively.It is encouraging to note that tests of the clinical studies that supported approval of the new indications for the assay were performed at the company’s Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology laboratory. Per LabCorp, OPDIVO is already approved for the two aforementioned indications without use of the test. However, the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test provides vital information about those patients, who are most likely to respond positively to OPDIVO. Earlier, the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay was approved for use as a complementary diagnostic with OPDIVO to treat certain patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma. At that time too, LabCorp’s central clinical trials laboratory was the only provider of testing to support the clinical trial for the 2015 approval of the non-squamous NSCLC treatment indication. Per the company, this successfully demonstrates how the combined capabilities of LabCorp’s clinical laboratory infrastructure and Covance’s central clinical trials laboratory are paving new ways for clinical trials.LabCorp’s consistent efforts to expand in the growing field of complementary and companion diagnostics is gradually fetching unmatched results. Notably, the company has adopted this strategy to work closely with health systems that have expressed interest in becoming preferred partners in LabCorp and Covance’s clinical trials. In this regard, the company has signed agreements with several major health systems recently. Earlier this year, the company entered into an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific to join its NGS Companion Diagnostics Center of Excellence program. It has also inked an exclusive deal to distribute OmniSeq’s immune profile and tumor profiling tests. Within Diagnostics, LabCorp has made a strong progress with consumer and patient-facing initiatives. The company’s LabCorp-Walgreens collaboration is off to a terrific start with respect to patient volumes, Net Promoter Scores and patient feedback riding on years’ experience at these sites.Within drug development business, the company is focused on driving future profitable growth through expanded solutions and enhanced operational capabilities. The acquisition of Chiltern closed on Sep 1, is significantly strengthening LabCorp’s strategic position in clinical development as well as accelerating revenue and profit growth within Covance.  LabCorp was trading above the broader industry over the last six months.  The stock has gained 8.1% compared with the industry’s 4.7% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Two better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report), both sporting  a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

158,BMY,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) along with partner Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) announced positive interim data from dose-escalation part of a phase I/II study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of its lead candidate, NKTR-214, with Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo (nivolumab). The combination therapy is being evaluated for treatment of patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).Data from the study was presented at the 2017 annual meeting of Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC).Notably in September last year, Nektar had entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers for evaluating the Opdivo/NKTR-214 combination therapy across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications in phase I/II studies. While both companies share cost of the combination studies equally, Nektar retains the global commercial rights to NKTR-214.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has skyrocketed 164.9% while the industry has increased 0.9%.The PIVOT-02 phase I/II study was conducted on a total of 38 patients across a number of dose cohorts. Data from the trial demonstrated positive response rates across all three tumor types in both PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative patients.The company reported no treatment discontinuation due to adverse events.Importantly, NKTR-214 is a CD122-biased agonist, while Opdivo is a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. The two different and complementary mechanisms, which comprise the combination regimen, could provide new treatment options for cancer patients.We remind investors that Nektar is also conducting a phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The PROPEL study complements Nektar’s ongoing PIVOT trial.Earlier in May, Nektar had entered into a research collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

159,BMY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) announced the FDA approved an expanded indication for its lymphoma drug, Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin).The company announced that the FDA has approved Adcetris for the treatment of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) that have received prior systemic therapy. Notably, the approval was received a month before the action date set by the FDA (Dec 16, 2017).  In August, the FDA granted priority review for the supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) filed to get Adcetris approve for the above indicationsMarkedly, primary cutaneous ALCL and MF are the most common subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) which is blood cancer of the skinAdcetris is the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics. The drug is approved for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), and for patients suffering from classical Hodgkin lymphoma, who are at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation.So far this year, shares of Seattle Genetics have increased 9.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 2.3%.  The latest approval was mainly based on positive data from the phase III trial, ALCANZA and two phase II investigator-sponsored trials in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Interestingly, the ALCANZA study achieved both the primary and secondary endpoints. The study showed that CTCL patients treated with Adcetris had superior outcomes across all primary and secondary endpoints compared with patients in the control arm, who were treated with either methotrexate or bexarotene standard of care agents.Going forward, the expanded label should further boost the sales of the drug. Evidently, sales of the drug in the third quarter grew 13% year over year to $79.2 million.Furthermore, Seattle Genetics is developing the drug in more than 70 clinical studies with key studies including evaluation in T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. Another phase III study is also evaluating Adcetris in frontline mature T-cell lymphomas. Again, the drug is being studied in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.However, Adcetris faces competition from other drugs that include Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, which was recently approved for the lymphoma indication.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderSeattle Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

161,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) and Ipsen announced positive detailed results from the pivotal phase III CELESTIAL study of Cabometyx (cabozantinib)  demonstrating significant overall survival benefit in patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).CELESTIAL study met its primary endpoint and cabozantinib provided a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement versus placebo in overall survival (OS). The median OS was 10.2 months with Cabometyx compared with 8.0 months with placebo. The Median progression-free survival (PFS) more than doubled, at 5.2 months with Cabometyx compared with 1.9 months with placebo. The trial showed that disease control (partial response or stable disease) was achieved by 64% of the Cabometyx group compared with 33% of the placebo group. The companies plan to present the results at a symposium in San Francisco later this week.We remind investors that Cabometyx is already approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. In December 2017, the FDA approved label expansion of Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated RCC. The approval came on the back of positive results from the randomized phase II, trial CABOSUN on first-line kidney cancer. The results demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS versus Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent.Exelixis’ share price has increased 64.5% over a year compared with the industry’s gain of 2.6%.  HCC is the most common form of liver cancer, accounting for more than 90% of cases in the United States. Hence there is a dire need to bring new treatment options. Exelixis plans to submit a supplemental new drug application to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018.Cabometyx raked in strong sales in the first nine months of 2017, courtesy of the increasing demand for the drug. A potential approval will further boost the sales of the drug. .Exelixis has also initiated a phase Ib study (investigator-sponsored) on Cabometyx (in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo (nivolumab) or Opdivo plus Yervoy) in patients suffering from genitourinary tumors, including bladder cancer and RCC.Exelixis has also inked agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents. Exelixis, Inc.

162,BMY,"Focus this week was on the 36th annual JPMorgan healthcare conference where several biotech and pharma companies provided a preliminary look at their results for 2017 and also provided pipeline updates as well as their outlooks for 2018.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesKey Takeaways from JPMorgan Healthcare Conference: Several pharma companies were present at the 36th annual JPMorgan healthcare conference, the largest and most informative healthcare investment symposium in the industry. Among key updates, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) said that it expects 2018 to be a rich data delivery year. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) also provided a look at its pipeline including opportunities for Opdivo. The company also said that business development remains an important priority with the focus being on deals that make sense from a financial perspective and where the assets and technologies are strategically aligned to its priorities and are potentially transformational. Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) is also on the lookout for business development deals while exercising financial discipline. The company said that it is looking at opportunities through licensing deals and bolt-on acquisitions to add drugs/technology that address unmet medical needs (Read more: Key Takeaways from Pfizer & 3 Other Drug Stocks at Healthcare Conference). Allergan was also present at the conference with its preliminary financial outlook for 2018 (Read more: Allergan's Sales Guidance for 2018 Lower Than Expected). GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report), meanwhile, is looking to strengthen its pharma pipeline by prioritizing its development capital focus on two core (respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases) and two potential therapy (immuno-inflammation and oncology) areas. Glaxo is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Novo Nordisk Goes Public With Ablynx Proposal: Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) confirmed that it is looking to acquire Belgium-based biopharma company Ablynx. Novo Nordisk had initially proposed to acquire Ablynx for €26.75 per share in cash. However, the company came back with a revised offer when Ablynx rejected the first proposal. Novo Nordisk’s latest offer includes an upfront cash payment of €28 per share plus a contingent value right (“CVR”) worth up to €2.50 per share (total equity valuation of approximately €2.6 billion). This offer, too, has been rejected by Ablynx with the company’s Board announcing that the proposal fundamentally undervalues Ablynx and its growth prospects.A look at Ablynx’s pipeline shows that the company could well be in a position to launch its first product, caplacizumab (anti-vWF; acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - aTTP), this year. Caplacizumab is currently under review in the EU while a regulatory application will be filed in the United States in the first half of 2018. The estimated annual market opportunity for aTTP, a life-threatening blood clotting disease, is expected to be about €1.2 billion. The company also has a broad range of partnerships with the potential to generate more than €10.6 billion in milestones plus royalties. Other pipeline candidates also address significant market opportunities. While currently there are no rumors about additional bidders, the EU approval of caplacizumab could well change this scenario.As far as Novo Nordisk is concerned, the acquisition would make sense with caplacizumab being a good fit for the company’s hematology portfolio. The deal would also give a boost to Novo Nordisk’s pipeline especially given the continued pricing pressure within diabetes care, particularly in the United States (Read more: Novo Nordisk Confirms Bid for Ablynx But Faces Rejection).Sanofi & Regeneron Boost R&D Investment in Dupixent and Cemiplimab: Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron have decided to boost their investment in the development of cemiplimab (a PD-1 antibody) in oncology and Dupixent (an IL-4/IL-13 pathway-blocking antibody) in type 2 allergic diseases. Based on this decision, investment in cemiplimab will shoot up to at least $1.64 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion from the initial agreement, with both companies contributing equally. Cemiplimab is being studied as monotherapy as well as in combination with other therapies in a wide range of cancers including advanced skin cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and lymphomas. Regulatory applications for cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are scheduled to be submitted in the European Union and the United States in the first quarter of 2018.  Meanwhile, Dupixent, currently approved for eczema, has the potential to be evaluated for additional indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peanut allergy and grass allergy and in patients who have multiple allergic conditions. This is in addition to ongoing development in pediatric atopic dermatitis, pediatric asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis and nasal polyposis. Regeneron and Sanofi are currently seeking FDA approval for Dupixent in uncontrolled, persistent asthma in patients at least 12 years old.Another candidate that should benefit from the additional investment is REGN3500, an IL-33 antibody, with potential in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Development Updates from Merck: Merck provided late-stage data on its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, as monotherapy for surgically resected high-risk melanoma. Keytruda met the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (“RFS”).Merck also announced that the FDA has accepted its regulatory applications for doravirine, its investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (“NNRTI”) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. A response from the agency is expected by Oct 23, 2018.The FDA also granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Eisai’s Lenvima (lenvatinib) in combination with Keytruda for the treatment of patients with advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). Breakthrough Therapy Designation helps fasten the development and review of drugs which are being evaluated for the treatment of serious conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may be substantially better than existing treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s) (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Combo Gets Breakthrough Therapy Status).Merck’s stock is down 7.4% over the last one year, compared to the 18.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 1% over the last five trading sessions. Among major stocks, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was up 3% while Pfizer declined 0.6%.

163,BMY,"We expect Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 5, before the market opens.Bristol-Myers’ shares have increased 30.1% in the past year while the industry recorded an increase of 26.6%.Bristol-Myers’ track record has been mixed so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprise in two of the last four quarters and missed expectations twice. The average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters is 2.72%. In the last reported quarter, Bristol-Myers delivered a negative surprise of 2.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayBristol-Myers’ blockbuster immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo is expected to continue as the primary sales driver in the fourth quarter. The drug is already approved in multiple cancer indications. In the past two quarters, the drug received approval for five line extensions, which is expected to boost sales. Moreover, in December 2017, Opdivo’s label was expanded as adjuvant therapy for completely resected melanoma.The FDA’s approval of Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in May for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC had a lower-than-expected impact on third-quarter sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Keytruda sales is pegged at $1.3 billion, flat with the year-ago actual figure.In January 2018, the European Commission approved the label expansion of Yervoy injection in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The FDA had approved the drug for this indication in July 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug’s sales in the fourth quarter is $315 million.In November 2017, Bristol-Myers announced that the FDA has approved line extension of Orencia in pediatric patients with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. The label expansions (including psoriatic arthritis in July 2017) and new administration option approved in June 2017 is expected to fuel growth of the drug, which registered growth of 10% in the previous quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orencia sales is $686 million.On the other hand, the decline in Hepatitis C franchise is expected to continue due to intense competition from multiple drugs including Epclusa whose label was expanded to include HIV co-infection in August. Moreover, the HIV business continues to face competitive pressure. Recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hepatitis C franchise sales is pegged at $55 million this quarter, down 75.7% from year-ago quarter actual figure.The company is developing its key drug, Opdivo as monotherapy as well as combination therapy for several tumor types in multiple studies, with two label expansion applications under review in the United States. We expect investor focus on updates related to Opdivo on the conference call.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.35%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Bristol-Myers has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and Consensus  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and Consensus | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some biotech stocks that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its results on Feb 8. The company has an Earnings ESP of +3.45% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ANTH  -  Free Report) is expected to release its results on Feb 26.

164,BMY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc.(SGEN  -  Free Report) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies targeted for the treatment of cancer. The company has only one marketed product, Adcetris, approved for several indications.In the past year, Seattle Genetics’ share price has been trading below the industry. The stock has lost 9.8% against an increase of 9.6% for the broader industry.Adcetris has been performing well since the beginning of 2017, which prompted the company to raise the guidance for the drug’s sales in the year. Moreover, the prospect of the drug received a boost with line extension in primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (“MF”) in November 2017.Moreover, the collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical for global development and commercialization of Adcetris is also encouraging as Seattle Genetics earns royalty payments and is entitled to milestone payments of up to $165 million.In June 2017, the company announced encouraging data from a phase III study, ECHELON-1, evaluating Adcetris in front-line classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Data from the study showed that Adcetris achieved statistically significant improvement in modified progression free survival versus standard of care. A supplemental Biologics License Application was submitted to the FDA based on this data in November 2017.Another phase III study, ECHELON-2, is evaluating the drug in front-line CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma. Data is expected from the study this year.Apart from Adcetris, the company has six ADC candidates and one novel immuno-oncology candidate, which are being evaluated in early to mid-stage studies. A phase Ib study is evaluating pipeline candidate, enfortumab vedotin, in combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo and Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq.However, dependence on a single product is a concern for the company. Any decline in sales or unfavorable response in label expansion studies will affect the stock.Moreover, label expansion of Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in the lymphoma indication in March 2017 has increased competition for Adcetris.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

166,BMY,"2017 was an eventful year for pharma and biotech stocks. Although the industry faced challenges like drug pricing scrutiny, pricing pressure, increasing competition, concerns regarding Amazon’s interest in entering the healthcare arena, fewer-than-expected acquisition deals and major pipeline setbacks, there were some positive developments as well. There was a significant surge in FDA approvals, investors appeared more comfortable with the drug pricing controversy and innovation won the day with the FDA granting approval to gene therapies for cancer as well as a rare form of blindness. Tax reforms are also expected to work in the sector’s favor with mergers and acquisitions (M&As) expected to pick up in the coming quarters.Keeping this in mind, here is a look at key takeaways from presentations made by four major pharma and biotech stocks at the annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference, the largest and most informative healthcare investment symposium in the industry.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report): Pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer, expects 2018 to be a rich data delivery year. The company’s focus is on five therapeutic areas including oncology, inflammation & immunology, vaccines and rare disease & internal medicines. Within the immuno-oncology portfolio, focus remains mainly on drug combinations of Bavencio with a variety of Pfizer-targeted agents.During the first half of the year, the company should present late-stage data on Bavencio (second-line non-small cell lung cancer) and Vyndaqel (cardiomyopathy) while regulatory submissions are expected for Xtandi (non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer) and PARP inhibitor, talazoparib (breast cancer). The second half of the year will see the company presenting phase III data on rivipansel (sickle cell) and tanezumab (pain). The company also has a couple of PDUFA dates in 2018 – Xeljanz for ulcerative colitis (its first indication outside rheumatology) and lorlatinib (second-line non-small cell lung cancer).Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The company’s shares are up 11.1% over the last one year compared to the 18.4% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report): Biotech company, Celgene, announced its preliminary results as well as 2018 outlook at the healthcare conference. Celgene will also be presenting a significant amount of data this year including on Revlimid + Rituxan (relapsed and/or refractory follicular lymphoma) and Otezla for scalp psoriasis. Several study initiations are also expected this year. Moreover, the company expects to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for Revlimid in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (“NDMM”), a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for fedratinib in myelofibrosis and an sNDA for Otezla in Behçet's disease. Meanwhile, FDA decisions are expected this year for ozanimod (relapsing multiple sclerosis - RMS) and a once-daily formulation of Otezla. The company said it will continue to invest in business development.Celgene is a Zacks Rank #3 stock – the company’s shares are down 10.1% over the last one year compared to the 0.9% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report): Bristol-Myers’s pipeline represents several opportunities for long-term growth. The company provided an update on its blockbuster drug, Opdivo, which is expected to drive near- and mid-term growth. Non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”), hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer are some areas that represent commercial potential in excess of $1 billion each. These are disease areas with high prevalence, high unmet medical need and low survival rates. Bristol-Myers has several data-readouts on Opdivo planned for 2018 and 2019. The company’s immuno-oncology portfolio has several early-stage candidates and late-stage assets like relatlimab (anti-LAG3) and BMS-986205 (BMS-IDO). The company said that business development remains an important priority with the focus being on deals that make sense from a financial perspective and where the assets and technologies are strategically aligned to its priorities and are potentially transformational.  Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The company’s shares are up 9.1% over the last one year.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report): For Merck too, business development remains a key priority. The company said that it is looking at opportunities through licensing deals and bolt-on acquisitions to add drugs/technology that address unmet medical needs. While Merck will provide its 2018 outlook in February, the company said that headwinds remain in the form of competitive pressure for drugs like Zostavax and Zepatier while Zetia and Vytorin will still feel the impact of generic competition. However, Keytruda represents significant growth opportunity with the drug being in several studies for label expansion and combination use. Moreover, the company’s pipeline of oncology assets, novel vaccines, select hospital and specialty products also provide scope for long-term growth.Merck is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The company’s shares are down 7% over the last one year.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

167,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) announced an amendment to the protocol for the phase Ib trial of cabozantinib combined with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.Per the amendment, there will be four new expansion cohorts to the trial. The cohorts will include include patients with NSCLC and CRPC, in addition to previously included patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and urothelial carcinoma (UC). The primary objective in the expansion stage of this trial is to determine the objective response rate in each cohort.The cohorts will now include the following patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or BRAF) who have not received prior therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, patients with NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration who have progressed following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor, patients with UC who have progressed following treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, patients with CRPC who have previously received enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate and experienced radiographic disease progression in soft tissue.The multicentre phase Ib open label study is divided into two parts — a dose-escalation phase and an expansion cohort phase.The main objective is to calculate the optimal dose and schedule of daily oral administration of cabozantinib.  The trial will begin enrolment in the eight expansion cohorts once the recommended dose and schedule are determined (anticipated to occur in the first half of 2018).Exelixis’ stock have rallied a massive 108.2% in the last one year compared with the industry’s gain of 3.8%.In April 2016, a tablet formulation of cabozantinib, Cabometyx, was approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy.Cabometyx delivered strong sales in the first nine months of 2017, underlying the increasing demand for the drug. New patient market share in the second-line plus setting increased to 38%.The recent FDA approval of Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC should further boost demand. The drug demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus the current standard of care, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent.Apart from Roche, Exelixis also inked agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) to jointly develop cabozantinib in collaboration with immunotherapy agents. Exelixis collaborated with Bristol-Myers to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo alone or along with Yervoy in a phase III trial in first-line RCC, and potentially in other tumor types including (HCC and bladder cancer). The companies have initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER in July 2017 to evaluate Opdivo in combination with Cabometyx or Opdivo and Yervoy in combination with Cabometyx versus Sutent in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC.While competition might stiffen a bit in 2018 as the the FDA accepted Bristol-Myers’ supplemental Biologics License Application. The application includes priority review of Opdivo plus Yervoy to treat intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced RCC with an action date of Apr 16, 2018. We expect Exelixis to ride high on the performance of Cabometyx in 2018.Zacks RankExelixis flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

168,BMY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) announced today that the FDA has accepted for filing a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the label expansion of its lymphoma drugAdcetris (brentuximab vedotin) and granted priority review. The sBLA is filed for Adcetris in combination with chemotherapy for the frontline treatment of patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The FDA also set an action date of May 1, 2018.Generally, a priority review designation from the FDA is granted to drugs that have potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease.Adcetris is the only marketed product at Seattle Genetics. The drug is approved for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), and for those suffering from classical Hodgkin lymphoma, who are at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation.In 2017, shares of Seattle Genetics have increased 5.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 4.9%.The submission of the sBLA is based on positive results from a phase II study called ECHELON-1. In June 2017, the company had announced positive top-line data from the ECHELON-1 study, which demonstrated that Adcetris achieved improvement in modified progression-free survival of statistical significance compared to standard of care chemotherapy. In fact, the ECHELON-1 study evaluated Adcetris in addition to Adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine in patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma with no prior treatment.In November, the FDA approved an expanded indication for this lymphoma drug. Seattle Geneticsannounced that the FDA has approved Adcetris for the treatment of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) that have received prior systemic therapy. Notably, the approval was received a month before the action date set by the FDA (Dec 16, 2017).  Furthermore, Seattle Genetics is developing Adcetris in more than 70 clinical studies with the key studies including evaluation in T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. Another phase III study is also evaluating Adcetris in frontline mature T-cell lymphomas. This drug is being studied in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma as well.However, Adcetris faces competition from the other drugs that include Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, which was approved for the lymphoma indication in March 2017.Seattle Genetics, Inc.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s see the reasons why this stock can prove to be a valuable addition to your portfolio in 2018.Favorable Share Price Movement: Shares of Celldex have risen 11% in the past six months while the industry registered a loss of 2.9%. Moreover, the company is trading at cheaper price/book ratio of 1.66 compared with the industry’s 4.07. The company is also in a better position to pay its obligations as its current ratio is 5.91. Rising Estimates: In fact, Celldex’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding expectations in three of the past four quarters and meeting the same once. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 15.36%. Moreover, loss estimates for 2018 have narrowed 6.25% in the past 60 days. Revenues are expected to grow 28.4% in 2018 from 2017.Pipeline Progress: Celldex’s most advanced pipeline candidate glembatumumab vedotin is being investigated in a phase IIb study for triple negative breast cancer and in a separate phase II study for metastatic melanoma. The data from the breast cancer study is expected in the second quarter of 2018.Moreover, Celldex is also evaluating glembatumumab in combination with varlilumab or a checkpoint inhibitor arm, including either Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo or Merck & Co, Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda.  In the melanoma study, glembatumumab performed well in the single agent setting.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, Celldex has several promising candidates in its pipeline, including varlilumab (being evaluated in phase II in combination with Opdivo for various cancers), CDX-1401/CDX-301 (phase II—multiple solid tumors; in collaboration with CITN) and CDX-014 (phase I—advanced renal cell carcinoma) among others.Acquisitions & Collaborations: Celldex has a collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers, which provides the company a strong partner with expertise in the field of immuno-oncology and strong financials. Also, the acquisition of privately held development-stage company, Kolltan Pharmaceuticals strengthened its immuno-oncology pipeline by adding a unique platform of antibodies targeting receptor tyrosine kinases.ConclusionAlthough Celldex is developing its candidates in several cancer indications, the oncology market is highly competitive. With immuno-oncology attracting a lot of interest, companies like Juno Therapeutics, Inc. , bluebird and others are all involved in the development of immuno-oncology treatments.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

170,BMY,"Shares of Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) have been on a roll. This small biotech company is up 51.2% so far this year, outperforming the 3.5% increase registered by the industry during this period.Let’s analyze the factors that have driven the stock’s rally so far.The company’s only marketed drug, Rubraca, had received accelerated approval in December 2016. The drug is a PARP inhibitor and is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in third or later line settings.Although the drug saw slower adoption in the third quarter of 2017 amid competition from Tesaro’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula and AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Lynparza, sales grew 15% sequentially. The company has also made efforts to increase patient awareness and accessibility of the drug. The company had 1100 new patients on therapy in the period. The drug registered sales of $38.5 million in the first nine months.The patients are selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca.Data from a confirmatory study, ARIEL 3, which was conducted to convert the accelerated approval to continued approval of Rubraca showed promising progression-free survival in patients. The company filed a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA in October 2017 based on ARIEL-3 data to expand Rubraca’s label to include second-line or later maintenance indication for advanced ovarian cancer. The company believes that the label expansion will increase patient population by at least four times.The FDA has accepted the sNDA under priority review on Dec 5, 2017. A decision is expected in April next year.Meanwhile, the other phase III confirmatory study - ARIEL4 - is evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy. Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable ovarian cancer indication. An approval is expected in EU in the first quarter of 2018 and Clovis is establishing the commercial infrastructure for the same.Clovis is also developing Rubraca in other cancer indications either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Two separate studies are evaluating Rubraca in combination with Roche’s Tecentriq in gynecologic cancers or Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in ovarian, breast and prostate cancer.Clovis Oncology, Inc.

171,BMY,"Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(PTLA  -  Free Report) recently announced that the FDA has accepted its resubmitted biologics license application (BLA) for the reversal agent for Factor Xa inhibitors, AndexXa (Andexanet Alfa). A decision from the U.S. regulatory body is expected on Feb 2, 2018.AndexXa has been developed for patients treated with a direct or indirect Factor Xa inhibitor, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.Notably, AndexXa is also under review in the EU with marketing application filed in the third quarter of 2016.Portola’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has soared 143.8% compared with the broader industry’s decrease of 1.9%.The resubmission includes additional information requested by the FDA in a complete response letter (CRL) issued to Portola in August last year. In the letter, the FDA had requested for information related to product manufacturing. It had also asked for more data to support the inclusion of direct Factor Xa inhibitor Lixiana (edoxaban) and indirect Factor Xa inhibitor Lovenox (enoxaparin) on the product label.We remind investors that the BLA was based on positive data from two phase III ANNEXA studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of AndexXa in reversing the anticoagulant activity of the Factor Xa inhibitors, Xarelto (rivaroxaban) of Johnson and Johnson, Inc. (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Eliquis (apixaban) of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report), in older healthy volunteers. Significantly, AndexXa enjoys an Orphan Drug Status in the United States.Per the company’s press release, more than 90,000 U.S. patients treated with oral Factor Xa inhibitors in 2016 were admitted to hospital due to excessive bleeding. It has also been estimated that more than 150,000 patients taking the injectable Factor Xa inhibitor Lovenox in the United States could benefit from an antidote each year.With no currently approved antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors yet, there is a high unmet need for the same in the market.Going ahead, we expect investors’ focus to remain on further details of AndexXa’s regulatory aspect.Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

172,BMY,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted priority review for the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for an investigational, fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (50mg) (BIC), a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (200/25mg) (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.The NDA was filed on Jun 12, 2017. The FDA has set a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of Feb 12, 2018.A marketing application for BIC/FTC/TAF is also under review in the European Union, and was validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in July.A potential approval is expected toboost Gilead’s HIV portfoliofurther.Gilead is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio for the same.The newly launched TAF-based products Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy are performing well with strong adoption in both the U.S. and EU. Genvoya has already become the most-prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch in Nov 2015. The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product, surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%.Gilead expects use of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to continue boosting sales of HIV franchise going forward, particularly in the U.S. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting should also boost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 136,000 patients using Truvada by the end of the second quarter.Meanwhile, Gilead’s stock has gained only 1.1% in the year so far, against the industry’s gain of 6.1%.The uptake in HIV franchise should help the company combat the persistent decline in HCV franchise due to competitive pressure. The HCV business saw some improvement in the second quarter. The HCV franchise was boosted by the FDA approval of Vosevi. HCV patient starts in the first half were better than expectations but should see a gradual decline in the second half due to increased competition.Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa has being facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza.

173,BMY,"Second quarter earnings season is drawing to a close with most major companies having reported results. This week, companies like Endo, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), Novo Nordisk and Perrigo (PRGO  -  Free Report) presented their second quarter results.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Mylan’s second quarter results were disappointing with the company missing on both earnings and revenues and cutting its outlook (Also read: Mylan Misses on Q2 Earnings & Sales, Lowers View). Mylan has pushed back all major product launches in the U.S. from 2017 to 2018 reflecting ongoing challenges and the uncertain U.S. regulatory environment. These product launches include generic versions of Advair and Copaxone. Escalating price erosion in the generics market remains a major challenge. Meanwhile, Mylan got a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) in late Jul 2017 seeking information relating to opioids manufactured, marketed or sold by the company from Jan 1, 2013 to Dec 31, 2016. Mylan has lost 15.4% of its value year to date versus the 15.8% decline of its industry.Perrigo’s second quarter results were better-than-expected with the company raising its outlook (Also read: Perrigo Q2 Earnings & Sales Top, 2017 View Raised). Novo Nordisk also topped earnings estimates and raised its outlook. Meanwhile, Endo, which topped earnings and revenue estimates, lowered its outlook (Also read: Endo Beats Q2 Earnings & Sales, 2017 Guidance Lowered). Endo stock has lost 54.2% of its value year to date versus the 1.8% decline of its industry.Perrigo is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Esperion Up on Positive Mid-Stage Data: Esperion’s (ESPR  -  Free Report) shares were up 15.4% on positive top-line data from a study evaluating the company’s bempedoic acid and Zetia (ezetimibe) combination plus Lipitor versus placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The mid-stage triplet oral therapy study met its primary endpoint of greater LDL-C lowering compared to placebo. The company intends to conduct additional studies next year and expects to file for FDA approval of the combination by the first quarter of 2019.Zynerba Plunges as STAR 1 Fails to Shine: Zynerba  saw its shares plunging 55.7% on disappointing mid-stage data on the company’s experimental cannabinoid treatment, ZYN002. Results from the double-blind placebo controlled STAR 1 study in adult epilepsy patients with focal seizures showed that both doses of ZYN002 failed to meet the endpoints compared to placebo. Focus has now shifted to a couple more studies being conducted with ZYN002 – osteoarthritis (top-line data expected in Aug 2017) and Fragile X syndrome (top-line data expected in Sep 2017).  Valeant Gets CRL for Eye Drop: Valeant (VRX  -  Free Report), which reported second quarter results this week (Also read: Valeant Beats Q2 Earnings, Sales in Line, Trims View), got a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for its new drug application (“NDA”) for Vyzulta (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution, 0.024%). The company is looking to gain approval for the use of the intraocular pressure lowering single-agent eye drop in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. While no safety or efficacy concerns were raised by the FDA, the CRL referred to a Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“CGMP”) inspection at Bausch + Lomb's manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL. Valeant is working on resolving manufacturing quality issues at the Tampa plant and will be working with the agency to determine the path forward.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.9% over the last five trading sessions.

174,BMY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 39 cents per share for the second quarter of 2017, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 43 cents but wider than the year-ago loss of 23 cents per share.Revenues came in at $108.2 million, up 13.4% year over year, primarily on the back of strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $107.2 million.Seattle Genetics’ share price has gained 0.3% year to date compared with the industry’s rise of 11.9% in the same period.Quarter in DetailSeattle Genetics’ top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company’s only marketed product, Adcetris, generated revenues of $74.3 million, up 12.3% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 7.5% to almost $21.5 million. Collaboration revenues included fees earned from the company’s agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues increased 34.7% year over year to $12.4 million attributable to international sales of Adcetris by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. .Research and development (R&D) expenses were $114.4 million, up 33.7% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 22.3% to $40.7 million. Costs were high primarily due to investment in vadastuximab talirine, enfortumab vedotin, Adcetris and other pipeline development.2017 Outlook UpdateThe company raised its outlook for net sales of Adectris in the U.S. and Canada to the range of $290 million to $310 million (previously $280 million to $300 million).Pipeline UpdateSeattle Genetics continues to work on expanding Adcetris’ label further through three phase III trials. We note that the company reported positive data from ALCANZA phase III study recently and submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) in June for including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in its label.The company announced top-line data in Jun 2017 from the phase III ECHELON-1 study (frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma) on Adcetris showing a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival (PFS). Seattle Generics and Takeda are planning to submit applications for regulatory approval in their territories.Moreover, top-line data from the ECHELON-2 study (frontline CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma) should be out in 2018. The company is also evaluating Adcetris in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in relapsed/refractoryclassical Hodgkin lymphoma. Adcetris received a non-conditional approval in Canada for Hodgkin lymphoma with high risk of relapse.In addition, the company expects to initiate a pivotal phase II study on enfortumab vedotin in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer patients in late 2017. Also, in the quarter, the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma candidate, polatuzumab vedotin, received PRIME designation in Europe, which is being evaluated in combination with Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan.However, the company discontinued the phase III CASCADE study on vadastuximab talirinein frontline older patients with acute myeloid leukemia in Jun 2017 based on higher rates of death observed in the study.Our TakeThe company’s second-quarter loss was narrower than estimated and sales also beat expectations. With positive news announced from Adcetris studies, investors should focus on updates on Adcetris’ label expansion. The increase of the net sales guidance for Adcetris is also encouraging.Seattle Genetics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Seattle Genetics, Inc.

175,BMY,"Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) reported sales of CHF26.3 billion in the first half of 2017, up 5% from the year-ago period.Core earnings came in at CHF8.23 per share, up 6% from the first half of 2016.Shares of Roche have performed better than the Zacks classified industry in the year so far. In fact, the stock gained 10.8% over this time frame, compared with a gain of 9.9% for the industry.The company reports results under two divisions: Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.Sales at the Pharmaceuticals division increased 5% driven by strong growth in Tecentriq, Ocrevus and Perjeta which was partially offset by lower sales of Tarceva, Tamiflu and Pegasys. Diagnostics division sales climbed 5% primarily on the back of strong immunodiagnostic business.First Half in DetailHerceptin sales improved 3% due to increasing demand in the U.S. and Brazil along with additional reimbursement approvals and broader use in China. Perjeta sales grew 17% following increased demand in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings in Europe, the U.S. and international markets.  Sales of Kadcyla (+9%) were driven by increasing demand in the international markets.Meanwhile, sales of Avastin were strong in the international region (+11%), especially China where sales grew due to broader market penetration in the lung and colorectal cancer setting.  However, sales in the U.S. dropped 3% due to the increased use of new immunotherapy agents in the lung cancer setting. Overall, sales declined 1%.Sales of Rituxan/MabThera (+3%) contributed to the top-line growth in the oncology as well as in the immunology segments. Growth in Gazyva/Gazyvaro (+44%) was witnessed in the U.S. and Europe despite increasing competition in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Recently launched drugs, Tecentriq for bladder cancer and Alecensa for lung cancer are off for an encouraging start. Initial uptake in the U.S. has been strong. Tecentriq, Ocrevus and Alecensa contributed CHF 0.5 billion of new sales, contributing to half of the division’s growth.Performance of the immunology franchise was driven by increased sales of Actemra/RoActemra (13%), and strong uptake of Esbriet (16%) and Xolair (17%). Increasing use of Actemra/RoActemra as a single agent and in the subcutaneous formulation were the key growth drivers globally.However, sales of Tarceva declined (-17%) due to growing use of other therapeutic options. Sales of Xeloda (-1%) continue to be hit by generic competition. Sales of Tamiflu also declined 12%.Revenues at the Diagnostics division climbed 5% on the back of solid performance of the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions (8%) unit, which was in turn, propelled by Immunodiagnostics (13%). Tissue Diagnostics (13%) and Molecular Diagnostics (1%) also performed impressively. However, Diabetes Care sales declined 4% as sales continue to be impacted by challenging market conditions, particularly in North America.2017 Outlook RaisedRoche now expect sales to grow in mid-single digits (prior guidance: low-to-mid single digits). The company expects core earnings to grow in tandem with sales. The company intends to further increase its dividend in 2017 in local currency.Roche Holding AG Revenue (TTM)  Roche Holding AG Revenue (TTM) | Roche Holding AG QuotePipeline ProgressRoche continues to expand cancer immunotherapy drug Tecentriq (bladder and lung cancer)’s label. Tecentriq received accelerated approval from the FDA for the treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy in Apr 2017. Lucentis was approved by the FDA for the monthly treatment of all forms of diabetic retinopathy. Actemra/RoActemra subcutaneous injection was approved by the FDA for the treatment of giant cell arteritis in May 2017.The FDA further approved Rituxan Hycela (rituximab and hyaluronidase human) for subcutaneous injection, for the treatment of adults with specific forms of blood cancer. On the other hand, a new tablet formulation of Esbriet was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The FDA has already approved the same in early 2017.Roche also presented positive results on emicizumab in patients suffering from haemophilia A from the phase III study, HAVEN. Meanwhile, studies showed that Roche's Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of both relapsing and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (RMS and PPMS) patients requiring mobility aids versus comparators.However, the phase III study, IMvigor211, which evaluated Tecentriq in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer whose disease progressed during or after treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy (previously treated), did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival compared to chemotherapy.Our TakeRoche’s results for the first half of 2017 were impressive with sales being boosted by new product launches–Tecentriq and Ocrevus.  Sales of Tecentriq were mainly driven by strong uptake in the U.S. in metastatic bladder cancer and in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The label expansion of the drug is expected to boost sales further. The successful launch of Ocrevus for the treatment of two forms of multiple sclerosis has also boosted the topline.  Based on a strong performance in the first half, the company also raised its sales guidance.However, sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline. Generic competition for Xeloda also continues to hurt sales.We note that competition from biosimilars loom large on Roche's key drugs like Herceptin, Avastin and Rituxan. The first biosimilars for MabThera are already in the market. The company expect biosimilars for Herceptin towards 2017 end-early 2018. We note that Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its bisomilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Moreover, Roche is facing stiff competition from the likes of Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in the immuno-oncology space.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here .The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

178,BMY,"Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) reported results for the second quarter wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations.Second-quarter 2017 earnings (including the impact of stock-based compensation expenses) of $2.51 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.11. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $3.03.Moreover, total revenue in the reported quarter was $7.1 billion and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.4 billion. However, revenues declined 8.2% year over year. Shares were up 1.8% in after-market hours trading following the release of second-quarter results. However, shares of Gilead have underperformed the Zacks classified industry in the year so far with the stock gaining 3.6% during this period, compared with the industry’s gain of 11.5%.HIV Impresses Yet AgainProduct sales came in at $7.0 billion, down 9% year over year. The decline was due to lower hepatitis C virus (HCV) sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolios, came in at $6.4 billion in the reported quarter, down 9.8%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi and the recently launched Epclusa, were $2.9 billion, down from $4.0 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) across various locations.Sales of Harvoni declined 46.1% year over year to $1.4 billion in the reported quarter. The decline was mainly due to lower sales in the U.S and Europe. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 76.8% to $315 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $1.2 billion in the reported quarter, lower than the prior-quarter figure of $892 million. We note that Epclusa was launched in the U.S. and Europe in June and Jul 2016, respectively.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.6 billion, up 16.1% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $857 million, up from $302 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $286 million, up from $61 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $258 million, up from $58 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined. Viread sales were up at $300 million, up 4.5%. Atripla sales tanked 29.4% to $475 million, while Truvada sales fell 13.8% to $812 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $230 million (up 13.3%), $200 million (up 30.7%), $92 million (up 8.2%) and $35 million (down 14.6%), respectively.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 41.8% to $864 million due to purchase of Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) priority review voucher. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were roughly flat at $897 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 87.3%, up from 91.5% in the year-ago period.2017 Guidance UpdatedBased on a better-than-expected performance in the first half of 2017 specifically in the U.S, Gilead raised its guidance for 2017. Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.0–$25.5 billion, up from $22.5–$24.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $15.5 and $16.0 billion (earlier projection: $15 and $15.5 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 and $9.5 billion (earlier projection: $7.5 and $9.0 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.2–$3.4 billion and $3.2–$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86–88%. Earnings per share are now projected around 86 – 93 cents (earlier projection: 84 – 91 cents).Dividend and Share RepurchaseConcurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 52 cents per share of common stock for third-quarter 2017. The dividend is payable on Sep 28 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Sep 15. During the second quarter, the company paid cash dividends of $680 million and repurchased 2 million shares for $130 million.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. QuoteOur TakeThe better-than-expected performance in the second quarter was driven by positive trends in the non-HCV business and better-than-expected results from HCV business (market share of 80%), particularly in the U.S due to rapid uptake of Epclusa. The HCV franchise was boosted by the FDA approval of Vosevi. HCV patient starts in the first six months were better than the company’s expectation. The company, however, expects a gradual decline in the second half of the year (market starts of 185,000 to 200,000 in the U.S) for 2017 due to increased competition. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie’s, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza among others.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the U.S. and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%.Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is alsoexpected toboost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 136,000 patients using Truvada by the end of the second quarter. However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U.S. which may impact sales.Zacks Rank & Key PickGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).   A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Exelixis has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 512.11%.

179,BMY,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AVEO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 8 cents per share (excluding change in fair value of warrant liability), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents as well as the year-ago loss of 11 cents. However, reported loss for the quarter was 30 cents per share.Shares of the company rose more than 3.6% on Wednesday. In fact, AVEO’s share price movement shows that the stock has significantly outperformed the industry year to date. AVEO has surged 427.8% during this period, compared with the industry’s gain of 8.7% during this period.AVEO does not have any approved products in its portfolio. The company’s top line mainly comprises of collaboration revenues, milestone and other payments. Total collaboration revenues in the second quarter were approximately $0.35 million compared with $0.2 million in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly HighlightsResearch & development expenses were up 22.8% to about $6.9 million. However, general and administrative expenses increased 33% year over year to $2.3 million.Pipeline UpdatesAVEO has made significant progress with its lead pipeline candidate, tivozanib. It is currently under review in the EU for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC. In Jun 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the approval of the candidate. A final response on the approval status of the candidate is expected in the third quarter of 2017.The company also announced achievement of enrollment target in a phase III study, TIVO-3, evaluating tivozanib, in June, ahead of its prior deadline of Aug 2017. Top-line data is expected in the first quarter of 2018. The study will compare tivozanib with Bayer’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) Nexavar in patients with refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The data from this study along with previously completed TIVO-1 study will support the regulatory application for approval of tivozanib in the U.S. as a first- and third-line treatment for RCC.AVEO Pharmaceuticals announced in June that the phase I/II study TiNivo evaluating Tivozanib in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in patients with advanced RCC has been advanced to phase II study. The successful completion of phase I/II study established a tivozanib regimen of 1.5 mg daily for 21 days followed by a rest period of one week.2017 GuidanceAVEO expects that its present cash resources of $40.1 million will allow the company to fund its planned operations into the second quarter of 2018.Our TakeThe positive CHMP recommendation for tivozanib was encouraging. We expect investor focus to remain on the TIVO-3 trial for the third-line treatment of patients with refractory RCC. The trial is being conducted to address the overall survival concerns from the TIVO-1 trial identified by the FDA.However, AVEO is heavily dependent on partnerships for pipeline development. Ophthotech Corporation (OPHT  -  Free Report) terminated its agreement to develop tivozanib in Apr 2017. Any hiccups in the partnership or development and regulatory process of lead candidate tivozanib will pull down the stock significantly.AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

180,BMY,"Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INFI  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 34 cents per share in second-quarter 2017, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 22 cents. The company had reported a loss of 12 cents in the year-ago quarter.Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteSince Infinity does not have any approved product in its portfolio, the company earns revenues in the form of royalties, license and milestone payments as well as research and development (R&D) support fees paid by its partners.Infinity did not record any revenues during second-quarter 2017. However, it recorded collaboration revenues of $9.5 million in the year-ago quarter, related to Infinity's previous collaboration agreement with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Infinity’s share price has increased 0.7% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 1.0%.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, R&D expenses plummeted to $3.9 million from $52.9 million. The decline was mainly related to a decrease in clinical development expenses for duvelisib in addition to the company's 2016 restructuring activities.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $6.2 million for the reported quarter, down from $15.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to the company's 2016 restructuring activities.2017 Outlook ReiteratedInfinity expects net loss to be in the range of $40–$50 million in 2017. The company anticipates ending 2017 with year-end cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities balance in the $40–$50 million band. Moreover, Infinity expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents as of Jun 30, 2017, should be adequate to fund the company's capital needs into the first-quarter 2019.Pipeline UpdateCurrently, Infinity is evaluating IPI-549 as a monotherapy and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo (nivolumab) in a phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors.The company completed an evaluation of escalating monotherapy doses of IPI-549 ranging from 10 – 60 mg QD once daily and has determined the 60 mg dose for evaluation in the expansion component of the study. The selection of the mentioned dose was based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic analyses, which showed that IPI-549 maintained full suppression of PI3K-gamma at this dose level.Further, data from the study also showed that the IPI-549 dosed at 60 mg QD was well tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Subsequently, the monotherapy expansion component of the study is now available for enrolment. The study will evaluate the safety and activity of IPI-549 dosed at 60 QD in approximately 25 patients.Meanwhile, dose escalation evaluating IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo is currently ongoing. The company plans to initiate the combination expansion component of the study in the second half of 2017.On the other hand, the company amended its license agreement with Takeda Oncology in Jul 2017 for IPI-549. Per the amended agreement, the company will no longer have an obligation to pay Takeda future royalties on worldwide net sales of selective inhibitors of PI3K-gamma, including IPI-549. In lieu, Infinity issued unsecured convertible notes of $6.0 million to Takeda that mature in 2018 and accrues interest at an annual rate of 8%.Our TakeThe wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter was disappointing. Infinity received a huge setback when AbbVie terminated their collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of duvelisib. Hence, we expect investor focus on pipeline progress in the upcoming quarters.Zacks Rank & Key PickInfinity currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Gilead Sciences.

181,BMY,"This week, companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) and Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results. While Pfizer reported a mixed quarter, Allergan topped expectations. Teva, however, had a tough quarter. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) announced immune-oncology (IO) focused deals including an acquisition.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Big companies like Pfizer, Allergan and Teva reported second quarter results this week. Pfizer surpassed earnings estimates but missed on revenues raising concerns about the company’s top-line growth prospects. While Prevnar and Enbrel sales declined during the quarter, Pfizer is facing two key loss of exclusivities (LOEs) in the U.S. -- Viagra later this year and Lyrica at the end of 2018 (Read more: Pfizer Surpasses Q2 Earnings Estimates, Misses Sales).Meanwhile, Allergan topped both earnings and sales estimates and raised its outlook as well (Read more: Allergan Q2 Earnings & Sales Top, Restasis Sales Down).Teva’s shares fell 24% on a dismal quarter with the company missing on earnings and sales reflecting the performance of the U.S. generics business and the continued deterioration in Venezuela. The generics business was hit by accelerated price erosion and lower volume mainly due to customer consolidation, higher competition, and delayed new product launches. Teva lowered its outlook for the year and slashed its dividend as well. The company also expects to exit 45 markets across the globe by year end and will be cutting its headcount by about 7,000 since the closing of the Actavis Generics business deal. Teva has lost 34.5% of its value year to date versus the 7.6% decline of its industry.J&J, AbbVie Drug Gets FDA Nod for cGVHD: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and AbbVie’s BTK inhibitor Imbruvica gained FDA approval for its first non-cancer indication -- chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) in adults after failure of one or more systemic lines of therapy. This makes Imbruvica the first and only approved treatment for this patient population. This marks the sixth indication for Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J stock has gained 15.8% year to date, outperforming the 10.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Bristol-Myers in Acquisition Deal Worth Up to $2.3B: Bristol-Myers announced that it will be acquiring IFM Therapeutics, a venture-backed biotech company working on treatments that modulate novel targets in the innate immune system to treat cancer, autoimmunity and inflammatory disorders.With this acquisition, Bristol-Myers will gain full rights to IFM’s preclinical STING (stimulator of interferon genes) and NLRP3 agonist programs that are focused on cancer. The STING agonist program includes a lead asset while the NLRP3 agonist program includes a potential first-in-class pipeline candidate.This acquisition, scheduled to close in the third quarter, will strengthen Bristol-Myers’ immune-oncology (IO) pipeline. The deal will see Bristol-Myers shelling out $300 million upfront while additional payments of up to $1.01 billion will be made for each of the first products from the two programs on the achievement of certain milestones.Additional milestone payments could be made for further products resulting from these programs.Bristol-Myers signed another IO focused deal this week -- the company signed a clinical collaboration agreement with Clovis Oncology under which its immunotherapy Opdivo will be evaluated in combination with Clovis’ PARP inhibitor Rubraca in mid- and late-stage studies for different types of tumors.Meanwhile, Opdivo’s label was expanded in the U.S. this week for the treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Accelerated approval was granted on the basis of overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response.However, we note that Merck’s Keytruda gained approval earlier this year for patients with MSI-H or dMMR in a wider patient population -- Merck’s label includes patients with solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options as well as colorectal cancer patients whose disease has progressed following treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs.J&J RA Drug Fails to Get FDA Advisory Panel Support: J&J’s investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor, failed to get the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee on safety concerns. The company is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Considering the safety concerns raised by the panel, the agency could well ask for additional information before granting approval.Pfizer Drug Gets Advisory Panel Support: Pfizer’s supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) for its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz (5 mg twice daily) and Xeljanz XR (11 mg once daily), for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), got the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee. The advisory panel voted 10 to 1 in favor of approving the proposed dose of Xeljanz for the PsA indication. A decision from the FDA should be out by Dec 2017. Xeljanz, currently approved for RA, brought in sales of $587 million in the first half of 2017.Priority Review for AstraZeneca BTK Inhibitor: AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) investigational BTK inhibitor, acalabrutinib, was granted priority review by the FDA. The company is looking to get the drug approved for use in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. A response from the agency is expected in the first quarter of 2018. Acalabrutinib was also given Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for this indication.AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi also got BTD this week for the treatment of patients with locally-advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.Positive Data on Lilly Migraine Drug: Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) presented late-stage data on its investigational migraine drug, lasmiditan, saying that it met the primary endpoint as well as key secondary endpoints. The results were consistent with results presented from an earlier late-stage study. Lilly expects to file for FDA approval in the second half of 2018.Lilly is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

Cometriq (cabozantinib) capsules for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer generated $7.1 million in net product revenue.Total collaboration revenue was $11.0 million compared with $4.6 million in the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, research and development expenses declined 22.7% to $28.2 million primarily a result of increases in clinical trial costs (costs related to CABOSUN, start-up costs associated with CheckMate 9ER and with phase Ib trial of cabozantinib and Tecentriq in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and were partially offset by a decrease in costs related to METEOR) and personnel expenses.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $40.7 million, up 13.7% driven by an increase in headcount connected with the build-out and support of the commercial organization in the U.S, an increase in legal costs, and an increase in consulting and outside services to support marketing activities.Pipeline UpdateThe company continues to focus on the commercialization of Cabometyx in the U.S. Exelixis plans to file a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for cabozantinib as a treatment for previously-untreated patients with advanced RCC in third-quarter 2017 based on the positive data from the randomized phase II trial, CABOSUN. An independent radiology review committee has confirmed the primary efficacy endpoint results of investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the CABOSUN trial. As per the analysis from the committee, Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in the rate of disease progression or death as measured by PFS.During the first quarter, Exelixis inked agreements with The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to collaborate on the development of cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents. Exelixis and Bristol-Myers initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER, in Jul 2017.Exelixis has also initiated the dose-escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq. The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) or RCC.In Mar 2017, the FDA granted cabozantinib orphan drug designation for the treatment of HCC. A phase III trial, CELESTIAL is currently ongoing in patients with advanced HCC. The company now expects completing the second intermin analysis at 75% of the events in the second half of 2017.Meanwhile, Exelixis and Roche have agreed to revise the revenue and cost-sharing arrangement for commercialization of the other drug in the former’s portfolio, Cotellic in the U.S.Roche also announced that IMspire150 TRILOGY, which evaluates the combination of Cotellic, Tecentriq, and Xelboraf in first-line BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma, enrolled its first patient in Jan 2017 while IMspire170, the trial evaluating the combination of Cotellic and Tecentriq versus Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in first-line BRAF wild-type metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma, is likely to enroll its first patient in the third quarter of this year.2017 GuidanceExelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2017 in the range of $290–$310 million. This guidance includes about $25 million of non-cash costs and expenses related primarily to stock-based compensation expense. R&D expense is projected to increase in the second half of 2017 due to initiation of combination studies.Our TakeExelixis’ second-quarter results were impressive where in both earnings and sales beat estimates. The sequential increase in Cabometyx sales is a positive for the company thereby underlying the increasing demand for the drug. Going forward, we expect investor on further label expansion of cabozantinib and Cotellic. A potential label expansion in first-line RCC will significantly boost the growth prospects.Zacks Rank & Key PickExelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

183,BMY,"The FDA, which approved 22 treatments last year, has given its approval to 26 drugs so far in 2017 including 3 in July. Key approvals this year include Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Some of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of August.Another New Indication for Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo?Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) is looking to get the label of its PD-1 inhibitor expanded for use in patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) after prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. The regulatory application is currently under priority review with a response expected on Aug 2, 2017. Opidivo is currently approved for a wide range of indications and brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017. Bristol-Myers has lost 2.6% of its value year to date (YTD) versus the 10.5% growth of its industry.Will J&J RA Drug Win Support of FDA Panel?The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting tomorrow to discuss the BLA for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor. The company is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. While new treatment options have entered the market over the last couple of decades, RA patients are still not adequately managed with many left with fewer therapeutic options due to loss of response to available agents, and poor compliance due to inconvenient dosing.Earlier this week, the FDA had released briefing documents for the meeting which indicate a lot of emphasis will be placed on the safety profile of the drug especially the imbalance in all cause death between Plivensia and placebo. If approved, Plivensia would enter a pretty crowded market given the presence of drugs like Humira, Actemra and Kevzara among others, though its once-monthly dosing schedule could give it an advantage. Shares of J&J have gained 15.2% YTD, outperforming the industry’s rally.Will FDA Follow in EU’s Path and Give the Green Signal to AbbVie’s Maviret?AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) also has an important regulatory event coming up with the FDA expected to respond on the approval status of the company’s latest hepatitis C virus (HCV) offering this month. Maviret, an investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), is a once-daily ribavirin-free treatment that has the potential to provide a faster path to virologic cure for all major HCV genotypes (GT1-6). Maviret represents blockbuster potential and could help AbbVie gain major market share once approved and launched. We note that Maviret gained EU approval just last week. Shares of AbbVie have gained 11.6% YTD, outperforming the industry’s rally.Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B?It’s been a great week for clinical-stage immunology company Dynavax Technologies Corp. (DVAX  -  Free Report) which got a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults. With the positive vote, will it be third time lucky for the company which has previously received two complete response letters for Heplisav-B (one in Nov 2016 and the other in Feb 2013) from the FDA? A decision from the agency is expected on Aug 10. If approved, Dynavax plans to launch the vaccine early next year. Dynavax’s shares shot up 71.4% on the positive panel vote and are up a whopping 301.3% YTD, significantly outperforming the industry’s10.5% rally.Pfizer’s Xeljanz to Be Reviewed by FDA Advisory PanelPfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) has two regulatory events this month -- the first is an FDA advisory panel meeting and the other a PDUFA date. The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting on Aug 3 to discuss supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) submitted by the company for its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz and Xeljanz XR, for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Efficacy and safety data and benefit-risk considerations will be discussed by the panel. Xeljanz, currently approved for RA, brought in sales of $927 million in 2016.Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to give a response regarding the approval status of Pfizer’s Besponsa which recently gained approval in the EU. If approved in the U.S., Besponsa will provide a new treatment option for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), an aggressive type of blood cancer with poor prognosis in adults. According to information provided by Pfizer, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with relapsed or refractory adult ALL is less than 10%. Pfizer stock has gained 2.1% YTD, lagging the industry it belongs to. Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some other FDA decisions scheduled for this month include a response regarding Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) and partner Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Idhifa (under priority review for relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an IDH2 mutation) on Aug 30. Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to decide on the approval status of Valeant’s eye drug, Vesneo (latanoprostene bunod) and Adamas’ ADS-5102 (treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in people with Parkinson's disease) on Aug 24.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

185,BMY,"Total earnings for 95.3% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 7.6% on revenue growth of 4.6%. Though earnings growth appears solid compared with many other sectors, earnings and revenue beat ratios of 72.5% and 58.8%, respectively, look disappointing.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on Oct 17, followed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) on Oct 24 and Oct 26, respectively. Two other major U.S. drug companies, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), reported on Oct 27 and Oct 31, respectively. These industry primes posted solid results with either earnings or revenue beats or both.Johnson and Johnson Earnings in FocusThe world's biggest maker of healthcare products continued its long streak of earnings beat. Earnings per share came in at $1.90, 10 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 13.1% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 10.3% year over year to $19.65 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.28 billion. Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $7.25-$7.30 from $7.12-$7.22 and revenue guidance to $76.1-$76.5 billion from $75.8-$76.1 billion (read: Healthcare ETFs in Focus on Johnson & Johnson Q3 Earnings).Pfizer Earnings in FocusThe U.S. drug giant came up with an earnings beat and in-line revenues. Earnings per share of 67 cents came in a couple of cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $13.7 billion were in line with the estimate of $13.17 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share and revenues rose 10% and 1%, respectively. For 2017, Pfizer narrowed the revenue guidance range to $52.4-$53.1 billion from $52-$54 billion while raised the earnings per share guidance range to $2.58-$2.62 from $2.54-$2.60.Merck Earnings in FocusMerck beat the earnings estimate while missed on revenues. Earnings per share came in at $1.11, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 and improving 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.

Like other drug makers, Eli Lilly also raised its 2017 revenue and earnings guidance. It now expects revenues in the range of $22.4-$22.7 billion compared with the previous expectation of $22.0-$22.5 billion and earnings per share in the range of $4.15-$4.25 versus $4.10-$4.20 expected previously.ETF AngleThe string of earnings beat failed to boost pharma ETFs as they saw rough trading over the past one month.

186,BMY,"Nektar Therapeutics’ (NKTR  -  Free Report) shares increased more than 10% on Nov 7 after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter results with both earnings and sales surpassing estimates.Quarterly earnings of 37 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. Notably, the company reported a loss of 32 cents in the year-ago quarter.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has skyrocketed 144.1% while the industry has registered an increase of 1.3%.Quarterly revenues substantially rose 321.2% to $152.9 million from the year-ago quarter. This upside can mainly be attributed to a massive increase in license and collaboration revenues. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $125 million.Quarter in DetailThe top line comprised product sales, royalty revenues, non-cash royalty revenues besides license, collaboration and other revenues.In the third quarter, product sales tumbled 70% to $4.4 million from $14.7 million a year ago. However, non-cash royalty revenues increased 5.2% to $8.1 million.The company reported royalty revenues of $9.3 million, thereby registering a huge improvement of 66.1% in the third quarter compared with $5.6 million in the year-ago quarter. This uptrend was mainly on the back of royalty revenues received under a license agreement with AstraZeneca for Movantik and from Shire plc for Adynovate.License, collaboration and other revenues came in at $131.1 million compared with $8.4 million a year ago. In the quarter, Nektar received an upfront payment of $150 million from Eli Lilly & Company for development and commercialization of NKTR-358. Of this amount, $127.6 million has been recognized this time around.Research and development (R&D) expenses climbed 26.3% to $65.7 million, primarily due to investments in pipeline, including key candidates NKTR-358, NKTR-214 and NKTR-181.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were up 17.5% to $12.1 million in the quarter under review.Pipeline UpdateThe most advanced candidate in the company’s portfolio is Onzeald, currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treatment of adults with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases. Nektar also initiated a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) on Onzeald compared with the single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice in patients with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases shortly. Positive results from the study could support a regulatory filing in the United States.Apart from Onzeald, another candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology portfolio is NKTR-214. In September, Nektar announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).A phase I/II study evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo is also underway. The candidate is being examined across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications.Another candidate, NKTR-181, is being evaluated in a phase III study for treatment of chronic pain. In July, the company reported positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential (HAP) study, evaluating NKTR-181, to assess the opioid abuse potential compared with oxycodone. The company is planning to submit a new drug application (NDA) for the candidate by April 2018.2017 Outlook UpdatedNektar raised its revenue outlook for 2017 to account for the $150 million upfront payment it received from Eli Lilly & Company in the reported quarter. The company now estimates revenues in the range of $250-$255 million compared with $215-$225 million, projected previously.Cash and investments in marketable securities as of Sep 30, 2017 were $412.2 million in comparison to $389.1 million as of Dec 31, 2016.

187,BMY,"Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INFI  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 14 cents per share in third-quarter 2017, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  21 cents. The company had reported a loss of 39 cents in the year-ago quarter.Since Infinity does not have any approved product in its portfolio, the company earns revenues in the form of royalties, license and milestone payments as well as research and development (R&D) support fees paid by its partners.Infinity recorded $6 million in revenues during third-quarter 2017. The amount was paid by Verastem, Inc. (VSTM  -  Free Report) as milestone payment related to phase III DUO study evaluating duvelisib. However, it did not record any revenues in the year-ago quarter.Infinity’s share price has increased 80.7% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 1.2%.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, R&D expenses plummeted to $9.3 million from $12.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline was mainly due to the company's 2016 restructuring activities.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $4.5 million for the reported quarter, down from $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to the company's 2016 restructuring activities, partially offset by issuance of convertible notes for eliminating Infinity's royalty obligation to Takeda.2017 Outlook ReiteratedInfinity expects net loss to be in the range of $40–$50 million in 2017. The company anticipates year-end cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities balance in the $40–$50 million band. Moreover, Infinity expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30, 2017 should be adequate to fund the company's capital needs through first-quarter 2019.Other UpdatesInfinity is evaluating IPI-549 as a monotherapy and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in a phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors.The company has expanded its collaboration with Bristol-Myers to include triple negative breast-cancer patients in the study. The earlier agreement allowed study in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.In the second quarter, the company had completed the evaluation of escalating monotherapy doses of IPI-549 ranging from 10 – 60 mg QD once daily and set the 60 mg dose for evaluation in the expansion component of the study.Meanwhile, dose escalation evaluating IPI-549 (40 mg QD) in combination with Opdivo is currently ongoing. The company plans to initiate the combination expansion component of the study in 2017.Our TakeThe restructuring initiatives taken by the company have lowered operating expenses. We expect the initiatives to have a significant positive cumulative effect on the company’s margin, going forward.Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

188,BMY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) incurred third-quarter 2017 loss (adjusted for one-time items) of 14 cents per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 24 cents as well as the year-ago loss of 29 cents per share. Lower costs and higher revenues led to the narrower loss in the quarter.Total revenue in the quarter rose 77.3% year over year to $3.9 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 million. The manufacturing service agreement with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative led to higher revenues in the quarter.Shares of the biotech company rose 10% in after-hours trading on Tuesday.However, the stock has not done too well this year so far. It has declined 26% year to date against the 3.3% increase registered by the industry.Research and development expenses declined 12.4% from the year-ago period to $21.9 million due to lower varlilumab contract manufacturing and clinical studies expenses. General and administrative spend declined 4.3% to $5.3 million due to lower commercial planning costs and stock-based compensation expenses.As of Sep 30, 2017, Celldex had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $140.5 million compared with $154.0 million as of Jun 30, 2017. Celldex expects that this cash plus $11.3 million in net proceeds raised from sales of its common stock this month under the agreement with Cantor will be enough to fund working capital requirements and planned operations through 2018.Pipeline UpdateCelldex’s most advanced pipeline candidate is antibody drug conjugate, glembatumumab vedotin, currently being evaluated for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (phase IIb—METRIC study) and metastatic melanoma (phase II). Enrolment in the key METRIC study closed this August, with data expected in the second quarter of 2018. In the melanoma study, Celldex added two new cohorts, a glembatumumab plus varlilumab arm and a glembatumumab plus checkpoint inhibitor arm, including either Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo or Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, other promising candidates in its pipeline, include varlilumab and CDX-014 (phase I—advanced renal cell carcinoma) among others.Varlilumab is being evaluated in combination with Opdivo in a phase II study that includes cohorts in five indications—colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma. Celldex plans to complete enrolment across all cohorts in the phase II portion of the study in the first quarter of 2018.Along with the earnings release, Celldex announced data from a phase II study evaluating a combination of glembatumumab vedotin and varlilumab in melanoma patients who have progressed on checkpoint inhibitors.

189,BMY,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AVEO  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results next week.In the last reported quarter, AVEO delivered a positive surprise of 7.69%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.AVEO’s share price movement shows that the stock has significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. In fact, AVEO has surged 363% during this period compared with a rise of 11.5% for the industry.Factors at PlayAVEO, a development-stage biopharmaceutical company, is focused on the development of treatments for cancer and other areas of unmet medical need. The company has shown impressive progress with its most advanced candidate, Fotivda (tivozanib).EUSA Pharma, the European licensee for tivozanib, submitted written responses to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues (LOI) in Apr 2017. It completed an oral presentation in May 2017 related to the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for tivozanib as a first-line treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the approval of Fotivda for treating RCC in June, boosting the potential of marketing authorization for the candidate in EU.Moreover, in Jun 2017, the company announced that a phase I/II TiNivo study has progressed to phase II based on successful completion of the Phase I dose escalation study. The phase II study will evaluate 1.5 mg dose of tivozanib in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo daily in patients with advanced RCC.Following the positive safety review by Safety Monitoring Committee to replace early dropouts in Feb 2017, the company completed enrolment in phase III TIVO-3 study in Jun 2017 ahead of the set timeline (Aug 2017). The study compares Fotivda to Bayer AG’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) Nexavar in patients with refractory advanced RCC.Apart from tivozanib, AVEO has several early- and mid-stage candidates in its pipeline including ficlatuzumab. In June, the company announced positive results from phase I studies, evaluating the candidate in metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.The company depends entirely on collaboration revenues and milestone and other payments for its top line. In Apr 2017, it received a $5 million milestone payment from CANbridge Life Sciences Ltd., related to a technology transfer milestone for its inhibitory antibody candidate, AV-203. Also, during the quarter the company secured $14 million from credit facility with Hercules and at-the-market issuance of common stock as part of its agreement with FBR & Co.Investors’ focus will likely remain on tivozanib’s progress and other pipeline-related updates.Surprise HistoryAVEO Pharma’s performance over the last four quarters has been mixed, with the company surpassing expectations thrice and missing the same once. The average positive surprise over the last four quarters is 8.57%.AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

190,BMY,"The second quarter earnings season is off to a strong start. As of July 25, approximately 128 S&P 500 companies or 36.1% of the index’s total membership have reported results.  A deep look into the results show that earnings for the companies reported so far are up 7% year over year on 4.2% higher revenues. Of these, 77.3% have topped earnings estimates while 70.3% have beat on revenue estimates. However, the pace of growth is below the first quarter but in line with the four-quarter average and has improved over the 12-quarter average. Going forward, estimates for the third quarter are going down. The estimate for Q3 growth is 4.8%, down from 6% at the start of the quarter.The Pharma sector has more or less combated the overall decline in the financial markets and maintained momentum.  Last week, industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales. Swiss major Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) reported encouraging second-quarter results. Meanwhile, biotech giant Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the second quarter of 2017 and raised its annual guidance.Let’s take a look at three biotech companies that are set to report second-quarter results on Jul 27.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company beat earnings estimates by 16.7%.Bristol-Myers has a decent track record so far. The company’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.39%. Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a 0.00% Earnings ESP . Although the current rank increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes it unlikely for the stock to beat estimatesthis quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Bristol-Myers’ high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, is expected to continue to drive the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Although the first quarter saw some stability in the second-line lung cancer, the recent FDA approval of Merck & Co., Inc.  (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC will impact sales.

Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 4.08%.Celgene’s key product, Revlimid, is expected to continue to be the main growth driver as in the first quarter, driven by share gains in important markets and longer treatment duration in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla continue to perform well. In the second-quarter call, investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on the pipeline front. Celgene has submitted a new drug application to the FDA for Idhifa in relapsed refractory AML in 2016. The NDA for Idhifa was granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of Aug 30.Celgene’s track record has been pretty decent with the company toppingearnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 3.01%. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3  and an Earnings ESP of +0.62% which indicates a likely earnings beat in the quarter.

191,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after the market closes.Exelixis’ track record is outstanding. The company has surpassed expectations in all the four trailing quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 512.1%.Exelixis’ share price has increased 82.6% year to date compared with the Zacks classified industry’s gain of 11.7%.Factors Likely to Impact ResultsExelixis received a major boost with the FDA approval of Cabometyx tablets in Apr 2016 for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The initial uptake of the drug was encouraging and is expected to propel the top line in the forthcoming quarters in 2017. The sequential increase in Cabometyx sales is also a positive. Moreover, Cabometyx was also approved in the EU.Meanwhile, Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program. In Oct 2016, the company announced positive results from the phase II CABOSUN study on cabozantinib versus sunitinib in formerly untreated advanced RCC, which was presented at ESMO 2016. Based on the CABOSUN results, the company has planned to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for cabozantinib for treating first-line advanced RCC in the third quarter of 2017. The company presented further positive analysis from the trial in Jun 2017. A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost results.In early 2017, Exelixis collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo alone or in combination with Yervoy in a phase III trial in first-line RCC, and potentially in other tumor types including (HCC and bladder cancer. Exelixis will also evaluate Cabometyx in combination with Tecentriq, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with advanced RCC or bladder cancer. In Jun 2017, Exelixis initiated the dose-escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq. The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) or RCC. These collaborations allow Exelixis to earn milestone payments and royalties that boost its top line.However, expenses will continue to increase. Exelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2017 in the range of $290 million–$310 million.Exelixis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Exelixis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Exelixis, Inc.

192,BMY,"Despite the hurdles in Trump’s plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, healthcare is the second best performing sector this year lagging technology. The optimism comes especially from encouraging industry trends and hopes of a favorable policy environment.The Trump administration plans to focus on easing regulatory hurdles rather than lowering drug prices, and expedite new drug approvals. Additionally, the shift in investors’ sentiment to defensive sectors like healthcare, which generally outperform during periods of low-to-moderate growth and rising geopolitical uncertainty, has led to a rally in healthcare stocks (read: Top Ranked Healthcare ETFs for Long Term Investors).As such, popular funds – Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report), Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT  -  Free Report), iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (IYH  -  Free Report) and Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC  -  Free Report) – have gained at least 18% so far this year.

193,BMY,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AVEO  -  Free Report) reported a third-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 2 cents per share (excluding loss due to change in fair value of warrant liability), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents as well as the year-ago loss of 8 cents. However, including loss related to change in fair value of warrant liability, net loss per share for   the quarter was 22 cents.Shares of the company rose more than 1.7% on Tuesday. In fact, AVEO’s share price movement shows that the stock has significantly outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. AVEO has surged 453.7% during this period, compared with the industry’s gain of 3.3%.AVEO’s first drug, Fotivda (tivozanib) received EU approval in August for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The company will receive double-digit royalty payments from EUSA Pharma on net sales of the drug in Europe.However, Fotivda did not record any sales this quarter and AVEO’s top line mainly comprises collaboration revenues, milestone and other payments. Total collaboration revenues in the third quarter were approximately $4.6 million compared with $1 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.5 million.Quarterly HighlightsResearch & development expenses were up 5% to about $4.7 million. However, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.9% year over year to $2.1 million.Pipeline UpdatesIn June, the company announced the completion of enrollment in a phase III study, TIVO-3, evaluating Fotivda. Top-line data is expected in the first quarter of 2018. Subsequent to the quarter in October, based on a pre-planned futility analysis, AVEO announced that the study comparing tivozanib with Bayer’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) Nexavar in patients with refractory advanced RCC will continue unmodified.The data from this study along with previously completed TIVO-1 study for first-line setting will support the regulatory application for approval of tivozanib in the United States as a first- and third-line treatment for RCC. A potential approval in the United States in this indication will provide further boost to the company.In September, AVEO announced that EUSA Pharma has opted into a phase I/II TiNino study evaluating Fotivda in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in RCC. EUSA Pharma may use the study data for regulatory or commercial purposes in exchange for a payment of $2 million.2017 GuidanceAVEO expects that its present cash resources of $37.4 million will allow the company to fund its planned operations through the fourth quarter of 2018.Our TakeThe approval of Fotivda in the EU wass a huge boost for the company as the first-line RCC is a lucrative market in Europe. Moreover, it will also remove AVEO’s dependence on collaboration revenues and milestone payments.AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

194,BMY,"Horizon Pharma plc (HZNP  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter of 2017. The company also raised its annual sales guidance.  Following the news, the company’s shares went up 1.2%. However, Horizon Pharma’s stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date as against the industry’s gain of 5.4%. The company reported third-quarter earnings of 26 cents per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents but were down from 70 cents in the year-ago quarter.Sales in the third quarter were down 1% year over year to $271.6 million but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $254.1 million.Horizon Pharma PLC Price and Consensus  Horizon Pharma PLC Price and Consensus | Horizon Pharma PLC Quote Quarter in DetailThe Orphan unit recorded revenues of $117.4 million, up 64% from the year-ago period. The strong performance was backed by solid net sales of Ravicti, which generated sales of $50.9 million in the quarter, up 21% year over year driven by continued conversion from older-generation nitrogen-scavenger therapies, as well as the addition of treatment-naïve patients due to the recent label expansion. We remind investors that the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application for Ravicti to expand the age range for chronic management of urea cycle disorders in patients to two months and older from two years and older.Additionally, Procysbi contributed to the performance with its net sales of $33.5 million. Actimmune sales in the reported quarter were $29.2 million, up 17% year over year driven by the continued efforts to establish the role of Actimmune in a broader range of chronic granulomatous disease patients.The Rheumatology unit generated sales of $58.1 million, up 44% year over year. Also, Krystexxa sales in the quarter were strong and came in at $42.8 million, up 67% year over year, driven by continued strong year-over-year vial demand.Primary Care garnered revenues of $96.1 million, down 41% year over year. The decline in net sales was due to the implementation of a new contracting model, in order to secure broader inclusion of the company’s primary care medicines on formularies. Sales also declined sequentially as a result of lower average net realized price.Net sales of Pennsaid2%, Duexix and Vimovo were $48.3 million, $31.6 million and $15.1 million, respectively, in the reported quarter.2017 GuidanceThe company raised its outlook for 2017 and now expects sales in the range of $1.030-$1.055 billion, compared with  the earlier estimate of $1.010-$1.045 billion.The company continues to invest in the expansion of Krystexxa into nephrology indication and expects sales growth of more than 50% in 2018.  The guidance includes assumption of lower net average net realized price beginning in the second half primarily resulting from the U.S. Government's Health Resource and Services Administration's Final Rule on 340B drug ceiling price implementation scheduled for July 2018.Horizon Pharma is significantly increasing investments in one its key growth drivers, Krystexxa and expects net sales for Krystexxa of more than $400 million in 2017 driven by higher demand. The company expects continued double-digi t net sales growth for Ravicti in 2017, with room for additional uptake due to the recent label expansion. Sales of Procysbi will decline to the divestiture of European rights. Sales of Actimmune are projected to grow around 5%.Other UpdatesThe company announced that the first patient was enroled and infused in phase III confirmatory clinical trial evaluating teprotumumab for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, or TED. We remind investors that the company acquired River Vision earlier and added its biologic candidate teprotumumab to its pipeline.In June 2017, Horizon Pharma sold the marketing rights for Procysbi and Quinsair in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions to Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. as the company focuses on higher-return businesses.Meanwhile, the company is working on expanding Actimmune’s label.  An investigator-initiated study at the Moffitt Cancer Center is underway and enrolling patients. The study is evaluating Actimmune in combination with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin, Perjeta, and Taxol and aims to determine the optimal dosing and treatment combination in certain advanced breast cancer patients. The company has collaborated with the Fox Chase Cancer Center to evaluate Actimmune in combination with a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in a phase I dosing study for the treatment of kidney and bladder cancer. The study continues to enroll its fourth cohort of patients and expects to have dose level results by the end of the year.  The National Cancer Institute has plans to evaluate Actimmune in combination with Merck & Co’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda to treat cutaneous t-cell lymphoma patients. This phase II study remains on track to begin. The company remains on track to submit a supplemental New Drug Application in the first quarter of 2018 to expand the age range for chronic management of urea cycle disorders (UCDs) to birth and older.Our TakeHorizon Pharma’s third-quarter results were impressive with the company beating on both the top and bottom-line estimates. Moreover, the increase in sales guidance for 2017 was encouraging as well. We expect Krystexxa, Ravicti and Actimmune to drive further growth.The acquisition of teprotumumab has further diversified the company’s portfolio.Zacks RankHorizon Pharma currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

195,BMY,"Major pharma companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report), Sanofi (Read more: Sanofi Q3 Earnings In Line, Sales Lag, Diabetes Weak), Allergan (Read more: Allergan Tops Q3 Earnings Estimates, Tweaks 2017 View) and Novo Nordisk (Read more: Novo Nordisk Tops Q3 Earnings Estimates, Lags Sales) reported third quarter results last week.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesWhy Did Teva’s Shares Plunge after Q3 Earnings? Teva’s shares plunged 19.9% following the release of third quarter results. While the company missed on earnings, revenues were in-line with expectations. However, the key reason for the stock’s poor performance was the lowered outlook with the company facing huge revenue erosion with its key branded drug, Copaxone, facing generic competition for the 40 mg formulation as well. This development alone is expected to hit 2017 earnings by 30 cents per share. Meanwhile, the Generics business continues to face headwinds with price erosion remaining a major challenge (Read more: Teva Stock Plunges 20% on Q3 Earnings Miss & View Cut).     Key Takeaways from Pfizer’s Q3 Conference Call: Pfizer’s third quarter earnings surpassed expectations and resulted in the company raising its earnings outlook for the year (Read more: Pfizer Beats on Q3 Earnings, Raises 2017 EPS View). The company said that key brands including Ibrance and Eliquis globally and Xtandi, Lyrica, Xeljanz and Chantix in the United States continue to perform well.However, the company is facing supply shortages for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio mainly due to capacity constraints and technical issues. At the time of acquiring Hospira (completed in September 2015), Pfizer had expected that it would take up to a couple of years to integrate the manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues. On the third quarter call, the company said that it expects to make substantial progress in 2018 toward cutting down the sterile injectable shortages.Regarding Inflectra, Pfizer’s biosimilar version of J&J’s Remicade, the company said that penetration in the United States continues to be slower than expected due to the exclusionary contracting of Remicade by J&J. We remind investors that Pfizer has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court against J&J related to providing patient and physician access to lower cost biosimilars (Read more: Pfizer Sues J&J, Accuses it of Preventing Inflectra Uptake).Pfizer also provided an insight on the expected impact of loss of exclusivities (LOEs) in the next few years. While LOEs are expected to affect revenues by about $2 billion in each of the next three years, this will go down to approximately $1 billion in 2021 and will not be more than $500 million from 2022 through 2025.As far as near term pipeline and regulatory updates are concerned, Pfizer expects a decision from the FDA for its type II diabetes drug, ertugliflozin, in December. Meanwhile, top-line results on PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, from the phase III EMBRACA study will read out by year end. The study is evaluating talazoparib versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with germline BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer.Data on PD-L1 inhibitor Bavencio plus Pfizer’s 4-1BB agent in patients who have not been previously treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is also due later this year. Pfizer is also looking to submit an application with the FDA for lorlatinib, its next-generation ALK inhibitor for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, by year end.Pfizer has gained 9.4% year to date, compared to the 15.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Novartis Seeks Label Expansion for Kymriah: Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) is looking to expand the label of Kymriah, the first CAR-T therapy to gain FDA approval. The company is seeking FDA approval for the use of Kymriah for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (“ASCT”). Novartis has Breakthrough Therapy designation for r/r DLBCL. DLBCL is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). r/r DLBCL is a highly aggressive and difficult-to-treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is fatal in almost 40% of patients due to relapsed or refractory disease. Kymriah is currently approved for patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) that is refractory or has relapsed at least twice. Approval for the r/r DLBCL indication would expand the patient population for Kymriah though Gilead already has a presence in this area with its CAR-T therapy Yescarta being approved for the treatment of adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment.Novartis also announced its intention to acquire Advanced Accelerator Applications to strengthen its presence in oncology (Read more: Novartis Buys French Radiopharmaceutical Company).FDA Approves AstraZeneca’s Blood Cancer Drug: AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) gained accelerated FDA approval for its BTK inhibitor, Calquence (acalabrutinib), for adult patients with previously-treated mantle cell lymphoma, an aggressive type of blood cancer that is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and associated with a high relapse rate. We note that AbbVie’s Imbruvica is also approved for this patient population.AstraZeneca also expanded its clinical trial collaboration with Incyte – the companies will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Incyte’s investigational selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor, epacadostat, in combination with AstraZeneca’s PD-L1 inhibitor, Imfinzi, compared to Imfinzi alone in early lung cancer.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca said that its IL-13 human monoclonal antibody, tralokinumab, failed to achieve the primary endpoint in a late-stage study for severe, uncontrolled asthma. Top-line results from another late-stage study showed that tralokinumab failed to achieve a statistically-significant reduction in oral corticosteroid (“OCS”) use, the primary endpoint, when added to the standard of care, in patients dependent on OCS.FDA Nod for J&J Drug Label Expansion: The FDA also granted approval to a new dosage (10 mg once-daily) of Johnson & Johnson’s Xarelto. The 10 mg formulation is approved for use in reducing the continued risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism (“VTE”) after completion of at least six months of initial anticoagulation therapy. Johnson & Johnson is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Valeant Gets FDA Nod for Vyzulta and PDUFA Date for IDP-118: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.'s (VRX  -  Free Report) Vyzulta (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution, 0.024%) also gained FDA approval for the reduction of intraocular pressure (“IOP”) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The company also announced that the FDA has accepted its regulatory application for IDP-118 (halobetasol propionate and tazarotene) lotion, an investigational topical treatment for plaque psoriasis. A response from the FDA regarding the approval status of the treatment is expected by Jun 18, 2018.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined marginally this week. Among major stocks, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) was up 3.8% while Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) was down 3.7%. Over the last six months, J&J was up 15.1% while Merck declined 10.6% (See the last pharma stock roundup here: Lilly Tops on All Fronts, Mixed Results from Bristol-Myers).What's Next in the Pharma World?Quite a few small-and mid-cap pharma companies are yet to report results. Moreover, Bristol-Myers should get a response from the FDA regarding label expansion of its blockbuster drug, Sprycel, for use in the treatment of children with Ph+ chronic phase (“CP”) chronic myeloid leukemia (“CML”). The company is also seeking approval for a powder for oral suspension (“PFOS”) formulation of Sprycel. A response from the agency is expected on November 9.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

196,BMY,"Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) incurred third-quarter 2017 loss of $1.24 per share, which was narrower than the year-ago loss of $1.70 per share. However, the reported figure was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.16.Clovis’ only marketed drug, Rubraca, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in December 2016 for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have received prior chemotherapies.Net product revenues, entirely from Rubraca, were approximately $16.8 million in the quarter, up 15.1% sequentially. However, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.46 million. Markedly, the company registered 1100 new patients in the reported quarter. However, adoption of Rubraca was slower due to limited BRCA mutant label and increased competition from recently approved maintenance therapies including Tesaro, Inc.’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula and AstraZeneca PLC’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Lynparza.In the year-ago quarter, Clovis did not generate any revenues.Shares of the company declined 4.47% in after-market trading on Wednesday on lower-than-expected Rubraca sales. Nonetheless, Clovis significantly outperformed the industry year to date. While the stock has been up 64%, the industry gained 2.7%.Quarter in DetailDuring the third quarter, research & development expenses decreased 28.4% year over year to $38.9 million primarily due to decreased development activities related to Rubraca and rociletinib programs. However, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses climbed 280% year over year to $35 million, reflecting increased activities to support commercialization of Rubraca.Cash used in operating activities in the quarter was $45.8 million, less than $60.3 million in the year-ago quarter.Clovis ended the quarter with $628 million of cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities supported by the proceeds raised through share offerings in January and June.Update on RubracaLast month, Clovis submitted a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Rubraca seeking label expansion as a maintenance treatment for patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. The sNDA was submitted based on positive data from ARIEL 3 confirmatory study.Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable ovarian cancer indication. Clovis expects an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use later this year. Additionally, it has plans to submit a supplemental application for the second-line or later maintenance treatment indication in the EU, upon potential approval in ovarian cancer.In July 2017, Clovis collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to evaluate Rubraca in combination with the latter’s Opdivo in multiple tumor types. After ARIEL 3, another confirmatory study – ARIEL4 – is evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy and is open for enrolment.Going forward, Clovis plans to expand Rubraca’s label into additional indications like prostrate, breast and pancreatic cancers, among others either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.Clovis Oncology, Inc.

197,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) reported impressive results for third-quarter 2017 on the back of increased Cabometyx sales. The company posted third-quarter 2017 earnings of 26 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. Notably, the company reported a loss of 4 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Exelixis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Exelixis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Exelixis, Inc. QuoteNet revenue came in at $152.5 million, significantly up from $62.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $104.4 millionRevenues were boosted by increased Cabometyx sales. The FDA approved a tablet formulation of cabozantinib, (distinct from the capsule form) under the brand name Cabometyx in April 2016 for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. Exelixis’ share price has increased 62.5% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 4.1%.Quarter in DetailTotal product revenues were $96.4 million, up from $42.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Cabometyx generated $90.4 million in net product revenues, up 11.6% sequentially driven by 9% growth in demand which was attributable to new patient starts, refills for patients already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base. Cometriq (cabozantinib) capsules for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer generated $6.1 million in net product revenues.Total collaboration revenues were $56.1 million compared with $19.5 million in the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, research and development expenses increased 40.4% to $28.5 million primarily as a result of increases in personnel expenses, clinical trial costs and consulting and outside services. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $38.1 million, up 17.2% driven by increases in consulting and outside services to support the company’s marketing activities resulting primarily from an increase in general and administrative headcount to support the company’s commercial and research and development organizations.Pipeline UpdateThe company continues to focus on the commercialization of Cabometyx in the United States. Exelixis filed a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for cabozantinib as a treatment for previously-untreated patients with advanced RCC in August 2017.  The FDA had accepted the sNDA and granted Priority Review, assigning a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of Feb 15, 2018.In March 2017, the FDA granted cabozantinib orphan drug designation for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In October, Exelixis announced that the CELESTIAL trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) with cabozantinib providing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared to placebo in patients with advanced HCC. The independent data monitoring committee for the study recommended that the trial should be stopped for efficacy following review of the second planned interim analysis. Exelixis plans to submit an sNDA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018.During the first quarter, Exelixis inked agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develope cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents. Exelixis and Bristol-Myers initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER, in July 2017.Meanwhile, Exelixis and Roche have agreed to revise the revenue and cost-sharing arrangement for commercialization of the other drug in the former’s portfolio, Cotellic in the United Sates.The IMspire150 (TRILOGY) trial, which evaluates the combination of Cotellic, Tecentriq, and Xelboraf in first-line BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma is underway while IMspire170, the trial evaluating the combination of Cotellic and Tecentriq versus Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in first-line BRAF wild-type metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma, is open for enrolment.2017 GuidanceExelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2017 in the range of $285-$295 million.Our TakeExelixis’ third-quarter results were strong wherein both earnings and sales beat estimates driven by solid Cabometyx sales. The sequential increase in Cabometyx sales is a positive for the company thereby underlying the increasing demand for the drug. New patient market share in the second line plus setting increased to 38%. Going forward, we expect investors focus to remain on further label expansion of cabozantinib and Cotellic. A potential label expansion in first-line RCC and advanced HCC will significantly boost the growth prospects of the company.Zacks Rank & Key PickExelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

198,BMY,"With the third-quarter earnings season continuing in full swing, investors are keeping an eye on the financial performance of companies. But betting on stocks just based on their quarterly performances is not the correct long-term investment strategy.Several technical and fundamental aspects need to be taken into consideration while choosing stocks with steady performance. Therefore, some expert advice comes in handy while selecting such stocks.One can easily pick attractive stocks by following broker upgrades. They have deeper understanding of what’s happening in a particular company. Also, they comprehensively analyze the strengths and weaknesses of a company and consider them against the present economic backdrop to figure out how the stock will fare as an investment.Also, brokers directly communicate with top management, attend conference calls and go through the company’s publicly available financial documents. They even talk to customers to understand their likes/dislikes for the products and services offered by the company.So, when a broker upgrades a stock, one can definitely rely on it. But merely depending on it is not wise. One must take into consideration several other factors to ensure strong returns.Selecting the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (4 weeks) of 1% or more: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% more over the last four weeks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must be trading above $5.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank equal to #1 or #2: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) have a proven record of success. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.VGM Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the seven stocks that made it through the screen:Headquartered in New York, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) discovers, develops, licenses, manufactures, markets, and distributes biopharmaceutical products.

199,BMY,"The FDA, which approved 22 novel drugs last year, has given its approval to 35 drugs so far in 2017 including a key approval in October – Gilead Sciences’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, a cell-based gene therapy for the treatment of adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment. This makes Yescarta the second gene therapy to gain FDA approval, the first being Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah. Kymriah was approved in late August 2017 for certain pediatric and young adult patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”).Other key approvals this year include Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of November.Keryx’s Auryxia under Review for Label Expansion: Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (KERX  -  Free Report), which is focused on developing medicines for renal disease, is seeking FDA approval for the label expansion of Auryxia. The company is looking to get Auryxia approved for the treatment of patients with iron deficiency anemia and non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (“CKD”). A decision should be out on November 6. Approval for this indication would expand the patient population for Auryxia which brought in sales of $24.6 million in the first half of 2017.Keryx’s shares are up 2.9% year to date, compared to the industry’s 2.7% rally.Label Expansion for Bristol-Myers’s Sprycel? Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is looking to expand the label of its blockbuster drug, Sprycel, so that it can be used for the treatment of children with Ph+ chronic phase (“CP”) chronic myeloid leukemia (“CML”). The company is also seeking approval for a powder for oral suspension (“PFOS”) formulation of Sprycel. A response from the FDA for the regulatory application, which is under priority review, is expected on November 9. Label expansion should boost Sprycel sales further - the drug brought in sales of $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2017.Bristol-Myers’s shares are up 6.4% year to date, compared to the industry’s 15.1% rally.Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Will it be Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B? Dynavax Technologies Corporation (DVAX  -  Free Report) is awaiting a response from the FDA for its hepatitis B vaccine, Heplisav-B, this month. Earlier this year, the vaccine had got a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). With the positive vote, expectations were high that the company would finally gain approval for the vaccine which had previously received two complete response letters (one in November 2016 and the other in February 2013). However, the FDA action date of August 10 was pushed out by three months with the agency asking for more detailed information about the company's proposed post-marketing study for the vaccine.With the additional information being considered a major amendment to the Biologics License Application (“BLA”), the FDA is expected to give its response regarding the approval status of the vaccine by November 10. Approval would allow Dynavax to go ahead with its plans to launch the vaccine early next year.Dynavax’s shares are up 431.7% year to date, compared to the industry’s 2.7% rally.Heron’s Cinvanti under Review for CINV: Commercial-stage biotech company, Heron Therapeutics, Inc. (HRTX  -  Free Report) is awaiting a decision from the FDA for Cinvanti, which is under review for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (“CINV”). Approval would strengthen Heron’s CINV franchise by adding a second, complementary therapeutic agent. The FDA is expected to give its decision on November 12.Heron’s shares are up 18.7% year to date while the industry recorded a decline of 0.9%.Will Ultragenyx Gain FDA Approval for its First Product? Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (RARE  -  Free Report) has an FDA action date coming up this month for vestronidase alpha or rhGUS which is under review for mucopolysaccharidosis 7 (MPS 7) also known as Sly syndrome. About 200 patients across the world are afflicted by this disease, which is one of the rarest forms of MPS. Currently, there are no approved treatments for MPS 7. Approval for rhGUS on November 16 would transform Ultragenyx into a commercial-stage company.Ultragenyx’s shares are down 31.8% year to date, compared to the industry’s 2.7% rally.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

200,BMY,"Aduro BioTech, Inc. (ADRO  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 loss of 33 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but narrower than the year-ago loss of 54 cents per share.Quarterly revenues fell 2.4% year over year to $3.7 million. The top line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.18 million. In July, the company recognized a milestone payment of $2 million from Merck & Co (MRK  -  Free Report) related to development of Aduro’s anti-CD27 antibody.Aduro’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has declined 30.3% while the industry registered an increase of 3.3%.Research and development expenses showed a substantial increase of 28.4% in the quarter to $24.5 million, mainly due to an increase in costs related to manufacturing of B-select antibodies and higher facility related costs.General and administrative expenses were $8.5 million, down 1.1% year over year due to lower consulting and professional fees.Pipeline UpdateAduro has a broad pipeline of novel immunotherapies under development for the treatment of a variety of cancers.The company initiated a phase I study in September to evaluate personalized live, attenuated double-deleted Listeria monocytogenes (pLADD)-based immunotherapy. The immunotherapy, which uses patient-specific antigens, will be studied in patients with microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer. Aduro’s most advanced LADD candidate, CRS-207, is being evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in two separate phase II studies for gastric cancer and mesothelioma. Data from mesothelioma study is expected by the end of this year.Meanwhile, the company initiated a phase Ib study to evaluate its STING pathway activator, ADU-S100, in combination with Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, PDR001, for treating solid tumors and lymphomas.During the quarter, Aduro announced that the FDA has cleared the investigational new drug application (""IND"") for anti-APRIL antibody, BION-1301.

201,BMY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results next week. Its performance has been encouraging as it beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and met estimates in one, delivering an average positive surprise of 7.29%.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8%.Celldex Therapeutics’ shares are down 31.1% so far this year against a 3.3% increase registered by the industry during this period.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCelldex earns revenues entirely from product development and licensing agreements, and contracts and grants. The company recognizes revenues under its clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) for varlilumab. The company will continue to record revenues from these sources in the third quarter of 2017.With no approved product in its portfolio, investor focus will remain on pipeline development.Celldex’s most advanced pipeline candidate is glembatumumab vedotin, which is currently being evaluated for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (phase IIb—METRIC study) and metastatic melanoma (phase II). Enrolment in the METRIC study closed this September, with data expected in the second quarter of 2018. In the melanoma study, Celldex added two new cohorts, a glembatumumab plus varlilumab arm (data expected in fall 2017) and a glembatumumab plus checkpoint inhibitor arm, including either Bristol Myers’ Opdivo or Merck’s Keytruda. In the melanoma study, glemba performed well in the single agent setting.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, Celldex has several promising candidates in its pipeline, including varlilumab, CDX-1401/CDX-301 (phase II—multiple solid tumors) and CDX-014 (phase I—advanced renal cell carcinoma) among others.Varlilumab is being evaluated in combination with Opdivo in a phase II study that includes cohorts in five indications—colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma. Celldex plans to complete enrolment across all cohorts in the phase II portion of the study in the first quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, data from the phase I study of varlilumab/Opdivo combination study was presented in June. The study met its primary endpoint as the combination was well tolerated at all tested dose levels.Though R&D and SG&A costs declined in the second quarter, operating expenses may vary on a quarterly basis.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Celldex is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

202,BMY,"Shares of Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) have witnessed a continuous upside this year. Shares of this small biotech company are up 62.3% so far this year, outperforming the 7.2% increase registered by the industry during this period. Let’s analyze the factors that have driven the rally so far.The company’s only approved drug, Rubraca, has shown an impressive growth trend in 2017. The drug received accelerated approval in Dec 2016. The company’s commercialization efforts have helped the ovarian cancer drug register almost 100% growth in sales sequentially in the second quarter of 2017. Rubraca sales were $21.7 million in the first half of 2017. The company had 1100 new patients on therapy in the period.Rubraca is a PARP inhibitor, which is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. The patients are selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. The drug was in-licensed from Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in 2011.Two confirmatory studies - ARIEL3 and ARIEL4 – are being conducted by Clovis for converting the accelerated approval to continued approval of Rubraca.The company’s shares got a boost when it announced positive top-line results from ARIEL 3 in June 2017. Promising progression-free survival (PFS) and safety results from the pivotal maintenance confirmatory study demonstrated that Rubraca had a meaningful impact in delaying disease recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer patients.Clovis is planning to file a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA by October this year based on ARIEL-3 data to include second-line or later maintenance indication for advanced ovarian cancer on the label of Rubraca. The company expects the label expansion to increase patient population by at least four times.Meanwhile, the other phase III confirmatory study -- ARIEL4 -- is evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy. Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable ovarian cancer indication. An approval is expected in EU in the first quarter of 2018 and Clovis is establishing the commercial infrastructure for the same.There is immense commercial potential for Rubraca in the target market due to increasing demand for PARP inhibitors. Per the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer ranks fifth in deaths from cancer among women. Over 22,440 cases of ovarian cancer are estimated to be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2017. There is a huge unmet need for new treatment options, given that one in four women with ovarian cancer has a germline or somatic BRCA mutation.Rubraca is also being developed in additional cancer indications either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents, including Tecentriq-Rubraca combination in gynecologic cancers. This combination study is sponsored by Roche. Moreover, in Jul 2017 the company collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to evaluate Rubraca in combination with the latter’s Opdivo in ovarian, breast and prostate cancer.It is important to note that the ovarian cancer market is already crowded with the presence of major players. With the launch of Tesaro, Inc.’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula in Apr 2017, competition has intensified further.Clovis Oncology, Inc. Price and Consensus  Clovis Oncology, Inc.

203,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company beat earnings estimates by 16.7%.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteBristol-Myers’ stock has lost 26.4% in the past year, underperforming the industry, which remained flat in that period.Bristol-Myers has a decent track record so far. The company’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.39%. Will Bristol-Myers surpass expectations this time as well?Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to Impact This QuarterBristol-Myers’ high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, should continue to drive the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Opdivo’s U.S. sales are driven by the melanoma, second-line non-small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma indications.Recent label expansions into the classical Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck cancer indications should boost the drug’s sales.  However, the lung-cancer market in the U.S. became more competitive in 2016 due to the entry of Tecentriq.Bristol-Myers expects the second-line lung cancer business to be under competitive pressure. As a result, sales of the drug in the U.S. market is projected be flat in 2017. Although the first quarter saw some stability in the second-line lung cancer, the recent FDA approval of Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC will further impact sales.On the other hand, the virology business is expected to decline significantly in 2017 due to competition from Epclusa. The HIV business continues to face competitive pressure. Recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise.Bristol-Myers is also looking to diversify its portfolio with the development of BMS-986036 for NASH.On a positive note, Bristol-Myers raised its earnings expectations for 2017 concurrent with the first-quarter results. The company now projects earnings in the range of $2.85–$3.00 per share (old guidance: $2.70 to $2.90). Revenues are expected to grow in mid- to single-digit range due to strong trends across the business, particularly in key products like Opdivo, Eliquis and Yervoy. Gross margins are projected to decline as the year progresses and are estimated in the 72–73% range.  R&D expenses are expected to increase in the low-double digit range.In the second-quarter earnings call, investors are expected to focus on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts for Opdivo, along with updates on business development activities.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Bristol-Myers is 0.0% since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 73 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Bristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its 0.0% ESP makes it unlikely for the stock to beat earnings this quarter. As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +66.7% and carries a Zacks Rank #1.

204,BMY,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that Health Canada has granted a Notice of Compliance for its single-tablet regimen, Vosevi (sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg), for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.Vosevi has been approved for the treatment of HCV infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 previously treated with sofosbuvir-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor. The drug is already approved in the U.S.Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market because of its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. The HCV portfolio received a huge a boost when Epclusa gained approval in both the U.S. (Jun 2016) and EU (Jul 2016) to become the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. The approval of Voseviwill further boost Gilead’s strong HCV portfolio.However, the HCV franchise is under pressure as a result of competition and pricing issues. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza among others. Competition as well as pricing pressure intensified further with the launch of Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Gilead’s stock has moved up 1.0% in the year so far compared with the industry’s gain of 7.3%.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the U.S. and EU, which now represent 51% of total prescription volume. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is expected to further boost sales. However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U.S. which will impact sales.Zacks Rank Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

205,BMY,"Pharmaceutical stocks were in the limelight this week with Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO Ken Frazier resigning from President Donald Trump’s manufacturing council. The sector was also in the news with an investigation being launched into the rising prices of multiple sclerosis (""MS"") drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBayer, Novartis, Teva & Others Face MS Drug Price Probe: Drug pricing is back in the news with an investigation into the skyrocketing prices of MS drugs being launched by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and Rep. Peter Welch. Letters have been sent to seven companies including Biogen, Teva, Roche, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Merck KGaA, Bayer and Sanofi requesting information about their pricing strategies for their MS drugs. The letters have also raised the issue of “shadow pricing” – when an expensive new drug is launched or the price of an existing drug is raised, other companies follow suit and increase prices to match the higher prices.  According to an American Academy of Neurology study, annual sales of MS drugs doubled from $4 billion to almost $9 billion from 2008 to 2012.  Meanwhile, information provided by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society shows that the average wholesale price of MS disease modifying therapies was $16,000 in 2004 and shot up to $61,000 in 2013 and $83,688 in 2017. Mylan to pay $465M under DoJ Settlement: Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that an agreement has been signed with the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") and two relators regarding the Medicaid drug rebate settlement for $465 million. With this move, all claims relating to the classification of Mylan’s EpiPen Auto-Injector and EpiPen Jr Auto-Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program have been resolved. EpiPen, which was listed as a non-innovator drug, will be reclassified. Mylan said that it also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (Also read: Why Did Mylan Stock Surge Today?).Broader Label for AstraZeneca/Merck’s PARP Inhibitor: The FDA expanded the label of AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) and Merck’s PARP inhibitor Lynparza for ovarian cancer. A new tablet formulation was also approved as maintenance treatment for women with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA-mutation status as well as for use beyond the third line setting in BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. The approval of the tablet formulation will provide patients with a convenient dosing option as they can take 2 tablets twice daily instead of 8 capsules twice daily.

According to information provided by Pfizer, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with relapsed or refractory adult ALL is less than 10%. Besponsa’s approval path in the U.S. included a Breakthrough Therapy designation and priority review. Although the label comes with a black box warning for hepatotoxicity, this should not impact uptake given the poor survival rate for this patient population. EU approval for Besponsa came earlier this year in June.Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo Combination Disappoints in Kidney Cancer Study:  Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo failed to meet one of the co-primary endpoints in a late stage study evaluating the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor plus Yervoy versus Sutent (sunitinib) in intermediate and poor-risk patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell cancer. The Opdivo-Yervoy combination met the objective response rate co-primary endpoint (41.6% versus 26.5%) but failed to show statistical significance for progression-free survival. The third co-primary endpoint of overall survival is yet to mature. Opdivo is approved for second-line renal cell carcinoma and positive data from this study would have helped support label expansion into the first-line setting. With the study ongoing for overall survival data, hitting this co-primary endpoint could support label expansion (Also read: Bristol-Myers Opdivo Fails Kidney Cancer Trial CheckMate-214).

206,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for Cabometyx tablets for patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The sNDA submission was based on positive results from phase II trial, CABOSUN, in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with intermediate- or poor-risk disease per the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC).An independent radiology review committee has confirmed the primary efficacy endpoint results of investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the CABOSUN trial. The study compared Cabometyx to Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent in the first-line treatment of intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC patients. As per the analysis from the committee, Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in the rate of disease progression or death as measured by PFS.In May 2016, Exelixis announced that CABOSUN met its primary endpoint as Cabometyx demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared to Sutent in patients with advanced intermediate- or poor-risk RCC as determined by investigator assessment.We remind investors that Cabometyx was approved by the FDA in Apr 2016 for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC who received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost results.New patient starts, refills for patients already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base for Cabometyx are driving the drug’s sales. The sequential increase in Cabometyx sales was driven by growth in prescriptions.Exelixis has collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) for the development of the drug in combination with immunotherapy agents.Exelixis’ share price has increased 79.6% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 7.4%.Earlier in the week, Bristol-Myers announced disappointing top-line results from the CheckMate-214 trial which investigated immuno-oncology drug Opdivo in combination with Yervoy versus Sutent in intermediate and poor-risk patients previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint.We note that renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults and accounts for more than 100,000 deaths worldwide each year. Among these, clear-cell RCC is the most prevalent type of RCC and constitutes 80-90% of all cases thereby underlying the demand for the same.Hence a potential approval of Cabometyx for previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC will boost sales.Zacks RankExelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

207,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced disappointing top-line results from the CheckMate-214 trial. The study investigated immuno-oncology drug Opdivo (nivolumab) in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab) versus Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE) Sutent in intermediate and poor-risk patients previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.Although the combination showed an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), it did not reach statistical significance as the median PFS was 11.56 months for the Opdivo and Yervoy combination versus 8.38 months for Sutent. Hence, the trial did not meet its primary endpoint. Nevertheless, the combination met the co-primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) and achieved a 41.6% ORR versus 26.5% for Sutent.However, the company has decided to continue with the study as planned to allow the third co-primary endpoint of overall survival to mature. The tolerability profile observed in CheckMate-214 was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies of this dosing schedule.  We note that renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults and accounts for more than 100,000 deaths worldwide each year. Among these, clear-cell RCC is the most prevalent type of RCC and constitutes 80-90% of all cases thereby underlying the demand for the same.Bristol-Myers received a huge boost when its high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval anywhere in the world in Jul 2014. It is currently approved in several countries including the U.S., the EU and Japan for several cancer indications.However, the company has had its share of pipeline and regulatory setbacks. In Oct 2016, Bristol-Myers announced the final primary analysis of CheckMate-026, a phase III study that evaluated the use of Opdivo monotherapy as a first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors expressed PD-L1 greater than or equal to 1%.In Jan 2017, the company announced not to pursue accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the United States, based on a review of available data. Bristol-Myers’ failed efforts to expand Opdivo’s label to include first-line treatment of lung cancer adversely impacted shares. Bristol-Myers’ stock has declined 1% in the year so far, against the industry’s 10.7% gain.Opdivo faces stiff competition from Merck &Co’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Roche Holding’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq. The recent FDA approval of Merck’s Keytruda for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC will further impact sales.Moreover, with the failure of AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Mystic study on Imfinzi in NSCLC, investors are worried about the outcome of the CheckMate-227 study on Opdivo for first-line NSCLC given the similarity of trials. While management has played down the uncertainty regarding the trial, concerns remain.Zacks Rank Bristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(CLVS  -  Free Report) on Aug 14.Rubraca has shown impressive growth trend in 2017 on the back of the company’s commercialization efforts. Rubraca sales doubled sequentially in the second quarter. Rubraca sales were $14.6 million in the quarter. However, general and administrative expenses increased 276% year over year to $29.2 million due to commercialization efforts.Rubraca is the only approved drug in the company’s portfolio and is the first and only oral PARP inhibitor to receive approval as monotherapy. The drug is approved for patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca.Clovis is conducting two confirmatory studies - ARIEL3 and ARIEL4 – for converting the accelerated approval to continued approval of Rubraca. Rubraca was in-licensed from Pfizer Inc.

209,BMY,"Nektar Therapeutics’ (NKTR  -  Free Report) shares have declined almost 9% since Aug 8 after the company reported second-quarter results. The biotech reported a wider-than-expected loss while sales missed estimates.Nektar’s second-quarter 2017 loss of 39 cents per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 35 cents. This reported loss was also wider than the year-ago loss of 36 cents per share.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The company’s shares have surged 46.3% while the industry has registered a decrease of 4.1%.Quarterly revenues rose 5.5% to $34.6 million from the year-ago quarter. This increase in revenues can mainly be attributed to the rise in product sales and royalty revenues. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36 million.Quarter in DetailThe top line comprised product sales, royalty revenues, non-cash royalty revenues, license, collaboration and other revenues.In the second quarter, product sales increased 21.7% to $15.7 million from $12.9 million a year ago. However, non-cash royalty revenues decreased 18.5% to $6.6 million.The company reported royalty revenues of $7.4 million, registering a huge improvement of 111.4% in the second quarter compared with $3.5 million in the year-ago quarter. This was mainly thanks to royalty revenues from Movantik sales.License, collaboration and other revenues came in at $4.8 million, down 42.2% compared with $8.3 million a year ago. This fall in revenues can mainly be attributed to the recognition of $3.2 million, received from Daiichi Sankyo for the sublicense of Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102) in Europe in second-quarter 2016.Research and development (R&D) expenses climbed 15.1% to $60.3 million, primarily due to investments in pipeline, including key candidates, NKTR-358 and NKTR-181.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were up 45.5% to $16 million. This massive jump can mainly be attributed to a payment of $7 million for settlement of a litigation regarding a cross-license agreement with Enzon, Inc., a Florida-based pharma company.Pipeline UpdateThe most advanced candidate in the company’s portfolio is Onzeald, currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treatment of adults with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases. However, the company was informed last month by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it had adopted a negative opinion for the conditional marketing application for the candidate in the EU. Subsequently, in the same month, the company filed a request for examining the opinion adopted by the CHMP.Apart from Onzeald, another candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology portfolio is NKTR-214. A phase I/II study evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo is underway. During the second quarter, Nektar announced that it has started dosing patients in the trial and plans to enroll up to 260 patients in eight target cancer indications. The company expects to report initial data from the dose-escalation part of the study soon.Notably, in May, Nektar announced a research collaboration agreement with Japanese pharma company, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio.Last month, Nektar announced that it has entered into a strategic collaboration contract with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) to co-develop NKTR-358 (phase I study ongoing) for treatment of a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions.2017 Outlook UpdatedNektar raised its revenue outlook for 2017 to account for a $150 million upfront payment it expects to receive from Lilly. The company now estimates revenue in the range of $215-$225 million compared with $145-$155 million, projected previously.Driven by the same reason, Nektar also raised its expected cash position for the year ending 2017 with approximately $350 million compared with $225 million, estimated previously.Nektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksNektar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

210,BMY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) incurred second-quarter 2017 loss of 23 cents per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 25 cents as well as the year-ago loss of 32 cents per share. Lower costs and higher revenues led to the narrower loss in the quarter.Total revenue in the quarter rose 171.4% year over year to $3.8 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.82 million. The manufacturing service agreement with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative led to higher revenues in the quarter.Shares of the biotech company rose 4.3% in after-hours trading on Tuesday.However, the stock has not done too well this year so far. It has declined 27.7% year to date against the 9.7% increase registered by the industry.Research and development expenses declined 2.7% from the year-ago period to $25.0 million. General and administrative spend declined 16.7% to $6.5 million.As of Jun 30, 2017, Celldex had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $154.0 million compared with $167.0 million as of Mar 31, 2017. Celldex expects that this cash plus anticipated proceeds from the future sales of its common stock under the agreement with Cantor will be enough to fund working capital requirements and planned operations through 2018. However, the guidance assumes that Celldex will pay future Kolltan contingent milestones, if any, in stock and not in cash.Pipeline UpdateCelldex’s most advanced pipeline candidate is glembatumumab vedotin, currently being evaluated for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (phase IIb - METRIC study) and metastatic melanoma (phase II). Enrolment in the METRIC study is expected to be completed in September this year, with top-line data expected in the second quarter of 2018.Data from the phase II metastatic melanoma study of glemba, as a single agent, was presented in June at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Glemba performed well in the single agent setting with 11% response rate, a 52% disease control rate and a median duration of response of six months in patients who have failed three or four prior lines of therapy. The study also includes two new cohorts, a glembatumumab plus varlilumab arm - data expected by year end - and a glembatumumab plus checkpoint inhibitor arm, including either Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo or Merck & Co, Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, Celldex has several promising candidates in its pipeline, including varlilumab and CDX-014 (phase I—advanced renal cell carcinoma) among others.Varlilumab is being evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers Opdivo in a phase II study that includes cohorts in five indications - colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma. Celldex plans to complete enrolment across all cohorts in the phase II portion of the study in the first quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, the company presented data from the phase 1 potion of varlilumab/Opdivo combination study at ASCO in June. The data showed that the combination was well tolerated at all tested dose levels without any increased autoimmunity or inappropriate immune activation.With the Kolltan acquisition in Nov 2016, Celldex gained rights to two of Kolltan’s cancer pipeline candidates, CDX-0158 and CDX-3379. While CDX-0158 is being evaluated in a phase I study for refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors/GIST and other KIT positive tumors (data expected by year end), a phase II study on CDX-3379 in patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer who are refractory to Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report)/Bristol-Myers’ Erbitux is expected to be initiated in the fourth quarterCelldex Therapeutics, Inc.

211,BMY,"Total earnings for 83.3% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 6% on revenue growth of 4.1%. Though earnings growth is weak compared with many other sectors, earnings and revenue beat ratios of 85% and 70%, respectively, are particularly encouraging. In fact, healthcare is the fourth sector that surprised investors the most on earnings, trailing aerospace, technology and materials.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on July 18, followed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) on July 25 and July 27, respectively. Two other major U.S. drug companies – Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) – reported on July 28 and August 1, respectively. These industry primes posted solid results with earnings beat while a few lagged on the revenue front.Johnson and Johnson Earnings in FocusThe world's biggest maker of healthcare products continued its long streak of earnings beat but narrowly missed the top–line estimate. Earnings per share came in at $1.83, 4 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 5.2% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 1.9% year over year to $18.84 billion but fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.89 billion.Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $7.12–$7.22 from $7.00–$7.15 and revenue guidance to $75.8–$76.1 billion from $75.4–$76.1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $7.10 for earnings per share and $75.71 billion for revenues at time of earnings release. JNJ has gained 0.9% to date since its earnings announcement (read: J&J Brightens Outlook: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).Pfizer Earnings in FocusThe U.S. drug giant beat on earnings but missed on revenues. Earnings per share of 67 cents came in couple of cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $12.9 billion fell shy of our estimate of $13 billion. On an annual basis, earnings per share rose 5% and revenues declined 2%.For 2017, Pfizer expects revenues in the range of $52-$54 billion and raised the lower end of the earnings per share guidance to $2.54-$2.60 from $2.50–$2.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is correctly pegged at $52.79 billion for revenues and $2.56 for earnings per share. Shares of PFE are up 1.8% since the earnings announcement.Merck Earnings in FocusEarnings per share came in at $1.01, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents and improving 8.6% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues inched up 1% year over year to $9.93 billion and were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.79 billion.Merck raised its revenue guidance from $39.1–$40.3 billion to $39.4-$40.4 billion while reiterated earnings per share projection at $3.76–$3.88 for this year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $40.32 billion for revenues and $3.86 for earnings per share. The stock has lost 0.3% following its earnings announcement.Bristol-Myers Earnings in FocusBristol-Myers reported earnings per share of 74 cents, a penny ahead of our estimate and increased 7% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 6% to $5.14 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.07 billion.The company raised its low end of earnings per share guidance to $2.90-$3.00 from $2.85-$3.00 for this year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of the earnings announcement was pegged at $2.94. Shares of BMY are down 0.9% to date since the earnings announcement (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Eli Lilly Earnings in FocusEarnings of $1.11 at Eli Lilly outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by seven cents and came in 29% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 8% to $5.82 billion and beat our estimate of $5.59 billion.Like other drug makers, Eli Lilly also raised its 2017 revenue and earnings guidance. It now expects revenues in the range of $22.0–$22.5 billion compared with the previous expectation of $21.8–$22.3 billion and earnings per share in the range of $4.10-$4.20 versus $4.05-$4.15 expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of the earnings release was pegged at $22.18 billion for revenues and $4.12 for earnings per share. Shares of LLY have lost 3.3% since the earnings release.ETF AngleThe string of earnings beat failed to boost pharma ETFs as they saw rough trading over the past 10 days.

212,BMY,"Second quarter earnings season for the pharma sector kicked off this week with industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Swiss pharma giant, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), reporting results. Meanwhile, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) gained tentative approval from the FDA for its follow-on biologic basal insulin though the company cannot launch immediately due to an ongoing patent infringement case.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at J&J and Novartis’ 2Q Results: Industry bellwether J&J and Swiss pharma giant, Novartis, both reported second quarter results earlier this week. J&J surpassed earnings expectations though revenues fell short. The company raised its outlook for the year with operational sales growth expected to accelerate in the second half. Some of the factors that should help this include the earlier launch of Tremfya, a more moderate erosion of the U.S. Remicade business compared to previous expectations as well as the continued strong performance of key drugs. Contribution from new products in the Medical Devices segment is also expected to pick up in the back half of the year with strong growth in the Vision Care segment expected to continue. The Consumer segment, however, will continue to be impacted by weaker macroeconomic dynamics (Read more: J&J Beats on Q2 Earnings, Lags Sales, Ups 2017 View).Novartis’ second quarter results were better than expected with the company beating on both earnings and revenues. Entresto and Cosentyx continued to perform well while Sandoz sales declined reflecting pricing pressure in the U.S. Meanwhile, Alcon’s performance improved encouraging the company to raise its Alcon sales outlook to low single digit growth (Read more: Novartis Tops Q2 Earnings, Sandoz Faces Pricing Pressure). Novartis stock has gained 17.3% year to date, outperforming the 12.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.Tentative Approval for Merck’s Follow-On Basal Insulin: Merck got tentative approval from the FDA for its biosimilar version of Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) blockbuster diabetes drug, Lantus. Lusduna Nexvue (insulin glargine injection), technically a follow-on biologic basal insulin, has been developed by Merck with funding from Samsung Bioepis.However, Merck will have to wait before it can launch the product due to an automatic 30-month stay resulting from a patent infringement lawsuit initiated by Sanofi in Sep 2016. Merck cannot launch its product before the expiry of the stay period or a favorable court ruling, whichever occurs first.We note that a biosimilar version of Lantus is already on the market in the form of Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Basaglar which entered the market in mid-Dec 2016. Lantus sales declined 14.1% in the first quarter of 2017 including a 20.9% decline in the U.S. reflecting lower average net price, patient switches to Toujeo and the impact of formulary exclusions. Pricing pressure will increase once Merck’s product enters the market.Sanofi and Merck are both Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sanofi in Nanobody Deal with Ablynx: Sanofi has entered into a research collaboration and global exclusive licensing agreement with Belgian company, Ablynx, focused on the development and commercialization of Nanobody-based therapeutics for the treatment of various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. With this deal, Sanofi will gain access to certain Nanobodies in Ablynx’s existing portfolio as well as to Ablynx’s scientists and proprietary Nanobody platform. Sanofi will make an upfront payment of €23 million. Other financial details include up to €2.4 billion in milestone payments as well as tiered royalties. With this collaboration, Sanofi is looking to expand its drug discovery pipeline in immunology.EU Nod for AstraZeneca’s Kyntheum: AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) psoriasis treatment Kyntheum gained approval in the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The company said that its partner LEO Pharma gained approval for the use of the biologic medicine for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.Kyntheum was approved in the U.S. under the trade name Siliq in Feb 2017 with a black box warning regarding risk in patients with suicidal thoughts or behavior.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 1.8% over the last five trading sessions. Among major stocks, AstraZeneca was up 4.6% while J&J gained 3.6%.

213,BMY,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AVEO  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 3.In the last reported quarter, AVEO delivered a positive surprise of 20%.AVEO’s share price movement shows that the stock has significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. In fact, AVEO has surged 457.4% during this period compared with a rise of 3.9% for the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayAVEO, a development-stage biopharmaceutical company, is focused on the development of treatments for cancer and other areas of unmet medical need.In August, the European Commission approved Fotivda (tivozanib) for treating first-line treatment for renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) in adults. The drug has demonstrated superiority over Bayer AG’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) Nexavar in treating RCC. Fotivda became the first approved drug of the company. However, we expect minimal impact on the top line as the launch process is currently underway.The company depends entirely on collaboration revenues and milestone and other payments for its revenues. AVEO has received a payment of $4 million as research and development payment from EUSA Pharma following the approval of Fotivda. Meanwhile, it also received $0.5 million from CANbridge for achieving a milestone related to manufacturing development activities for AV-203.Moreover, in June 2017, the company announced that a phase I/II TiNivo study has progressed to phase II based on successful completion of the phase I dose escalation study. In September, AVEO announced that EUSA Pharma has opted into phase I/II TiNino study evaluating Fotivda in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in RCC. EUSA Pharma may use the study data for regulatory or commercial purposes in exchange for a payment of $2 million.Apart from tivozanib, AVEO has several early- and mid-stage candidates in its pipeline including ficlatuzumab. In June, the company announced positive results from phase I studies, evaluating the candidate in metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.Investor focus will likely remain on updates related to tivozanib’s launch and progress of other pipeline candidates.Surprise HistoryAVEO Pharma’s performance over the last four quarters has been mixed, with the company surpassing expectations thrice and missing the same once. The average positive surprise over the last four quarters is 11.79%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AVEO Pharma is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 5 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Although AVEO Pharma’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(GILD  -  Free Report) reported their third-quarter results last week.  While Merck, Celgene and AbbVie outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings, they lagged the same for revenues. However, Bristol-Myers and Gilead surpassed expectations for both earnings and revenues.Notably, Bristol-Myers and Gilead raised their earnings outlook for 2017 as well.

Abbvie and Celgene also tightened their earnings guidance for 2017.Here we have three biotech/pharma companies that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 31.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) Pfizer, which is scheduled to release earnings before the market opens, delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.08% in the last quarter. The company’s earnings performance has been mixed with the bottom line missing in two of the last four quarters while beating the same in the other two, bringing the average surprise to negative 0.39%.For this quarter, Pfizer has an Earnings ESP of -0.11% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 65 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.New products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) may contribute to the top line, meaningfully. Meanwhile, sales of blockbuster drug Enbrel will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The lower sales trend in Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to continue as well. Sales of Viagra are expected to be affected by lower demand.

215,BMY,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after market close.Exelixis’ track record is outstanding. The company has surpassed expectations in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 543.6%. Exelixis’ share price has increased 15.7% in the last six months compared with the industry’s loss of 0.1%.Factors Likely to Impact ResultsExelixis received a major boost with the FDA’s approval of Cabometyx tablets in April 2016 for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The drug’s uptake was encouraging and is expected to propel the top line in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, Cabometyx was also approved in the EU.New patient starts, refills for patients already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base for Cabometyx are driving the drug’s sales. Meanwhile, Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program and has submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for advanced RCC. The FDA assigned a PDUFA action date of Feb 15, 2018. A potential label expansion of Cabometyx will significantly boost the growth prospects.During the first quarter, Exelixis inked agreements with The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop abozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents. Exelixis and Bristol-Myers initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER, in July.Exelixis also initiated the dose-escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq. The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) or RCC.These collaborations allow Exelixis to earn milestone payments and royalties that boost its top line.However, expenses continue to increase. Exelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2017 in the range of $290-$310 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Exelixis is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) to be able to beat earnings. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -10.82% since the Most Accurate is 7 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 8 cents.

216,BMY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 19 cents per share for the third quarter of 2017, significantly narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents and the year-ago quarter loss of 23 cents per share.However, including a gain of $78.7 million from the exercise of the warrant granted during termination of license transaction with Immunomedics, the company reported earnings of 34 cents per share.Revenues came in at $135.3 million, up 27.3% year over year, primarily on the back of strong sales of Adcetris. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $113 million.Seattle Genetics’ shares were up 3.8% in after-market trading on Thursday. In fact the company’s share price has gained 15.9% year to date compared with the industry’s rise of 3.6% in the same period.Quarter in DetailSeattle Genetics’ top line comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties.The company’s only marketed product, Adcetris, generated product sales of $79.2 million, up 12.9% year over year.Collaboration and license agreement revenues increased 64.5% to almost $39.4 million, mainly driven by strong demand for Adcetris in the international market. Collaboration revenues include fees earned from the company’s agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. for Adcetris and other ADC collaborations.Royalty revenues increased 36.9% year over year to $16.7 million, attributable to international sales of Adcetris by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $113.6 million, up 22.5% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 13.9% to $34.8 million. Costs were high primarily due to investment in vadastuximab talirine, enfortumab vedotin, Adcetris and other pipeline development.2017 Outlook UpdateThe company raised its outlook for collaboration and license agreement revenues to the range of $90 million to $100 million (previously $75 million to $90 million). The royalties are expected in the range of $60 million to $65 million (previously $50 million to $55 million). Net sales of Adcetris are expected in the range of $290 million to $310 million.The company lowered the upper limit of the expected R&D expense projection. It is currently expected to be $460 million to $480 million compared with the previous expectation of $460 million to $500 million.Pipeline UpdateSeattle Genetics continues to work on expanding Adcetris’ label further through three phase III studies. We note that the FDA has granted priority review for a supplemental Biologics License Application in August to include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in its label. A decision is expected in December.Meanwhile, the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Adcetris based on data from the phase III ECHELON-1 study (frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma) on Adcetris showing a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival. Seattle Generics and Takeda are planning to submit applications for regulatory approval by the year end.Moreover, top-line data from the ECHELON-2 study (frontline CD30-expressing mature T-cell lymphoma) should be out in 2018. The company is also evaluating Adcetris in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in relapsed/refractoryclassical Hodgkin lymphoma.In addition, the company initiated a pivotal phase II study on enfortumab vedotin in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer patients in late 2017. Moreover, Seattle Genetics and Astellas Pharma are planning to initiate a phase Ib study to evaluate the candidate in combination with CPI therapies, including pembrolizumab, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.In July, Seattle Genetics collaborated with Genentech, a member of Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report), to evaluate the combination of Roche’s immunotherapy Tecentriq and Seattle Genetics’ antibody-drug conjugate SGN-LIV1A in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.Our TakeThe company’s third-quarter loss was narrower than estimated and sales also beat expectations. Given the positive developments for Adcetris, investors should focus on updates of its label expansion. Approval for T-cell lymphoma indication will boost sales further.Seattle Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stocks in the health care sector includes Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC (ADAP  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

217,BMY,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Vosevi (Sovaldi, velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg) tablets. The drug is a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1a or 3 previously treated with a Sovaldi-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor.The approval came on the back of positive data from the phase III studies – POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 studies. The studies evaluated 12 weeks of Vosevi in direct-acting antiviral-experienced chronic HCV-infected patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.However, Vosevi has been warned for its product label regarding the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HCV/HBV co infected patients.Nevertheless, the approval makes Vosevi the first once-daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1–6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors. The approval is expected to boost Gilead’s strong HCV portfolio.Gilead has a strong presence in the HCV market due to its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. While Sovaldi continues to be a very important product for the company, Harvoni’s label has been expanded twice in the U.S. since approval and is now approved for use in a broader range of patient population. The HCV portfolio got a huge a boost when Epclusa gained approval in both the U.S. (Jun 2016) and the EU (Jul 2016) to become the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. Initial uptake of Epclusa has been encouraging while formulary reviews are on track. Gilead expects to launch Epclusa in other large EU markets once pricing and reimbursement is in place by the second half of 2017, which should boost sales further.Last month, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion on the company’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Vosevi following an accelerated assessment procedure.Gilead’s HCV franchise is under pressure due to intense competition and pricing issues. HCV product sales were weaker than expected mainly due to fewer new patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient. Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa has being facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR, Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Olysio.The company expects that the persistent decline in HCV patient starts will be the primary factor behind the year-over-year decrease in revenues in 2017 along with increased competition which will impact patient share and pricing.Shares of Gilead have underperformed the Zacks classified Medical-Biomedical and Genetics industry in the year so far, with the stock losing 0.1% during this period, against the industry’s gain of 8.8%. Nevertheless, the HIV franchise of Gilead is performing well and is expected to help the company combat the persistent decline in HCV franchise.Zacks Rank Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing UpsiZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

218,BMY,"Shares of Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) have gained almost 4.68% on Aug 12. The company’s shares have rallied a whopping 77% this year so far, outperforming the 7.8% increase registered by the Zacks categorized Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry during this period. Here we analyze the factors that led to the rally.Exelixis is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small-molecule therapies for the treatment of cancer.Exelixis’ lead product, Cometriq, the capsule form of cabozantinib, was approved in the U.S. in 2012 for the treatment of progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program comprising over 45 clinical studies across multiple indications. The company received a major impetus in Apr 2016 when the FDA approved the tablet formulation of cabozantinib, (distinct from the capsule form) under the brand name Cabometyx for the treatment of RCC in patients who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. Cabometyx was also approved in EU in Sept 2016 for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults who have received prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy.Results from the phase II CABOSUN study on cabozantinib versus Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutentin formerly untreated advanced RCC were positive. Based on the CABOSUN results, the company has planned to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for cabozantinib for treating first-line advanced RCC in the third quarter of 2017.The company presented further positive analysis from the trial in Jun 2017. A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost results.As per data from The American Cancer Society, kidney cancer is among the ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the U.S. Hence, we believe Exelixis is poised to capture a major chunk of the market if approved for first-line kidney cancer.Meanwhile, in early 2017, Exelixis inkedagreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agentsfurther. Exelixis collaborated with Bristol-Myers to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo alone or in combination with Yervoy in a phase III trial in first-line RCC, and potentially in other tumor types including (HCC and bladder cancer). Both the companies have initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER in Jul 2017 to evaluate Opdivo in combination with Cabometyx or Opdivo and Yervoy in combination with Cabometyx versus Sutent in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC.Exelixis has also collaborated with Roche to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with advanced RCC or bladder cancer. In Jun 2017, Exelixis initiated the dose-escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq. The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) or RCC.Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug.Zacks RankExelixis currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

220,BMY,"Aduro BioTech, Inc. (ADRO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 loss of 27 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 36 cents. However, the company reported earnings of 3 cents per share a year ago.Quarterly revenues plunged 84.9% year over year to $5.9 million. This top-line deterioration was mainly due to the recognition of a milestone payment of $35 million in the second quarter of 2016, pursuant to an agreement with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) for development of ADU-S100 in combination with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor.However, the decrease was partially offset by a recognition of $2 million milestone payment under collaboration with Merck & Co (MRK  -  Free Report) with a view to investigate CRS-207 combined with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for treating gastric cancer. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4 million.Aduro’ shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. Shares of the company have rallied 10.5% while the industry has registered an increase of 9.9%.Research and development expenses showed a substantial decline of 20.4% in the quarter to $21.4 million, mainly due to a decrease in expenses related to the manufacturing of GVAX pancreas and pancreatic cancer clinical study expense, incurred in the second quarter of 2016.General and administrative expenses were $8.2 million, down 4.6% year over year due to lower consulting and professional fees.Pipeline UpdateAduro has a broad pipeline of novel immunotherapies under development for treatment of a variety of cancers.The most advanced programs from the LADD platform is a combination of CRS-207 – Aduro’s LADD (live, attenuated double-deleted)-based immunotherapy, GVAX Pancreas and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo (anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor) – that is currently under evaluation in the phase II STELLAR study on patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.Aduro has also completed enrollment in the initial cohort of the phase Ib study, evaluating the combination of CRS-207 and standard-of-care chemotherapy on patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. In Jun 2017, Aduro Biotech announced initiation of a phase II study to evaluate a combination therapy of CRS-207 with Merck’s Keytruda for treating patients previously nursed for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).During the same month, Aduro announced that the FDA has cleared the Investigational new drug application (IND) for ADU-S100 (MIW815).

221,BMY,"Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 loss of $1.29 per share, which was narrower than the year-ago loss of $2.07 per share. The reported loss was however wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.27.Clovis’ PARP inhibitor, Rubraca (rucaparib) received accelerated approval from the FDA in Dec 2016 for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. The drug is the only marketed product in its portfolio.Net product revenues, entirely from Rubraca, were approximately $14.6 million in the quarter, up 108.6% sequentially and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.54 million. The company registered 750 new patients in the quarter.In the year-ago quarter, Clovis did not generate any revenues.The company’s shares rose 1.36% in after-market trading on Wednesday. The stock has significantly outperformed the industry, having surged 83.7% this year so far while the industry rose 10%.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, research & development expenses decreased 51.1% year over year to $33.1 million, primarily due to decreased development activities related to Rubraca and rociletinib programs. General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased 276% year over year to $36.1 million, reflecting increased activities to support commercialization of Rubraca.Cash used in operating activities in the quarter was $69.1 million, slightly more than $68 million in the year-ago quarter.The company ended the quarter with $671.5 million of cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities supported by the proceeds raised through share offerings in January and June.Update on RubracaIn order to convert the accelerated approval to a continued approval, Clovis is running confirmatory studies.In Jun 2017, the company announced promising progression-free survival (PFS) and safety results from the pivotal maintenance confirmatory study, ARIEL3. It demonstrated that its PARP inhibitor, Rubraca has a meaningful impact in delaying disease recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer patients.Clovis intends to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for label expansion of Rubraca in second-line or later maintenance indication for advanced ovarian cancer by October this year. The company believes that the label expansion is expected to increase patient population by at least four times.Meanwhile, Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable ovarian cancer indication. Clovis expects EU approval in the first quarter of 2018 and is establishing the commercial infrastructure for the same. The company also has plans to submit a supplemental application for the second-line or later maintenance treatment indication in EU, if the drug is approved for ovarian cancer.Another phase III confirmatory study, ARIEL4 is evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy and is open for enrolment.Meanwhile, Clovis is looking to expand Rubraca’s label into additional indications like prostrate, breast and pancreatic cancers, among others, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Earlier this week, the company collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) to evaluate the Rubraca - Opdivo combination study in ovarian, breast and prostate cancer.Several clinical studies were initiated in early 2017, including TRITON2 and TRITON3 in prostate cancer and a Tecentriq- Rubraca combination study in gynecologic cancers, which is sponsored by Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report).Clovis Oncology, Inc.

222,BMY,"Shares of Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) were down 3.4% after the company reported a loss in the second quarter of 2017.Incyte reported a loss of 6 cents, a penny wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents. Incyte had reported earnings of 18 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues were $326.4 million, up 32.5% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $318.4 million. The top line was driven by higher sales of Jakafi in the U.S. and Iclusig in Europe as well as royalties from ex-U.S. sales of Jakavi and Olumiant.Incyte’s shares have moved up 28.4% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 9.0% gain.Quarter in DetailJakafi sales grew 33%, year over year to $276 million. Net product revenue of Iclusig amounted to $15.7 million. Product royalty revenues from Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex-U.S. markets grew 34% to $34.8 million.Research and development expenses were up to $201.8 million from $120.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the portfolio as well as upfront and milestone expenses of $209 million related to collaboration and license agreements. Selling, general and administration (SG&A) expenses amounted to $90.1 million, up 34.8% year over year.2017 Outlook UpdatedThe company now expects Jakafi revenues in the range of $1,090–$1,120 million, up from $1,020–$1,070 million. Iclusig revenues are expected in the range of $60–$65 million.R&D expenses are now expected in the range of $1,050–1,150 million, up from the earlier forecast of $1,000–1,100 billion due to the acceleration of the phase III plans for epacadostat. SG&A expenses are still expected in the range of $340–$360 million. Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation QuotePipeline UpdateA phase III trial, REACH3 evaluating Jakafi as a treatment for patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is expected was initiated in Jun 2017. The pivotal program, RESET-272 evaluating Jakafi versus anagrelide in patients with essential thrombocythemia is now open for enrolment and first patient will be dosed in the coming weeks.A phase III trial, GRAVITAS-301, on itacitinib, in patients with treatment-naïve acute GVHD, was initiated in July.Earlier in 2017, Incyte extended its collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) for the pivotal program studying epacadostat in combination with Keytruda to a total of five tumor types. Incyte and Merck will advance four additional tumor types beyond melanoma – non-small cell lung cancer, bladder, renal and head & neck cancers – across six phase III trials. These trials are expected to begin in2017.Additionally, Incyte extended its collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) evaluating epacadostat in combination with Opdivo in pivotal studies in two tumor types (planned initiation before 2017 end).The European Commission approved Olumiant in Feb 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The drug was approved in Japan too. However, the company suffered a setback when the FDA issued a complete response letter for Olumiant in which the FDA indicated that additional clinical data are needed to determine the most appropriate doses. The FDA further stated that additional data are necessary to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms. In Jul 2017, Lilly and Incyte announced that the resubmission of the New Drug Application (NDA) for Olumiant will be delayed for a period anticipated to be a minimum of 18 months. Both companies will be further evaluating future plans with the agency and analyse options for resubmission, including the potential for an additional clinical study, as requested by the FDA.Our TakeIncyte reported a wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter. Nevertheless, the revenue beat was impressive. Jakafi sales were driven by patient demand and are expected boost revenues. The increase in sales guidance was also encouraging.While most of the demand is due to a larger established patient base in myelofibrosis, polycythemiavera is also expected to be a major long-term driver of Jakafi growth. This is owing to the larger potential patient population and the possibility for longer duration of treatment. Jakafi was included as a recommended treatment for patients with myelofibrosis and patients with polycythemiavera in the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in Jul 2017. This is likely to boost demand further.However, the delay in NDA submission of Olumiant in the U.S. is disappointing.Zacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

223,BMY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8 after market close. Celldex’s performance has been encouraging as it delivered positive surprise in three of the trailing four quarters and met estimates in one, delivering an average positive surprise of 6.04%.Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.

We believe the company will continue to record revenues from these sources in the second quarter of 2017.With no approved product in its portfolio, investor focus will remain on pipeline development.Celldex’s efforts to build its immuno-oncology pipeline are impressive. Its lead pipeline candidate, glembatumumab vedotin is currently being evaluated for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (phase IIb - METRIC study) and metastatic melanoma (phase II). It is also being evaluated for the treatment of other cancers (squamous cell lung cancer, uveal melanoma and pediatric osteosarcoma) in which glycoprotein NMB is expressed.The company announced in Jun 2017 that glembatumumab vedotin demonstrated a median overall survival of nine months for all patients and 15.8 months in patients with stage III/IV checkpoint-refractory metastatic melanoma, improving on its previous results. Moreover, the phase I portion of a phase 1/2 dose escalation and cohort expansion studyshowed that varlilumab in combination with Bristol-Myers Opdivo in advanced cancer patients was well toleratedat all tested dose levels.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, Celldex has several promising candidates in its pipeline, including CDX-1401/CDX-301 (phase II—multiple solid tumors; in collaboration with CITN) and CDX-014 (phase I—advanced renal cell carcinoma) among others.Operating expenses vary on a quarterly basis.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Celldexis likely to beat on earnings this quarterThis is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

Meanwhile, important study data was released by Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Big pharma companies like Merck, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Glaxo, Roche, Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca reported second quarter results last week. Bristol-Myers, Lilly and Merck all beat expectations. While Merck maintained its outlook for the year (Read more: Merck Beats on Q2 Earnings and Sales, Keeps 2017 View), Bristol-Myers updated the same (Read more: Bristol-Myers Beats on Q2 Earnings, Tweaks 2017 View). Lilly was hit by its baricitinib update despite reporting a “beat and raise” quarter (Read more: Key Takeaways from Lilly's Q2 Call: Baricitinib, Cancer Pipeline). Meanwhile, AstraZeneca’s results were over-shadowed by disappointing MYSTIC data on Imfinzi in treatment-naïve non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the company’s shares falling 14.9% (Read more: AstraZeneca Beats on Q2 Earnings, Falls on Failed Study).British drugmaker Glaxo set out new priorities for the company with the company deciding to allocate 80% of capital to priority assets in two current (respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases) and two potential (oncology and immuno-inflammation) therapy areas.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Merck’s Keytruda Misses Endpoint in HNSCC Study: There were a lot of updates from Merck last week in addition to the earnings results. The company was hit by disappointing results from a late-stage study evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The study failed to meet the pre-specified primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). This is the latest Keytruda-related setback for Merck. Earlier this month, the company had announced that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on three combination studies (KEYNOTE-183, KEYNOTE-185 and KEYNOTE-023) being conducted with Keytruda for multiple myeloma (MM).Meanwhile, a look at Merck’s second quarter results shows that Keytruda remains strong in the lung cancer setting. Keytruda is currently in more than 550 studies including more than 300 combination studies.Merck-AstraZeneca Sign Oncology Collaboration: Merck and AstraZeneca will be collaborating for the global development and commercialization of Merck’s Keytruda and AstraZeneca’s PARP inhibitor Lynparza for different types of cancer. Lynparza, currently approved for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer in multiple lines of treatment, is in different studies for a range of tumor types including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. The deal will cover the evaluation of PARP and MEK inhibitors with PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors. AstraZeneca stands to receive up to $8.5 billion including an upfront payment of $1.6 billion, $750 million for certain license options and up to an additional $6.15 billion on the achievement of regulatory and sales milestones.Merck stock has gained 8.9% year to date (YTD), lagging the 10.5% rally of the industry it belongs to while AstraZeneca has gained 10.8% YTD.J&J’s Janssen Inks Deal with Bavarian Nordic: Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies and Denmark-based biotech company Bavarian Nordic entered into an additional worldwide exclusive license and collaboration agreement under which Janssen will get exclusive rights to Bavarian Nordic’s MVA-BN technology for two additional programs targeting vaccines against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV-1.J&J will make an upfront payment of $10 million and an equity investment worth $33 million. Bavarian Nordic will also be eligible to receive milestone payments worth up to $836 million plus tiered royalties on future sales.With this deal, the companies are now collaborating for four programs combining Bavarian Nordic’s MVA-BN technology with Janssen’s AdVac technology platform.Pfizer-Astellas’ Xtandi Breast Cancer Program Dropped: Astellas, which reported results last week, provided an update on its pipeline which showed that the company and its partner, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), have decided to drop the development of Xtandi for breast cancer. The development program included a phase III study for triple negative breast cancer and a phase II study for ER/PR positive, HER2 positive breast cancer. Astellas said that the decision was based on discussions with Pfizer, the change in the competitive landscape, need for further diagnostic development and new phase II data.Ongoing programs for Xtandi include non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (phase III), prostate cancer in patients with non-metastatic biochemical recurrence (phase III), metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (phase III) and hepatocellular cancer (phase II).PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.8% over the last five trading sessions.

225,BMY,"Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) reported third quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations.  However, the stock is expected to open in the red given the decline in hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise.  Nevertheless, Gilead’s stock has gained 15.2% year to date as against the industry's  decline of 0.2%.The company’s third-quarter earnings (including the impact of stock-based compensation expenses) of $2.27 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $2.75.Moreover, total revenues of $6.5 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.3 billion. However, revenues declined 13.2% year over year.HIV Impresses Yet Again, Harvoni & Sovaldi PlungesProduct sales came in at $6.4 billion, down 13.5% year over year. The decline was due to lower hepatitis C virus (HCV) sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $5.8 billion in the reported quarter, down 14.7%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) and sales of Vosevi (approved in the United States and Europe in July 2017).Sales of Harvoni declined 47.7% year over year to $973 million in the reported quarter. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 73.4% to $219 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $882 million in the reported quarter, up from the year-ago figure of $640 million. We note that Epclusa was launched in the U.S. and Europe in June and Jul 2016, respectively.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.6 billion, up 16.1% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $988 million, up from $461 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $316 million, up from $88 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $296 million, up from $105 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined 63.1% and 42.3% respectively. Viread sales were down at $274 million, down 9.6%.Atripla sales tanked 32.4% to $439 million, while Truvada sales fell 5.5% to $811 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $213 million (down 0.9%), $164 million (down 3.5%), $92 million (up 1.1%) and $40 million (up 2.5%), respectively.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 24% to $745 million. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 3.3% to $806 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 87.2% compared to 87.6% in the year-ago period.2017 Guidance UpdatedGilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.5-$25.5 billion, up from $24.0-$25.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $16 billion and $16.5 billion (earlier projection: $15.5 billion and $16 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion (earlier projection: $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.3-$3.4 billion and $3.3-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-87%. Earnings per share are now projected around $1.02-$1.17 (earlier projection: 86-93 cents).Kite AcquisitionThe company recently acquired Kite Pharma. Last week, the company received FDA approval for Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy.Dividend and Share RepurchaseConcurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 52 cents per share of common stock for fourth-quarter 2017. The dividend is payable on Dec 28 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Dec 15. During the quarter, the company paid cash dividends of $682 million and repurchased shares for $153 million.Our TakeThough the company topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the third quarter, it witnessed a  decline in HCV sales. The HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition. We expect sales to decline further going forward.  We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza among others. Competition as well as pricing pressure has intensified further with the launch of Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Only 39,000 patients began treatment on a Gilead regimen during the quarter, down 9% from the prior quarter.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the United States and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 56% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting should further boost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 145,000 patients using Truvada by the end of the third quarter. The approval of Yescarta also bodes well for Gilead.However, Gilead has lost exclusivity for Viread and Truva which will further impact performance. We expect the decline in HCV franchise to offset the positive momentum of HIV franchise.Zacks Rank Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

226,BMY,"Major pharma companies like Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report), GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) and Novartis (Read more: Novartis Q3 Earnings & Sales Top on New Drugs Strength) reported third quarter results this week. While it was a “beat and raise” quarter for Lilly, Bristol-Myers’s results were mixed.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly Tops Expectations, Mulls Options for Animal Health Segment: Lilly’s third quarter results were better than expected with the company beating on both the top- and bottom-line and raising its outlook for the year reflecting uptake trends for new pharmaceutical products.The company also announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Animal Health business (Elanco Animal Health) with an update expected by mid-2018.

Opdivo’s performance remained strong despite the presence of increasing competition with sales growing 38% to $1.3 billion. Eliquis also performed well. The company said that business development remains a top priority while it expects to buy back shares worth an additional $250 million by year end (Read more: Bristol-Myers Misses on Q3 Earnings, Opdivo in Focus). The company has gained 4.3% year to date, compared to the 16.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Sanofi Files Patent Infringement Lawsuit against Mylan for Lantus: French drugmaker, Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) has filed a patent infringement suit against Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) for Lantus and Lantus SoloStar. The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges infringement of 18 patents. Although Sanofi’s diabetes product sales are under immense pressure, the Lantus franchise remains a major contributor to the top-line. Earlier this year in August, Sanofi had filed a patent infringement suit against Merck alleging infringement of two patents related to Lantus products.Interest Increases in Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare Business: Ever since Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that it is exploring strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business, including a full or partial separation via a spin off or sale, quite a few companies have been rumored to be interested in striking a deal. This week, British pharma major, Glaxo, was asked on its third quarter call about its interest in acquiring Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business.  Glaxo’s own Consumer segment has been witnessing a material slowdown in global growth across key categories with factors like pricing pressure, increasing competition and tougher emerging markets weighing on performance (Read more: Glaxo Q3 Earnings Beat, Revenues In Line, Shares Down).Meanwhile, according to a Reuters article, Pfizer expects to start the auction process for its consumer healthcare business in November. According to sources, possible bidders apart from Glaxo and Reckitt Benckiser could include names like Procter & Gamble, Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson and Nestle.PerformanceThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 3.7% this week. Among major stocks, Glaxo declined 10.9% mainly reflecting concerns about the company’s dividend payouts especially if it strikes a deal for Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business. Over the last six months, J&J was up 16.3% (See the last pharma stock roundup here: Beat & Raise Quarter from J&J, Allergan Hit by Restasis Ruling).What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for earnings results from companies like Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

227,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 75 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the year-ago quarter earnings of 77 cents.However, total revenue of $5.25 billion came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.2 billion as well as $4.9 billion recorded in the year-ago period. Strong sales of Opdivo and Eliquis contributed to the top line in the reported quarter.Shares of the company were down 1.9% in pre-market trading, presumably due to the lower-than-expected earnings. Bristol-Myers’ shares have increased 9.5% so far this year, which compares unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 17.8%.Quarterly DetailsRevenues were up 6% year over year when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. Revenues in the United States increased 3% to $2.9 billion and increased 12% outside the United States. Ex-U.S. revenues were up 11% when adjusted for foreign exchange impact.Leukemia drug Sprycel raked in sales of $509 million, up 8% year over year. Melanoma drug Yervoy contributed $323 million to the top line during the reported quarter, up 13%.Opdivo, which is approved for multiple cancer indications, generated revenues of $1.27 billion, up 38% from the year-ago period. The drug received approval for its label expansion in three more indications, which includes hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic colorectal cancer and recurrent gastric cancer.However, the performance of key drugs in the Virology unit continues to disappoint. Sales of Baraclude declined 14% to $264 million. The Reyataz and Sustiva franchises deteriorated 27% and 33% year over year to $174 million and $183 million, respectively..Nevertheless, sales of Eliquis were $1.23 billion during the reported quarter, up 29% year over year. Multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti recorded sales of $60 million, up 46% year over year.Research and development (R&D) expenses in the quarter increased 36% to $1.5 billion mainly due to a charge of $310 million related to acquisition of IFM Therapeutics, while marketing, selling and administrative expenses remained flat at $1.1 billion.Gross margin was 70.1% in the quarter compared with 73.5% in the year-ago quarter due to change in product mix and recognition of an inventory charge.In September 2017, Bristol-Myers completed the acquisition of all outstanding capital stock of IFM and gained full rights to IFM’s preclinical STING and NLRP3 agonist programs, which enhance the body’s immune response for treating cancer. Moreover, the company signed a global collaboration and license agreement with Halozyme Therapeutics for developing subcutaneous administration of its immuno-oncology medicines using Halozyme’s ENHANZE drug delivery technology.During the quarter, Bristol-Myers entered into multiple collaborations to develop Opdivo in combination with two antibody drug conjugates, a PARP inhibitor or tyrosine kinases inhibitor in several tumor types. These include Daiichi Sankyo’s investigational candidate DS-8201, AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) ABBV-399, Exelixis, Inc.’s (EXEL  -  Free Report) Cabometyx and Clovis Oncology, Inc.’s (CLVS  -  Free Report) Rubraca.Pipeline UpdateIn September, Bristol Myers announced data from a phase III study, CheckMate -238, which showed significant improvement in recurrence-free survival in stage IIIb/c or stage IV melanoma treated with Opdivo – Yervoy combination compared to Yervoy alone. Meanwhile, another phase III study, CheckMate -214 was stopped early as Opdivo + Yervoy achieved superior overall survival compared to current standard of care sunitinib. The study was conducted on previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.However, three studies were placed under partial clinical hold evaluating Opdivo-based combinations in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The hold was placed based on risk observed in studies evaluating another anti-PD-1 agent, pembrolizumab, in multiple myeloma patients.2017 Earnings Guidance RevisedBristol-Myers has raised its adjusted earnings expectations for 2017. The company now projects earnings in the range of $2.95 to $3.05 per share (old guidance: $2.90 to $3.00). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.99.Our TakeBristol-Myers missed earnings expectations primarily due to an increase in R&D expenses. However, robust sales of drugs like Opdivo, Eliquis and Yervoy in the quarter drove the top line. The revised 2017 guidance was also encouraging. Meanwhile, we are positive on Bristol-Myers’ efforts to develop its pipeline, especially Opdivo.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

228,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is a New York-based major producer and distributor of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare related products. The company’s key oncology products include Opdivo, Sprycel, Yervoy and the recently launched Empliciti.

The company’s virology portfolio comprises products like Reyataz and the Sustiva franchise.Bristol-Myers is also active on partnership front and pursue strategic acquisitions across therapeutic areas including immunoscience, oncology, fibrosis and genetically defined diseases.However, like many of its peers, Bristol-Myers is facing generic competition for several of its key products.

229,BMY,"The third-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start.  The results of the companies that have reported numbers show that earnings and revenue growth pace is accelerating from the first two quarters. In particular, revenue growth has shown significant momentum as evident from the proportion of positive revenue surprises. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index for the third quarter are expected to be up 3% on 4.9% higher revenues.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 companies which account for 24.7% of index’s total market capitalization have reported results. Results reveal that earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 7.3% increase in revenues. Among these, 71.3% beat earnings estimates while 70.1% beat revenue estimates.Medical Sector PerformanceThe Medical sector has performed relatively well till date and this quarter is not going to be any different as per estimates. Of the 5.4% companies that have reported so far, 66.7% beat on revenues while all the companies surpassed earnings expectations. Going forward, the sector is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.8% in revenues and 1.9% in earnings in Q3.The bellwether of the sector, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results and raised its outlook. Swiss giant Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) too beat on both earnings and sales on the back of new drugs like Cosentyx and Entresto. Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter.Here we have four major biotech giants that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 26. Let's see how things are shaping up for these:Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is expected to beat expectations when it reports after the market closes. Per the Zacks model a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Gilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in two of the last four and missing in two. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 17.4%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%. Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Specifically, Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Genvoya stands at $919 million. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  (Read more: Is Gilead Poised for a Beat This Earnings Season?)Gilead Sciences, Inc.

The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters while missing in the other two, resulting in an average negative surprise of 0.39%.Pfizer’s shares have risen 11.7% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 20.3% for the Zacks classified industry. Factors at PlayNew products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) may contribute to the top line meaningfully.However, loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq Vfend, Zyvox and Celebrex and the expiration of a few co-promotion agreements will continue to hamper top-line growth.Sales of blockbuster drug Enbrel will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The lower sales trend in Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to continue. Sales of Viagra are also likely to be affected by lower demand. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prevnar and Enbrel is $1.47 billion and $565 million, respectively.At the Q2 call, management said that the penetration of Inflectra, Pfizer’s biosimilar version of J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, in the United States has been slower than expected as it is experiencing access challenges among national commercial payers.In fact, in September, Pfizer filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court alleging that J&J wasresorting to unfair practices to prevent sale of Inflectra. Though J&J did not discuss much about Inflectra’s impact on the branded drug’s sales or the lawsuit at its Q3 call, we expect an update from Pfizer at its upcoming investor call.Meanwhile, the bottom line is likely to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks. However, new product launch expenses and R&D investments are expected to hurt profits.Pfizer’s acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) candidate, Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in March 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio was also approved in EU and Japan in September for MCCTwo leukemia treatments - Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were also approved by the FDA in the third quarter of 2017.Besponsa was also approved in the EU in June.We expect management to record sales from these new cancer drugs this quarter.Earlier this month, Pfizer said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. An update on the matter is expected at the investor call.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (65 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (64 cents per share), is +0.94%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Pfizer’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Pfizer, Inc.

232,BMY,"We expect  Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.09%.Merck’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 8.11%Merck’s shares have risen 7.7% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with 20.5% increase for the industry.Factors to ConsiderMerck’s new products like Keytruda (cancer), Zepatier (HCV) and Bridion (sugammadex) Injection are likely to drive the top line this quarter.Keytruda sales in the United States are gaining particularly on the back of strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. The Keytruda development program significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and an additional indication in Europe. Key recent approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo) in lung cancer.The new approvals have expanded the patient population, which is expected to drive sales in the third quarter.However, at the Q2 call, management warned that Zepatier uptake may be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition. Previously, strong underlying demand trends in the United States, Europe, and Japan had supported Zepatier’s sales.The company also faces headwinds in the form of genericization as well as increasing competition and the negative impact of currency exchange.Sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Cubicin (lost patent protection in the United States in June 2016), Zetia (lost market exclusivity in the United States in December 2016) and Vytorin (lost U.S. exclusivity in April 2017) are likely to decline in the quarter.Sluggish growth of the integrase class and continued competitor dynamics in the United States and Europe will continue to affect Isentress’ sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Isentress sales is $306 million for the third quarter.Investors will also be focused on the performance of Merck’s DPP-4 inhibitor – Januvia. Pricing pressure hurt sales of the Januvia/Janumet franchise in the first half.The Vaccines and Animal Health franchises are expected to boost sales this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Vaccines (total) and Animal Health segments is $1.83 billion and $911 million, respectively.At the Q2 call, Merck mentioned a network cyber-attack in June that disrupted its global operations, including manufacturing, research, and sales. At that time, Merck had said that full recovery from the cyber-attack will take some time, which could result in a temporary delay in fulfilling orders of some products (not Keytruda, Zepatier and Januvia) in certain markets. We expect an update on this at the upcoming conference call.Remediation expenses related to the cyber-attack, increased investments behind the ongoing launches and additional R&D costs associated with the new oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca are expected to result in higher operating costs in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Merck is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($1.03 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($1.02 per share), is +0.61%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Merck has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Merck’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Merck & Company, Inc. QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderOther large-cap pharma stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +0.79% and a Zacks Rank #3.

233,BMY,"We expect Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.Year to date, Bristol-Myers’ shares have increased 10.2% while the industry has recorded an increase of 20.5%.Bristol-Myers’ track record has been positive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters and missed expectations in one. The average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters is 7.99%. In the last reported quarter, Bristol-Myers came up with a positive surprise of 1.37%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayBristol-Myers’ high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo is expected to be the primary sales driver in the third quarter. The drug is already approved in multiple cancer indications. During this quarter, the FDA approved the drug for two additional indications – hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic colorectal cancer – in patients who have received prior treatment. Although, these label expansions are not expected to have much impact on the top line, these when combined with the two label expansions in the second quarter will certainly boost sales.Although the second quarter saw some stability in the second-line lung cancer setting, FDA’s approval of Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in May for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC will increase competition and may impact sales unfavorably. The Zacks Consensus Estimates indicates the drug sales to increase 31% from the year-ago quarter to $1.2 billion.In July, the FDA also approved the label expansion of Yervoy injection in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug this quarter is $323 million.Meanwhile, rheumatoid arthritis drug, Orencia, received approval for treating psoriatic arthritis in the United States as well as in Europe in July. Moreover, in June, Bristol-Myers announced the availability of subcutaneous administration option for Orencia in patients with moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The label expansion and new administration option is expected to fuel growth of the drug. The drug, which registered growth of 10% in the previous quarter, is expected to generate sales of $635 million this quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.On the other hand, the decline in the Hepatitis C franchise is expected to continue due to intense competition from multiple drugs including Epclusa whose label was expanded to include HIV co-infection in August. Moreover, the HIV business continues to face competitive pressure. Recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hepatitis C franchise sales is pegged at $108 million this quarter, down 71.5% from year ago quarter.The company is developing its key drug, Opdivo as monotherapy as well as combination therapy for several tumor types in multiple studies, with two label expansion applications under review in the United States. We expect investor focus on updates related to Opdivo in the conference call. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (earnings of 77 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (earnings of 76 cents), stands at +0.79%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Bristol-Myers currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some biotech stocks that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Clovis Oncology, Inc.

234,BMY,"Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) reported sales of CHF39.4 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 5% from the year-ago period. Roche’s stock has gained 7.2% year to date compared with industry’s gain of 23.8%.The company reports results under two divisions: Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.Sales at the Pharmaceuticals division increased 5% driven by strong growth in Tecentriq, Ocrevus, Alecensa and Perjeta which was partially offset by lower sales of Tarceva, Tamiflu and Avastin. Diagnostics division sales climbed 5% primarily on the back of strong immunodiagnostic business.Results In DetailHerceptin sales improved 2% due to increasing demand in the United States and Brazil along with additional reimbursement approvals and broader use in China. Perjeta sales grew 17% following increased demand in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings in Europe, the United States and Brazil. Sales of Kadcyla (+9%) were driven by increasing demand in the international markets.Meanwhile, sales of Avastin decreased due to increasing use of cancer immunotherapy medicines in lung cancer.Sales of Rituxan/MabThera (2%) were driven by growth in oncology as well as in the immunology segments. Growth in Gazyva/Gazyvaro (40%) was strong despite increasing competition in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Recently launched drugs, Tecentriq for bladder cancer and Alecensa for lung cancer are off to a strong start. Tecentriq, Ocrevus and Alecensa contributed CHF 0.9 billion of new sales.Performance of the immunology franchise was driven by increased sales of Actemra/RoActemra (13%), and strong uptake of Esbriet (11%) and Xolair (17%). Increasing use of Actemra/RoActemra as a single agent and in the subcutaneous formulation were the key growth drivers.However, sales of Tarceva declined (17%) due to growing use of other therapeutic options. Sales of Xeloda (2%) continue to be hit by generic competition. Sales of Tamiflu also declined 12%.Revenues at the Diagnostics division climbed 5% on the back of solid performance of the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions (7%) unit, which was in turn, propelled by Immunodiagnostics (13%). Tissue Diagnostics (13%) and Molecular Diagnostics (3%) also performed impressively.However, Diabetes Care sales declined 2% as sales continue to be impacted by challenging market conditions, particularly in North America.2017 Outlook ReiteratedRoche now expect sales to grow in mid-single digits. The company expects core earnings to grow in tandem with sales. The company intends to further increase its dividend in 2017 in local currency.Pipeline ProgressRoche continues to expand cancer immunotherapy drug Tecentriq’s label. Tecentriq was approved in the United States as monotherapy for the treatment of patients suffering locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer who have been previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy or who are considered ineligible for cisplatin chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 status. Arthritis drug RoActemra was approved for the treatment of giant cell arteritis. Gazyvaro in combination with chemotherapy was approved for previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma. The FDA also approved Actemra intravenous injection for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome in patients two years of age and older.Our TakeRoche performance in the first nine months of 2017 was strong driven by contribution from newly launched drugs. The label expansion of key drugs will further drive growth. However, sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline. Generic competition for Xeloda also continues to hurt sales.We note that competition from biosimilars loom large on Roche's key drugs like Herceptin, Avastin and Rituxan. The first biosimilars for MabThera are already in the market. The company expect biosimilars for Herceptin towards 2017 end-early 2018. We note that Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its bisomilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Moreover, Roche is facing stiff competition from the likes of Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in the immuno-oncology space.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

235,BMY,"With the approval of Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, this week saw the approval of the second CAR-T therapy for treating cancer. It is regarded as one of the most advanced immune-oncology treatment options.Moreover, the FDA has granted priority review to label expansion applications for four major cancer drugs. These include AstraZeneca, plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Lynparza for advanced breast cancer and Imfinzi for an earlier stage of lung cancer, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo for melanoma patients with high risk of recurrence and Exelixis, Inc.’s (EXEL  -  Free Report) Cabometyx for advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”).Meanwhile, Ipsen along with its partner, Exelixis, announced positive results from a phase III study on its hepatocellular carcinoma candidate. Moreover, AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) entered into an immuno-oncology research collaboration with Harpoon Therapeutics, focused on novel T-cell recruiting biologic therapies. AbbVie will use Harpoon's tri-specific T-cell activating construct platform for developing its immuno-oncology pipeline.Let’s see the news in details.Key NewsGilead’s acquisition of Kite Pharma for nearly $12 billion has finally paid off with the approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapy candidate. The FDA approved the therapy for treating relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (r/rLBCL) in adults who have received two or more lines of systemic therapy.The various forms of r/rLBCL for which Yescarta is approved include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. This is the second gene therapy to be approved in the United States after Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah, which received approval in August for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.CAR-T therapy is the most advanced form of treating cancer. This is done by modifying the patient’s T-cell, part of the body’s immune system, to fight cancerous cells. The therapy is manufactured specifically for each single patient.Gilead Sciences, Inc.

236,BMY,"We expect GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.94%.Glaxo’s shares are up 6.7% this year so far, underperforming the 20.5% increase witnessed by the industry.Glaxo’s performance has been pretty good so far. The company’s earnings beat expectations thrice in the four trailing quarters while meeting estimates in the remaining quarter. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 8.34%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderGlaxo should continue to see strong performance in its Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business segment.Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to be driven by strong sales of new HIV products, Tivicay and Triumeq. Sales of newly launched respiratory drugs, the Ellipta products and Nucala are expected to offset the declines in Seretide, Advair and Avodart. Many of Glaxo’s key drugs like Lovaza and Avodart are facing declining sales due to generic competition. Importantly, pricing dynamics and competitive pressure are hurting sales of its top-selling drug Advair in the United States while generic competition is hurting Advair sales in Europe. A generic version of Advair in the United States is unlikely to be approved this year.The Vaccines segment will continue benefit from continued uptake of meningitis vaccines, Bexsero and Menveo (acquired from Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report)Importantly, sales growth is slowing in the Consumer Healthcare segment due to a slowdown in market conditions and the impact of divestures. The Consumer Healthcare segment is expected to remain under pressure in the third and the fourth quarters and is not expected to contribute much to sales growth this year.Meanwhile, cost savings from restructuring and continued efficiencies should boost operating profits.In September, Glaxo and partner Innoviva gained FDA approval for their once-daily, single inhaler triple therapy, Trelegy Ellipta, for COPD. The combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (“ICS”), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”), and a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (“LABA”), Trelegy Ellipta will provide patients with a convenient dosing option and is expected to bring in blockbuster sales. We expect management to comment on commercialization plans for this newly approved product at the Q3 conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Glaxo is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise and Glaxo has the right mix.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (85 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (84 cents per share), is +1.80%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Glaxo has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of Glaxo’s Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderOther large-cap pharma stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank includeBristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Oct 26, with an Earnings ESP of +1.05% and a Zacks Rank #3.

237,BMY,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off third quarter earnings season for the pharmaceutical sector on a strong note with the company beating on both earnings and revenues. While focus remained on J&J’s strong earnings results, companies like Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) were also in the news regarding patent litigation.   Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJ&J Q3 Results Impress, Raises Outlook: J&J’s Q3 earnings results were strong with the company beating on both earnings and revenues. All three segments (Consumer, Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals) did well with oncology recording robust growth. Results included contribution from pulmonary hypertension products which became a part of the company’s portfolio following its acquisition of Actelion. Based on solid third quarter results, J&J raised its outlook for the year as well (Read more: J&J Beats on Q3 Earnings, Actelion Buyout Drives Sales).The company has gained 23.3% year to date, compared to the 20.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Sanofi’s Dupixent Tops in Allergic Inflammatory Disease Study: Sanofi and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals announced positive phase II results on Dupixent (dupilumab) in adults with active moderate-to-severe eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic, allergic inflammatory disease. Patients receiving Dupixent weekly reported a significant improvement in the ability to swallow versus placebo (Read more: Sanofi/Regeneron's Dupixent Succeeds in Phase II Study). The market could be huge for Dupixent if it gains timely approval given the lack of any FDA-approved treatments. Dupixent has orphan drug status in the United States for this indication.Dupixent, which has blockbuster potential, is currently approved for eczema and is being evaluated for additional indications apart from eosinophilic esophagitis. In fact, last month, the companies had announced positive top-line data from a late-stage study on Dupixent for uncontrolled persistent asthma.  Regeneron and Sanofi are also collaborating with Aimmune Therapeutics, a clinical-stage company focused on the development of treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. Under the clinical collaboration, Aimmune’s AR101 will be evaluated with adjunctive Dupixent in peanut-allergic patients in a mid-stage study that is scheduled to commence next year. The study will be sponsored by Regeneron while Aimmune will provide clinical supply of AR101 and food challenge materials.Data on Merck’s Keytruda, Priority Review for Lynparza sNDA: Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) presented updated overall survival (“OS”) data on its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of patients suffering from metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with high levels of PD-L1. The company said that the additional six months of available data continued to show a reduction in the risk of death by 37% for Keytruda compared to chemotherapy. Keytruda more than doubled median OS compared to chemotherapy after two years of follow up.Keytruda is a key product in Merck’s portfolio with the drug bringing in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017.Merck and partner AstraZeneca also announced that they have been granted priority review by the FDA for their supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of PARP inhibitor Lynparza tablets in patients with gBRCA, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (“MBC”) who have been previously treated with chemotherapy either in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic settings. A response from the agency is expected in the first quarter of 2018.Novo Nordisk Diabetes Drug Gets FDA Panel Support: Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) got a boost with an FDA advisory panel (the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee) voting unanimously (16-0) in favor of approving once-weekly semaglutide for use in type II diabetes patients. Given the favorable vote, chances of gaining FDA approval look pretty high. On its second quarter call, Novo Nordisk had said that it expects a decision from the FDA by year end. Semaglutide’s approval would be a major positive for the company with the drug expected to be a key growth driver.Novo Nordisk is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Priority Review for BMY Drug Label Expansion: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) immuno-oncology therapy, Opdivo, has been granted priority review by the FDA for label expansion into the treatment of melanoma patients who are at high risk of disease recurrence following complete surgical resection. Opdivo, one of the prioritized brands in Bristol-Myers’ portfolio, brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017 (Read more: Bristol-Myers Gets Priority Review for Opdivo Label Expansion).Adverse Ruling for Allergan in Restasis Patent Litigation: Allergan continues to make headlines related to its blockbuster eye drug, Restasis. This time round, the company announced that it has received an adverse ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas regarding four patents covering the drug. The court found the patents to be invalid. Allergan intends to appeal the ruling and said that the FDA is yet to approve any generic version of the drug. However, ophthalmology-focused company, Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, announced that it is working on making lower-cost alternatives to Restasis available. The company said that initial prescriptions will be 99 cents for a one month supply while refills will start at $79 per month, including shipping.According to Allergan, the Restasis patents are scheduled to expire on Aug 27, 2024. Allergan, which entered into a settlement agreement with a generic challenger recently (InnoPharma), has been adopting different ways to protect Restasis from generic competition. The company came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect the drug from generic competition. Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling drug bringing in sales of almost $1.5 billion in 2016. Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents. The deal has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy-cat versions of expensive drugs.Impax to Combine with Amneal: Specialty pharma company Impax Laboratories  will be merging with privately-held generic company Amneal Pharmaceuticals in an all-stock transaction. With this merger, the combined company will have high-value generic product pipelines and a growing specialty business. The deal is expected to boost Impax’s stand-alone earnings per share in the first 12 months and generate double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth over the three years following the close of the transaction. Annual cost synergies of about $200 million are expected to be achieved within three years. The merger is expected to go through in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Impax Laboratories and Amneal Pharmaceuticals Agree to Merge).PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 1% this week with the sector reacting positively to J&J’s Q3 results.

238,BMY,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first large-cap pharma stock to report its earnings results for this season on Oct 17. J&J beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in the third quarter and also raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook. Shares of J&J were up more than 3% on Tuesday.J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the third quarter leading the company to post its first positive sales surprise after almost a year. Higher sales in the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from the Actelion deal pulled up the top line in the quarter. J&J acquired Swiss biotech Actelion in June this year for $30 billion.Overall, the pharma sector has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year.After declining 5.2% last year, the Large Cap Pharma industry has risen 18.2% this year so far, outpacing 14.2% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.New product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals (11 new drugs approved in Q3 alone) and continued strong performance of legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year.These factors are likely to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs.J&J’s better-than-expected results, especially the strong performance of its Pharmaceuticals segment, have raised optimism for another strong quarterly performance by the pharma sector, mainly the large-cap companies.Let’s have a closer look at what to expect from six big pharma stocks when they report this month/early next month. Five out of the six companies are expected to deliver earnings beat this quarter.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)Pfizer is scheduled to announce third-quarter results on Oct 31 before the market opens. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of +1.04%, the chances of the stock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.New products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are expected to contribute to Pfizer’s top line meaningfully. However, the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq Vfend, Zyvox and Celebrex and the expiration of a few co-promotion agreements will continue to hamper top-line growth. Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales will continue to be soft in the quarter due to biosimilar competition.Pfizer surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pfizer, Inc. QuoteBristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report)Bristol-Myers is scheduled to release results on Oct 26 before the market opens. Similar to Pfizer, our quantitative model indicates an earnings beat for Bristol-Myers. This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.05%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bristol-Myers’ high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, is likely to drive the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Opdivo’s U.S. sales are driven by the melanoma, second-line non-small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma indications.Recent label expansions into the classical Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck cancer indications will also boost the drug’s sales.Bristol-Myers outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteMerck & Company, Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report)Merck is scheduled to release results on Oct 27 before the market opens. With a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +0.61%, the chances of the stock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter is high.Merck’s new products like Keytruda (cancer), Zepatier (HCV) and Bridion (sugammadex) Injection will likely drive revenues this quarter as well. Keytruda sales in the United States are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. The Keytruda development program significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and an additional indication in Europe. The new approvals expand the patient population and are expected to drive sales further.However, genericization and increasing competition will likely remain overhangs.Merck outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Merck & Company, Inc. QuoteGlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report)Brentford, UK-based GlaxoSmithKline is expected to report results on Oct 25. GlaxoSmithKline is also expected to outperform in the third quarter due to its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Earnings ESP of +1.80%.Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business segments are expected to perform well. Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to continue being driven by strong sales of new HIV products, Tivicay and Triumeq.However, many of Glaxo’s key drugs like Lovaza and Avodart are facing declining sales due to generic competition. Moreover, sluggish sales growth in the Consumer Healthcare segment due to a slowdown in market conditions and the impact of divestures may negatively impact the top line in the third quarter.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteEli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Eli Lillyis slated to announce third-quarter results on Oct 24 before the market opens. With a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +0.07%, the chances of an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter is high.Continuing the trend of the past few quarters, new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz and Jardiance are likely to support the top line in the reported quarter.However, sluggish performance of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to continue in the third quarter due to the loss of exclusivity.Notably, Eli Lilly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteNovartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report)Swiss company, Novartis is scheduled to report its results on Oct 24, before market opens. Novartis is not expected to beat estimates in the third quarter due its Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.40%.The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis, given the potential in the CAR T therapy space. Moreover, new products like Cosentyx and Entresto are expected to boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market share from rivals like AbbVie’s Humira and Amgen’s Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016.However, a weak Alcon business and generic competition for several of its key drugs is expected to hurt revenues in this quarter.Notably, Novartis outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG QuoteThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

239,BMY,"We expect Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.60%.Biogen’s shares have risen 21.4% this year, better than the industry’s growth of 12.4% in the same time frame.Biogen’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far, having delivered a positive surprise in each of the last four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 6.41%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderGlobal patient growth is driving prescription trends and sales of Biogen’s MS drugs. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter. However, rising competition from Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) newly launched MS drug Ocrevus may hurt sales of Tysabri modestly as in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus estimate for key MS drugs, Tysabri and Tecfidera are $479 million and $1.08 billion, respectively.Meanwhile, the combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy will continue to decline with patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Spinraza, approved for spinal muscular atrophy in December 2016, witnessed faster-than-anticipated adoption in the United States in the first half backed by robust underlying demand. In June/July, Spinraza was approved in the EU, Canada and Japan, which should boost sales in Q3. However, at the Q2 call, management had mentioned that Spinraza U.S. sales may slow in the second half, as more difficult-to-treat patients are coming on and patient transition from intensive Spinraza treatment during induction to a less intensive maintenance schedule.Biogen’s biosimilar products — Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) — are also generating higher revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.Headcount reduction and restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to lower operating expenses. Meanwhile, R&D expenses are expected to increase due to increased business development payments.Investor focus will remain on Tecfidera’s scrip trends, sales rampup of Spinraza, pipeline progress and acquisition plans.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Biogen is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise and Biogen has the right mix.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($5.72 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($5.68 per share), is +0.71%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Biogen has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Biogen’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Biogen Inc.

240,BMY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.73%.Lilly’s shares have risen 17% this year so far while the industry recorded an increase of 18.2%.Lilly’s performance has been mixed with earnings missing expectations in two of the last four quarters while beating the same in the other two, bringing the average negative surprise to 0.89%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderNew products like Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance have supported the top line in the past few quarters. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter of 2017 as well. While Trulicity sales are expected to be driven by growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains, Jardiance sales are likely to be driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class. Newer products like Basaglar, Lartruvo and Taltz may continue to witness better sequential sales backed by strong launch uptake.However, sales of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to decline due to the loss of exclusivity. Cymbalta has lost exclusivity in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries outside the United States. Meanwhile, lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents is hurting Alimta sales in the country. The consensus estimate for Alimta for the third quarter is $508 million.Another new drug Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries. In July, the drug was approved in Japan, which is likely to add to the top line in the third quarter. However, in the United States, the drug is under review. In August, Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted in January next year.Meanwhile, older products like Humulin, Trajenta and Forteo may continue to do well.Animal Health segment sales, in the past two quarters, have been hurt by global competitive pressure. At the Q2 conference call, management had said that the global competitive pressure will continue to hurt revenues in the segment through the rest of the year, though to a lesser extent. The consensus estimate for Animal Health segment for the third quarter is $715 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.14%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteStocks to ConsiderStocks in the pharmaceuticals sector that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank includeBristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Oct 26, with an Earnings ESP of +2.35% and a Zacks Rank #3.

241,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) extended its strategic partnership with TARGET PharmaSolutions, Inc. The partnership has been extended for TARGET-NASH for a multi-year deal.We note that both companies announced two new collaborations in Nov 2016 for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The TARGET model is designed to provide pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners access to a robust disease state registry that is also linked to a biorepository and patient reported outcomes and provides unique data and insights compared to typical patient registries.TARGET-NASH, a longitudinal observational study is evaluating patients suffering from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Having enroled 2,364 patients at 55 sites, the study is collecting retrospective and prospective data from enroled patients and is developing a biorepository which its stakeholders can access for translational studies (including those of genomics and biomarkers).   Bristol-Myers’ stock has rallied 25.3% in the last six months compared with the industry’s rally of 14.3% gain.Bristol-Myers already has a mid-stage candidate in the NASH space. BMS-986036, an investigational pegylated analogue of human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a key regulator of metabolism, in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F1-F3) achieved its primary endpoint of significant reduction in liver fat versus placebo in April. The company was entitled the rights to research, develop and commercialize BMS-986036 from Ambrx, Inc.A chronic liver disease, NASH is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver which in turn is known as steatosis. NASH is known to affect up to 15 million people in the United Stated and can lead to inflammation, hepatocellular injury, progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. It is expected to be the leading cause for liver transplantation by 2020. Notably, it is currently the leading cause of liver transplants for people under 50 in the United States.Other major companies with promising candidates for NASH include Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

242,BMY,"Companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) were in the news this week – while Pfizer is mulling strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business, Merck said that it will not file its CETP inhibitor.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPfizer to Divest Consumer Healthcare Segment? Pfizer is currently reviewing different strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business which includes a full or partial separation via a spin off or sale. The company could also ultimately decide to retain the business. This is not the first time that Pfizer has decided to spin off or sell a non-core business segment. Some of the strategic steps taken by Pfizer include the sale of the Hospira infusion systems business to ICU Medical (February 2017), the spin-off of the animal health business that led to the creation of Zoetis (2013) as well as the divestment of the nutrition business to Nestle in 2012. Before that, Pfizer had sold off its Capsugel business to an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.The divestment of the Consumer Healthcare business would help Pfizer focus on its Innovative Health segment and would also bring in funds that the company could use for returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends (Read more: Pfizer Considering Sale/Spin-Off of Consumer Healthcare Unit).Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The company has gained 11.9% year to date, compared to the 18.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Merck Collaborates with KalVista: Clinical-stage pharma company, KalVista Pharmaceuticals saw its shares shoot up 38.6% on a collaboration agreement with Merck for KVD001 and future oral diabetic macular edema (“DME”) compounds based on plasma kallikrein inhibition.KVD001, an investigational intravitreal (IVT) injection, is scheduled to move into a phase II proof-of-concept study later this year. Merck has the option to acquire rights to the candidate following the completion of the study. Merck has a similar option for certain other DME candidates.KalVista will receive a non-refundable upfront payment of $37 million as well as payments associated with the exercise of the options by Merck and the achievement of milestones for each program that could add up to $715 million. The company also stands to receive tiered royalties on net sales for candidates commercialized under the deal. Merck also acquired a 9.9% ownership stake in KalVista worth $9.1 million. Another Pipeline Setback for Lilly: Lilly suffered a setback with its recently approved breast cancer drug, Verzenio, failing to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage study in KRAS-mutated, advanced non-small cell lung cancer.  While the CDK4 and 6 inhibitor failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”), an analysis of the secondary endpoints of progression-free survival (“PFS”) and overall response rate (“ORR”) showed evidence of monotherapy activity (Read more: Lilly's Verzenio Fails in Phase III Lung Cancer Study).Meanwhile, Verzenio has been granted priority review by the FDA for use in the initial treatment of advanced breast cancer. This means a response from the agency should be out within eight months of receiving the regulatory application instead of the usual timeframe of 12 months.J&J Seeks FDA Nod for New Prostate Cancer Treatment: Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Biotech is seeking FDA approval for apalutamide, an investigational, next generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor for men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”). There is significant unmet need for this patient population given the absence of FDA approved treatments for these patients.Prostate cancer, the most common cancer among American men, is expected to be diagnosed in more than 161,000 men in 2017, as per the American Cancer Society.Apalutamide became a part of J&J’s pipeline following its 2013 acquisition of privately-held Aragon Pharmaceuticals. Apalutamide’s approval would strengthen and expand J&J’s presence in the prostate cancer market – the company currently sells Zytiga, which is approved for use in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”). J&J is looking to expand Zytiga’s label into earlier stages of metastatic prostate cancer.Allergan Settles Restasis Litigation with InnoPharma: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) entered into a settlement agreement with InnoPharma related to litigation regarding Restasis patents. The challenged patents are listed in the Orange Book and are scheduled to expire on Aug 27, 2024.Under the settlement agreement, InnoPharma can start selling a generic version of the eye drug in the United States from Feb 24, 2024 or earlier under certain circumstances. Moreover, under certain circumstances, InnoPharma will be allowed to launch an authorized generic version of Restasis on Aug 28, 2024.Allergan is adopting different ways of protecting Restasis from generic competition. The company recently came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect the blockbuster eye drug from generic competition. Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling drug bringing in sales of almost $1.5 billion in 2016. Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents. In fact, the Tribe is filing to dismiss the ongoing inter partes review (“IPR”) of the Restasis patents based on their sovereign immunity from IPR challenges.The deal with the Tribe has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy-cat versions of expensive drugs. Allergan has been asked by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to provide certain documents and information about the deal by Oct 17, 2017.Merck Will Not File Anacetrapib: Merck has decided that it will not seek regulatory approval for its investigational CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib. The company’s decision was based on a thorough review of the clinical profile of the drug. We note that Merck is not the first company to drop a CETP inhibitor from its plans. Companies like Lilly, Roche and Pfizer have all had high profile setbacks with their CETP inhibitors and the class was more or less written off (Read more: Merck Will Not Seek Approval for CETP Inhibitor Anacetrapib).CRL for AcelRx’s Dsuvia: AcelRx Pharmaceuticals’s (ACRX  -  Free Report) shares plunged 59.8% with the company getting a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for Dsuvia (sufentanil sublingual tablet). The FDA said that it cannot approve the regulatory application in its current form and has asked for additional safety data. The agency has also asked the company to make certain changes to the Directions for Use to ensure the proper administration of the tablet. AcelRx has been asked to validate the same through a human factors study. AcelRx is looking to get Dsuvia approved for the reduction of moderate-to-severe acute pain and dosing errors associated with IV administration via its non-invasive single-dose applicator (“SDA”) in medically supervised settings.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 0.5% this week.

243,BMY,"Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INFI  -  Free Report) announced that it has expanded its existing clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) for evaluating IPI-549 in combination with  latter’s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo. The collaboration will include patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), who have not been previously exposed to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy.Very few patients with triple negative breast cancer respond to checkpoint inhibitors alone and so they are left with very limited therapeutic options. Thus expanding the collaboration to include patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), who have not been previously exposed to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. This, in turn, will enable Infinity to test whether IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo can increase the number of patients who respond to checkpoint inhibition.Markedly, IPI-549 is the lead pipeline candidate of Infinity Pharmaceuticals and is being evaluated in a phase I/Ib study for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. It is an orally administered treatment that selectively inhibits phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-gamma.In November 2016, Infinity entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers to evaluate IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo in patients with advanced solid tumors.Meanwhile, Opdivo is approved for varied indications in the EU and the United States.  Also, it has received approvals for several indications including melanoma, head and neck, lung, kidney and blood cancer.However, Infinity’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been down 10.4%, as against the industry’s gain of 2.1% in the same time frame.It should be noted that the phase I/Ib study evaluates IPI-549 as a monotherapy and in combination with Opdivo in about 200 patients with advanced solid tumors. Patient enrollment is complete in monotherapy dose-escalation, and monotherapy expansion is ongoing. Combination dose-escalation is also ongoing, and its expansion is expected to begin in the second half of 2017.Markedly, the combination expansion component comprise multiple cohorts designed to evaluate IPI-549 in patients with specific types of cancer that include patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) whose tumors show initial resistance or subsequently develop resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Additionally, it will also have a cohort of patients with TNBC who have not been previously exposed to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

244,BMY,"Key highlights in the pharma sector include a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) investigational rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) treatment and FDA approval for Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) cancer drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCRL for J&J RA Drug: J&J’s Janssen Biotech got a CRL from the FDA for sirukumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA. The agency has asked for additional data on the safety of sirukumab. This does not come as a surprise considering the investigational treatment failed to get the support of an FDA advisory panel last month. Given the safety concerns raised by the panel, the request for additional data was more or less expected. J&J intends to meet with the agency to determine the requirements for gaining approval for the IL-6 inhibitor.Meanwhile, the company has submitted a new drug application (“NDA”) for the first darunavir-based single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV. Approval would make this combination the only complete regimen with the potential to deliver the advantages of a single table regimen with the high genetic barrier to resistance of darunavir and the demonstrated safety profile of TAF.Another FDA Nod for Merck’s Keytruda: Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, has gained FDA approval for yet another indication. The cancer therapy, which is already available for a wide range of indications, can now be used in previously-treated patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1. This marks the tenth new indication for Keytruda over a three-year period.Keytruda is a key product in Merck’s portfolio with the drug bringing in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017. The company is working on expanding the label of the drug which is currently in more than 550 studies covering a wide range of cancers and treatment settings (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Gets FDA Nod for Advanced Gastric Cancer).Merck is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

This comes shortly after the company completed a $15 billion share buyback program. Allergan also reaffirmed its commitment to increase its cash dividend every year while reiterating its commitment to maintaining investment grade credit ratings and paying down $3.75 billion of debt in 2018.The company also announced the departure of Tessa Hilado, executive vice president and chief financial officer (""CFO""), who will be retiring from the company once a successor is appointed.Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo Gets Another Approval: Bristol-Myers also gained approval for another indication for its immune-oncology therapy, Opdivo. With the latest approval, Opdivo can now be used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma patients previously treated with Nexavar (sorafenib). This makes Opdivo the first and only immuno-oncology agent to be approved for this patient population (Read more: Bristol-Myers Opdivo Gets Approval for Liver Cancer).The company also gained approval in Japan for the use of Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer which has progressed after chemotherapy. Gastric cancer is highly prevalent in Asian countries and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in Japan.Bristol-Myers also entered into a clinical trial collaboration with AbbVie under which a combination of Opdivo and AbbVie’s investigational antibody drug conjugate ABBV-399 will be evaluated in c-met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Bristol-Myers stock has gained 8.1% year to date, compared to the 17.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Priority Review for Aradigm Drug: Aradigm got priority review for Linhaliq for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE) patients with chronic infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). A response from the agency regarding the approval status of the drug should be out by Jan 26, 2018. NCFBE, a severe, chronic and rare disease, affects more than 150,000 people in the United States and over 200,000 people in Europe. With no drug currently approved for the treatment of this condition, there is significant unmet need.

245,BMY,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) entered into a deal to evaluate the combination of AbbVie's investigational antibody drug conjugate, ABBV-399, and Bristol-Myers Squibb's immune-oncology drug, Opdivo (nivolumab), in c-Met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Currently, the combination is in a phase I study that evaluates the patients for second line treatment who have failed one prior line of chemotherapy. But the specific terms of the deal were not disclosed. Notably, AbbVie is the sponsor conducting the trial.AbbVie’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 39.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 17% in the same time frame.We remind investors that Opdivo is approved for varied indications in the EU and the United States. The drug has also received approvals for several indications including melanoma, head and neck, lung, kidney and blood cancer.ABBV-399 is an anti-c-Met antibody drug conjugate that targets both MET-amplified and c-Met-overexpressing tumors. It is currently being developed to treat advanced solid tumors.In fact, Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions. Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug, significantly.  Markedly, Opdivo is being studied in combination with Bristol-Myers’ other drug Yevroy.  In the melanoma indication, the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen is contributing to growth in both Opdivo and Yervoy. Also, the drug became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy – classical Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In the second quarter of 2017, Opdivo generated revenues of $1.19 billion, up 42% from the year-ago period.AbbVie Inc.

246,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved immuno-oncology drug Opdivo for intravenous use for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with  Nexavar.The approval for this indication was granted under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response.However, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.Per estimates, HCC is the most common type of liver cancer and the fastest-growing cause of cancer death in the U.S.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classic Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016). In November 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.  Bristol-Myers’ stock has rallied 10.7% year to date compared with the industry’s 20.0% gain.Label expansion into additional indications might give the product access to more patients and increase the commercial potential of the drug.Additionally, the company entered into a collaboration agreement with Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) in June 2017. Per the deal, Bristol-Myers will evaluate the combination of Opdivo and Seattle Genetics’ antibody drug conjugate (ADC)Adcetris in a phase III trial as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory or transplant-ineligible advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).However, Bristol-Myers suffered a setback in January 2017 when it decided not to pursue the accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the United States based on a review of available data.Currently, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.Meanwhile, the FDA put a partial clinical hold on three clinical trials — CA209602 (CheckMate-602), CA209039 (CheckMate-039) and CA204142. The trials are investigating Opdivo-based combinations in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

247,BMY,"Key highlights this week include a lawsuit filed by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) accusing Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) of adopting exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices to prevent biosimilar uptake. Meanwhile, companies like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN  -  Free Report) were in the news for regulatory/pipeline updates.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesSupernus Down on Study Update: Supernus provided an update on the first phase III study on SPN-810 which is being evaluated for the treatment of impulsive aggression (“IA”) in patients aged 6 to 12 years who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”). Based on a planned interim analysis, the company has decided to drop the lower dose of 18 mg from the study and patients will be randomized to receive either the 36 mg dose or placebo. Investors were disappointed by the update and shares were down 23.4% (Read more: Supernus Drops SPN-810's Lower Dose Test in Phase III Trials).  CHMP Positive on J&J Psoriasis Drug: J&J’s Tremfya (guselkumab) got a positive opinion in the EU with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) recommending marketing authorization for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy.Timely approval would make Tremfya the first biologic that selectively blocks interleukin (IL)-23, a cytokine that plays a key role in plaque psoriasis. According to information in the press release, about 14 million people across Europe are estimated to suffer from psoriasis.Tremfya gained FDA approval earlier this year in July.Pfizer Files Suit against J&J for Biosimilars: Pfizer has filed a lawsuit against J&J in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania related to providing patient and physician access to lower cost biosimilars. According to the lawsuit, J&J has adopted exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices to deny access to and undermine the benefits of price competition in the biologics market. In order to maintain its monopoly in connection with Remicade (infliximab), J&J was accused in the lawsuit of inappropriately excluding biosimilar competitors. Pfizer had launched Inflectra, its biosimilar version of Remicade, in late 2016.

The company announced the sale of the remaining assets in its specialty global women’s health portfolio. The planned divestiture of this segment will bring in total proceeds of $2.48 billion which will be used by Teva to pay down debt. The decision to sell the women’s health business is part of Teva’s efforts to divest its non-core segments and focus on its key strategic areas. The company also announced amendments to its USD and JPY term loan and revolving credit facilities. Teva is currently going through tough times with the company being hit by generic pricing erosion.

248,BMY,"Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has put a partial clinical hold on a phase Ib and phase I/II b trials evaluating Tecentriq, due to safety issues.A partial hold was put due to emerging safety data from clinical trials evaluating Merck & Co (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in combination with Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid and Pomalyst. We note that the FDA had put a hold on several trials in the FUSION program by Celgene.The FDA is currently evaluating all ongoing blood cancer trials investigating an anti-PD1/PDL1 drug in combination with an immunomodulatory drug in order determine if it is a class-wide (anti-PD1/PDL1) concern in multiple myeloma/blood cancers or a specific concern with certain combinations with immunomodulatory drugs.The two studies include cohorts evaluating Tecentriq in combination with an immunomodulatory medicine (IMiDs) in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma.As a result of the partial clinical hold, patients who are currently enroled in these trials and are deriving clinical benefit may continue to receive treatment, but no additional patients will be enroled.We note that the FDA granted accelerated approval to immuno-oncology drug, Tecentriq in May 2016 for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Initial uptake of the drug has been encouraging. In October 2016, Tecentriq became the first and only anti-PDL1 cancer immunotherapy to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC.The FDA recently granted accelerated approval to Tecentriq for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy. The drug was previously approved for patients suffering from locally advanced or mUC who have disease progression during or following any platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of receiving chemotherapy before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant).The news comes as a disappointment as label expansion of the drug will boost sales. Roche’s stock has gained 14.1% against the industry’s gain of 19.4% in the year so far. Earlier, the FDA also put a partial clinical hold on Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) three clinical trials — CA209602 (CheckMate-602), CA209039 (CheckMate-039) and CA204142 for the same reason.

249,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) recently entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. (HALO  -  Free Report).Per the agreement, Bristol-Myers will use Halozyme’s ENHANZE drug delivery technology. This will facilitate subcutaneous administration of Bristol-Myers’ immuno-oncology drugs.ENHANZE technology is based on a proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme (rHuPH20) that temporarily degrades hyaluronan (chain of natural sugars in the body) to enable dispersion and absorption of other injected therapeutic drugs.Per the terms of the agreement, Bristol-Myers will pay an initial $105 million to use ENHANZE technology. The company has also designated multiple immuno-oncology targets including programmed death 1 (PD-1) and has an option to select additional targets within five years from the effective date. The collaboration may extend to a maximum of 11 targets. Halozyme is entitled to milestone payments of up to $160 million for each nominated collaboration targets and additional milestone payments for combination products. Moreover, Bristol-Myers is also required to pay Halozyme royalties on drugs using the ENHANZE technology developed under the collaboration.For Bristol-Myers, the transaction is expected to have a dilutive impact on the bottom line in 2017 and 2018 by approximately one cent and by 5 cents in 2019.In addition, Halozyme licensed ENHANZE technology to Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) for exclusive development of an undisclosed therapeutic target.  Per the terms of this deal, Halozyme will receive $30 million initially with the potential to earn milestone payments of up to $160 million subject to the achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. Halozyme will also receive tiered, mid-single digit royalties on sales of commercialized products.Concurrent to these deals, the company raised its sales guidance. Shares of Halozyme were up 21% following the news.Meanwhile, the news bodes well for Bristol-Myers’ too. We note that Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classic Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016). Label expansion into additional indications might give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug. The company had earlier suffered a setback in January 2017 when it decided not to pursue the accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the United States based on a review of available data. Currently, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States.

250,BMY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results from a phase III study, CheckMate -238, on Opdivo.CheckMate 238 is an ongoing phase III, randomized double-blind study of Opdivo versus Yervoy in patients who have undergone complete resection of stage IIIb/c or stage IV melanoma. Results from the study showed that Opdivo 3 mg/kg led to a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to Yervoy (ipilimumab) 10 mg/kg in patients with stage IIIb/c or stage IV melanoma following complete surgical resection.The results from the planned interim analysis showed that Opdivo met its primary endpoint, with a statistically significant improvement of 35% in RFS compared to Yervoy.In July 2017, the company reported positive results from the same study.Last week, the company reported positive results from a phase III study that evaluated Opdivo plus Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and met its co-primary endpoint.  The study showed superior overall survival compared to current standard of care, Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. Based on a planned interim analysis, an independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the study must be stopped early.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classic Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016). In November 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Label expansion into additional indications might give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug. However, Bristol-Myers suffered a setback in January 2017 when it decided not to pursue the accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the United States based on a review of available data.Currently, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.Meanwhile, the FDA put a partial clinical hold on three clinical trials — CA209602 (CheckMate-602), CA209039 (CheckMate-039) and CA204142. The trials are investigating Opdivo-based combinations in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Bristol-Myers’ stock has gained 7.5% in the year to date against the industry’s 14.5% gain.The FDA put these studies on hold due to risks identified in Keytruda, another anti–PD-1 agent, in patients with multiple myeloma.In addition, concerns from AstraZeneca PLC’s (AZN  -  Free Report) failed study on lung cancer drug Imfinzi loom large on the company’s CheckMate 227 study on Opdivo.Zacks RankBristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

252,BMY,"Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) gained about 5% after the company ended its phase III combination study, CheckMate-214, earlier than expected after it met its co- primary endpoint.The phase III study evaluated Opdivo plus Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and met its co-primary endpoint.  The study showed superior overall survival (OS) compared to current standard of care sunitinib (marketed as Sutent by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in intermediate- and poor-risk patients.In fact, the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy also met the secondary endpoint of improved overall survival in all randomized patients. Based on a planned interim analysis, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that the study be stopped early. But the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment observed in the study was consistent with previous reports of this dosing schedule and similar across subgroups.In August 2017, Bristol-Myers announced top-line results from CheckMate-214 study, where the study met the co-primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR).  Markedly, the co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival favored the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy versus sunitinib but did not reach statistical significance.Bristol-Myers’ shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been down 7.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 10.2% in the same time frame.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classic Hodgkin lymphoma — in the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.In fact, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults and has a huge unmet medical need. Thus, label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug.Additionally, the company entered into a collaboration agreement with Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) in June 2017. Per the deal, Bristol-Myers will evaluate the combination of Opdivo and Seattle Genetics’ antibody drug conjugate (ADC) Adcetris in a phase III trial as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory or transplant-ineligible advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).However, Bristol-Myers suffered a setback in January 2017 when it decided not to pursue the accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the United States based on a review of available data.Currently, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States.

253,BMY,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and partner Neurocrine Biosciences announced that the new drug application (NDA) for their pipeline candidate, elagolix, has been submitted to the FDA. AbbVie is looking to get elagolix approved as an oral medicine for the management of pain associated with endometriosis.The NDA filing is supported by positive results from two replicate pivotal phase III trials evaluating elagolix, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, in this indication. The detailed data from the study, presented in October last year, showed that treatment with elagolix resulted in statistically significant reductions in menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared to placebo. Data from the studies also demonstrated superiority compared to placebo in reducing painful intercourse associated with endometriosis.Endometriosis affects an estimated one in 10 women of reproductive age and is associated with pain symptoms. At present there is no cure for endometriosis. The pain associated with endometriosis is currently managed with oral contraceptives, progestins, danazol, NSAIDS, opioids, and GnRH agonists. Many of these medicines are not specifically indicated for the treatment of endometriosis.So far this year, AbbVie’s share price has increased 23%, comparing favorably with a gain of 11.8% recorded by the industry.Elagolix is also being evaluated in phase III studies for reducing heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids. Data from the pivotal study is expected by end of 2017Apart from elagolix, AbbVie has several candidates in different stages of development across a wide range of therapeutic areas and has partnerships with companies like Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report), Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report).AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
