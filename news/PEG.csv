0,PEG,"PSE&G, New Jersey's largest utility, reached a settlement with regulators to replace hundreds of miles of decaying gas pipes and raise customer rates.The agreement gives the company some clarity in its capital spending plans and on its revenue projections. PSE&G is a subsidiary of Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG), which says it is the nation's largest utility company. Staff of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and other agencies approved the $1.875 billion settlement, and it now needs final approval from the public utilities board.PSE&G will replace 875 miles of gas mains throughout its service area and make other improvements to its gas system over a five-year period. Cast iron and unprotected steel gas mains will give way to plastic pipes that are less likely to leak or release methane gas, the company said.Also in the agreement is an increase in rates. The typical residential customer will see a rate hike of less than 2%, or about $17, per year over the five-year program.The stock of its parent PSEG is forming a shallow base with a possible 53.38 buy point. Shares have been more volatile than usual this year, but the chart is otherwise in good shape. The utility sector climbed Tuesday as investors sought havens, even while higher bond yields hurt dividend plays.Utilities like PSEG aren't known for making big moves, but they reward investors with dividends. PSEG pays a quarterly dividend of 45 cents a share, for an annualized yield of 3.6%. The company raises the dividend regularly and it's up from 36 cents a share five years ago.The company will announce first-quarter earnings Monday morning. Analysts expect earnings of 99 cents a share, up 8%, on revenue of $2.91 billion, an increase of 12%.The five-year earnings growth rate is 4%.RELATED:Will Bitcoin Boost U.S. Utilities, Renewable Energy Developers?A Pipeline To Profit From The Other Energy Stocks: PlasticsWill More Utility Stocks Form This Bullish Chart Pattern?

1,PEG,"Before two fatal self-driving-car accidents over the last few weeks, the big event this year for autonomous vehicles was supposed to be Waymo's launch of a paid ride-sharing service in Phoenix.Waymo, a stand-alone unit of Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) since late 2016, is far ahead in the race toward autonomous cars and planned to be first to market with a commercial robotaxi service. If the Phoenix rollout were to go smoothly later this year, it could boost Waymo's value — some put it as high as $125 billion — as well as light a fire under Alphabet stock.Now the accidents have cast doubt on whether the self-driving car can become the future of personal transport.Waymo Chief Executive John Krafcik recently said, ""We're building a bridge to trust."" But now he faces an uphill battle in convincing the public that computer-operated cars are safer than human drivers.And the outlook for self-driving cars overall suddenly seems opaque. Companies racing to build autonomous cars —  including Waymo, Tesla (TSLA), General Motors (GM), Aptiv (APTV), Ford (F) and Daimler (DDAIF) — could go under even more scrutiny when seeking government approval to test self-driving cars on public roads.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Uber Technologies crash that killed pedestrian Elaine Herzberg on March 18 occurred in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe, not far from where Waymo plans to launch its service. A federal probe of the crash could take a year, and in the interim, Uber has suspended some of its self-driving-car tests.The National Transportation Safety Board also is investigating the crash of a 2017 Tesla Model X just five days later. The driver, Wei Huang, was killed when the vehicle hit a concrete lane divider in the Silicon Valley community of Mountain View, Calif. Tesla has confirmed the car's autopilot system was engaged at the time. Auto-pilot systems are not the same as driverless vehicles that do not require human input but Tesla is a high-profile developer of the self-driving car.But now that probe could be delayed as well since Tesla was removed Wednesday by the NTSB from actively participating in the investigation for making unauthorized public statements.Bullish analysts are buying what Krafcik has to say, however. They peg Waymo's long-term valuation at anywhere from $41 billion to $125 billion. Those estimates assume Waymo will license its technology to automakers, offer a consumer robotaxi service or find other ways to monetize its driverless system.""The planned launch of a ride-hailing program in Arizona in 2018 puts Waymo on a clearer path to monetization,"" Doug Anmuth, a JPMorgan analyst, said in a recent note to clients. ""We believe the value of Waymo is underrepresented in Alphabet (stock).""Speaking at a National Automobile Dealers Association meeting a few days after the Tempe crash, Krafcik said the Uber ""car had technology representing the self-driving space."" Krafcik said that a Waymo vehicle, which employs different technology, would have avoided hitting a pedestrian in a similar situation.Waymo has been the chief exponent of self-driving cars. The company has launched consumer education campaigns in conjunction with Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups.Krafcik pointed out at last month's South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, that some 1.25 million people die each year in car accidents worldwide. Self-driving cars will cut that number down, he predicted.So Waymo is forging ahead in Phoenix and elsewhere. The company announced in late March it will buy 20,000 luxury electric cars starting in 2020 from Jaguar Land Rover to expand its self-driving-car services. Parent Alphabet will foot the bill.Waymo's driverless Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans have logged more than 5 million miles in parts of 25 cities without a fatality. By comparison, Uber's cars had traveled roughly 2 million miles before the fatal crash. Was Waymo just lucky, or is its autonomous technology superior?In Phoenix, Waymo's minivans achieved an industry first by operating over public roads without a human driver available to take over in an emergency. Local residents that joined the early-rider program were given free trips.Waymo last week filed an application in California to expand its its self-driving car program — without human supervisors — in that state.While Waymo leads the industry by far with its 5 million test miles on the self-driving car, observers say it could take tens of billions of test miles before regulators allow autonomous vehicles to be widely deployed. In the wake of the Uber crash, it's not clear whether a self-driving car needs to be merely safer than humans, or nearly perfect.Surveys show that consumers fret about software malfunctions. They also worry that hackers could take over autonomous vehicles and create a demolition derby on city streets.A self-driving car relies on a mix of technologies to pinpoint location, understand surroundings, and predict what things around it will do.Waymo's strengths in artificial-intelligence software, custom-built laser scanning gear and 3D digital mapping technology have made it an early leader. Its stated goal: create the world's most experienced driver.To do that, it plans to continually improve computer algorithms for the self-driving car. These are the artificial-intelligence software programs that aim to replicate the human ability to learn, reason and make decisions.Waymo takes a methodical approach. It's collecting rich data in urban areas and taking in details like the height of curbs, the width of intersections and the precise location of traffic lights and stop signs. That could take years.""The scalability of automated driving is what's in question,"" said Roger Lanctot, analyst at Strategy Analytics. ""Waymo is on a path to brute-forcing its way, city by city, to achieving true autonomy. They're refining the process, trying to shorten the time, of adding a city to the deployment plan.""Approaches differ. Waymo is betting on laser-beam scanning to provide high-resolution 3D imaging. It also has radar for measuring distances and velocity, and advanced cameras to identify signs and traffic lights. Car-roof-mounted laser systems also provide Waymo cars with 360-degree views.For now, Tesla has opted not to use lasers, by far the most costly autonomous technology. Tesla uses cameras, radar and ultrasonic sensors. Its ""Level 2"" technology enables cars to handle steering and acceleration, but humans remain in control.General Motors, which plans to launch a robotaxi service in an unidentified  ""dense, urban"" setting in 2019, uses laser systems. GM has undertaken a self-driving-car program using Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles in San Francisco. It's seeking a regulatory green light to build a self-driving car without a steering wheel or pedals.In Phoenix, Waymo has achieved what's called ""Level 4"" automation. Its driverless cars operate without human supervisors but only in a pre-mapped area. Its paid robotaxi service in Phoenix will operate in a 600-square mile area.Phoenix, with 299 sunny days per year on average, is considered an ideal place to launch a commercial service. Laser systems have trouble in rain, snow and fog.The holy grail for Waymo, General Motors and others is building a Level 5 fully autonomous car. The vehicle could go anywhere instructed, including unmapped areas, under any weather conditions. At the NADA conference, Krafcik said a free-range Level 5 autonomous car is a ""very long way out.""Wall Street analysts figure on Waymo making money with Level 4 technology, but just how valuable is Waymo? Bank of America puts it at $41 billion, while Morgan Stanley says it's closer to $70 billion. Jefferies suggests a range of anywhere from $75 billion to $125 billion. That's still a formidable sum, even for a company like Google's parent, with a market cap of more than $700 billion.Waymo has rebounded after losing top engineers who left to form autonomous startups such as Argo, Aurora and Nuro. Krafcik took the helm at Waymo in late 2016. He spent 14 years at Ford and served as CEO of Hyundai Motor America.Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) makes autonomous minivans for Waymo. But Waymo has yet to forge licensing deals for a self-driving car with the likes of Ford and Honda Motor (HMC) despite reports of negotiations. Waymo and Honda are said to be mulling a partnership to build a self-driving car that would deliver goods.At the auto dealers' conference, Krafcik said Waymo's monetization paths include ride-sharing services, self-driving trucks and licensing its software and hardware to traditional automakers. Longer range, he sees opportunities in public transportation in smart cities.""If Waymo just licenses their tech to automakers, they will make money in the short run but lose their predominant position in the long run as self-driving technology is commoditized,"" said Alexander Hars, managing director at Inventivio, a German self-driving consultancy. ""This is OK for the automakers but cannot be the only goal of Waymo.""Waymo has ordered ""thousands"" of Chrysler minivans to increase its fleet as it expands to more cities. It also has partners in Avis Budget Group (CAR) and AutoNation (AN) for servicing and housing its fleet. Trov, a startup backed by the venture-capital subsidiary of Munich Re, will provide trip insurance for passengers using Waymo's ride-hailing service.Krafcik contends ride-sharing services are the most economical business model for the self-driving cars, which are expected to be expensive. A self-driving car could operate around the clock and travel 250,000 miles if deployed in ride-sharing services, he said at the auto dealers' meeting.And, by getting rid of human drivers, ride-sharing services can drive down costs. Industry-leading Uber is still unprofitable.But it's still not clear whether Waymo plans to scale up a worldwide business to challenge Uber or is just out to prove its self-driving-car technology is best-in-class.CapitalG — a venture investment arm of Google's corporate parent, Alphabet — has invested in Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing service provider, behind Uber. Lyft and other ride-sharing startups loom as potential customers of Waymo and manufacturing partners.A Boston Consulting Group study forecasts that 20% of the miles Americans travel on roads in 2030 will be in driverless, ride-share vehicles.Aside from ride-sharing fleets, analysts say autonomous vehicles will be first deployed in gated communities, college campuses, theme parks, airports and warehouse distribution centers — all rangebound locations.Just how much demand there will be from consumers for personal transport is where the rubber hits the road. One common view is that if ride-sharing services take off, consumers will buy fewer cars themselves. At NADA, Krafcik said Level 4 self-driving cars could be in dealer showrooms sooner than people think.A bullish forecast by consultancy McKinsey says that by 2030, fully autonomous cars could account for 15% of passenger vehicles sold worldwide.Much depends on what self-driving technology might cost per vehicle as an options package. Analysts say autonomous technology needs to be in the $5,000-to-$15,000 range, as an added cost on top of the vehicle's base price.That would be a huge drop from prototype autonomous vehicles, which use multiple laser systems, cameras and other sensors. Laser systems have dropped from $75,000 to around $20,000, analysts say. Next-generation, solid-state laser systems may bring the price down to $500 to $1,000 each.A self-driving car also uses multiple backup computers. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) are racing to build specialized chips for processing AI software. Nvidia in March showcased new simulation technology for testing self-driving cars using virtual-reality systems.Nvidia hasn't disclosed pricing for its new ""Xavier"" AI system-on-a-chip for the self-driving car, unveiled in January at the Consumer Electronics Show. The company has told analysts it expects that deployments of the self-driving car will pick up in 2020 — a time frame that may be extended in light of the recent crashes.In the wake of those incidents, designers of autonomous vehicles will be pressured to build redundant software, hardware and sensor technology into vehicles, says Brian Johnson, a Barclays analyst. That approach will impact the cost of autonomous vehicles.""What the (Tempe) episode reinforces is that the conservative approach is likely the best one, and that sensor redundancy is crucial — providing an aviationlike level of safety,"" he said in a report. ""In this environment, we see Waymo, Aptiv and GM positioned with the right skill sets.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:AI In Business: This Is What The Future HoldsAI News: Artificial Intelligence Trends And Leading StocksNissan Takes A Leaf From GM With This Self-Driving TestAutonomous Cars: Why General Motors Is In The Back Seat Vs.

4,PEG,"Celgene's (CELG) multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod, will likely be delayed by a year or more after U.S. regulators punted its application — prompting shares to crash to a four-year low Wednesday.X The Food and Drug Administration is likely focusing on a six-person study initiated in October 2016, a handful of analysts suggested. Celgene submitted its application for ozanimod based on other successful Phase 3 trials.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges suggests Celgene took a gamble, filing the application before having the results of the October 2016 study. The study appears to duplicate the type of work Receptos would have done on ozanimod before Celgene acquired it in 2015.""The completion of the study itself suggests some recognition of a deficiency in the clinical package prepared by the prior owner,"" he said in a note to clients. ""The FDA appeared to surprise the company by demanding that this variance, and the full data, be added to the entire application.""Celgene, though, didn't publicly identify the issue in its application. Late Tuesday, Celgene said the FDA refused to review ozanimod based on ""nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections"" in the application. The company is seeking a meeting with the FDA to determine its next steps.""We remain confident in ozanimod's clinical profile demonstrated in the pivotal program in relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis,"" Celgene Chief Medical Officer Jay Backstrom said in a prepared statement Tuesday.But on the stock market today, Celgene toppled 9% to close at 87.12.Analysts peg the delay on ozanimod between several months and two years. If the issue can be addressed with data from the ongoing pharmacology studies, Celgene could refile by midyear and then wait 60 days for the FDA to decide whether to accept the application, Porges said.Using a standard nine-month review process, ozanimod could now launch in the third quarter of 2019 vs. earlier expectations for the fourth quarter of 2018, he said. Celgene doesn't expect a delay in ozanimod in inflammatory bowel disease, which Porges expects to launch in 2020.""This suggestion is consistent with the lack of direct or alarming clinical effects being behind the delay,"" Porges said.Celgene likely won't have to perform additional clinical trials on ozanimod, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients. The company believes it could either reanalyze existing data or add results from ongoing studies to sufficiently complete the application.""Notably, they appeared confident that the issues in the (refusal-to-file letter) do not affect the ultimate approvability or commercial profile of the drug, and (the) timeline for the inflammatory bowel disease indication would not be affected,"" Abrahams said.Still, Abrahams cut his price target on Celgene to 131 from 140. He expects ozanimod's launch in multiple sclerosis to be delayed by a year. This could have a ""meaningful"" impact on uptake considering this class of multiple sclerosis drugs, known as S1P,  is about to go generic.Ozanimod is considered a safer version of Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya. Both belong to the S1P class of multiple sclerosis drugs. Gilenya is expected to lose exclusivity in 2019, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a report.""With Gilenya losing exclusivity potentially as early as 2019, (ozanimod's) approval could be pushed to late 2019 — well after (the generic version of Gilenya) could be available,"" Raymond said.Canaccord analyst John Newman expects ozanimod in multiple sclerosis treatments to launch in 2020. He cut his U.S. sales estimate for ozanimod to $197 million in 2022 from $340 million previously. Outside the U.S., Newman calls for $129 million, down from $233 million previously.The ozanimod delay is far from Celgene's only pock mark on its inflammation and immunology pipeline. Last year, Celgene halted a late-stage trial in Crohn's disease, which cast doubt on an ulcerative colitis program.After plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla lagged in the third quarter, Celgene cut its 2020 guidance for inflammation and immunology to $2.6 billion to $2.8 billon, from its prior forecast for $4 billion issued in 2015.""Investors in Celgene's stock are likely to start clamoring for more aggressive and extensive changes in the company's leadership and direction after yet another disappointment,"" Leerink's Porges said. He cut his price target to 123 from 135.Analysts note Celgene needs ozanimod to diversify as key cancer drug Revlimid is set to begin losing exclusivity in the mid-2020s. Porges had expected ozanimod to become 15% of total product sales in 2025, based on his earlier estimate.""It's been a rough couple of months,"" Piper Jaffray's Raymond said. This newest obstacle ""only (raises) more questions regarding Celgene's efforts to diversify away from Revlimid.""But Celgene's setback is a silver lining for one biotech: Biogen (BIIB). RBC's Abrahams noted that Biogen now faces one less potential rival on the table in the near term for its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera. Meanwhile, it's weathering the launch of Roche's (RHHBY) rival drug, Ocrevus, fairly well.""We believe any potential prolongation of stability for their core revenue-generating multiple sclerosis franchise is a win and likely to perpetuate views of Biogen as a safe large-cap name to own in 2018,"" he said.RELATED:These Biotechs Diverge After Biggest Moneymakers Lag ExpectationsVeeva Rockets After Topping Quarterly Estimates, Crushing Guidance ViewsTesaro Dives 10% After Biggest Cancer Drug Lags Expectations, Guidance

10,PEG,"U.S. stock indexes deepened their losses midday Friday, as Senate Republicans scrambled to salvage its tax-cut package. The indexes rallied Thursday on belief that the bill would pass, but doubts delayed a vote late Thursday.X The S&P 500 dropped 1.1% midday Friday, while the Nasdaq slipped 1.5%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 fell 2.5%.Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.The Republican tax-cut package stalled Thursday after the Joint Committee on Taxation said the bill would not generate enough tax revenue to avoid increasing the deficit. That along with a parliamentarian snag derailed the vote Thursday evening. With additional fixes, a Senate vote is expected this morning.Selling picked up midday Friday after an ABC news report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn would testify against President Trump in a plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller.Concerns over tax cuts and tax revenue is an old and tiresome story on the Hill. When Reagan sought passage of a tax-cut bill in 1985, the New York Times reported that the Joint Committee on Tax Revenue said it would reduce tax revenue. Reagan prevailed and the tax revenue rose in each of the next five years, proving the panel's projections wrong. The panel, though, always has a challenging job. Dynamic factors are difficult to predict, and economics is all but dynamism.In midday stock-market action, blue chips were roughly even between winners and losers. On the plus side, Merck & Co. (MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) each initially rose about 1% before gains faded. On the negative side, General Electric (GE) sagged 1.4%.GE has been a laggard this year. The diversified manufacturer's stock is down 43% this year.In S&P 500, the biggest gainer for the day was oil and natural gas explorer Apache (APA). The stock rose about 6% in heavy volume. Apache is on track for its fourth daily gain in a row. The stock has gained 11% since Monday's close. Light sweet crude popped 1.31 to 58.71 per barrel.The Street expects Apache to turn in a profit of 4 cents a share in 2017 after two years of losses. In 2018, analysts expect a profit of  54 cents a share for Apache.Meanwhile, the exchange-traded fund Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY) slipped about 1% as it tested its 50-day line. The ETF is based on the IBD 50 and is up 38% for the year. The stock  recently pulled about 5% off its Nov. 22 high.Money center banks, which are up almost 4% for the week, stirred midday Friday.

13,PEG,"I knew the late Justice Antonin Scalia a little, and like millions of others, I was an avid fan of his jurisprudence, the great bulk of which he produced after I was no longer a law student, so much the worse for me.What do I have to do with it? Nothing, except that reading opinions as a law student was often like trying to swallow great bowls of sawdust — without milk. Very few judges can write well. On the rare occasions when I came across a decision by Learned Hand, I would practically weep with gratitude for his clear, forceful prose.Antonin Scalia was not just a great stylist for a jurist, he was a great writer for a writer. Most of his work though, obviously, was in the form of opinions and dissents, and even the best Supreme Court opinions are required to include copious citations in the text, which, for the general reader, can be distracting speed bumps. That's one of the many reasons to rejoice at a new collection of Scalia's speeches.""Scalia Speaks"" is a joint effort by Ethics and Public Policy Center President Ed Whelan (a former Scalia law clerk) and Christopher Scalia, one of the justice's nine children and a former English professor. It offers even the nonspecialist an almost intimate picture of one of the giants of our age. Here, in vivid prose, without textual clutter, is his case for originalism, against the ""living Constitution"" and for judicial modesty.Just as compelling are the other dimensions of Scalia's life and personality that shine through. In 1997, the University Club of Washington gave the justice a sports award. He began with characteristic drollery: ""I have been asked many, many times to what do I attribute my well-known athletic prowess."" He then related the games and sports he had played as a kid in Queens, New York. The speech is a veritable time capsule, conveying an almost unrecognizable era in which unsupervised kids devised their own games using little more a Spaldeen ball and a broomstick. ""There were no soccer moms because there was no soccer. Americans overwhelmingly preferred baseball, a game in which a lot of players stand around while not much happens, to soccer, a game in which people run back and forth furiously while not much happens."" The man who would famously refer in one Supreme Court opinion to ""argle-bargle"" recalled fondly that one of his childhood games was called ""mumblety-peg"" and consisted of throwing a penknife into a square marked off in the dirt. ""In those days nobody worried about kids carrying knives.""There is much to learn in these speeches about the Constitution, Western civilization, the intersection of faith and public policy, American history and, of course, the law. But the thread that connects all is Scalia's bone-deep appreciation for the primacy of character. Again and again he stressed that a decent society ultimately rests not on laws or customs or even history but on the character of the people. He gave many speeches at universities, law schools and (if one of his nine children or numerous grandchildren was in the graduating class) high schools. A recurring theme was the purpose of education, which he believed was not only to instill knowledge but also to build character. Scalia quoted his own father, a professor of Romance languages and no intellectual slouch himself, who advised, ""Brains are like muscles, they can be rented by the hour. The only thing that's not for sale at any price is character.""Scalia's mind sparkled like a gem, but perhaps, in our turbulent time, the most important take-away from this collection is the lesson it teaches about civility.The national mood has changed even just since Scalia's death. So many of us today are marinating in the pleasures of hatred. Justice Scalia was one of the most skilled polemicists of our time, but he was the opposite of a hater. He had an open, generous nature. Some of the eulogies he offered for friends are included in ""Scalia Speaks,"" and they convey just how perceptive and appreciative he was. The most important things in life — work, family, attitude, piety — are the things he treasured in others. And though neither MSNBC nor Fox News would choose to focus on this, he didn't allow political differences to poison personal relationships. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was among his closest friends. He taught Justice Elena Kagan to hunt.Justice Ginsburg provided a warm introduction, in which she revealed that she and Scalia used to trade drafts, the better to hone their arguments. ""If our friendship encourages others to appreciate that some very good people have ideas with which we disagree, and that, despite differences, people of goodwill can pull together for the well-being of the institutions we serve and our country, I will be overjoyed, as I am confident Justice Scalia would be.""Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

14,PEG,"Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google will play to their strengths as the battle in voice-activated search shifts to commercial products, an analyst said Wednesday.There are four big players in the voice search market today, each building their own ecosystem leveraging voice-activated ""digital assistants"": Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Amazon, Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT), SunTrust Humphrey's Youssef Squali said in a note to clients.While Google dominates in smartphone voice search, Amazon's strength is its popular Echo-branded home speaker systems. The challenge for both, though, lies in getting consumers to use voice search in ways that generate revenue.""We estimate that voice search accounts for about 10% of all search queries today, yet we peg the revenue associated with it at less than 2% in 2017,"" said Squali in the report. ""This dichotomy can be explained by the fact that a disproportionately larger percentage of voice searches today are for noncommercial queries (playing music, managing alarms, weather, general interest questions).""However, he expects more voice searches to be used for products, especially consumer packaged goods.Squali says Google, which recently partnered with Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), will seek more alliances.""We expect several other retailers to partner with Google over time in an effort to stem the onslaught of Amazon; in effect Google becomes the retailers' friend, their white knight against Amazon,"" he said in the report.While Apple and Microsoft are players in voice-search as well, they have different aims, Squali says.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.""Google would like to answer every question or query a person might have while monetizing via relevant advertisements. Amazon wants to own the consumers wallet and be the default online shopping destination,"" said Squali. ""Apple wants to sell easy-to-use, sleek hardware. Microsoft wants to be the go-to enterprise solution and improve employees' productivity.""The SunTrust analyst estimates that voice search revenue will boom from $600 million in 2017 to $15 billion by 2020.Squali added: ""We believe there will be multiple winners out of this evolution, each with a differentiated skill set, but we expect Amazon to come out much strengthened by it.""RELATED:Where Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?Google Appeals Fine, Regulatory Risk Underestimated: AnalystHow Wal-Mart, Google Are Taking On A Common Internet FoeGoogle In Talks To Buy HTC Smartphone Business, Reports SayIs The Holy Grail Of Digital Payments Just One Click Away?

16,PEG,"The world has suffered a decade of financial bubble, crash, and anemic economic growth, driven in part by large swings in the value of the dollar in relation to other major currencies. To raise economic growth requires restoring confidence that going forward, the dollar's exchange rate with other top economies will be more stable.Ending currency volatility will require leadership from the U.S. Treasury, which has responsibility for the dollar's international value. This is a key opportunity for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and his team to improve economic growth and financial stability.Three areas unaddressed by recent presidential administrations cry for attention.1.) The world's two largest currency issuers, the United States and the euro area, together represent about 40% of world GDP. Many other nations — China, the Persian Gulf states, Hong Kong, parts of Eastern Europe and Africa — fix their currencies to one of these titans, creating extended dollar and euro blocs that represent at least two-thirds of global output.For this reason, the dollar-euro exchange rate is the most important price in the world, says Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Mundell. It strongly influences global asset prices, financial conditions, and trade flows. Along with prices for key commodities like oil, the dollar-euro price is an essential, real-time market signal of monetary conditions.Over the last decade, the dollar-euro rate has been highly unstable, seesawing by about 20% eight times since 2007. When the U.S. Federal Reserve eases, the dollar depreciates, when it stops, the dollar springs back up, pushing down prices and slowing the economy.As a result, market expectations of dollar appreciation have meant a weak recovery. Who can make long-term capital expenditures or investment in such conditions? Is it any wonder monetary velocity — the speed with which currency moves through the economy — remains at crisis level, despite enormous efforts at monetary easing?Just as President Reagan's Treasury Secretary James Baker announced the Plaza Accord to realign and stabilize the dollar relative to the German and Japanese currencies in 1985, the current Treasury Department should stabilize the world monetary system by announcing a dollar-euro stability pact, as soon as possible.2.) The relationship between the dollar and the Chinese yuan likewise needs attention.Beijing was wise more than 20 years ago to peg its currency to the U.S. dollar. Lacking a deep financial system of its own, it recognized that its best bet to avoid destabilizing speculative attacks was to delegate its monetary policy to the Federal Reserve. By joining the dollar bloc, China has achieved internal financial stability that has allowed it to grow rapidly for two decades, alleviating grinding poverty and turning it into an economic powerhouse.China's dollar peg has also been a significant source of global financial stability, as past Treasury secretaries have recognized.But, the China-U.S. currency bloc is now at risk, for two reasons.First, the dollar appreciated sharply versus the euro and other major currencies beginning in late 2014. That translated into tighter monetary policy for China and some loss of competitiveness by Chinese exporters.Second, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has used domestic monetary policy more actively in recent years. Independent monetary policy and a stable exchange rate cannot coexist for long, and China has sought to staunch the outflow from the yuan with capital controls and by buying up its own currency, spending almost $1 trillion of its foreign exchange reserves last year.If history teaches anything — George Soros breaking the Bank of England in 1992, the collapse of Argentina's faux currency board in 2001 — it is that pegged exchange rates cannot survive if a central bank also conducts an activist domestic monetary policy.Markets are now betting that the yuan will depreciate significantly, perhaps after the Communist Party's twice-per-decade national conference this fall. A major yuan decline could lead to a financial crisis in Asia or spark a trade war with the U.S.So, will the Treasury Department address this issue before it becomes a crisis?  Specifically, will the U.S. encourage the PBOC to recommit to a stable exchange rate with the U.S. if the dollar-euro rate has been stabilized?3.) The world's fourth largest economy, Japan, has been pummeled by its overvalued exchange rate for 25 years. In the 1980s, Japan agreed to tighten monetary policy and raise the yen versus the dollar. But it wildly overshot, and the yen soared from 240 per dollar in 1985 to 80 in 1995 — a three-fold increase. The result of this huge appreciation was two decades of falling prices, ultralow interest rates, and economic malaise.Japan's case demonstrates that neither fiscal stimulus nor temporary monetary easing can fundamentally realign an overvalued exchange rate. The only way out is to permanently break market expectations of appreciation, by realigning the yen down to a healthy level versus the dollar, followed by long-term stability.Once there is a currency stability pact — a new Plaza Accord — among the U.S., eurozone, and China, why not roll in Japan as well?Exchange rate stability with a low, common rate of inflation among the major economies would end a decade of volatility, crisis, and malaise. It would help inaugurate a new era of optimal capital flows, open trade, and strong growth for the U.S.The question is, will the Treasury Department take the lead?

17,PEG,"Investors in Dow component Microsoft (MSFT) and countless other companies are due for a wake-up call in coming months, and this is one instance where hitting the snooze button isn't a good idea.A set of new accounting rules that govern revenue recognition — said to be the biggest change in standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 — will take effect next year, affecting either fiscal 2018 or 2019 for all U.S. companies.The accounting changes are under the radar of many investors, who may scramble to make sense of what's happening with the stocks, many of them blue chips like Microsoft, into which they've poured their money.Under the designation of FASB 606 — FASB is an acronym for the Financial Accounting Standards Board — the new rules will make revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. It's geared to help investors, but there could be near-term pain. Many companies will likely speed up revenue recognition and possibly make earnings more volatile from quarter to quarter.""We expect that (the new rules) will cause significant investor confusion over the next 12 months to the financial analysis of companies ranging from small companies up to the largest, including Microsoft,"" said a recent report from Citigroup.But the rules aim to address a big problem.While top-line growth is a critical metric for investors, revenue recognition has been a weak link in accounting standards. With the new rules, Wall Street analysts and investors should get a better feel for how a company is doing and whether business is deteriorating or booming.One goal is providing more transparency in sales backlogs, or revenue not yet recognized from contracts already signed. Some companies state backlogs, some don't. Now they'll have to put a number on it in many industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.In regulatory filings, companies also will be required to disclose more information on contracts. That should give investors and analysts more data on what risks or uncertainties companies face. Companies talk about things like pension costs in filings but don't provide the same transparency on revenue issues.Industries with the most ""deferred revenue"" — sales booked over time — will be most affected by FASB 606, says a Morgan Stanley report. Those include software, communications equipment, airlines, aerospace and defense.In industries that will be impacted most by the new rules, some analysts are talking about using more steady free cash flow as an alternative metric to earnings per share. The reason is free cash flow will be less impacted by the 606 rules.""I would expect to see more disclosures, certainly by the third quarter, on whether the standard is going to affect revenue recognition,"" said Dusty Stallings, a partner at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers.Microsoft is expected to be one of the prominent early adopters of the new standard. It reports its 2017 fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on July 20, and a few weeks later the company plans to restate earnings for the prior two years.Also on the list with Microsoft are a number of other Dow components, including General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and Verizon Communications (VZ).A wide swath of other firms in many industries are expected to be impacted. They include Amazon.com (AMZN), American Airlines (AAL), AT&T (T), Electronic Arts (EA) and General Dynamics (GD). Others are First Solar (FLSR), Monsanto (MON) and T-Mobile US (TMUS)Companies that recognize more revenue upfront could have more earnings volatility. Surprises to the upside may be followed by sudden, equally surprising shortfalls. Companies prefer that a total contract value be recognized over time, which provides more flexibility in smoothing out earnings to meet consensus estimates.""New principle-based revenue rules will likely accelerate revenue recognition, while also introducing more volatility,"" said Snehaja Mogre, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report. ""As the new standard will not impact actual cash flows, we expect investors to increase their reliance on cash flow metrics.""Many companies are still studying the new FASB 606 rules, but crunch time is coming. Expectations run high that many companies will finally declare whether the 606 standard is ""material"" or not to financial results on June- or September-quarter earnings calls.In Microsoft's case, the new standard is expected to impact Windows 10 revenue in particular. Microsoft is expected to book Windows 10 revenue when it bills hardware makers rather than over the life of a PC or device using the software. Microsoft in May briefed financial analysts, telling them that in fiscal 2016 revenue would have been about 7% higher —$6 billion or so — had it used the new revenue standard back then.While Microsoft will forecast earnings in July for its first fiscal quarter of 2018, it plans to update guidance in August using the new revenue recognition standard. When briefing analysts in May, Microsoft made the point that the FASB 606 rules will not impact free cash flow.""Net-net, investors could start paying more attention to cash flows given increasing revenue variability,"" Brent Bracelin, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said in a recent note to clients.While some companies will opt to restate earnings for prior years, most are expected to take a ""modified"" compliance route, applying the new rules on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward, adjusting results for new contracts, says Betsy Meter, an audit partner at KPMG.""It's industry-driven mainly,"" she said. Companies that delay, though, will be less likely to take Microsoft's approach and restate prior-year earnings, which gives investors more information.""For industries where there is a significant impact, a full retrospective approach will give them some history and visibility,"" Meter added.Some of the biggest names in tech, though, see little impact. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are among tech companies that expect little impact from the new standard. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) has not been heard from.In general, the rules are expected to affect companies with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue and contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks. And they will also affect companies that use third-party sales distribution channels.Revenue from Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers will be booked earlier, rather than when consumers actually buy the devices, says a Connor Group report. The new rules also will impact Amazon gift cards, says the report.Key to the new accounting rules is that revenue must often be booked right away and not stretched out over the term of contracts. AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon will likely book more revenue from smartphone sales upfront, rather than over the course of an installment payment plan.Salesforce.com (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE) are among software companies still studying the impact of 606 rules. Workday (WDAY) has decided to  remove guidance for billings, a sales growth metric,  as it adopts the new accounting rules. It's unclear how many other companies may follow suit on billings.Companies with cloud-based, software-as-a-servicer (SaaS) business models that involve renewable subscriptions are expected to be less impacted than those that sell software installed on a customer's own in-house computers.Only about 7% of SaaS provider ServiceNow's (NOW) revenue comes from on-premise licenses, analysts say. Splunk (SPLK) and Ansys (ANSS), on the other hand, garner a large chunk of revenue from on-premise deals, says a William Blair report.While Microsoft will likely book Windows 10 revenue sooner, its online Office 365 sales will be less affected. Cloud-based software is rented via the internet.""SaaS models should see the least impact from the new standard, given that software is hosted and delivered over broadband connections vs. software installed on-premise,"" said Bracelin.Cisco Systems (CSCO), a big computer networking gear maker, could see its deferred revenue impacted, he says.Many software companies may be in the process of renegotiating contracts to ease the impact of rule 606, says KPMG's Meter.Some software makers, such as Autodesk (ADSK), have already transitioned business models to subscription licenses for cloud software. Under the 606 rules, only software that is continuously updated is eligible for revenue recognition over time, or ""ratably.""A lot of U.S. companies had hoped for further delays in carrying out the 606 rules, which have been in the works for more than a decade.""Companies know the time is upon them to get going,"" said Stallings at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""There's acceptance that this is going live on Jan. 1, 2018, for calendar-year companies.""RELATED:Workday Ends Billings Guidance In Accounting Shift, Stock Falls
"
18,PEG,"President Donald Trump's assertion this week that the ""dollar is getting too strong"" led to a sharp decline in the value of the greenback. The market's reaction to Trump was a reminder that presidents often get the dollar they want.This has us worried that Trump and his Treasury Department will pursue a weaker currency in the mistaken belief that this will boost the economy and his presidency.The irony here is that the anticipation of many of his other policies, such as his proposed tax cuts, deregulation plans, and ObamaCare reform, have already strengthened the dollar since the election, because those policies would make the U.S. a more attractive destination for investment.Trump was partly right when he noted the irony that his policies are partly responsible for the higher dollar that he doesn't want.Here's what he seems not to get: The investment here in new factories and businesses won't be as great — and job creation won't be as robust — if he gets his way and the dollar is weakened or unstable. Investors want to send their money to places where the currencies don't erode in value and thus reduce the real return on their investments.For evidence of this, Trump should take a closer look at modern presidential history. It is fairly indisputable that strong-dollar presidents have been economically successful and weak-dollar presidents have been mostly unsuccessful and unpopular. Correlation is not causation, but it is instructive.Start with the big economic boom in the 1960s that began with John F. Kennedy. While real growth rates hit 5% and 6% in the aftermath of his tragic assassination, it was Kennedy who laid the groundwork for the go-go '60s with substantial income-tax reductions, and his rejection of an emerging and wrongheaded consensus that a weaker dollar, free of its golden anchor, would enhance economic growth.Kennedy's declaration on the dollar was bullish and unequivocal: ""This nation will maintain the dollar as good as gold at $35 an ounce, the foundation stone of the free world's trade and payments system.""But that policy position began to shift in the late 1960s.A U.S. economy that had been raging began to sputter, and then in the '70s it stagnated. Perhaps easily forgotten is that in the second half of the 1960s, Lyndon Baines Johnson paired a rising tax burden to pay for the Vietnam War and the Great Society welfare programs with a growing skepticism about the importance of a solid, stable dollar.Private markets lost confidence in the greenback and began to demand more paper dollars for gold as inflation rose. These forces crashed the decadeslong Bretton Woods era of a $35-per-ounce peg to gold.Under President Richard Nixon confidence in the dollar eroded further.In 1971, Nixon made dollar devaluation explicit when he severed its link to gold. The consequence of this action was a greenback that went into free fall. This was the start of the great inflation of the 1970s with surging gold, oil and commodity prices across the board.Under Jimmy Carter the weak-dollar policy became more pronounced with Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal publicly urging a weaker dollar. And weak it became as inflation eventually topped 13%.Looking back on the '70s, it's surely no surprise that we had three failed presidencies in a row: those of Nixon, Gerald Ford and Carter.The battered dollar meant that real living standards took a big hit — especially for the poor and middle classes — and the stock market got crushed. Stocks lost more than half their value, adjusted for inflation, in the worst bear market since the Great Depression. The price of gold surged from $35 to $875 an ounce during a rather forgettable economic decade.‎It was the era of Malaise. The joke with double-digit inflation was that if you saw a dollar on the ground, you would only lean over to pick it up if you thought there might be something of value underneath it. No one wanted to invest when the eventual return would be in dollars that were of shrinking value over time.Ronald Reagan's policies changed all that. Much historical credit for the economic boom of the 1980s is attributed to the 40th president's tax cuts and deregulation. But we think that just as important was Reagan's quest to crush inflation and his frequently expressed desire for a stronger, more stable dollar.  Paired with the aforementioned tax cuts and deregulation, the U.S. proved a magnet for investment in the '80s.Important here is that, particularly when it came to the dollar, Bill Clinton's presidency was a repeat, and arguably an enhancement, of Reagan's strong-dollar policy.As our friend Larry Kudlow has observed: ‎ ""The single most significant, intergalactic, extra-celestial, interplanetary, and spiritual force behind the global stock market rally of the 1980s and 1990s was the decline of inflation to rates not seen in over thirty years.""Clinton's Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin never bashed the Japanese over the value of the yen, and his currency quietude was a strong signal that he meant what he said about a strong dollar being in our best interest.Unfortunately, George W. Bush reverted to a weak-dollar policy when he reached the White House in 2001. Gold, the best measure of a currency's value, had been largely stable in price in the prosperous '80s and '90s, only for it to more than triple against the dollar.Another weak-dollar era began, and with predictable results: subpar economic growth as investors poured their money into sinks of wealth like housing, at the expense of investment in equities and enterprises representing future wealth creation.The dollar's sharp decline continued throughout much of Barack Obama's first term in office, though his administration eventually and wisely retreated from currency brinkmanship.By 2011 the dollar began a long march upward, and the gold price began a gradual decline. The latter gave legs to what had been a steady stock-market rally. While we disagreed with Obama on most of his fiscal and regulatory policies, his dollar policy was a winner.We discuss modern dollar history in the hope that President Trump will reconsider his advocacy of dollar weakness. The biggest problem facing workers today is a relative lack of business investment that is the driver of all job creation. Almost as troubling, the American worker has suffered 17 years of flat and even slightly declining wages amid 21st century currency uncertainty.The weak-dollar advocates in the Trump White House seem to forget that American workers are paid in dollars in return for their toil. But if the dollar falls as Trump says he desires, the purchasing power of American paychecks will shrink with the devaluation.How does it help the 150 million Americans earning a paycheck for the government to adopt a policy that reduces each dollar's purchasing power to, say, 95 cents? This is an effective pay cut for the tens of millions of working class Americans who crossed over and voted for Trump.If Trump wants to implement policies that boost prosperity, and we hope he does, he should focus on tax cuts, deregulation, and a strong and stable dollar. Those are the policies that worked for the three most economically successful presidents of modern times: JFK, Reagan and Clinton. A strong, not a weak, dollar makes for a strong and popular president.

24,PEG,"In a discussion of the best utility stocks, Exelon (EXC) deserves serious consideration.The best utility stocks are often known for solid dividend yields. Exelon has one at around 3.4% annualized. The company announced a dividend of 34.5 cents a share on May 1, payable June 8 to shareholders of record May 15.Exelon is one of two names in IBD's diversified utilities group included in Friday's Utility Leaders screen. The other is Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG). Diversified utilities provide customers with a wide range of utilities, including electricity, natural gas and water.Exelon's six utilities provide electricity and natural gas to about 10 million customers in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. The company also serves about 4 million customers in northern Illinois. That's about 70% of the state's population.Exelon is also a big power generator. It boasts more than 32,700 megawatts of nuclear, gas, wind, solar and hydroelectric generating capacity.Due to a constantly evolving energy industry, the company continues to innovate. That's resulted in one of the cleanest and low-cost power generation fleets in the U.S. Exelon is also developing fuel cell projects, zero-emission natural gas plants and microgrids.After three straight quarters of earnings declines, profit growth has ramped up in the past two quarters. When the company reported Q1 results on May 2, quarterly profit jumped 50% from the year-ago quarter. Sales increased 11% to $9.69 billion, nice acceleration from 6% growth in Q4.As part of its Q1 press release, the company cited more than $500 million in ongoing annual savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Chart-wise, Exelon looks pretty darn good. The weekly charts shows a shallow, cup-with-handle base with a 41.66 entry.RELATED:Best Utility Stocks To Buy And WatchThis Utility's Stock Chart Is Unimpressive, But Its Dividend Is RichHow 875 Miles Of Steel Pipe Will Turn To Plastic

27,PEG,"Liberal journalists have spilled a whole lot of ink in the Trump era, boasting how they've suffered watching a week or so of Fox News programming to explore the strange informational terrain of the Trump voter. They pompously proclaim it's television for your crazy Uncle Frank, pushing conspiracy theories for dumb people while nurturing resentment toward the elites — meaning, of course, them.That nasty cartoon is rebutted by the new Fox News program ""Life Liberty & Levin,"" hosted by Mark Levin. It is more intellectual than anything produced on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN or MSNBC. Nothing they have on air comes even close.For an hour, at 10 p.m. Eastern on Sunday nights, Levin interviews one guest — remember that? — drilling deep to explore how the guest has worked to protect and preserve the principles of freedom. It's substance over sizzle. It serves to enlighten, not to entertain. It is serious programming, so the liberal critics have demeaned it as a ""glacial slog.""It takes a nanosecond for Levin to go further than today's typically superficial television interview. He begins by reviewing his guest's biography, and viewers may learn a tidbit that immediately puts the guest's career in its proper perspective.Sen. Mike Lee, for example, is the son of former Solicitor General Rex Lee, and he gained his interest in politics by watching his father work in court.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen interviewing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Levin told viewers that they graduated from the same high school in the Philadelphia area (at a different time), and that Netanyahu spent a year after college working at the same consulting firm as former Gov. Mitt Romney. With just those two introductory nuggets, Levin has transcended the claptrap one hears from the elites at CNN or MSNBC.The series began with an interview of economics professor and columnist Walter Williams, a true icon in his field who we believe, like Thomas Sowell, has been insulted throughout his career (he's too much of a gentleman to say so himself) by so often being typecast by the media as an expert ""black economist,"" as if that were a notable or limiting descriptor (take your pick). You doubt us? Google that term and you'll find his name. Google ""economists"" and you'll find a list of the top 54 economists, and he's not on it.Levin put him front and center, where he belongs. Here's a question and an answer you'll never find on the other networks: Levin asked, ""Do you think liberty has the seeds of its own demise?"" Williams responded by explaining how tyrants always welcome freedom of speech to get their foot in the door only to undermine others' freedom of speech.The episode might remind older viewers of Milton Friedman interviews back in the '80s on his PBS series ""Free to Choose."" It will remind you of absolutely nothing on television today.How about Levin digging into matters like the meaning of the words in the Declaration of Independence, of natural law and inalienable rights, with Hillsdale College President Dr. Larry Arnn?They discussed how progressives undermine America's founding principles, and Dr. Arnn expertly put matters in proper perspective: ""(T) he first thing that happens is ... they start writing about this Declaration of Independence — 'It was really good for the time but not relevant anymore.' ... and that won't work, by the way, because if the Declaration is false now, it was false then by its own terms, right?""Liberals also peg Fox News as toeing the Trump line 24/7. That's certainly not true of Levin. In the last few weeks, he and several of his guests have brutally pounded on the Republican leadership for passing a 2,200-plus-page monstrosity of an omnibus spending bill, and passing it with absolutely no time for members of Congress to actually read it first (never mind debate it).One of those guests is former Attorney General Ed Meese, Levin's old boss in the years of President Reagan. On the other hand, Meese also deemed President Trump's judicial appointments ""outstanding,"" praising Trump for selecting judges that adhere to the Constitution, and consulting The Federalist Society and The Heritage Foundation. It's the kind of discussion those dumb conservatives want to hear and those elites don't want dumb conservatives to hear.Millions of Americans have enjoyed Levin's books on liberty and tyranny, and now it's possible to get some of that wisdom every Sunday on cable TV. All credit should go to Fox News for daring to put a calm hour of serious talk about political philosophy on the air.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Facebook Still Hasn't Owned Up To One Huge Privacy BreachThe Gender Pay Gap Is Nothing Compared With These Other Workplace GapsBy Handing Out Driver's Licenses, Far-Left California Invites Illegals To Stay — And Taxpayers To Pay

28,PEG,"Two bank stocks in the superregional group — Comerica (CMA) and Northern Trust (NTRS) — have recently appeared in the Big Cap 20. A few statistics point to where some of the market's strength is emerging so far this year.The S&P 500 is down 3.2%  for the year. The Big Cap 20 is up 3.1%. The superregional bank group is up 1.3%. The bank sector, which includes seven industry groups, is down 1.66%. Northern Trust is down 0.4%, and Comerica is up 5.6%.So far this year, the superregional group is the leader among bank groups.Chicago-based Northern Trust has accelerated its earnings growth in recent quarters. Earnings rose 6% vs. year-ago levels in the first quarter of 2017, then 10%, 11%, and 20% in the most recently reported quarter. The Street expects earnings to increase 27% in the current quarter.Annual earnings growth is expected to hit 29% in 2018, which would be the fastest growth in 10 years.Two new factors could be helping the banks. First, rising interest rates are expected to boost the banks' net profit margins.Second, the Republican changes to the Dodd-Frank law will ease some of the regulations affecting the banks, especially those banks with less than $250 billion in assets. According to SEC filings for the year ended in December, Northern Trust's total assets were $138.6 billion. Comerica's total assets were $71.6 billion.From the smaller banks' perspective, that's good news. However, there's some bad news that goes along with the changes.From a free-market perspective, the bad news is that the Republicans are not repealing Dodd-Frank. Not even close. They are ensuring that much of it will survive. Regulators will continue to have control over how big capital cushions should be and how much in profits banks can return to shareholders.The Senate has approved the changes, but the House had yet to vote on its version, as of Friday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

32,PEG,"There was plenty of reason to laugh at the breakdown of Fidel Castro's funeral car as it made its way from Havana to Santiago. It's always funny when someone known as ""el maximo lider"" gets cut down a peg — with a mundane car breakdown at his supposedly exalting memorial moment. What's more, Castro had left his country in shambles, creating a metaphor of sorts with the broken-down — or out of gas — Cuban economy matching the state of his funeral car.And given the number of coincidences that have gone with the communist dictator's death — that he died on capitalist shopping-fest Black Friday, that he died on ideological archenemy Augusto Pinochet's birthday — it was impossible to not think the gods were at least smiling.Some also pointed to the similarities between Castro's funeral car breakdown and the Ayatollah Khomeini's undignified ending, where his body and coffin were tossed around by an overenthusiastic mob in 1989, or Zairean kleptocrat Sese Seko Mobutu's, whose corpse somehow lacked a proper embalming and stank to high heaven for all the funeral's attending dignitaries in 1997.But there was a more serious message in what we saw on Sunday in the sight of Castro's funeral ashes sitting on top of a military green giant cigar box and being pushed by sweaty soldiers: that the Cuban political elites can no longer shelter themselves from the economic failures they so casually inflict on the rest of the Cuban people.Consider how big and humiliating this breakdown is. All the world was watching as Cuba's supposed communist ""success story"" was put on a final grand parade. The funeral was supposedly to recount the esteem and regard held by Cubans of Castro's 54 year rule. Instead, the procession — symbolic in that it retraced Castro's  final road  to seizing power in 1959. If things couldn't go right for something like this, what could they go right for?Something happened that made the Russian-made jeep malfunction at the critical moment — whether bad maintenance due to a lack of spare parts, an angry or unmotivated workforce paid just $20 a month, a shortage of gas, or a lack of investment and upgrades.  If it was the first possibility, it points to an important lesson from Adam Smith: that of the invisible hand.Smith postulated that large numbers of forces go into the creation of an economy based on individual self-interest and those forces eventually span the entire economic ecosystem, including the players at the top. Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek expounded further on it, explaining that central planners, acting without price signals, cannot know what the value or worth of anything is and their acts naturally create shortages and inefficiencies.The Castro elite, modeled on the old Soviet nomenklatura, have shielded themselves well from the depredations of  central planners. Castro had his own island of plutocratic delights and according to Forbes magazine, went out nearly a billionaire with a $900 million fortune. For a long time, he was able to avoid the consequences of socialist central planning. That he wasn't now, suggests a regime that has pretty well spent itself.Bob Gates, in his CIA memoir, ""From The Shadows,"" observed a similar phenomenon as the old Soviet Union reached its last legs — a story about how Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, when he was running the hated and feared KGB, had a group of guests visit him at the Lubyanka prison which was the Moscow headquarters of his great spy empire — only to find that their bearskin hats had been stolen by petty thieves inside the building. It was stories like that suggested to Gates and others that the end was near.It may well be that Castro's regime may be on its way out with that sort of signal too.RELATED:The Fidel Castro Myth Debunked: The Death Of A Tyrant, Not A HeroCastro's Funeral: In Lieu Of Flowers, Send Agents To Arrest The Rest Of The DictatorsBrent Bozell: Media Still Honoring Castro And His Debacle

35,PEG,"In my Nov. 1 column, I looked at the presidential election through the lens of the old children's radio show ""Let's Pretend"" -- examining how things would look if it turned out that Donald Trump ends up winning.That would have required lots of pretending until recently. Two weeks ago, Hillary Clinton led Trump by 6% in the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls. That lead is now 1.9%. RCP state polling averages then had Clinton ahead by 128 electoral votes. Now the estimated count is 273 to 265.These numbers may overstate the closeness of the race. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, which weighs poll results by various factors, gives Trump a 31% chance of winning. Other polling websites peg his chances as significantly less.But obviously, something has changed. FBI Director James Comey's announcement Oct. 28 that the investigation into Clinton's nonsecure emails as secretary of state was resuming undoubtedly contributed to it. And the race may already have been tightening after the announcement of what Trump might call yuuuuuge ObamaCare premium increases.After all, Clinton is seeking a third Democratic term, though the signature policies of the current Democratic president — ObamaCare, the Iranian nuclear deal — have always been unpopular.The response to the Comey announcement of those on Team Clinton — which includes many of the mainstream media, as well as the Clinton campaign — reeked of panic. They clearly didn't see this coming.The first response was to attack Comey for addressing his letter only to Republican members of Congress. In fact, it was addressed, in line with typical executive branch practice, to the appropriate committee members of both parties. An unforced error or, as the British would say, an own goal.Then came an attack on Comey for violating Justice Department ""protocol"" -- a word used a dozen times by vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine in one interview.But of course, Team Clinton didn't object to Comey's violating protocol July 5 when he announced he wouldn't recommend criminal charges against Clinton for violating email rules and lying repeatedly about it. He said that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring such a case, even though no rational judge would quash an indictment under Title 18, Section 793(f) of U.S. Code based on the facts he alleged.My theory is that Comey was placed in an impossible position by the June 27 Phoenix tarmac meeting between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch, a meeting that was surely intended to be secret but was revealed apparently because a TV reporter had a good source in the private jet terminal.By meeting with the spouse of a candidate under criminal investigation, Lynch revealed herself to be a political hack. Her Justice Department's refusal to summon a grand jury and sweetheart deals with key witnesses strengthen that view.So Comey, head of an investigative agency, was obliged to make a decision that would ordinarily be made by a prosecutor. Like a local judge asked to enjoin a party's national convention delegates, he evidently didn't consider it his job to determine who should be a presidential nominee.Team Clinton cheered that violation of protocol. The Oct. 28 letter required a ""1984""-style flip-flop from those in the Clinton camp. They said, in effect, ""We have always been at war with the protocol-violating James Comey.""The repeated attacks on Comey by Clinton and the mainstream media were out of the 1990s Clinton playbook. Similar attacks worked when Bill Clinton was the incumbent president with high job approval. But Hillary Clinton isn't the incumbent president and has sub-50% approval.Did Team Clinton think its candidate would win a contest over honesty and integrity with an FBI director it had recently praised? That looks like political malpractice.Media members of Team Clinton chimed in with articles claiming that Clinton was being criticized only because she is a woman — an absurdity because the criticisms pertain to her specific acts. It's a Clinton thing, not a female thing, to violate email rules and lie repeatedly about it.In response, Trump uncharacteristically has campaigned on substantive issues, rolling out an arguably serious plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare.Polls still show Clinton ahead — but by margins similar to the British polls showing Brexit losing and smaller than those in 2015 polls showing Conservatives wouldn't win a majority in Parliament. Those elections came out the other way.So maybe we're in my pretend world. If so, a Clinton loss would validate my old rule that nothing is free in politics; there is just some question about when you pay the price. RELATED:Clinton Email Scandal ExplainedClinton Foundation Scandal Special ReportIBD/TIPP Presidential Tracking Poll

36,PEG,"U.S. stock indexes got off to a timid start Friday morning, barely moving despite an upward revision to first quarter GDP.The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each were little changed. Volume in the stock market today was lower on both major exchanges. Trade often fades before a holiday.The stock market will be closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.Bulls got some good news before the market's open. The second reading on first quarter GDP growth moved the peg to 1.2%, up from the previous reading of 0.7%. The Street had expected a small upward revision to 0.8%.In response, the CME Group's FedWatch Tool raised the odds for a quarter-point rate hike in June to 87.7%, up from 83.1% Thursday and 73.8% a week ago. Higher interest rates should be helpful to banks, but the bank stocks haven't gained much from the outlook. Going into Friday's session, the money-center group was up about 1.4%, which is roughly in line with the S&P 500.The two banks in the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average skidded. Goldman Sachs (GS) dropped 0.6% and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) trimmed 0.3%. Of the 30 Dow components, only 10 were up in early trade.On the growth-stock side of the market, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) gapped up 5% in fast volume. The company reported after the close Thursday. Earning popped 41%, topping the consensus view by about 14%. Revenue surged 22%, edging above estimates.Ulta's same-store sales increased 14%. E-commerce sales leapt more than 70%.

37,PEG,"Looking for some ideas for your portfolio? Want to boost the octane in your retirement account? Then check out how American Funds and Fidelity Investments — the second- and third-largest mutual fund complexes after Vanguard as of Dec. 31, according to Morningstar Inc. — were allocating their shareholders' money.The main lesson for individual investors? Even the smart money, in the form of these two fund families, can disagree about some key decisions.The three sectors in which their stock fund weightings differed from each other the most were information technology, consumer staples and energy.Fidelity's stock funds overall had 26% of their shareholders' money in tech, the group's largest sector weighting, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research for research firm CFRA.American Funds was well below that, with just 18% in tech.American Funds had more in consumer staples, 9% vs. only 7% for Fidelity.And American Funds had more in energy, 10% vs. just 6% for Fidelity.We recently dissected recent big buys by Fidelity, so here's a look at some big fourth-quarter buys by American Funds, whose 64 stock mutual funds were up 4.90% year-to-date as of Feb. 28, according to Morningstar Inc. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, was up 5.94%.American Funds boosted its share count in chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) by a whopping 43%.Analog Devices has a top-notch 98 Composite Rating from IBD, a peg under the highest possible on a scale from 1-99. The stock's earnings per share rose 6%, 2% and 68% in the past three quarters. Share price is up 14% this year going into Monday.Drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was another stock in which American Funds made a big increase in its share count, adding 40% more to its stake.Bristol-Myers has a weak 61 Composite Rating. Share price has been trending lower since mid-July. Shares are down 2% this year but have rallied 22% since Jan. 26, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' consensus view and cut its 2017 guidance.One reason for Bristol-Myers' rally is that its cancer drug Opdivo recently won approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer. It got a similar green light in Europe last year.American Funds jacked up its number of shares in Facebook (FB) by a net 39% in Q4. The stock has a good 92 Comp Rating. Shares have climbed 19% so far this year.Alphabet (GOOGL) is another name in which American Funds raised its bet, by 16% in the social-media giant's case. Share price is up 7% so far this year.Additional tech-oriented bellwethers were among the stocks in which American Funds made net new buys, including consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL), chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) and software titan Microsoft (MSFT).But the big fund family hedged its bets in some other tech titans, including net redemptions in chipmaker Intel (INTC) and Amazon (AMZN). It also trimmed big-box building products chain Home Depot (HD).Trims did not mean that individual mutual funds within the family had lost faith totally with individual stocks. Home Depot, a Q4 trim, remained a top-10 position in some of American Funds' largest portfolios.Home Depot was a top-10 holding by $84.9 billion Fundamental Investors (ANCFX), whose 10 biggest positions also included Amazon. Three net new buys — Broadcom, Microsoft and energy equipment and field services company Schlumberger (SLB) — were also top-10 positions in the fund, according to Rosenbluth.The $90.6 billion American Funds Washington Mutual Investors (AWSHX) also had top-10 positions in Home Depot, Microsoft and Schlumberger.While Schlumberger was prominent in some individual funds, American Funds overall also made Q4 net big buys in integrated energy giant Chevron (CVX), boosting its share count by 4.8% to 70 million by the end of Q4.The fund group also boosted its share count in Royal Dutch Shell by 7.3% to 96 million.American Funds trimmed its share counts in several consumer-staples stalwarts. It trimmed 15% of its shares in household products giant Procter& Gamble (PG), soft drink leader Coca-Cola (KO) by 9.2% to 234 million and tobacco company Philip Morris International (PM) by 4.1% to 157 million.RELATED:Despite Brief Jitters, Investors Still Favor Online Leaders And Infrastructure PlaysMutual Fund Managers Cite Tech, Financial, Energy And Industrial Names They Like For '17

38,PEG,"U.S. stock indexes sailed to new highs in late afternoon trade Wednesday as volume picked up for a second straight day and the building sector stirred.The Dow Jones industrial average popped 0.8%, clearing the 20,000 mark for the first time in history. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 1% and 0.8% respectively. Small caps moved in like form as the Russell 2000 added 1%.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Tuesday's levels in the stock market today.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, building-related stocks — such as homebuilders, heavy construction, wood products and cement — were leading the way up. The day's biggest losers included steel makers and gold miners.While the Dow's outlandish sounding number may have little meaning in itself, the mileage marker did complement the market's bullish mood.Most stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average were up, and eight scored gains of 1% or more. Boeing (BA) led with a 4.2% gain and Caterpillar (CAT) was second with a 2% gain. Both attracted heavy volume, which suggested that institutional buying was behind the move.Caterpillar broke out of a flat base, clearing a 97.50 buy point. Caterpillar will release Q4 results Thursday morning.Boeing reported quarterly results before the open that beat the Street's consensus estimates on sales and earnings.IBD'S TAKE: David Ryan, a William O'Neil protege, comments on the current stock market.In the S&P 500, breakouts included data storage firm Seagate Technology (STX), electronic parts provider Te Connectivity (TEL), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Martin Marietta (MLM) and Parker-Hannifin (PH).In the Nasdaq 100, breakouts included chip designer Marvell Technology (MRVL) and contract manufacturer Flex (FLEX).IBD's proprietary growth-stock screens also featured some breakouts.

39,PEG,"Workday (WDAY) stock fell Tuesday after Citigroup downgraded the enterprise software maker, which is removing guidance on its billings as it adopts new accounting rules.Workday late Monday reported fourth-quarter revenue and profit that topped expectations and forecast full-year fiscal 2018 revenue slightly above views.Workday announced it adopted a new revenue recognition standard, known as FASB 606, a full year before required implementation. Workday said it is the first software company to adopt FASB 606, which makes revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.""Management took away billings guidance for future periods and is making further changes to the sales force to incrementally focus on midmarket,"" said Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst in a report. ""Both these could cause investor angst and we look at midmarket as a lower-return market vs. enterprise. The company is adopting 606 early, which will bring quarterly revenue backlog disclosure with a likely realization in Q1 that annualized backlog grew slower than total.""Morgan Stanley analysts noted: ""Unfortunately, early adoption of FASB 606 and the withdrawal of billings guidance results in lack of clarity on the near-term growth trajectory.""Shares of Workday sank 8% to close at 82.93 in the stock market today, tumbling well below a buy point of 88.10.IBD'S TAKE: Seacoast Banking, Western Alliance Bancorp, and Broadcom are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the 606 rule takes effect in 2018 or fiscal 2019. It will affect many companies but likely will have the most impact on businesses with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue, contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks, or third-party sales distribution channels.FASB 606 is the biggest change in accounting standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Workday, like bigger Salesforce.com (CRM), has a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, business model and customers buy renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time software licenses.Adobe (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT) and Splunk (SPLK) are among software stocks that are transitioning to SaaS but still have considerable licensing revenue.Some analysts downplayed Workday's removal of billings guidance.""We believe that the removal of billings guidance only represents a temporary gap in transparency and expect the company to give further metrics around contracted revenue on the 1Q earnings call,"" said Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst in a report.Justin Furby, a William Blair analyst, said in a report: ""Management elected to discontinue providing billings guidance, as 606 drives an even bigger disconnect between billings growth and future revenue growth (it can now recognize revenue ahead of invoicing for ramped deals).""RELATED:Workday Swings To Profit, Revenue Outlook Bullish, But Stock FallsWorkday Stock Pops, Signs Wal-Mart In Its Biggest Deal EverThese 4 Software Stocks Are In Buy Range Right NowMeet The 'Fastest-Growing' $1 Billion Enterprise Software Firm

40,PEG,"If you're in the market for a car, there are some good reasons not to buy Chevrolet's new Bolt if, say, you insist on leather seats, take long road-trips to the middle of nowhere, or have a boat to tow around.If not, however, General Motors' (GM) new long range electric vehicle will be at the very least entirely sufficient for your needs. At best, it will be a giddy surprise.It wasn't supposed to be this way. The first affordable electric car to top 200 miles on a single charge was expected to be a vehicle of compromise, a bundle of ""buts."" Indeed, the most impressive things about the Bolt are the attributes it lacks. The car is not tiny, boring or slow. And it handily topped its goal, coming in with an EPA-estimated 238-mile range, almost exactly the distance between New York and Boston or Washington D.C.It is not, however, a looker. ""Pragmatic"" is probably the best adjective to describe the car. It looks like a stubby pod, cluttered by a smattering of busy design cues — swooping creases, bits of black plastic, and too many lights.The odd design works like clown-car magic on the interior, however. Chevy managed to peg the driver's seat high for a commanding view of the road, while leaving plenty of headroom for tall people in the front seats and in back.Editor's Note: This is a review of the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt from Bloomberg's Kyle Stock. The Bolt's design is neither futuristic nor timeless, but that's likely the point. GM has boldly designed electric cars in the past and it didn't go so well. The Bolt simply looks like a lot of other contemporary cars — a little Buick Encore, a little Honda (HMC) HR-V and a dash of BMW i3. The shape grows on you. It's athletic; small without being wimpy, sturdy without being bloated.Darin Gesse, senior manager of GM product strategy, admitted that design took a second seat to function.""We talked to customers about what they wanted and it all came down to range and price and range,"" he said. ""Everything else wasn't even second on the list; it was like 9th.""Forget about curb appeal. On the road, the Bolt is charming. It's quick, even for an electric car, thanks to a relative dearth of weight and clever gearing of the electric motor. It accelerates eagerly all the way up to its 95 mile-per-hour limit.Steering is tight and precise with plenty of weight and feedback. The ride is simultaneously forgiving and firm, thanks to GM's chassis-tuning expertise and the big slab of a battery. The 60 kwh lithium-ion monolith keeps the vehicle grounded through turns, stiffens the frame and absorbs the typical vibration that comes with pushing a box of metal through the air at highway speed.That massive battery, however, comes at a hefty price. GM spends about $9,000 on each one compared with a couple hundred bucks it costs to build a small gasoline engine. The yawning chasm of cost is clearly recouped somewhat inside the car. The cockpit is a cheap collage of plastic and hard rubber that feels down-market even on a $30,000 vehicle. It is ""nice"" in the way Ikea furniture is ""nice,"" which is to say it is thoughtful, pragmatic, and not terrible looking. You just don't want to touch it too much.The important bits are better. The 10.2-inch touchscreen in the dash is both responsive and intuitive to use. There's Wi-Fi — which actually works.Behind the steering wheel, the 8-inch digital gauge cluster is sharp and useful. In addition to the current speed, it prominently displays a real-time array of ranges: the maximum, minimum and average amount of miles left on the battery, which are constantly calculated based on how the car is being driven and how hard the climate control system is working. Chevrolet appears to be almost bragging about the car's range and, like most electric carmakers, it subtly encourages efficient driving by gamifying the experience.One of the Bolt's best features is a regenerative braking paddle behind the wheel, which simultaneously slows the car and recharges the battery when pulled. After 20 minutes of driving, I found myself hardly using the floor pedal. It's addictive, engaging and a constant prompt of the car's raison d'être.So how did GM pull off a $30,000 car with 200 miles of range? Tesla's (TSLA) promise to deliver on the same equation is still about a year away (longer if you ask Morgan Stanley). Many have expressed surprise about how soundly GM beat the most innovative car company in the world to the punch. But, this race wasn't won by engineering brilliance. It was a financial battle between David and Goliath. This time, Goliath won, which shouldn't shock anyone who understands economies of scale.At Tesla, unit economics are a brutal reality. With only two cars right now, the company's fortunes rocket or swoon every time it misses or beats production estimates by 1,000 vehicles. Musk has plenty of magic tricks to throw in the mix — from solar panels to giant garage batteries — but at the end of the day, the per-car calculation is hard to escape.IBD'S TAKE: General Motors shares are in the right side of a cup base that started forming in December 2015. Tesla, meanwhile, has yet to revisit the 291.42 all-time high it reached in September 2014. GM can spread costs and revenue over a fleet of about 40 vehicles and four separate brands. It buys parts by the trainload and sourced parts and engineering solutions from across the company. The Bolt's gear-selector comes from Buick. The nifty rearview mirror, which is essentially a camera most of the time, is courtesy of Cadillac.GM didn't need to go on a building spree either. It's had an assembly plant outside Detroit since 1983, and it's been building Chevrolet Sonics there for five years. Batteries, meanwhile, are just another part that can be ordered. GM was able to source its power-packs from LG Chem in Korea.The company is expected to lose somewhere in the neighborhood of $9,000 per Bolt, but it likely doesn't crunch the numbers that way. The vehicle is part R&D exercise and part marketing expense. Battery costs are sure to come down.As they do, expect Chevy to keep the price static and dial up the details a bit. And with electric vehicle mandates escalating in 10 states, the Bolt will let GM sell more swanky Silverado pickups at much fatter margins without paying penalties or buying credits from competitors. In that sense, the Bolt is a 3,600-pound chunk of Musk-level game theory.""Tesla loses money on every car too,"" said Bill Visnic, editorial director of the Society of Automobile Engineers; GM is just better equipped to mitigate that loss and leverage it into gains elsewhere.Regardless of what President-elect Donald Trump has planned, California and nine other states will require 15% of new vehicles to be zero-emissions (read: electric) by 2025. European countries, meanwhile, are passing resolutions to ban gasoline engines entirely by 2030.In a few years, a long-range, affordable electric car will no longer be a novelty. Chevrolet has simply made a very good version of that machine before anyone else. It's a winner-take-all market, but only for the next few months when competitors will begin rolling off the line. Almost every automaker has now committed to making electric vehicles, most recently Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Mercedes (DDAIF).It's unlikely the Bolt will crush Tesla's nascent Model 3. It has made essentially the anti-Tesla, a vehicle long on utility and short on sexy.What the Bolt will do is lure thousands of buyers who would otherwise buy a conventional car and immediately make obsolete almost every other electric car on the road. At this very moment, thousands of Nissan (NSANY) Leaf owners are quietly kicking themselves.""You go after the big piece of the pie and hopefully get a lot of it,"" Gesse said of the car's broad approach to the market.So how will the Bolt sell? Chevrolet says early demand is outstripping supply, but when we strolled through GM's Orion Assembly Plant, it was only making about 100 Bolts a day. Chevy churns out Camaros twice as fast. But GM didn't make the Bolt because it thought it would outsell its most popular models. It made it because it could.

41,PEG,"U.S. stock indexes stepped up to nice gains Tuesday afternoon as citizens went to the polls to choose a new president and Congress.The Nasdaq rose 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was up 7% on the NYSE but down 10% on the Nasdaq. Election Day is often a day of routine volume. The day after a presidential election is more prone to active trade, though it too can be quiet.Blue chips were mostly up, with winners leading losers in the Dow by a 5-1 ratio. The biggest gainer was insurer Travelers Companies (TRV), which rose more than 2%.In the S&P 500, Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) led with a 7% pop. The copper, gold and silver miner is working on a base. The Street expects Freeport to earn 23 cents a share this year, up from 2015's loss of 13 cents a share. In 2017, analysts peg earnings at $1.14 a share, which would be a 396% increase. Both estimates have been raised by analysts.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, chip designer MaxLinear (MXL) thrust up 10%. On Monday, MaxLinear beat the Street's consensus views on earnings and revenue.Second best in the IBD 50 on Tuesday morning was Priceline Group (PCLN). The online travel services firm gapped up 7% to a record high in strong volume. Priceline also beat the Street's numbers on the top and bottom lines.Stocks jumped up Monday after news that the FBI had once again cleared Democrat Hillary Clinton in an email probe. The reaction seemed to suggest that the big money favors Clinton.The stock market could get a surprise for Wednesday's session if Republican Donald Trump pulls off an upset. Most polls had Clinton winning, but two polls dissented. The Los Angeles Times/USC tracking poll said Trump led by 2 percentage points in the four-way race. The IBD/TIPP poll also pegged Trump's lead at 2 percentage points in the four-way contest. Percentages were rounded off. The IBD/TIPP poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.The polls, however, were not adjusted for the Electoral College's state by state results. So, it's possible a candidate could win the presidency without a popular majority.Trump has unsettled the Street with anti-free trade talk, but also has promised an aggressive cut in the corporate tax and a repeal of ObamaCare.The new makeup of Congress, though, could toss cold water on the plans of either Clinton or Trump for good or bad.RELATED:Trump Holds Lead In IBD/TIPP PollIs IBM About To Become A Buy?

42,PEG,"At this summer's DR1 Invitational race at Los Angeles' Sepulveda Dam, a vast, sun-baked plane of concrete, drones the size of overgrown insects carved wide cursive loops through the dam's broad archways. They threaded through slalom posts and shipping containers, punctuated by saw-toothed bursts from their rotors, and sailed to the finish line past a handful of quiet spectators and a few white tents containing tables scattered with toolboxes, extra drones and extra parts.The drones themselves can hit speeds of 80 miles per hour. And they crash a lot -- propellers snap off, frames get bent, the GoPro (GPRO) cameras often mounted to drones to capture video get smashed. That also means the pilots can gauge more quickly what propellers, batteries, frames and controllers work and which don't.""You'll find the technology in the drones that we're racing is newer than most of what is used in commercial applications, or in even military applications, because our development time is so rapid,"" said Chris Thomas, founder of the racing league MultiGP, which helped organize the race. ""We're creating this massive furnace for innovation.""The sport has grown big enough that Disney's (DIS) ESPN will air races and started with an introductory program Thursday. Meanwhile, Amazon's (AMZN) drone delivery plans and Facebook's (FB) intentions to use drones to strengthen internet access are helping to push the aircraft into the mainstream. But flying under the radar is a loosely-knit community of tinkerers creating a groundswell of activity that some have compared with the early years of the PC revolution embodied by Apple (AAPL) a generation ago.And as these drone wildcatters stumble upon ways to improve the aerial devices -- and forge a regulatory framework -- an array of companies is also circling to tap into the entrepreneurial energy.""The drone industry is probably one of the first open-source hardware industries,"" said James Peverill, CEO of GreenSight Agronomics, a Boston-based startup that uses drones for agricultural imaging and analytics and which has done work with golf courses and agrochemical giant Syngenta (SYT).""It almost harkens back to the beginnings of the personal computer industry,"" he added. ""In the late 70s, people were experimenting with computers in the basement, and when Apple Computer was founded, they basically used a lot of the ideas and technology from that DIY community that had hatched.""While few public companies are pure-play drone stocks, the financial industry has been offering broader exposure to the market. PureFunds describes its Drone Economy Strategy ETF (IFLY), which debuted in March, as the first exchange traded fund devoted to tracking the commercial drone market.The fund's holdings include Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other defense contractors, drone-maker AeroVironment (AVAV), GoPro and its chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA).""We've seen drones start to transcend the initial aerospace and defense uses into many different industries and sectors around the world,"" PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin told IBD. ""Trying to play the drone industry -- or any early-stage industry -- by picking one or two companies can be a pretty difficult and volatile proposition.""Amazon has been approved to test delivery drones in the U.K, and Alphabet (GOOGL) this summer got the OK for limited delivery-drone testing in the U.S. But despite the entrance of several tech Goliaths, the drone space is still so wide open that upstarts can aim high.Back when Amazon's drone plans were in a younger stage, Skycart, a drone delivery startup in San Jose, Calif., that started roughly four years ago, was trying to sell companies on the idea of using drones to send things.""Those companies thought we were joking,"" said Lukas Wrede, the company's CEO.Then, Amazon published a video demonstrating Prime Air, its future drone delivery service, and Wrede initially thought Skycart was done for. But he rethought.""If such a big company gets a lot of attention and they also have a powerful lobby, then they could probably influence the market in our interest,"" he said. ""And that's what they did.""Skycart also continued to improve its drone technology, enhancing its autonomous-flight and drop-off capabilities and its abilities to carry packages weighing 10 pounds, up from an earlier target of 5. Today, Skycart has started several delivery projects with their customers, which Wrede characterized as Amazon rivals who have become more aware of the possibilities of drone delivery. Among them is one of the biggest shipping express companies in the U.S., but he declined to identify it.Meanwhile, at the University of Southern California, assistant professor John Carlsson has been developing a delivery model in which drones carrying packages bounce between a moving delivery truck and their destination -- potentially cutting time, traffic and fuel costs.His means of testing this particular model? A drone and a skateboard. Still, he said, he has been approached by a handful of companies, including a multibillion-dollar retailer that sells a variety of products, but which he said is ""not Amazon.""He said he will be ""working on a project with them that will involve drones"" in the next several months that will either incorporate the delivery model or his other drone-related research, which has been backed by U.S. defense funding.""The kind of thing that we work on specifically is really applicable to any situation where you have one large vehicle, and a collection of smaller vehicles that are somehow tied to that,"" he said.As more drones swarm the skies and raise the risk of midair collisions, regulations have struggled to catch up, forcing the community of drone racers and other enthusiasts to cobble together solutions -- similar to the way they improvise technologies for their drones.The Sepulveda Dam race was two years in the making, said Brad Foxhoven, CEO Blockade Entertainment, one of the DR1 race's organizers. Thomas, of MultiGP, said that conversations had to happen between the site's owner and with the FAA, and a film permit had to be obtained.""Nothing like that has ever been permitted before,"" he said. ""We essentially had to look toward the jungle, take out our machetes and cut a path. We're building a sport from scratch.""Permitting, in general, though, is ""like they're trying to put a round peg into a square hole,"" Thomas said.The FAA and Transportation Department in June finalized regulations for small drone use, and the rules took hold last month. Still, some state and local officials are seeing a drone up close for the first time and regulators face information gaps. For example, the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act requires drone operators within five miles of an airport to notify that airport of their presence, but the lines of communication weren't always clear. So companies saw an opening.""People were knocking on the door of the airport manager or calling on the phone and saying 'Hey I'm going to fly my drone at the 7-Eleven,' "" said Ben Marcus, CEO and co-founder of Santa-Monica-based tech company AirMap. ""Airport managers were like: 'What am I supposed to do with that?' ""AirMap's technology offers up a smartphone-accessible map of what's happening in the low-altitude airspace. Their technology lets airports know what drones are in the skies nearby, and provides a communications platform between pilots, airports and others. If you're flying a drone and, say, a jet approaches, AirMap will send an alert. The technology can also provide information on temporary flight restrictions -- wildfires, a sporting event, presidential visits, Marcus said.More than 100 airports use AirMap's technology, including Los Angeles International Airport, Houston's George Bush Intercontinental and other U.S. hubs, said co-founder Gregory McNeal.""Ultimately, when Amazon and Google and other companies are looking to make deliveries, they're going to need to know about all of these types of pieces of low-altitude airspace information, some of which is dynamic,"" McNeal said. ""So the county fair comes to town, and the Ferris wheel goes up. The Amazon drone should know about that before it ever gets to the county fair.""Back at the DR1 race, the Sepulveda Dam was decorated with logos for Pepsico's (PEP) Mountain Dew and Doritos as well as Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD). The event was broadcast on Twitch, the gaming-centric streaming service Amazon bought in 2014. And in August, the 2016 National Drone Racing Championships took place in New York, an event broadcast via ESPN.And in separate announcements Wednesday, ESPN and U.K. media giant Sky struck deals with the Drone Racing League, another racing group, to broadcast five races over 10 episodes. An introductory broadcast is set to air Thursday on ESPN2, with the others to be broadcast there, ESPN and Sky Sports Mix in October. Sky, which is 39% owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA), also invested $1 million in the league.Blockade Entertainment's Foxhoven, meanwhile, said his company has had ""multiple conversations"" with people in the e-sports industry, some of whom attended the DR1 Invitational.As the racing community gains more mass appeal, the innovations it has made are starting to trickle out. The Drone Racing League has had ""quite a few outside parties"" approach them about potentially licensing its radio-system technology for non-drone-racing uses, founder and CEO Nicholas Horbaczewski said.""It's been fun to discover that in the process of developing this for a particular purpose, in this case sports, we've developed technology that has a broader application that can be used in other capacities in a positive and productive way,"" he said in an interview.Peverill, of GreenSight Agronomics, said his company uses a flight controller sometimes used in racing. And some companies are also scoping out racing events to see how drones can help their own products.Staff from GoPro, the event's title sponsor, attended the National Drone Racing Championships partly to get more of a sense of how drones could be used to provide more immersive, closer-to-actually-being-there camera work, said Scot Refsland, chairman of the Drone Sports Association, which organized the event.Enterprise data-storage giant EMC (EMC), which also backed the event, ran live demos of virtual reality technology there. AIG (AIG), a partner in the event and an issuer of drone insurance, has been working with the DSA to generate ideas on how to improve insurance for aerial devices as low-altitude airspace grows more crowded and complicated, Refsland said.Elsewhere, Justin Haggerty, founder of the competing International Drone Racing Association, said his organization has attracted interest from telecommunications companies looking to learn more about their technology. Among them was Korean telecom giant KT Corp. (KT), which Haggerty said is looking at ways to use drones for broadcasting.Meanwhile, the educational nonprofit Drones Pilot Federation sees drone racing as a crossover into education. Henry Minden, a vice president in the group, said the aerial devices have the potential to teach younger people, ages 12 to 30, about computer programming, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and assembly, and create new jobs in those areas.""You want to know how to go faster than the rest,"" he said. ""So you find yourself immersed in this world of physics, aerodynamics, electrical engineering and computer science.""In the process, many people involved in the informal community of drone enthusiasts have become advocates for wider application of the devices, which are still best known for their years of use in the military.""If I could just share this with more people, and especially take away the negative connotations,"" said Tommy Tibajia, one of the pilots at the DR1 race. ""Because, whenever I'm flying, (people) are like, 'Stop spying on me!' I'm like, 'Lady, trust me. I'm not spying on you.'

43,PEG,"U.S. stocks gripped most of the day's gains in midday trade Wednesday, as top-rated stocks showed encouraging action.The Nasdaq popped 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. Small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 edged up less than 0.2%.Volume in the stock market today was running slightly higher on the NYSE and 5% lower on the Nasdaq vs. the previous session's pace. Trade has been above average on the Nasdaq in each of the past six sessions. The high volume corresponded to the Nasdaq's peg of a new high and then its decline off that high -- not the kind of action the bulls prefer to see.The new high in fast trade was bullish, but the decline in fast trade is bearish.Top-rated stocks, however, had no trouble finding volume as they rose Wednesday. In the IBD 50, a proxy for leading stocks, eight stocks rose in heavy volume.Five logged gains of 3% or more: computer networking company Gigamon (GIMO), up 8%; network equipment maker Arista Networks (ANET), up 4%; China-based online gamer NetEase (NTES), up 4%; cloud-based provider of software and services LogMeIn (LOGM), up 4%; and optical interconnect products provider Acacia Communications (ACIA), up 3%.Apple (AAPL) broke past a 110.33 buy point in torrid volume. The stock, though, has a Composite Rating of 40, which puts it behind 60% of the stocks in IBD's database. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, biotech and fiber-optic names posted the biggest percentage gains. Solar and wholesale drug suppliers were the weakest groups.

44,PEG,"For eight years, TTT Moneycorp Ltd. regularly took Dariusz Suchicki to dinner and soccer matches, all while selling him, as the head of finance of a U.K.-based importer of Polish foods, a series of complex currency derivatives.When the pound started moving sharply against the zloty, those instruments became toxic: They began costing Suchicki's company, Best Foods, tens of thousands of pounds a month, the company said in court filings last year. Now, as Britain prepares for Brexit, blow-ups of this type of complex financial instrument are surging.About a quarter of all U.K. small and midsize enterprises routinely use hedging tools to manage currency risk, broker Afex Markets found in a survey carried out in 2015. Many of these instruments are highly leveraged, and can result in magnified losses for companies hit by big currency swings.Since the pound plummeted 12% after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, lawyers say they have been inundated with inquiries from companies that claim they were cajoled into buying similar esoteric products. The concerns come as British firms are already bracing for economic headwinds likely to accompany a future outside the European Union.Like Best Foods, many of those companies claim they were pressured into buying products they didn't fully understand and whose risks weren't properly explained -- so-called misselling. The derivatives sold to Best Foods were so numerous and of such ""exceptionally high complexity,"" the firm said, that Suchicki lacked the expertise and equipment to evaluate them.In the court documents, Moneycorp said that by entering the contracts, Best Foods acknowledged and understood that ""trading in options, even when used to cover a commercial position, may involve a high degree of risk and is appropriate only for persons who are able to withstand the risk of loss."" The firms settled out of court this year. Both declined to comment for this article.""It's not until the tide goes out that you discover the hidden risks of some derivatives products,"" said Alberto Thomas, a founding partner of Fideres Partners, a consultancy that works with law firms to bring misselling claims. ""We have seen a rise in cases of less sophisticated investors who were sold highly structured products which turn out to be of little or no use as hedging instruments,"" said Thomas, who wasn't involved in the Best Foods matter.The story of the unsophisticated investor buying complicated financial products and later facing costs they can't bear is a familiar one. Thousands of public authorities, from Jefferson County, Alabama, to Saint-Etienne, France, have paid millions of dollars to terminate swaps that soured. In the U.K., nine banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc, paid 2.2 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) in response to claims they missold interest-rate swaps to 18,000 customers.The difference this time is that many of these instruments are sold by lightly regulated brokers, because bigger banks have grown fearful of getting embroiled in another potential scandal, said Robin Henry, a partner at London law firm Collyer Bristow LLP, which advised Best Foods on its case. These brokers cold-call prospective customers, offer their services in newspaper advertorials and motivate their sales people with fat commissions, lawyers said.The derivatives subject to misselling claims have names like ""seagull"" and ""two-times leveraged accelerated knock-out, knock-in forward."" Most follow a standard format: The company agrees to buy a certain amount of currency each month based on the foreign exchange rate at the time.In the short term, it gets a better deal than it would get in the spot market or by using simple forwards. However, if exchange rates fall outside a given range -- after Brexit or the Swiss government's 2015 decision to ditch its currency peg, for example -- covenants are triggered that force the company to purchase much more currency than it needs or buy at unattractive levels.""We've seen examples of companies who need to swap $50 million worth of currency a year but, because of the leverage, they end up being obliged to buy $500 million,"" Collyer Bristow's Henry said. ""That's where you get these losses of $10 million or $15 million, which are completely unsustainable and take these companies completely by surprise.""Suchicki's problems started in early 2013, when the pound, spurred on by a buoyant U.K. economy and a series of Polish rate cuts, began a two-year ascent versus the zloty. Ordinarily, such moves would have helped the bottom line of Best Foods, which imports Polish meats and vegetables into the British market. Instead, according to the legal filings, the company suffered heavy losses. At one stage, the company said it was paying as much as 16 times more than it would have in the market to transfer pounds into zlotys.It's unclear just how many companies are struggling with soured contracts like these. Vedanta Hedging Ltd., a firm that provides financial expertise for lawyers who bring misselling cases, has helped its clients settle seven currency product cases, and says it has received 18 inquiries since the June 23 Brexit vote. Collyer Bristow is currently working on about half a dozen cases.Few are likely to make it to court, according to Clive Zietman, a partner at Stewarts Law. ""We are seeing more of these types of claims, but we are talking about small businesses, and it's prohibitively expensive to bring action,"" said Zietman. ""They are complicated, there's a lot of evidence work, and banks and other sellers will fight them.""The total market for foreign exchange derivatives is close to $3 trillion globally, according to the Bank of International Settlements' most recent review, but most of that is made up of transactions among large financial institutions, funds and sophisticated multinationals.Still, the money to be made from the small and midsize companies market has attracted big players. In August 2014, Bridgepoint, one of the U.K.'s biggest private equity firms, acquired Moneycorp in a deal worth 212 million pounds. The previous year, World First UK Ltd. sold a 40 percent stake to U.S. private equity firm FTV Capital for an undisclosed sum.A spokesman for Bridgepoint declined to comment. World First and FTV Capital didn't reply to e-mails seeking comment.The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority has seen little evidence of widespread misselling and doesn't view it as a significant problem, according to a person at the regulator, who asked not to be cited by name. The FCA declined to comment.So far, at least, many brokers have been willing to work with companies to find a solution behind closed doors -- either through restructuring, delaying payments or increasing credit limits.The situation could change if the pound continues its Brexit-spurred descent because most buyers of the derivatives haven't posted enough collateral to cover the losses they would face, according to Collyer Bristow's Henry. The currency is currently on track for its longest losing streak in three weeks versus the dollar. If enough businesses are affected, it would be the brokers' profits that ultimately get slammed.

83,PEG,"Nonfarm payrolls rose by 255,000 in July, the Labor Department said Friday morning, much better than expected for a second straight month, and reviving sentiment about the U.S. economy. But while the Federal Reserve will take notice, markets aren't expecting Fed action for several months.The jobless rate held at 4.9%, while hourly earnings rose 0.3% and the workweek nudged higher.Economists expected nonfarm payrolls up 185,000, the jobless rate dipping to 4.8% and average hourly earnings 0.3% higher.Also, June's strong figure was revised up by 5,000 to 292,000. May's weak hiring was revised up by 13,000 to 24,000.""Maybe it's not morning in America, but the coffee is brewing and jobs are being created,"" said Joel Naroff, president and chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors.Professional services, hospitality, retail and government sectors were key contributors. Manufacturing also rose in a broad-based gain. Mining, which includes oil drilling, showed further declines.The labor force participation rate rose 0.1 point for a second straight month to 62.8% as the labor force climbed by 407,000. The household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed an employment gain 0f 420,000.""The July jobs report was uniformly positive and strong,"" said IHS Chief Economist Nariman Behravesh in statement. He said the strong labor force gain ""signals greater confidence among US workers about job prospects.""Behravesh did note that ""as the economy approaches and reaches full employment, the pace of jobs gains is likely to slow.""Stocks soared on the jobs report, with the S&P 500 hitting a fresh high and the Nasdaq composite rising to within 1% of its all-time best.Normally, back-to-back strong jobs reports and bullish markets would raise the specter of a Federal Reserve rate hike. But with other economic reports looking less robust -- and other central banks such as the Bank of England and Bank of Japan increasing monetary stimulus --- U.S. policymakers are still seen on hold for the foreseeable future.Fed funds futures peg the odds of a September or November meeting hike below 20%, vs. below 10% before the jobs report. The odds don't top 50% until next March, though investors see a reasonable chance of a December move.""Given the unevenness of the data and still-present imbalance in the economy across sectors with a relatively solid consumer and markedly weak business investment, policy makers are likely to wait for further information regarding the longer-term trajectory of activity,"" wrote Stifel Fixed Income chief economist Lindsey Piegza.Strong hiring and solid wage gains --  holding at post-recession high of 2.6% vs. a year earlier -- should underpin consumer spending, which the economy has relied on even more in recent months. Consumer spending rose at a brisk 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, even as the overall economy grew about 1% for a third straight quarter.But recent corporate reports have raised doubts about consumer-related stocks and perhaps the broader economy.Apple (AAPL) reported a second straight quarter of declining earnings and revenue. Apple shares have rallied as per-share earnings and iPhone sales topped weak forecasts, but they reflect weak demand.IBD'S TAKE: For a more detailed look at consumer-related stocks' recent woes, click here.Ford Motor (F) last week missed second-quarter earnings estimates, citing sluggish U.S. sales and higher incentive spending climbed. Ford predicted domestic industry sales would fall in 2016 and 2017. On Tuesday, Ford and General Motors (GM) reported declining sales vs. a year earlier. Other automakers generally reported weaker-than-expected results.Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) also have reported weaker-than-expected U.S. comps, both citing consumer unease in part. Several analysts see restaurant stocks in trouble generally, though pizza chains are doing well.Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday reported weak July unit revenue, hitting airline stocks that day.Despite retailers' headwinds, the sector added 25,000 jobs last month.Manufacturing added 15,000, the best since January. Auto production had been a manufacturing driver for several years. If Ford, General Motors and others see flat to lower sales for the foreseeable future, that could hurt factory output and jobs. And with oil prices well off midyear highs, any hoped-for revival in energy-related jobs may also be short-lived.

84,PEG,"The biggest change in accounting standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will shake up how public companies book revenue, in many cases resulting in earlier recognition of sales.And the ripple effects could touch everything from earnings and taxes to bonuses, commissions and buyout decisions.The new FASB ""606"" rule developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board takes effect in 2018 or fiscal 2019. It will affect many companies but likely will have the most impact on businesses with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue, contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks, or third-party sales distribution channels.In the short term, stock market investors will sometimes have a tougher task in discerning corporate trends because current financial results might not be comparable to previous quarters. Sales and earnings also might be more volatile, potentially affecting stock prices.""The new revenue recognition standard is one of the biggest accounting events we've ever seen,"" said Dusty Stallings, a partner at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""It's going to be a tough exercise for most companies.""IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks to buy usually are powered by a strong revenue stream. But smart investors look at revenue within the context of a company's overall financial performance. IBD calculates a unique rating for every stock that does just that. For an explanation and a list of stocks that rate highly now, read Paul Whitfield's new article ""Don't Judge Sales In A Vacuum.""Some of the businesses that could be most impacted are telecom stocks AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) and computer software stocks such as Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT), analysts say. AT&T stock rose 0.2% Friday to 43.16, while Verizon shares were off 0.5%. Adobe climbed 2% Friday and Microsoft 1%.Just about every tech company has said in regulatory filings that it's evaluating how the new standard could impact financial statements. That includes Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Facebook (FB), Intel (INTC), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Qualcomm (QCOM).But the new FASB 606 revenue standard will affect most other industries as well, including media, entertainment, aerospace, biotech, health care, construction, auto, defense, real estate and franchisers, such as restaurants. Boeing (BA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are among stocks assessing the standard's impact.And companies will need to adapt more than just their financial statements.

""There is now going to be a unifying principal that is agnostic to industries.""For many software and some other tech stocks, the new standard might speed up the timing of revenue recognition vs. today's GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) guidelines. They'll have to recognize revenue immediately, not over the broad length of some contracts. Often, the companies won't know exactly what revenue to disclose, so they'll be asked to make more estimates and judgment calls rather than rely on the old rules.Computer makers and other companies that sell products through distributors likely will book more revenue upfront. They'll need to estimate, based on historical data, how much product will eventually be sold to end users through the distributors, and then book that amount.""Certain industries will recognize revenue sooner than they have in the past, and software is one example,"" Stallings said. ""But the change in guidance from the very strict rules today to the (new) requirement to make estimations is going to go across a lot of industries.""Key to the new accounting rules is that revenue must often be booked right away and not stretched out over time. AT&T and Verizon will likely book more revenue from smartphone sales upfront, rather than over the course of a lease contract or payment plan.If software companies fast-forward revenue recognition, there could be an uptick in acquisitions, says Todson Page, another partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. That's because smaller companies may be more attractive takeover targets if deals are earnings-positive immediately, or at least within a few quarters.""From a deal justification point of view, it may help some buyers because it would allow them to reach GAAP accretion numbers quicker,"" said Page, PWC's U.S. technology deals leader.Changes on the top line, of course, can affect a stock's earnings.""The new revenue standard has the potential to change not only the top line, but also the bottom line,"" Wesley Bricker, deputy chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a May speech.Earlier recognition of sales would help the bottom line at first, but it would lead to lumpier earnings overall, as more revenue is booked upfront and less over the duration of a contract or long-term license.Companies might have less deferred revenue that they book over time. Thus, the FASB 606 standard means they might have less leeway to manage earnings and meet consensus estimates by accelerating or deferring revenue.One broad aim of FASB 606 is to bring U.S. revenue recognition in line with international financial reporting standards, which are also being overhauled. A goal is to make it easier for investors to compare stocks across industries and countries, says KPMG's Kalavacherla, also a former member of the International Accounting Standards Board.Companies will have to chose just how to comply with the new standard. Some companies will opt to restate sales for some prior years, while others will take a modified compliance route, applying the new rules only to existing and future contracts as of the effective date.Telecom, media and entertainment companies are among those most likely to restate revenue, analysts say.And that likely would be the cleaner tack, says Kalavacherla. With the modified route, he says, less trend information will be available to investors and analysts. ""That comparative data will be lost,"" he said.In 2015, FASB delayed the effective date of the new revenue standard for one year to 2018 after companies asked for clarifications. Some companies are still griping.FASB has said it is not considering another delay. Some analysts, however, say the rules are still in flux.""The rules simply don't make sense right now,"" said John DiFucci, a software industry analyst at Jefferies.At a JPMorgan conference in May, some software companies hedged when asked how soon they'll be affected by the standard.The accounting changes come amid a huge change in the computer industry that finds software companies shifting from one-time licensing fees to subscription-based, software-as-a-service business models. Under the FASB 606 standard, only software that is ""continuously updated"" can be recognized over time — and that applies for most SaaS.Companies that have had SaaS business models from the start, such as Salesforce.com, might be less impacted by this change than others, analysts say. Adobe, Microsoft and Splunk (SPLK) are among software stocks that are transitioning to SaaS but still have considerable licensing revenue. The timing of revenue recognition for software licenses could be accelerated, says Citigroup.A KPMG survey found many companies are taking a wait-and-see approach. They haven't upgraded IT systems, recalculated contracts or taken other steps to comply with the new standard. Such companies are more likely to take the modified approach in complying with the standard, rather than restating financial statements.Since companies will need to make more estimates in revenue recognition, they'll need to disclose more historical and other data in footnotes, says KPMG, which will improve transparency, a plus for investors.The new standard also is a business opportunity for startups that offer financial software designed to help in revenue recognition. Among such companies are Leeyo Software, Zuora and Revstream.As Leeyo CEO Jagan Reddy told IBD: ""This is going to be a real challenge for auditors.""

116,PEG,"Free Markets: China's devaluation of the yuan confirmed suspicions about the country's economic health. But the real problem is policy. It's time for China to reconsider its state model.Markets were shaken on the surprise announcement from the People's Bank of China that it was devaluing its currency by 1.86%. Fear of competitive devaluations from China export rivals such as the Asian Tiger states and Mexico was also in the air.The Chinese central bank insisted that the devaluation was a one-off act done only in the interest of free markets and stability. But as one observer at Nomura Securities in Hong Kong told the financial press, the only reason the markets reacted as strongly as they did is that they didn't believe it.And that goes to the heart of the matter: China's currency regime, for all its supposed nods since 2004 toward a free-floating regime, remains a state-controlled system, with central planners struggling to keep up with market verdicts about money supply and interest rates and making mistakes in the process.No matter how the system changes, it's still prone to errors. Ironically, the claim to provide stability in the name of keeping wild and untamed markets on a leash is precisely what's leading to the instability today.""The problems that the Chinese central bank faces are the same as all other central banks that attempt to fix or stabilize their currency,"" said David DeRosa of DeRosa Research and Trading, whose 2001 ""In Defense of Free Capital Markets"" was praised by Milton Friedman.""The reversal of the stabilization leads to gross instability, whether the peg is designed to keep the exchange rate artificially high or low. Switzerland just found this out recently, and now it is China's turn.""Johns Hopkins University economist Steve Hanke points out that China has tried to fashion a freer market regime in response to pressure from the International Monetary Fund and the Obama Treasury Department. Both have pushed China to maintain the appearance of a float over its more rigid pre-2004 peg.The problem, Hanke said, is that monetary policy has been manipulated so that the yuan could only rise.The imbalances that created, along with a slowdown in an economy that can build only so many empty shopping malls and half-completed skyscrapers without commerce to fill them, are what led the devaluation.So for all of China's ambitions to make its yuan as powerful as the dollar by trying to please the IMF, the net result is that its devaluation looks a lot like 1994's.The real free-market mechanisms for monetary policy are twofold, Hanke says. ""One is a free-floating rate with full convertibility and no intervention. The other is an absolutely fixed exchange rate with full convertibility governed by a currency board system like Hong Kong. Either one is free market.""What is not free market is ... an exchange rate pegged for a while which they jiggle around until they make another mistake.""

117,PEG,"A marriage that at the time left many in Silicon Valley scratching their heads will be a thing of the past, as Symantec (SYMC) said Tuesday that it would sell its Veritas data storage business to private equity firm Carlyle Group, valuing the deal at $8 billion.The security software maker's purchase of Veritas in 2004 for more than $13 billion left many on Wall Street wondering about the synergies, as many analysts viewed the two businesses as incompatible, though Symantec stock did hit its all-time high that December, above 34.Last year, Symantec said it would split into two companies, the Symantec and Veritas businesses, but rumors of a possible deal with Carlyle surfaced last month.""While this potential transaction has been discussed in recent media reports, today's news should come as a relief to investors as Symantec finally unloads this 'decade of agita' since the Veritas acquisition was done and now can laser-focus efforts on beefing up its legacy security platform through aggressive M&A with cash from this transaction,"" FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note. ""The Veritas acquisition, in our opinion, remains one of the most head-scratching transactions we have seen in the tech space over the last 15 years and has been a black cloud around the Symantec story, as the company has struggled to reinvigorate its security segment while integrating this square peg in a round hole.""Privately held Carlyle will be joined by GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, in the purchase. The deal is expected to close this year.The deal includes $6.3 billion in net cash proceeds that go to Symantec. The rest involves increases in share-repurchasing programs.In a statement, Symantec CEO Michael Brown said the sale paves ""the way for Symantec to grow its security business and increase its lead as the world's largest cybersecurity company.""Symantec early Tuesday also reported earnings for its fiscal Q1 ended July 3 that missed Wall Street expectations.Symantec stock was down 4.5% in early afternoon trading Tuesday, near 22.The company reported adjusted net income of 40 cents a share, down 11% from the year-earlier quarter and missing the 43 cents predicted by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.

"
118,PEG,"The unexpected U.K. vote to leave the European Union has predictably set off a flight to safety, sinking global equity markets and Treasury yields, while boosting the value of the dollar.The immediate consequences are the opposite of what the weak global economy needed and have just put further pressure on the Federal Reserve and other central banks that were already running low on firepower.While there's much uncertainty about how the EU's second-largest economy will disentangle itself from the economic and political union, and while the process will play out over two years or more, economists are now forecasting a brief U.K. recession in 2017.Yet the U.K. only accounts for about 2.4% of global GDP, meaning that even a moderate recession is something the rest of the world should be able to take in stride. So why would global markets come unglued over Brexit? The short answer is that there's a lot more at stake than just U.K. GDP.""It is not an exaggeration to suggest a new world order will need to be defined, and further changes to the EU's composition clearly cannot be ruled out,"" wrote Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research. ""This is a momentous day for the U.K., but also for the EU -- investors simply can no longer make the assumption that the status quo will always prevail.""The Brexit vote will provoke ""a crisis of confidence in the whole (European) integration project,"" wrote Daniela Schwarzer of the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. ""Market pressure may be particularly high on the southern periphery where sovereign debt is reaching unsustainable levels and instabilities in the banking sector persist. The situation is particularly fragile as Portugal, Spain, Italy and France all have weak leaders or face political instability.""Still, Schwarzer writes, there is an opportunity for France and Germany to offer reforms in short order that address ""what people seem to worry most about: security, welfare and migration.""For now, though, uncertainty about the future of Europe and concern about the disruption of trade are likely to weigh on investment and growth. IHS Global Insight, which had been forecasting 1.5% GDP growth in Germany in 2017, now sees growth of 0.4% to 0.9%.U.S. economic growth also may take a small hit. A stronger dollar after Brexit will hurt the earnings of U.S. multinationals, make domestic manufacturing less competitive and dampen capital investment. Global banks and travel-related stocks, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), American Airlines (AAL), Priceline (PCLN) and United Airlines (UAL) were among Friday's biggest losers.The dollar's rise also could trigger bigger problems in emerging markets, especially China, which could come under further pressure to ease its currency peg as the country tries to keep its economy from slowing too much. Slower global growth also will be a negative for commodities prices.Federal Reserve policymakers were divided earlier this month between those who wanted to raise rates one more time in 2016 and those who favored two hikes. Now, Fed rate hikes appear to be off the table for the foreseeable future, after a lone hike in December 2015The CME Group's FedWatch tool says markets are pricing just a 22% chance of another rate hike by the policy meeting next Feb. 1.The Fed released the following statement Friday morning: ""The Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring developments in global financial markets, in cooperation with other central banks, following the results of the U.K. referendum on membership in the European Union.""The Federal Reserve is prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding markets, which could have adverse implications for the U.S. economy,"" it said.The 10-year Treasury yield fell 17 basis points to 1.57%, hitting a four-year low intraday, as prices for the safe haven asset climbed. In the short term, this should be a positive for the housing sector, for consumers who refinance their homes and for auto purchases.As far as actually boosting growth, it's not clear that the extraordinary measures already tried by the Fed, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan can make much more of a difference. The ECB and BOJ continue to conduct asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, and more recently have tried negative rates, with little or nothing to show for it.""Monetary policy ... may have become counterproductive at the margin,"" wrote Andrew Bell, the chief executive of Witan Investment Trust in London. ""The next phase will need to create a source of demand"" via fiscal policy.Thomas Simons, senior money market economist at Jefferies Fixed Income, told IBD that Brexit will increase the urgency of central bank policy that puts money in the hands of consumers, rather than quantitative easing that reduces borrowing costs but requires an appetite for lending to work.While the U.S. economy remains in relatively good shape because it is domestically fueled and services-oriented, he thinks the Bank of Japan is going to have to lead the way in a so-called helicopter drop: ""transfer cash directly to the treasury, then the treasury would have a large amount of fuel"" to propel the economy out of its funk.

119,PEG,"Are the exit polls, on which just about every elections analyst has relied, wrong? That's a question raised by New York Times Upshot writer Nate Cohn -- a question whose answers have serious implications for how you look at the 2016 general election.Standard analysis is that Democrats have a built-in advantage because the electorate is increasingly non-white. The exit polls say the white percentage of the electorate declined from 77% in 2004 to 74% in 2008 and 72% in 2012. In that year, they said, 13% of voters were black, 10% Hispanics, 3% Asian.Since then, these groups have been voting heavily Democratic, by varying margins, and analysts have argued that it's very hard for a Republican to win, especially one who has antagonized non-whites, as Donald Trump has.But exit polls may not be accurate, Cohn argues. As he points out, they are designed not to accurately represent the proportions of each demographic group, but to indicate the actual result, within a statistical margin of error, and to show the differing responses of significant subgroups.Moreover, as Cohn doesn't mention, the results are massaged by the exit pollsters and media analysts, who are aware that some voters (the young, for example) are more likely than others to fill out exit poll questionnaires.So Cohn looks at two other sources of information on how people voted, the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey and the Democratic firm Catalist's voter file compiled from public voting records.Both sources, like exit polls, have their weaknesses. Many non-voters tell the Census Bureau they voted. Voter records are often erroneous or out of date. Even so, the two sources paint a significantly different and possibly more accurate picture of the electorate than the exit poll.The CPS and Catalist report that the 2012 electorate was 74% and 76% white -- higher than the exit poll's 72%. They say that only 15% of voters were under 30, not 19% as in the exit poll, and that 61% and 62% were 45 or older, not 54% as in the exit poll.Most significantly, they peg the proportion of non-college-graduate whites over age 45 -- Donald Trump's core group -- as 30% and 29% of voters, significantly higher than the exit poll's 23%.Assuming these data are correct, Cohn estimates that 34% of Barack Obama's voters in 2012 were non-college whites, not the 25% that the exit poll indicates. Obama's share of that demographic fell in 2008, but mainly in the South, and held up in most of the North, including target states Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa and Colorado.In other words, Democrats are more dependent on non-college whites than most analysts assume. For years they've lost ground among this group, but they could lose more, in which case Obama's 51% 2012 majority may not be duplicated.Current polling shows Trump running better than Romney among non-college whites. But he's also running worse among white college graduates, and so makes no gains among all whites.But note that one thing pollsters have difficulty gauging is turnout. Contrary to widespread impression, turnout -- and particularly Democratic turnout -- has been declining in the Obama years. Obama received 3.5 million fewer votes in 2012 than 2008. Cohn presents data showing turnout down, especially among young white Democrats.That resembles something visible in this year's primary results. Overall, Republican and Democratic turnout was just about the same. But up through April 5, when the outcomes were in doubt, Republican turnout was 5 million higher than Democratic. In target states the Republican edge was 1.6 million.Republicans also had a 5-million turnout edge in states with open primaries, in which voters could choose which party to vote in. The 4 million Democratic turnout edge in post-April 5 primaries, almost all closed, was baked in by pre-existing Democratic registration advantages.This is a vivid contrast with 2008, when Republican turnout exceeded Democratic in only five states, two with primaries desanctioned by national Democrats (Florida, Michigan), two in heavily Mormon Utah and Idaho, plus Alabama, Arizona and Nebraska.Primary turnout proved a harbinger of the heavy turnout favorable to Democrats in November 2008. It's not clear whether it will this November, or whether the exit polls are wrong. But both are signs that Trump's chances might -- might -- be better than current polling suggests.

120,PEG,"Fears of a broad cybersecurity freeze could amplify after vendors Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and FireEye (FEYE) missed April-quarter expectations and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and Imperva (IMPV) guided toward slower growth.Then again, rather than a broad slowdown, the pure-play security leaders might in fact be losing some business to tech giants Cisco Systems (CSCO) and IBM (IBM), which are expanding deeper into security, and to specialized security vendors such as CyberArk Software (CYBR), Proofpoint (PFPT) and Mimecast (MIME).""Investors tend to look at security as a single sector, and the reality is you have a lot of different plays here,"" Pacific Crest analyst Rob Owens told IBD. ""In aggregate, we're seeing relatively consistent spending. There is some shifting that is happening, but that makes sense.""Security spending overall rose 13% year over year in Q1, barely down from 14% growth in Q4, Owens says. He says those growth rates are consistent with the past two years.Palo Alto, Fortinet and Check Point all had been hot stocks in 2014 and much of 2015 on the strength of their broad security platforms, but not this year. The focus has shifted to specific security areas such as privileged account management, email and cloud security, and endpoint protection, analysts say. So, while some vendors might be slowing, others are rising, Owens says.Fears of a broad security slowdown go back to last year, Owens told IBD.""We've been having this end-of-the-world discussion for a year now,"" he said. ""Certain vendors that may have been growing at rapid rates (have) decelerated.""Palo Alto Networks -- the No. 2 security software company by market cap, behind Check Point -- is an industry bellwether.Last month, Palo Alto disappointed Wall Street. It guided to 37% year-over-year sales growth for the current quarter, which would be great for most companies but would represents the highflier's slowest-ever growth. Last quarter was the first in eight where its sales rose less than 50%.But the slowdown is relative, Pacific Crest's Owens says.""Palo Alto will continue to perform well, but it can't continue to grow at four times the industry,"" he said. ""Fifty percent to 60% growth is unsustainable.""Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski anticipated slow April demand for Palo Alto products, citing checks with resellers.But Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick characterized the April slowdown as a ""blip"" in a typically seasonally weak quarter. She blamed FireEye CEO David DeWalt for the panic. During FireEye's fiscal Q3 earnings call in November 2015, DeWalt said ""emergency spending"" in the wake of the notable Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) breaches had normalized.""The CEO of FireEye last year said, 'You're just not having all these big breaches and we're not getting attacked from China as much, so spending is slow,'"" she said. ""So, everyone has been chanting the mantra.""(DeWalt is set to step down June 15, leaving COO and Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia to take the reins. FireEye acquired Mandiant in 2014.)Palo Alto Networks wasn't the only pure player to spot braking growth. On May 5, FireEye guided to its slowest quarter ever, and Imperva's outlook for this quarter would mark a fourth straight quarter of sales deceleration. In April, Check Point guided to 6% growth for Q2, down from six straight periods of 9% growth.Fortinet expects sales growth to slow to 27% in Q2 from 34% growth in the prior quarter. And even email specialist Proofpoint -- among those analysts peg as on the rise -- guided to its slowest quarterly growth in 11 quarters, to 32% growth from 37% the prior quarter.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group reflects fears of a general tech slowdown. The group was down as much as 34% for the year in early February, hitting a two-year low, as many tech stocks tanked on dour views from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA). The group has since recovered in part, but is still down nearly 16% for the year.Cybersecurity Ventures Managing Editor Steve Morgan says pure players like Palo Alto, Check Point and Fortinet are no longer good barometers for the health of the industry. Instead, thousands of venture-capital-backed startups -- as well as tech giants increasingly expanding their security presence -- are gouging share.In Q1, IBM pulled in $400 million in security sales -- topping Palo Alto, Fortinet and FireEye, and closing in on Symantec (SYMC) -- up 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and accelerating from 12% growth in all of 2015. Its overall sales fell 5%. For its fiscal Q3 ended April 30, Cisco said its security sales jumped 17% year over year, accelerating from 11% growth in fiscal Q2.Still, the accelerating growth for the IBM and Cisco security businesses falls short of the decelerating growth for most of the pure players. The big companies, though, aren't going away.Microsoft (MSFT) swept three cybersecurity players off the public map in 2015 via acquisitions, but the company doesn't break out its cybersecurity revenue, Morgan points out. And Dell subsidiary SonicWall, acquired in 2012, is potentially pulling in billions, but since Dell is now privately held those figures aren't reported publicly.""That revenue just goes away from what's reported in the public market,"" Morgan told IBD. ""Unless you cover the market really carefully, you won't hear about it.""But the cybersecurity VC market is still booming, he says. In 2015, Dow Jones estimated that $1.9 billion in VC funding was spent backing cybersecurity startups, Morgan says. At one time, it was unheard of for cybersecurity startups to raise more than high single digits in funding, and ""now we're routinely seeing (funding hit) $50 million, $75 million, $100 million.""Those VC-backed companies are ""competing aggressively in the market,"" Morgan said. ""But if they're not public, their revenue figures aren't necessarily being reported.""As private businesses like MalwareBytes, the Herjavec Group (tied to Robert Herjavec of the ""Shark Tank"" TV show) and Black Duck Software begin to achieve scale, they'll further steal share from the publicly traded security firms, Morgan says.Pacific Crest's Owens sees pent-up demand. He says companies still aren't spending enough on security. He ballparks annual IT spending overall near $1 trillion, and cybersecurity spending at $25 billion to $30 billion.""I think security has been an under-spend area for decades,"" he said. ""You're spending about 3% of your capex (capital expenditures) that's focused on IT on security. That's relatively low. Some regulated industries like health care might be two or three times that, but there's still a long way to go.""Building up security spending takes time, Owens says.""There's that perception that you're able to spend an unlimited amount of dollars overnight within security, but that's just not the case in reality,"" he said. ""It's not an overnight type of thing.""Network security still has headroom, Owens says, and he sees products focused on authentication, detection, remediation and endpoint solutions as leaders. Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury pegs privileged account management -- CyberArk's bread and butter -- as the industry's next growth vector. Dougherty's Trebnick expects email security providers like Proofpoint and Mimecast to pick up share. Morgan's bet is on cloud security.Meanwhile, Symantec, Juniper Networks (JNPR), Barracuda Networks (CUDA) and FireEye will continue to struggle, Owens says. Symantec may ""throw out billions in cash flow"" to survive attempts to transition from legacy antivirus to next-generation endpoint protection. FireEye is shifting to a subscription model. Juniper and Barracuda deal with broader macro issues outside cybersecurity, he says.So, back to the original question: Is security spending slowing?Not for many, Morgan says.""What I think you're seeing is a squeeze on the pure-play company,"" he said. But overall, instead of any slowdown, ""I think we're entering an uptick. Spending is up, undoubtedly.""

141,PEG,"A good stock idea isn't much use if you don't understand what you're looking at. Is it an institutional-quality stock? Is it a cyclical play that probably will only profit from its industry cycle? Is it a turnaround story that involves the fixing of a company problem? Is it a fad stock that will run hot until people tire of the novelty?
"
142,PEG,"The strategy and target will differ for each of these situations, and it will vary by the kind of uptrend the market is in.Peg the stock wrong or the market wrong, and you will probably lose money or at least make less than you should.If an investor is going to make big money, institutional-quality stocks, operating in a strong uptrend, will most often be the investor's best choice. However, there are times when a cyclical stock, turnaround or fad stock can deliver good gains.Where can an investor find or identify great stock ideas? Your Weekly Review (YWR), also known as the 85-85 list, is a good place to look in Friday's IBD.In this screen, stocks must score an 85 in EPS Rating and in Relative Price Strength Rating. The 85 means that the stocks must be in the top 15 percentile among stocks in IBD's database. Stocks also must be within 15% of a 12-month high.Charts are listed by industry group, but charts aren't printed for every stock. Additional stocks are listed in the fine-print listing on the last page of YWR, today on A8.The big net makes the 85-85 a good place to look for stock ideas. A low-hurdle screen will pick up more cyclicals, turnarounds and fad stocks than a high-hurdle screen.Some people sneer at ""fad stocks."" They argue that such stocks are dangerous, won't last and aren't for serious investors.Well, all stocks are dangerous. While fad stocks might have a shorter life, sometimes all we're talking about is a solid company indirectly benefiting from a fad.For example, egg producer and distributor Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) rode the Atkins diet to big stock gains in 2003.In other cases, fads develop into longer-lasting trends.For instance, Deckers Outdoor (DECK) bought UGG Holdings in August 1995 and eventually turned the Ugg boots — once popular mostly with surfers — into a broader fashion trend.From October 2002 to October 2011, Deckers Outdoors shares rose 9,193%, with Uggs deserving much of the credit.How might the 85-85 be used?Let's look at the 85-85 screen that was published in IBD on Oct. 24, 2014, not long after a market low and the Oct. 21 follow-through day. A follow-through day soon after a market low is often the best time to scout for breakouts, retaking of buy points and bounces off the 10-week moving average, as seen in the minicharts.An investor could've found five institutional-quality stocks in the 85-85 that soon set valid entries: Apple (AAPL), Celgene (CELG), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Illumina (ILMN) and Skyworks (SWKS). Gains varied from 15% to 79%.Four cyclicals in the 85-85 eventually offered entries: Landstar System (LSTR), Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), FedEx (FDX) and Lennar (LEN). Gains ran from 11% to 15%.Turnarounds and fads were scarce.The market itself was and had been choppy, which is why taking a 10% to 15% profit in Apple was prudent.

143,PEG,"Ruckus Wireless (RKUS) stock roared back Thursday on better-than-expected Q2 revenue, as analysts said a rebound might be underway at the maker of Wi-Fi networking gear.Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Ruckus late Wednesday reported in-line EPS. Ruckus stock soared 16% in morning trading in the stock market today, at a three-month high above 12.A slowdown in education spending has been an overhang on Wi-Fi gear makers stocks, including Aruba Networks, acquired earlier this year by Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).Federal funding for educational spending on broadband might finally arrive in late 2015, analysts say. And Ruckus might gain from cable TV and phone company customers.""Schools are just now receiving their funding letters and we expect a pickup once school session begins,"" said Mark Sue, an analyst at RBC Capital, in a research report. ""We peg this multiyear (industry) opportunity for Wi-Fi at $1 billion, significant enough for Ruckus to see accelerating growth if it claims its share. Our 2016 revenues of $444 million are conservatively pegged at +19% growth.""Said Troy Jensen, analyst at Piper Jaffray, in a report: ""The company saw some modest (federal) E-Rate funding come in during the June quarter, but we believe once K-12 spending ramps in the 2H, Ruckus will continue reporting solid growth and operating leverage.""Ruckus also has upside from other sources, including a corporate upgrade cycle to next-generation Wi-Fi technology.The enterprise market — big corporate, government, education and health system customers — has the highest average selling prices and margins for network gear makers.Ruckus competes with Cisco Systems (CSCO), Aerohive Networks (HIVE) and Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT).In a challenge to Cisco, Ruckus and Juniper Networks recently formed a marketing alliance targeting enterprise customers.Cable TV companies such as Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) are expanding Wi-Fi networks.""Ruckus is well-positioned to benefit from movements both up-market (Juniper partnership) and down-market, as well as further activity from service providers, both with cable TV companies and mobile operators,"" said Jason Ader, an analyst at William Blair & Co., in a report.Verizon Communications (VZ) and other wireless firms are eyeing unlicensed spectrum, as IBD reported, possibly emerging as bigger customers of Wi-Fi gear makers.In Q2, Ruckus said revenue rose 14% from the year-earlier period to $92.2 million, topping Wall Street estimates of $88 million. Ruckus earned 9 cents per share ex items, in line with views.In the current quarter, Ruckus forecast revenue of $96.5 million at its midpoint, about $1 million ahead on consensus estimates. It guided to EPS at 10 cents to 13 cents, including costs from litigation expenses. Analysts had modeled 12 cents.""Management continues to exercise caution in its forecast as it relates to (education spending),"" said Tim Long, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, in a report. ""We believe the guidance for Q3 reflects a high level of conservatism.""

174,PEG,"Investors have lavished more love on iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) than on any other equity ETF so far this year.USMV has seen $5.28 billion in net inflow in 2016, helping assets balloon 82% to $13 billion.Investors in its category sibling, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), are likely feeling deflated and perhaps even a bit miffed.SPLV has soaked in a relatively modest $1.8 billion during the same period. That's despite gaining 8.4% over the past year vs. 6.7% for USMV.Both are faring far better than SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. stock market that has tumbled 1.4% in the past year.So why is SPLV proving less popular, as reflected in its in inability to attract more new money?Partly because this exchange traded fund gets knocked by rivals for being little more than a utility fund, says Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares.As of the May 20 quarterly rebalance, its weighting in the utilities sector actually went up a further 7.2% to more than 20%. It gained 13 stocks, including utility firms American Water Works (AWK), Entergy (ETR) and Public Service Enterprise (PEG). It also dropped 13 stocks, including T. Rowe Price (TROW) and Pfizer (PFE).SPLV screens for the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 and gives a bigger weighting to stocks with lower volatility.USMV also offers exposure to U.S. stocks with potentially less risk than the broader market. However, it constrains sector weightings to within a 5% band relative to the parent MSCI USA index.That holds appeal for institutional investors whose mandates and compensations are tied to closely following the benchmarks, according to Kalivas.""Our customers are more nimble advisors"" who are more apt to drift away from the benchmarks, he said.SPLV has no maximum or minimum sector-weight requirements. And that is a good thing, Kalivas argues. For example, the utilities stake in SPLV has varied greatly over the years. It was as high as 32% in 2011, went down to less than 3% in 2015, and is now ""marching back up,"" Kalivas pointed out.Right now, SPLV has no exposure at all to the volatile energy sector.""If a sector comes under stress and has a lot of volatility, you can avoid it (entirely),"" Kalivas said. He cites the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the earlier tech crisis as periods when SPLV's unconstrained methodology ""would have been a big help."" Neither SPLV nor USMV has a 10-year history.Critics point out that SPLV makes big sector bets in the utilities and consumer staples sectors. This ETF tends to get hit hard when sector or interest-rate risk comes into play.

The developer of human resources management software reported an across-the-board first quarter beat late Tuesday. The stock has been racing up the right side of a possible base, ending Tuesday 71% above a February low.A couple of notable market changes during Tuesday's tough session: the Nasdaq, already below its 200-day moving average, lost its grip on its 50-day line. The Russell 2000 dropped through its 200-day line in rising trade. Today's critical test for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 will be whether they can hold above the short-term lows marked on Friday.Global markets felt their share of selling pressure on Wednesday.

"
177,PEG,"A weaker dollar is just what the doctor ordered for U.S. corporate earnings and sluggish business investment. It also takes pressure off China's unstable currency peg and other emerging markets with excessive dollar-denominated debts and reliance on dollar-priced commodities.But global financial markets are starting to get spooked about just how much and how fast the dollar has sunk, casting doubt on whether the trend can continue. The biggest jitters are coming from Japan, where the Nikkei 225 index plunged more than 3% for the second straight session, prompted by the yen's surge to an 18-month high vs. the dollar.Meanwhile, the euro surged to a 15-month high of $1.16, before reversing and closing lower.While the dollar reversed to the upside, broad stock market indexes sagged Tuesday amid fresh economic news indicating that global growth prospects remain weak. The Nasdaq fell 1.1% to the lowest close since mid-March. The S&P 500 lost 0.9% to a 3-week low.Those reports followed Monday's ISM manufacturing index signaling that activity nearly stalled in April, and last Friday's GDP figures showing that the U.S. economy rose at a 0.5% annual rate, the weakest in two years.Even with the dollar weak, U.S. oil futures fell 2.5%, their second straight loss amid renewed concerns about too much supply. Prices of copper and other base metals were broadly lower.The one divergent economic note on Tuesday came from the U.S., where auto sales bounced back to a 17.4 million annual pace in April after dropping to 16.46 million in March, helped by the best Ford (F) results for April in years. Still Ford, General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) shares fell Tuesday, though Fiat Chrysler rose late after confirming a self-driving car deal with Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google.IHS Global Insight Chief Economist Nariman Behravesh isn't expecting to see the dollar go much lower from here and thinks it will begin to strengthen vs. the yen and euro as the Federal Reserve moves to hike rates, possibly as early as June in his view.""Any kind of currency move is a double-edged sword,"" Behravesh said, noting that Europe and especially Japan ""really are not in great shape"" to handle currency appreciation.The rise in of Japan's currency gathered steam after the Bank of Japan surprised markets by leaving policy unchanged last week, a disappointment after reports that it might provide negative interest-rate loans to banks. That came just after the Fed signaled that it was in no rush to raise rates. A stronger yen, which makes it harder for domestic producers to compete and depresses the prices of imports, is the last thing Japan needs as it battles deflation.A weaker dollar, on the other hand, is good news for U.S. multinationals from Apple (AAPL) to Alphabet to Wal-Mart (WMT) to General Electric (GE), which have cited the negative impact of currency adjustments on earnings in recent quarters.With both the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan in a fight against deflation, and both losing ground as their currencies gain ground, further aggressive action on their part might be needed to turn the tide. For now, markets seem to be testing their determination to resort to yet more unconventional measures.

"
194,PEG,"Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Tuesday signaled that the U.S. central bank should worry less about inflation at home than about global growth risks, such as the slowdown in China and depressed commodity prices.Those risks, and the reality that the Fed has little conventional monetary policy ammunition to counteract a downturn, means that ""caution is especially warranted"" when it comes to raising interest rates, Yellen said at the New York Economic Club.The dovish tone of Yellen's speech sparked a rally on Wall Street as financial markets pushed back the expected date of the next rate hike to September, reflected in Fed funds futures pricing.The S&P 500 rose 0.9% and the Nasdaq 1.7%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield fell 9 basis points to 1.80%, and the U.S. dollar index slipped 0.8%.Even if she would never admit it, Yellen's speech reflected her recognition that the U.S. -- at least at this moment -- has become central banker to the world.It's not that the Fed is putting other countries or the global economy above the U.S., but that the linkages between the economies via the dollar and global financial markets are too powerful to withstand.Yellen's shift in emphasis since December has been extraordinary, evidently triggered by the six-week rout in financial markets to start the year. While she didn't go so far as to acknowledge that the Fed helped fuel the turmoil by putting upward pressure on the dollar, it's clear the thought has crossed her mind.Yellen alluded to the market turmoil in her discussion of the risks associated with slowing growth in China.""There is much uncertainty . . . about how smoothly this transition will proceed"" and how severe any financial disruptions will be, she said. ""These uncertainties were heightened by market confusion earlier this year over China's exchange rate policy.""Likewise, Yellen discussed concerns that the decline in oil prices ""was nearing a financial tipping point for some countries"" reliant on oil exports. The result could be sharp cutbacks in foreign government spending and financial strains that could have ""adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global economy.""Both in China and other emerging markets dependent on commodities, the common thread is the U.S. dollar. The Fed's divergence from the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, both of which have resorted to negative interest rates, helped push up the value of the dollar.That, in turn, exacerbated problems in China, which couldn't afford a stronger yuan but also couldn't afford the fallout from giving up its dollar peg. In other emerging markets, corporations borrowing in dollars face a harder time servicing debt as the dollar rises.Asked why the Fed pulled back from its plan to hike rates four times in 2016, Yellen essentially said she wanted policy to be in the right place if global growth was weaker than expected and began to infect the U.S. economy.In a tweet, currency strategist Axel Merk interpreted Yellen's comments in his own words: ""Yellen: It's China's fault!""Yellen explained that the Fed's power ""to use conventional monetary policy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric.""While cutting rates to zero won't do much to help growth, the Fed has lots of ammunition to quell an acceleration of inflation if the economy surprises to the upside.

197,PEG,"Lions Gate (LGF) stock sank Monday after the third installment of its ""Divergent"" franchise, ""The Divergent Series: Allegiant,"" failed to impress at the box office, highlighting the importance for entertainment companies to have robust offerings across all media segments.""Allegiant,"" starring Shailene Woodley, grossed an estimated $29.05 million over its opening weekend, coming in second place to the Walt Disney (DIS) blockbuster ""Zootopia,"" which has held the top spot for three consecutive weeks. The latter film, an animated feature about a rabbit who joins an all-animal police force, brought in a weekend haul of $38 million, according to Box Office Mojo.Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil had expected ""Allegiant"" to earn $40 million in its first three days on screen. He downgraded Lions Gate to hold from buy on Sunday.""We view the results as indicative of an increasingly unpredictable box office and view 2017 guidance as difficult to peg down, given the volatility,"" wrote Mogil.The film also suffered from poor reviews, receiving only a 10% rating from movie-review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.After the fourth and last ""Hunger Games"" film hit theaters last November, the ""Divergent"" series was largely expected to pick up fans of the movie saga. But viewers may be wearying of young-adult dystopian sagas -- which is not good for Lions Gate. With the bulk of the media company's revenue weighted toward its movie arm, a disappointing franchise will drag on results.""'Allegiant' was expected to be the underpinning of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 estimates, not to the degree to which 'Hunger Games' had aided the fiscal 2013-fiscal 2016 results, but at least a goalpost with strong visibility,"" wrote Mogil. ""With 'Allegiant' now faltering, the impact going forward is material and more importantly brings into question how deep the Young Adult market is, a market which has brought in numerous entrants amid a movie-going environment which is increasingly very concentrated among fewer films.""Media conglomerates and studio companies have had to play defense amid mounting investor and analyst concerns over cord-cutting and the assertive march of Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) and other streaming services.Even Disney's epic box office success with the latest ""Star Wars"" film has only done so much to quiet chatter over ESPN's recent subscription declines, though its strong, diverse offerings among its studio, parks, consumer product and media network segments perhaps offer a buffer to singular concerns. The Mouse's cable network segment revenue, which includes the sports network, made up almost 30% of the company's revenue in Q1. Lions Gate's motion picture segment, which includes home entertainment and television revenue, accounted for over 75% of total revenue in its most recent quarter. Theatrical revenue alone made up over 27% of revenue.""While (Lions Gate's) Television and library businesses continue to be strong, there is no offsetting a weak new-release slate,"" said Mogil in his report.Lions Gate shares closed down 1.6% to 22.26 on the stock market today. Shares had found resistance at the 50-day moving average in recent days and and have yet to peek above that level since breaking support on Nov. 13, days before the theatrical release of ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part II."" The company has recorded a five-quarter-long string of earnings and revenue declines.Shares plummeted 27% on Feb. 5 following the previous day's release of weak Q3 results. Lions Gate was reportedly in merger talks with Starz (STRZA), though it is unclear whether that that discussion was continuing.Starz shares fell 0.9%. Walt Disney dipped 0.75%.

That in turn boded well for corporate earnings, lifting the S&P 500 to its highest level of the year.The Fed signaled Wednesday that it wants to make sure the economy builds up some momentum before it resumes normalizing interest rates. That was a much more inviting message than in December, when policymakers hiked for the first time in nearly a decade. They also promised at that time a steady diet of rate hikes in 2016 — despite a strong dollar, weak earnings, tepid growth and a plunge in commodity prices that raised fears of emerging market defaults.The central bank indicated that it now sees only two hikes this year, with markets still expecting only one tightening step.With the Fed no longer working at cross-purposes from other major central banks -- the European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and People's Bank of China -- as they aim to stimulate growth, commodities prices continued to rally, particularly in dollar terms. Crude oil prices rose above $40 a barrel for the first time in 2016.The U.S. dollar index, which measures its value against a basket of major currencies, fell below 95, down from 97 before the Fed decision and a 52-week high just above 100. It was the biggest two-day decline since 2009. The dollar index had been as low as 80 as recently as July 2014, before the Fed began to point to a 2015 rate hike as other central banks doubled down on quantitative easing with a side of negative rates.The euro rose to $1.13 on the dollar and is now closer to its 52-week high of $1.17 than its low of $1.05.The weaker dollar is positive for the export sector's competitiveness, provides a boost to earnings for companies sell a lot of their products overseas and should ultimately lead to more capital investment in the U.S., said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research.The S&P 500, home to multinational giants, rose 0.7% to its best level since Dec. 31.Companies from Wal-Mart (WMT), to Apple (APPL), General Electric (GE) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).  All have cited big negative impacts from currency swings in recent quarters. General Electric shares rose 2.6% on Thursday, breaking out of a cup-with-handle base. Alphabet edged higher, but Wal-Mart and Apple shares fell modestly.The Fed's statement on Wednesday noted net exports and business investment as two economic soft spots.Yet the U.S. manufacturing sector, which has been stabilizing, may be showing early signs of an upturn. Regional Fed surveys from the  New York and Philadelphia areas this week showed surprising, if modest, strength. U.S. manufacturing output rose in the first two months of the year, led by business equipment.U.S. tourism also stands to get some help from the weaker dollar, which may translate to higher hotel rates in major tourist destinations like New York, Blitz said.While the U.S. benefit of a weaker dollar has to be weighed against what it means for the eurozone or Japan, the greenback's strength had appeared to exacerbate growth concerns in China, which has been trying to ease the yuan's peg to the dollar without panicking investors.The dollar typically appreciates ""whenever there is a flight to safety,"" said Sara Johnson, IHS Global Insight research director, so it's not surprising to see a reversal in flows amid an improvement in confidence in the global economy.""The risks are still lurking but we have seen a notable improvement in recent weeks,"" she said.The euro has been rallying against the dollar since the ECB cut its interest rate on bank deposits further into negative territory but President Mario Draghi indicated that further interest-rate cuts weren't expected.Now, with the Fed signaling ""it's going to be a year of continued accommodation,"" the divide between the central banks isn't so stark, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income.Vasileios Gkionakis, global head of currency strategy at UniCredit Research, wrote that the dollar ""is set for a multi-quarter decline, correcting a sizable overshooting.""

199,PEG,"With the bears running wild on Wall Street, it's nice to know that investors can still find stocks that are not only rising but also pay nice dividends.Utilities have been among the few pockets of safety during the market's correction.Southern (SO), which provides electricity to 4.5 million customers in the Southeast, is approaching a 50.34 buy point of a saucer-with-handle base. It's up nearly 3% this year, while the S&P 500 is off more than 9%. Furthermore, the company's annual dividend of $2.17 a share yields 4.4%, nearly double the S&P 500 average of 2.3%.The Atlanta-based company reported Feb. 3 that Q4 profit rose 16% to 44 cents a share, accelerating for the third straight quarter and beating Wall Street estimates. However, revenue dipped 10% to $3.6 billion as warmer weather reduced demand.Pinnacle West Capital (PNW) provides electricity to 1.2 million customers in Arizona. It's up almost 5% this year as it hovers below a 70.10 saucer-with-handle buy point. Its annualized dividend of $2.50 a share yields 3.6%.The Phoenix-based company will report Q4 results Feb. 19. Profit is expected to soar 420% to 26 cents a share, rebounding from a 77% drop in the same period a year ago. Revenue is seen rising 5% to $763 million. Despite the choppiness, Pinnacle still has a three-year earnings stability factor of 4 on a scale of zero (most stable) to 99 (least stable).American Electric Power (AEP) is also working on a saucer-with-handle base. The Ohio-based electricity producer, which serves over 5 million customers in 11 states, is nearly 4% below a 63.73 buy point. The stock's annual dividend of $2.17 a share yields 4.4%. Like the other stocks in this list, American Electric has a rising relative strength line, indicating that it's outperforming the market.Public Service Enterprise (PEG), a New Jersey-based provider of gas as well as electricity, is shaping a cup-type base with a possible 44.28 buy point.

200,PEG,"Investors in income stocks typically hold for the long term. They're less interested in the daily or weekly ups and downs of a stock than whether it can deliver modest, but dependable, dividend increases year after year.So whether a stock is setting up in a base or not is of less interest that it would be to a growth investor hoping to catch the next rally.But on the theory it's good to get off to a good start with a stock, there are numerous stocks breaking out that are on IBD's dividend leaders list that are setting up in bases.Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG) is in the late stages of forming a cup base. It's New Jersey's largest provider of electric and gas service with 2.2 million electric and 1.8 million gas customers.It also owns a feet of power plants with more than 13,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.The company pays a regular quarterly dividend of 39 cents a share, which works out to an annualized yield of 3.7%. Earnings have not grown much in the past few years. The five-year annualized growth rate is a negative 2%.Duke Energy (DUK) serves 7.3 million customers in the Southeast and Midwest. It announced Thursday it's selling its international business, which consists of generating capacity in South and Central America.The stock has made a strong upward move the past two weeks and might be forming the right side of a base. The stock pays an 82.5-cent quarterly dividend, which works out to a 4.2% annualized yield.Another utility, Great Plains Energy (GXP) might be forming the right side of a base. It pays a 26.25-cent dividend, which equates to a 3.6% dividend yield.

201,PEG,"There once was a time in this country when the mission of schools was to teach academics. Unfortunately, academics are being replaced with politically correct, feel-good programs that have nothing to do with education and discipline. Some of these programs border on the fraudulent, while others go over the top. Way over.One program that's received a bit of national attention lately is based in San Francisco. The Pacific Educational Group provides consulting services for school districts that want to teach their faculties about the perils of ""white privilege"" and its impact on minority students.PEG apparently is in the business of sending messages that ""suggest that minority kids are incapable of learning and succeeding unless K-12 curriculum is specifically customized for them,"" says Steve Gunn, editor of the Education Action Group Foundation's EAGnews.org.This soft bigotry of low expectations is made abundantly clear when PEG instructs teachers to establish, as Gunn puts it, ""separate behavior expectations for minority students, because those students supposedly come from cultures with radically different values.""Gunn notes that ""one of the annual white privilege conferences in Wisconsin taught participants that minority kids frequently have a 'different value and view on time, missed days, working together, and wait time between questions and answers.'""Gunn says school systems have dumped $3.9 million on PEG between 2010 and 2015 for its ""services,"" which sounds to us like a lucrative racket — and makes us wonder how much better all students would be served if that money were spent on developing good teachers rather than programs nurturing the hollow ideas that the elitists have bought into.Read the entire report and go over the partial list of school districts spending taxpayer money on ""white privilege"" training for teachers, and decide if this is the sort thing we need in our country.

Those costs rose 37% year-over-year in Q4, to $4.7 billion.Rumors continue to swirl about the firm's long-term plans for its shipping program, as investors and analysts speculate that Amazon is interested in competing with established delivery companies such as UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Internal documents seen by Bloomberg seemingly support that theory. And, there have been reports of Amazon getting into the ocean freight business -- which one observers said could generate upward of $100 million in free cash flow -- as well as leasing cargo jets and making a large purchase of trucks to haul packages between its fulfillment centers. The documents seen by Bloomberg suggest Amazon is gearing up to compete more with China e-com leader Alibaba (BABA).Besides delivery costs, Amazon has spent billions of dollars on its fulfillment and sortation centers, the last step in the delivery process.Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer says Amazon.com captured 51% of all retail growth in Q4 2015.Amazon's Prime loyalty program offers free two-day shipping, as well as free streaming audio and video, among other perks.Analysts in general peg Amazon's Prime customer count near 40 million, with some estimates coming in as high as 50 million.

216,PEG,"What’s the hot group in the current stock market?The fastest riser among IBD's 197 industry groups and subgroups over the past three weeks is a group that usually attracts little attention. The Electronic-Miscellaneous Products group rose from No. 128 to 37th, or 91 places in ranks, as of Monday’s IBD.Let’s take a look at the five highest-rated stocks in the group, according to Stock Checkup at Investors.com.1. Universal Display (OLED) makes light-emitting diode screens for smartphones and other products. The company has five-year growth rates of 71% for earnings and 52% for revenue.On Thursday, Universal will report Q4 and full-year results. The Street expects quarterly earnings to rise 82% to 51 cents a share. Revenue is expected to jump 27% to $71.54 million.For the full year, analysts peg earnings growth at 22% and revenue at 23%.The stock broke out of a 42% deep base in early December, but the breakout failed. It often happens with a deep base. Sometimes a shallower base that follows works better.Universal is working on a new, 30% deep pattern now but needs to build more of the right side.2. InterDigital (IDCC) provides mobile technologies for wireless devices.The small cap grew earnings 26% last year, but the Street expects a 14% decline this year. In 2017, earnings growth is expected to check in at 29%.InterDigital could be working on a double-bottom base. The stock is 10% below the 55.05 buy point.3. Synaptics (SYNA) develops and markets interface technologies for electronic devices, such as touchpads.Earnings grew 36% in 2013, then 37% and 34%. However, analysts expect earnings growth to slow to 11% this year and 12% in 2017.The stock is climbing the right side of sloppy consolidation.4. Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) makes technology for tracking inventory via bar codes and radio frequency identification.The company will report Q4 results before the open Thursday. The Street expects quarterly earnings to jump 28% to $1.47 a share. Revenue is seen expanding 21.5% to $960.26 million. Full-year EPS growth is forecast to jump 39%, up from 2014’s 34% growth. However, earnings in 2016 are estimated at 16% growth.5. Trimble Navigation (TRMB) makes global positioning gear but also has been moving into the drone industry since 2014.Earnings declined on a year-over-year basis in 2014-16. However, the Street expects EPS to grow 12% this year and 13% in 2017. Revenue fell 4% in 2015 but is expected to rise 3% this year.Trimble’s business is somewhat seasonal. The second fiscal quarter ending in June is usually the strongest quarter because of the construction season. However, the diversification of the business into software and subscription revenue has made the company less seasonal.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Volume was lower across the board according to preliminary figures, suggesting institutional investors stayed largely on the sidelines after a three-day stock market rally. Losers were about even with winners on the NYSE, but led by a 3-2 margin on the Nasdaq.Oil, medical and software stocks were among the day's biggest decliners. West Texas intermediate crude closed below $31 a barrel after a U.S. report showed stockpiles rose to an 86-year high.IBM (IBM) led the Dow with a 5% pop, gapping up past its 50-day moving average in fast trade. Shares, which have trended lower since July, extended their win streak for a fourth session. The tech services giant acquired Truven Health Analytics for $2.6 billion. Morgan Stanley upgraded the tech services giant to overweight from equal weight.Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) provided the biggest drag on the blue chip index. The retail giant reported Q4 earnings slightly above views, but quarterly sales disappointed, as did its full-year revenue guidance. Shares closed 3% lower, after paring its loss from nearly 6%.Jack In The Box (JACK) gapped down and sank 16% in heavy volume to a 16-month low, excluding the Aug. 24 minicrash. After the close Wednesday, the San Diego-based burger chain reported disappointing fiscal Q1 results that sent shares down in extended trading. It blamed the all-day breakfast menu launch of a rival, aka McDonald's (MCD).Universal Display (OLED) led IBD 50 stocks with a nearly 6% jump in brisk trade, extending its advance for a seventh straight session. Shares nearly regained their 50-day moving average. Analysts expect the organic light emitting diode company to post an 82% earnings jump to 51 cents a share on a 27% sales increase to $71.5 million when it reports Feb. 25 after the close.Also on the IBD 50, landscaping equipment maker Toro (TTC) surged 4% in strong volume. It broke out of a cup with handle with a 75.22 buy point.Economic data were mixed. Initial claims for jobless benefits declined last week to the lowest since November. But the Philly Fed manufacturing survey index continued to show contraction and the Conference Board's index of leading indicators slipped, both in line with expectations.Friday's light economic data schedule includes the consumer price index for January and Baker-Hughes weekly rig count.

220,PEG,"China’s mainland markets were set to reopen Monday after their weeklong Lunar New Year shutdown. How they will behave after the break is not certain.But Hong Kong’s market, which restarted trade on Thursday, ended the short week down 5% and at its lowest close since December 2011.Another possible influence: Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 tanked 11.1% the past week in its worst week since October 2008.The consensus among analysts is that Shanghai is likely to fall rather hard when trade restarts. (U.S. markets will be closed for the President’s Day holiday.)But markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen sometimes play catch-up with Hong Kong and global markets after their new year’s breaks and sometimes don't. The markets remain highly insulated -- non-Chinese investors have only limited access, and a great many of the stocks are strictly domestic companies.Shanghai rallied 29% from September through November. It fell four of the past five weeks, closing last week 26% below its Dec. 29 high. Shenzhen traced a similar but, as usual, more exaggerated path.Shanghai stocks may feel some effect from China’s January export and import data, due out Sunday. Consumer and producer price indexes for January are expected on Wednesday. Any government action to further loosen the yuan’s already weak peg to the dollar could also weigh on next week’s trade.A group of 104 China-based companies trading on U.S. markets late Friday afternoon showed an average gain of about 1% late in the session. Search engine Baidu (BIDU) advanced 8% for the day on news of a bid for its video wing, and Noah Holdings (NOAH), an asset manager and brokerage serving China-based investors, climbed 6%.The leaders among China-based plays continue to be the for-profit educators: New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) and TAL Education (XRS).TAL Education tripped a sell signal by falling more than 8% below a 48.94 buy point following a Feb. 1 breakout. The stock has work to do before another viable buy point is likely to appear.New Oriental, on the other hand, has maintained an active cup-with-handle base. It has a 33.01 buy point and its other gauges are intact: Its RS Rating is strong, its Accumulation/Distribution Rating is A-, and its relative strength line is hovering near new highs.Both companies have reported their most recent quarterly results.

221,PEG,"As Hong Kong property prices slump with real estate stocks, investors are looking to the options market for protection.Traders paid the most in four years in January to hedge against losses on Sun Hung Kai Properties vs. the cost of bullish bets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A similar pattern emerged in options on Wharf Holdings.A measure of the city’s property stocks is down 33% in the past year, with losses accelerating in January as the Hong Kong dollar weakened and real-estate sales fell to the lowest in at least 25 years.Hong Kong’s home prices have dropped about 9.5% from their record high in September, according to an index compiled by realty company Centaline Property Agency. Investors are pulling money out of the city amid concern that it will be squeezed between China’s economic slowdown and rising interest rates in the U.S., which drive up borrowing costs in Hong Kong through the currency peg.Bocom International sees property values sinking as much as 30% this year, while UBS (UBS) says that may happen by the end of 2017.Short-term interest rates in Hong Kong have jumped since the end of last year, threatening to hurt housing affordability. Housing costs have more than doubled from the end of 2008, prompting the government to impose measures to curb prices that had become out of reach for many local residents.Implied volatility for three-month contracts -- with an exercise price 10% below Sun Hung Kai shares -- was 6.9 points more than on similar bullish contracts on Jan. 20, the biggest premium since October 2011.“Investors want to buy some put options in order to hedge the downside risk as they are expecting property stock prices to fall,"" said Sam Chi Yung, a strategist at Delta Asia Securities, noting that the purchases are more likely for hedging than for speculation.To maintain its peg with the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong must match interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The weakening yuan is also adding to the pressure by eroding the purchasing power of mainland homebuyers, according to some analysts.Amid the gloom, rock-bottom valuations on most property shares has spurred some brokerages to recommend buying the stocks. Hong Kong’s biggest developers and landlords trade at average 8.2 times reported earnings, compared with 16 times globally.For Pauline Dan, the head of Greater China equities at Pictet Asset Management, the worst for homeowners might be still to come.

223,PEG,"Bill Ackman is finding out the hard way the lengths policy makers are willing to go to defend their currencies.Bets against China’s yuan and the Saudi Arabian riyal, made by the billionaire founder of activist hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, have largely failed as hedges against the effects of slumping Chinese stocks and declining oil prices due to intervention by the nations’ central banks, Ackman wrote in his annual letter to investors released Tuesday. Pershing, which has almost $15 billion of assets under management, lost 20.5% in its publicly traded fund last year.“Both China and Saudi Arabia have inadvisably, in our view, continued to expend hundreds of billions of dollars to protect their currencies,” Ackman wrote. “To date, despite the large notional size of this currency/market hedge and continued weakness in the yuan and growing pressure on the Saudi riyal, we have made only a modest profit on these investments.”Policy makers in both nations are actively propping up their currencies as they look to minimize capital flight and discourage speculation against their exchange rates. China is letting the yuan weaken gradually, intervening when daily declines are deemed too large; Saudi Arabia is burning through its reserves to defend a 30-year peg to the greenback. That’s capping gains from wagers predicated on the currencies’ decline.The yuan has slipped 1.3% versus the dollar this year after weakening 4.7% in 2015. The Saudi riyal is pegged at 3.75 per U.S. dollar.This isn’t the first time Pershing has made wagers on a currency peg. In 2011, the fund placed a wager that would profit if Hong Kong allowed its currency to appreciate against the dollar. The peg held.The hedge fund’s bets against the yuan and riyal are meant as hedges, Ackman wrote. Pershing started building up puts -- options that allow the purchaser to sell the currency at a set price in the future -- and put spreads on the yuan in August, two days before China’s surprise devaluation of the currency.Buying currency options was a cheaper way than buying puts on stocks or oil for Pershing to offset risk that Chinese equities were “in bubble territory” and that oil could slide further, Ackman wrote.The options “have not, to date, served to be a useful hedge against declines in our portfolio as our investments have declined much more dramatically than we would have expected in light of their limited exposure to the Chinese economy and oil prices,” Ackman wrote. “That said, we believe that both currency investments continue to offer an important hedging benefit and represent an attractive risk-reward, and therefore, we continue to hold them.”The yuan, which is allowed to trade 2% either side of a reference rate set daily by the People’s Bank of China, is forecast to slump about 3% by year-end, according to the median estimate of 41 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Twelve-month forwards for the Saudi Arabian riyal, which investors use to bet on or hedge the currency, tumbled to an all-time low of 3.87 per dollar this month. That’s weaker than the country’s 3.75-per-dollar peg, suggesting traders are betting on the end of the three decade peg, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

237,PEG,"Since President Obama’s Iran nuclear deal, it seems that every encounter between the world’s foremost terrorist state and the U.S. brings the world’s lone superpower down a peg.After firing rockets within a mile of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Strait of Hormuz last month, Iran two weeks later posted video of 10 detained U.S. sailors kneeling and being held at gunpoint after their transport vessel was seized for straying into Iranian waters earlier this month.Now -- within a single month -- comes a third embarrassment for the U.S.  Iran claimed on Friday that it flew a military drone over one of our aircraft carriers and provided video that the drone purportedly took.The video is chilling because it shows our carrier in a viewfinder’s crosshairs -- at the center of a bullseye.Our Navy confirmed that a drone was seen “directly over” the Harry S. Truman in the Persian Gulf on Jan. 12 -- the same day the sailors were detained -- but said a Navy chopper flew near it beforehand and determined it to be unarmed.The commander of Iran’s navy, Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, boasted on Iranian state TV that the drone got “so close to the warship” that it could “shoot such beautiful and accurate footage of the combat units of the foreign forces.”  Iran was conducting naval exercises at the time.According to Tehran’s state news agency, an Iranian submarine on an intelligence-gathering mission also took “clear pictures of the aircraft carrier without catching the attention of the staff on board.”The U.S. Navy said the Iranian drone “posed no danger to the ship,” but its actions were “abnormal and unprofessional.”The statement downplays the significance of yet another humiliation of this country at the hands of Iran. Surveillance isn’t always accurate, as Americans have learned the hard way many times, and the Iranian drone could still have been a danger to the carrier’s crew.Even though the Iranian aircraft was unarmed, our forces still would have had every right to shoot it down. Then the message going out to the world would be that the United States does not tolerate enemy military vehicles flying over our ships in international waters.Instead the message our friends and foes get comes from that video Iran procured for itself: a mighty U.S. aircraft carrier, crowded with our aircraft, adorned with a target centered on its flight deck.Back during the Reagan administration, when a U.S. frigate was nearly sunk by an Iranian mine in 1988, we responded decisively by bombing two of Iran’s oil rigs and six of its ships, not caring that the mine was probably meant for Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi ships and not one of ours.Today, the Obama administration’s preferred weapons against Iran are words.  Because to this administration, a “peace” deal that keeps Tehran perilously close to nuclear weapons capability is apparently more worth protecting than our sailors’ lives.

238,PEG,"The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged, as expected, on Wednesday and signaled that it's taking a timeout before resuming its effort to normalize policy. But that wasn't enough to satisfy investors.The shift in the Fed's tone suggested that policymakers were caught off guard by the weaker economic data and financial-market volatility that followed their decision to hike rates in mid-December. But investors may have been hoping for more than a subtle shift.  The meeting was immediately followed by downward pressure on stocks. The Nasdaq fell 2.2%, while the S&P 500 was down 1.1%.One key phrase was edited from the post-meeting statement that had appeared after its rate hike in mid-December: ""The committee . . . is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2% objective.""The phrase now reads, inflation is ""expected to remain low in the near term"" but still rise to 2% in the medium term.The Fed seemed to signal that it is backing off the implied projection of four quarter-point rate hikes in 2016 that accompanied its December rate hike. But that comes as little surprise, given that markets have been pricing in just one rate hike this year.After going nearly 10 years between rate hikes, it's now clear that the Fed lost patience and pulled the trigger when the economy had slowed to about 1% or less. The Fed has come under increasing criticism in recent weeks as financial markets tumbled, a fall that seemed to be triggered by China's moves to ease the yuan's peg against the strong dollar.The Fed clearly indicated that it will slow down and reassess things. The wild card: The implications of ""global economic and financial developments . . . for the labor market and inflation, and for their balance of risks to the outlook.""December's statement, by contrast, had simply asserted that the risks to the outlook were ""balanced,"" meaning growth and inflation were as likely to come up short of estimates as to outpace estimates.Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research, interpreted the change as understated ""Fedspeak for saying events now lean towards impacting the economy negatively.""The hit to financial markets since the start of the year has seen major U.S. stock indexes testing or undercutting lows hit in August. But, as Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research noted, the Fed isn't yet expressing much concern. Now, they are assessing risks. But the Fed statement in September went further: ""Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.""In admitting a lack of clarity about the balance of risks, the Fed came close to taking a rate hike off the table for the March meeting, though some economists said it was still a distant possibility.But nothing the Fed could say was likely to soothe investors after its December projection of 2.4% growth in 2016 to go with four rate hikes. The takeaway is that the Fed has a very low bar for raising rates going forward.""Growth may start to slow,"" Bandholz said, but even 2% GDP growth is likely sufficient for the Fed to keep raising rates as the unemployment rate moves below its current 5%.That stance makes sense to Bandholz, given that the Fed's overnight lending rate is not far above zero, but it's the predictable downside of beginning to raise rates this far into a recovery, when the economy is already nearing its potential.""The Fed essentially stated that it is capping growth at 2% with its decision to increase short term rates,"" Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA wrote this week. ""A cap on real growth is not good for companies which are already confronted with a lack of pricing power and slowing global economy.""Still, in Blitz's view, the Fed's message ""could end up as a positive for the equity markets.""""It was simply an acknowledgment that the Fed is not tied to any particular direction, especially now that global forces are tilting the balance of outcomes toward the negative.""

239,PEG,"After a week in sinking oil prices shook markets, the chairman of Saudi Aramco said that the Saudi Arabian state-run oil giant and potential IPO could ride out low prices for “a long, long time,” potentially forcing the hands of competitors stateside.Saudi Aramco has kept spending levels consistent with those before oil prices began falling, Chairman Khalid Al-Falih said at a conference Monday in Riyadh, according to Bloomberg. He said, ""Saudi Arabia is well-documented to be the clear lowest-cost producer -- we have scale, capabilities and technology to help us maintain our low cost as we go forward.""Aramco has been considering an IPO of its downstream assets, including its refining, chemical and marketing segments, or of part of ""the company at the top, which is everything we do,"" al-Falih said.The remarks came after an interview that ran Sunday in which al-Falih said that the nation would not sell shares of Saudi Aramco's crude reserves in any possible IPO. He said then that the company could list on a foreign exchange, which would likely be better able to handle what could be the largest initial public offering ever.Saudi Arabia's deputy crown prince said this month that the nation was weighing a potential offering of Aramco shares. Analysts peg Aramco's total value at anywhere between $1 trillion to $10 trillion, meaning that even a small offering could top China e-commerce giant Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion IPO in 2014.An Aramco IPO could make the typically secretive company more transparent and help Saudi Arabia prop up its own finances, which the oil-price collapse has battered even as Aramco sustains its oil and gas investments. Still, ""investors should remain wary of government control of the shares,"" Renaissance Capital's Tiffany Ng told IBD this month.Brent crude settled down 5.2% to $30.50 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 5.75% to $30.34 a barrel.

259,PEG,"Expect much of the same from the U.S. economy as in 2015, but possibly a little bit less of it. Another year of tame growth looks like close to a sure thing in a recovery that hasn't shifted out of second gear.The U.S. is likely to deliver its 11th straight year of sub-3% GDP growth in 2016, the longest such stretch since World War II.The fundamental backdrop is expected to remain in place, with the economy fueled by spending on services as a strong dollar and sluggish overseas growth keep manufacturing from gaining much traction.Some of the economy's drivers may begin to decelerate.Wells Fargo expects employment gains to slow from this year's 210,000 monthly pace to 180,000. The bank's economists think the record 18 million auto sales in 2015 ""may be close to topping out for this cycle.""General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) have reported strong U.S. sales, especially for high-margin SUVs. If sales plateau at 2016, manufacturers' woes due to global weakness and a retrenching energy sector may become more apparent.""Motor vehicles and student loans are the only areas of the economy where credit has flowed as freely in this cycle as it did in previous cycles, and it will likely be hard to push the envelope much further,"" Wells Fargo's economics group explained.Debt Binge UnlikelyThe good news is that household balance sheets are in somewhat better shape than in the last cycle, with new consumption being financed primarily out of incomes. That makes the U.S. economy much less recession-prone.And a debt binge now seems unlikely with the Federal Reserve starting to raise interest rates, however slowly. Economists expect three more quarter-point hikes in 2016 as the Fed's favored personal consumption expenditures inflation gauge nears its 2% target by year-end.""Strong household balance sheets and steady unemployment will keep the wheels of the recovery in (slow) motion for several years to come,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist for Morgan Stanley.While that sounds like a generally positive scenario, the glass is only half full. Morgan Stanley expects the U.S. economy to grow just 1.8% in 2016 and 2017, with 1% average earnings-per-share growth for the S&P 500.While the consensus of economists has GDP growth closer to 2.5%, that's still well below the 3%-plus growth that many were expecting in 2015.The future isn't what it used to be. Essentially, 2015 is when economists ruled out the prospect of an economic third gear, after gas savings in excess of $100 billion didn't provide much of a spark to consumption.""Slowing population growth rates and an aging population make it extremely unlikely that the U.S. or any developed market can ever reach those types of growth rates on anything but a very short-term basis,"" wrote Morningstar analysts Robert Johnson and Roland Czerniawski. They project 2%-2.5% growth in 2016.With labor force participation at long-term lows, the jobless rate dropped to 5% in 2015.Fed policymakers expect it to fall in 2016 to a range of 4.6%-4.8%. Tighter labor markets put upward pressure on wages, which have been notably lackluster in this expansion.Higher minimum wages in 14 states, including a $1 hike to $10 an hour in California, will add to that pressure but may spur low-wage employers to cut jobs or work hours.Wage growth is unlikely to be strong enough to shift the economy into high gear when corporations ""don't have pricing power,"" are struggling to increase earnings and are using cash to buy back shares at the expense of new capacity, Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist of Mizuho Securities USA, told IBD.Companies have gotten creative at holding down wages by relying on part-time and temporary or contract workers, said Ricchiuto. Modest pay gains, slower hiring and restrained credit growth, all of which seem likely, don't have the makings of a strong consumer sector.No Dollar ReliefU.S. producers aren't expected to get a reprieve from the strong dollar that's hurt their global competitiveness.A number of big currency strategists see the euro, worth $1.09, falling toward parity with the dollar or even lower in 2016.That will mean a loss of competitiveness for U.S. manufacturers and Chinese producers, since the renminbi's value is pegged to the dollar. China is already struggling to maintain its target of 7% growth amid real estate woes and economic changes, so a stronger currency won't be welcome.That's why Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist David Woo thinks the renminbi-dollar peg ""is headed for a divorce"" in 2016 as China takes more steps to delink its currency from the dollar after August's devaluation.The dollar's ascent delayed the Fed's initial rate rise, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said, and further gains could slow hikes.

323,PEG,"Before there was ObamaCare, there was runaway price inflation in health care.For example, last summer my wife went to a private clinic to get a simple cortisone injection in her foot. She'd had this done four and a half years earlier. Same clinic, same doctor, same $1 medication, but a very different bill — from $146 in 2009 to $987 in 2013! Why the difference?
"
324,PEG,"The for-profit clinic had been purchased by a nonprofit hospital.
"
325,PEG,"Surprisingly, the industries that have the most rampant price-inflation problems — health care and higher education — are dominated by nonprofit providers. Could it be that they are just as profit-driven as big, for-profit corporations?
"
326,PEG,"It certainly seems so. While legally organized and taxed as nonprofits, many health care and higher education providers are hardly selfless, and as their prices have dramatically increased, so have their profits.
"
327,PEG,"It is often assumed that nonprofit institutions, simply by virtue of their tax designation, never make a profit. Many colleges and hospitals don't report that they have realized profits, even when those profits are significant. Indeed, they often report profits as expenses.
"
328,PEG,"Here's how colleges do it: The operating profit margin on undergraduate education at public research universities is about 60%. This isn't apparent because that money, rather than being parceled out to investors, is spent on employees or auxiliary functions.
"
329,PEG,"In other words, rather than report a profit, a college might up its president's salary to $1 million or create more administrative positions.
"
330,PEG,"Not all excess spending is necessarily a waste. Some of the money might go to subsidize research that benefits society — but it's still spending that doesn't directly benefit paying customers.
"
331,PEG,"Nonprofit health care is even worse. For example, the large nonprofit hospitals in Oklahoma generally charge two to three times as much as the doctor-owned, for-profit surgery centers. That's for the same procedure performed by the same surgeon.
"
332,PEG,"What does the ""nonprofit"" hospital do with all that extra money? It certainly doesn't subsidize a lot of indigent health care. Expenses for charity care and bad debts amount to at most only about 6% of the average hospital's revenues, and some estimates peg it lower than that.
"
333,PEG,"Nonprofit colleges and hospitals didn't start with a focus on profits but on making education and health care more affordable.
"
334,PEG,"Over time, however, they changed to the point where they would be unrecognizable to their founders or even active supporters from just 30 years ago. They were supposed to sell services at a loss and cover the losses with donations rather than making profits from selling services.
"
335,PEG,"What can be done to restore these organizations to their mission?
"
336,PEG,"First, educate students and patients that a nonprofit legal status is no guarantee that schools or hospitals aren't trying to get every dollar they can. Openly for-profit entities could be a better deal.
"
337,PEG,"Second, to policymakers: Level the playing field. Eliminate policies designed to protect nonprofits at the expense of patients and students. A particularly egregious example is in health care, where the expansion of lower-priced, physician-owned hospitals is severely limited, but high-priced nonprofit hospitals are allowed to purchase physician practices.
"
338,PEG,"Why should nonprofits get a property-tax edge over their for-profit competitors? After all, providers who are honest about making a profit — and there are lots of reasons to want honest profit-making, which drives efficiency and innovation — have to pay taxes. Not so for their competitors clothed in faux angel's wings.
"
339,PEG,"Third, to the management of nonprofits: Change. You can charge lower prices. For example, nonprofit Western Governor's University is almost totally funded by student tuition, yet the average cost of its undergraduate degree is $17,000, vastly cheaper than the $56,000 that student and state pay for a degree from a public regional college.
"
340,PEG,"The key to charging lower prices is reducing costs by eliminating expenses that aren't necessary to provide quality service.
"
341,PEG,"Finally, to the members of nonprofit governing boards: It's time for a self-evaluation. You have a legal and moral responsibility to students and patients. Whose benefits do you want your institution to maximize? The patients' and students', or insiders'? Cleaning up a nonprofit is hard work. But if you're not willing to do it, don't serve on the board.

363,PEG,"In December, investors flocked to large-cap equity ETFs. They saw $21.5 billion in net inflow — the most among all categories by sector, style and region. Among sectors, consumer ETFs topped with $4.8 billion in new money. In fixed income, corporate bond ETFs drew $4.7 billion inflow.The ETF juggernaut rolled on in December, crushing mutual funds on its way to an 11th straight month of net inflow. Investors plowed a whopping $50.8 billion into the nation's equity, bond and hybrid exchange traded funds combined.That pushed U.S. ETF industry assets to $1.974 trillion at the end of December, up 1% over the previous month, according to Investment Company Institute, a trade association.Over the past 12 months, ETF assets increased $299.8 billion, or 17.9%.The exchange traded funds industry last saw net outflow in January 2014, of $15.15 billion. The December inflow topped every other month last year, including November's robust $41.3 billion.While ETF industry assets were reported to have crossed a historic $2 trillion in December, ICI excludes exchange traded notes from its calculation of ETF assets and flows. Several experts note that U.S. ETF assets took almost 18 years to reach $1 trillion. But they doubled to $2 trillion in about three more years.""Investors are continuing to see the benefits of owning ETFs in their portfolios,"" said Shelly Antoniewicz, a senior economist in ICI's research group. The strongest growth was in domestic broad-based ETFs, she added. ""That's not surprising given that the U.S. market was doing well in 2014."" Bond ETFs' ""terrific turnaround"" last year, Antoniewicz explained, was helped by the fall in interest rates.Investing in the stock market can lead to big gains. Increasingly, the transparency and intraday tradability of ETFs gives them an edge over mutual funds in attracting investor dollars, experts say.In December, long-term mutual funds saw $47 billion in net outflow. Their combined assets declined 1.4% to $13.129 trillion.Where The Money GrewThe $50.8 billion that investors put into exchange traded funds in December was up nearly 23% from the previous month.Net inflow into ETFs amounted to $240.8 billion in 2014 vs. $179.9 billion in 2013.The combined assets in ETFs of all types rose to $1.974 trillion, a jump of 1% from November, according to ICI. Over the past 12 months, ETF assets soared 17.9%.Domestic stock ETF assets continued to peg the strongest gains. Their assets grew $39.1 billion in December and $231.7 billion from December 2013. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), tracking the broad stock market, slipped 0.26% in December, but clocked in a tidy 13.5% gain over the full year.Assets in stock ETFs that invest primarily overseas dipped $19.6 billion in December to $414.8 billion. Their assets increased 4% from $398.8 billion in December 2013.Bond fund assets rose $250 million from November to $296.4 billion. Hybrid funds tacked on $3 million for a total of $3.047 billion.No new ETFs were launched in December. The total number of equity, bond and hybrid ETFs remained steady at 1,411. That's up 9% from 1,294 ETFs in December 2013. Bond ETFs lost one fund for a total of 264. Global and international equity ETFs were flat at 494.

364,PEG,"After an unexpected move by the Swiss National Bank on January 15 to abandon its peg against the euro and the announcement of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank (ECB) on January 22, investors around the world have been forced to re-evaluate currency risk as part of their asset allocation decisions. For many U.S.-based investors, currency hedging continues to resonate as they seek out new opportunities in foreign markets. Over the past 10 years, foreign currencies declined modestly against the U.S. dollar.1 However, as we have highlighted previously, our analysis shows that we may currently be in the middle stages of a secular appreciation in the U.S. dollar. As a result, investors should continue to consider hedging investments exposed to foreign currency risk. 
"
365,PEG,"One way investors have historically managed volatility in their portfolios was through allocations to cash. By maintaining a portion of their portfolios in cash, investors would hypothetically be able to deploy capital when markets became undervalued. However, today's interest rates environment is much different than it once was. From 2004 through 2007,short-term interest rates averaged 3.46%.2 Today, the U.S. 30-year bond only yields 2.40%.3 With yields this low across the yield curve, U.S. cash positions can provide a significant drag on performance. Today, the argument for short-term fixed income is that it reduces exposure to risk assets, albeit with considerably less income potential than in the past. However, volatility across asset classes is trending higher. Due to such low opportunity costs from short-term fixed income, hedging foreign currency risk via a long-dollar strategy provides investors additional flexibility compared to simply allocating to cash.

366,PEG,"Interestingly, even though the volatility of the dollar bull strategy was significantly higher than cash over this period, it actually reduced overall portfolio risk to a greater degree due to its negative correlation (-0.71) with international equities.4 In our view, the real value of bullish dollar strategies in the current market environment is for investors with long-term international holdings. Given that many of these legacy positions may have large unrealized capital gains, a bullish dollar currency strategy can help reduce volatility from currency markets while maintaining existing exposure.

"
413,PEG,"When Ben Bernanke was chairman of the Federal Reserve, he was fond of saying ""monetary policy is not a panacea."" Yet when one looks at actual policy since the 2008 financial crisis, it is difficult not to think that people, especially market players, have come to believe that the Fed is a cure-all for economic malaise.Indeed, the Fed has changed thinking on the use of unconventional monetary policy to stimulate economic growth. The use of quantitative easing (i.e., large-scale asset purchases, including mortgage-backed securities) and financial repression (i.e., holding benchmark rates near zero and allowing real rates to go negative) are now part of conventional wisdom of central banks trying to boost global growth.The Fed has increased its balance sheet from less than $800 billion before the crisis to more than $4.5 trillion, and has dramatically increased the monetary base in the process. Member banks are now holding nearly $3 trillion of excess reserves at the Fed due, in part, to payment of interest on those reserves since October 2008, and also because of regulations and policy uncertainty.Those funds are not being lent out, and thus not entering the income stream. Thus, even though the Fed has been creating massive amounts of new base money, the growth rates of the monetary aggregates have not been inflationary. That situation, of course, could change as the economy heats up and confidence returns.It is a myth to think that monetary authorities by a stroke of a keyboard can create economic prosperity or that monetary policy can be fine-tuned with every twist and turn of the real economy. Fed policy seems largely designed to prop up financial asset prices and to encourage risk-taking with the hope that newly acquired financial wealth will stimulate spending and ignite real economic growth rather than inflation.Yet a long look at monetary history tells us that central banks cannot control real variables (e.g., employment, output, and real interest rates), except for short periods. When expectations are taken into account, and lags recognized, it becomes clear that ""monetary stimulus"" is not a substitute for the hard choices that need to be made to generate lasting economic growth.Institutional changes that widen the scope of markets (private exchange) and limit the power of government to the protection of persons and property are the key to prosperity. Economic and personal freedom and responsibility under a genuine rule of law — not a powerful central bank that manipulates interest rates, politicizes the allocation of capital, and lacks any monetary rule to guide policy — are the fundamental conditions for expanding the range of choices open to individuals, which is the true measure of development.When the Fed or other major central banks suppress interest rates, holding them below their natural market equilibrium levels, they distort capital markets and lead to mal-investments. Unlike other prices, the interest rate is an indicator of people's preferences for present versus future consumption, and therefore reflects time preferences. Interest rates are also used to calculate asset prices, so when rates are distorted so are asset prices.With artificially low interest rates, people have little incentive to save for the future; they would rather load up on cheap credit and consume today rather than save and invest in the future. Likewise, with low rates, government debt looks less burdensome — and there is an added inducement to expand the size and scope of government.The Fed's ultra-low interest-rate policy has imposed large costs on conservative investors who have stayed on the sidelines as the stock markets have boomed. They have suffered permanent losses because of the Fed's failure to normalize monetary policy. Meanwhile, those who have taken on more risk have profited by Fed policy, but their smiles could turn to tears when asset prices adjust to higher rates and the bubbles burst.Eventually rates must rise to their natural levels consistent with time preferences and the productivity of capital. The Fed cannot peg rates forever. When rates rise, asset prices will fall and the government will face mounting costs of financing its huge debt. Junk bond funds will go under and there will be tremendous political pressure to bail out financial institutions and others considered too big to fail.Many Fed policymakers appear glued to the vision of a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, and to the idea that the Fed can create wealth by repressing interest rates ""for a considerable time."" By basing monetary policy on forecasts of the real economy, the Fed creates great uncertainty.There is no perfect model of the U.S. or global economy; the future is unknown and unknowable. That is why monetary policy cannot be a panacea, and why a rules-based regime is superior to pure discretion. Dorn is vice president for monetary studies and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.

446,PEG,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the utility’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.77%. Moreover, Public Service Enterprise outperformed the same in the trailing four quarters with an average of 7.70%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the second-quarter earnings call, Public Service Enterprise announced that its key subsidiary, PSEG Power’s adjusted earnings is benefiting from the ongoing programs to reduce operating expenses. We expect the company to reflect similar results when it will release its third-quarter earnings..Additionally, the unemployment rate in Public Service Enterprise’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is likely to the utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s quarterly performance.On the flip side,management earlier declared that the energy market has been adversely impacted by lower demand and excess capacity, which in turn has hurt the return of base load resources, as the average price on energy hedges decline. If the trend persists it might hamper Public Service Enterprise’s results.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects year-over-year decline of 5%, while revenues are pegged at $2.54 billion depicting an increase of 3.9%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Public Service Enterprise is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Public Service Enterprise has an Earnings ESP of -0.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 83 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Public Service Enterprise’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few utility stocks which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NiSource, Inc. (NI  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter results on Nov 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #2.

450,PEG,"The Q2 earnings season is fast approaching its core. As of Jul 26, 171 S&P 500 members came up with their quarterly earnings. Total earnings for these companies are up 8.8% from the same period last year on 3.4% higher revenues. 78.9% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 70.8% topped revenue estimates.It is going to be another busy week with nearly 800 companies – including 183 S&P 500 members – expected to come up with earnings results. Combining results of the reported index members (171 members till Jul 26) with the remaining 329 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.7% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.7% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June.

451,PEG,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 28, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the utility’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.52%. Moreover, Public Service Enterprise outperformed the same in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.50%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the first-quarter earnings call, Public Service Enterprise said that in the second quarter its key subsidiary, Power, will be impacted by incremental depreciation expenses related to the early retirement of the Hudson and Mercer coal-fired generating stations on Jun 1.However, the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the to-be-reported quarter. This, in turn, will result in higher household expenditures on heating, which is expected to drive revenues.Additionally, the unemployment rate in Public Service Enterprise’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.Overall, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects year-over-year growth of 0.35%, while revenues are pegged at $2.33 billion depicting an increase of 22.49%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Public Service Enterprise will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Public Service Enterprise has an Earnings ESP 0.00%.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock reported positive earnings surprise in two of the last four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 374.24%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The utility has been benefiting from the initiatives taken under its Transformation Plan. NRG Energy aims to save more than $1 billion through recurring cost cuts and margin improvements. The initiatives undertaken by NRG Energy through its Transformation Plan will increase annual cost savings from $500 million in 2018 to nearly $590 million in 2020. Margins of the company are likely to expand substantially from $30 million in 2018 to $215 million in 2020.NRG Energy expects to generate $3.2 billion through asset sales under its Transformation Plan. Monetization of non-core assets and cost-saving initiatives will allow the company to focus more on core assets and strengthen its balance sheet through repayment of exiting debts.The company also wants to increase shareholders’ value through buybacks. The Board of directors authorized $1 billion share buyback, of which $500 million is scheduled to be repurchased immediately. Post divestiture of additional assets, the company will look forward to utilize another $500 million to buyback shares.However, a number of NRG Energy's “merchant” facilities function without long-term power sales agreements and are influenced by market price fluctuations. Since there is no guarantee that the power generated from these units will be sold at commercially attractive rates, profitability from the merchant business is uncertain.A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry worth considering are CenterPoint Energy Inc.

459,PEG,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.31%. Moreover, Entergy Corp. outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 85.43%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayMost of the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal winters during the quarter under review. This has lowered demand for electricity in these regions, which in turn, is expected to weigh on the company’s fourth-quarter sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Entergy Corp.’s fourth-quarter sales of $2.33 billion marks a year-over-year decline of 12.2%.In October 2017, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the recovery of nuclear dry fuel storage costs incurred by Entergy Corp. earlier. The move is expected to boost the company’s fourth-quarter earnings. Our consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 42 cents per share reflects an annual growth of 35.5%.Moreover, during the fourth quarter, Entergy Corp. raised its quarterly dividend by 2.3% to 89 cents per share. This indicates improved cash inflow from operating activities for the company which we believe will drive its fourth-quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Entergy Corp. is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

460,PEG,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the utility’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.38%. However, Public Service Enterprise outperformed the same in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Public Service Enterprise is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Public Service Enterprise has both these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.92%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Public Service Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayIn June 2017, Public Service Enterprise submitted the planned update to its Energy Strong cost recovery petition, to include Energy Strong investments in service as of May 31, 2017. This filing requested estimated annual increases in electric and gas revenues of $16 million and $2 million, respectively. Last August, the BPU approved these raised rates effective Sep 1, 2017.Moreover, in June 2017, the company made its annual Basic Gas Supply Services (BGSS) filing with the Board of Public Utility (BPU) requesting an increase in the BGSS rate from approximately 34 cents to 37 cents per therm, effective Oct 1, 2017. Therefore, we may expect these to duly get reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter results in the form of improved sales as well as earnings growth.In line with this, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 56 cents per share reflects year-over-year growth of 3.7%. Meanwhile, the same for revenues is pegged at $2.36 billion, depicting an increase of 12.8%.On the flip side, the unemployment rate in Public Service Enterprise’s service territories is worse than the national average. A deteriorating economy is likely to lower the utility demand in the state, which in turn may weigh on the company’s quarterly performance.Nevertheless, earlier-than-expected snowfall in December 2017 in New Jersey drove demand for electricity substantially in the city. This in turn is expected to drive Public Service Enterprise’s yet-to-be-reported results.Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Quote Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other utility stocks which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter results on Feb 22.

NiSource has a 100% regulated utility business model.We anticipate that the increase in total revenues will be driven by the investment in capital projects, new rates in gas operations, improvements to its electric generating stations and strengthening its existing infrastructure.NiSource is expected to gain from new home construction and conversion to natural gas in its service territories that are helping to expand the existing customer base of the company.Other Stocks to ConsiderNiSource is not the only company in the industry looking up this earnings season.

462,PEG,"On May 23, we issued an updated research report on Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PEG  -  Free Report), also known as PSEG.Asolid portfolio of regulated and non-regulated utility assets provides stable earnings and significant long-term growth potential.Public Service Enterprise reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted operating earnings of 97 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Revenues were $2,818 million in the quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,740 million by 2.8%. Higher electric sales volumes drove the company’s top line.However, stringent environmental regulations and fluctuations in commodity prices are growth deterrents.In a year’s time, the stock has gained 18.5% against the industry’s decline of 5.7%. What’s Driving Public Service Enterprise?Public Service Enterprise strives to optimize generation margins by improving cost structure and performance. Low-cost nuclear fleet and expanding generating capacity from renewable sources is expected to drive earnings. Moreover, consistent improvement in energy markets in response to the low-priced gas environment should help PSEG Power — the company’s subsidiary — to increase efficiency and performance of plants and lower costs.The company’s current capital investment plan is to spend in the range of $13-$15 billion on its energy infrastructure during 2018-2020. Of this, the company expects to spend $11.5-$13.2 billion for its baseline infrastructure program, at a CAGR 7-9% in rate base over the next three years.PSE&G consistently upgrades gas distribution system as part of its Gas System Modernization Program (“GSMP”), which aims to replace approximately 510 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel gas mains along with 38,000 unprotected steel service lines to homes and businesses.. In April 2018, the company settled with the BPU for a GSMP II program, an extension of its GSMP, through which it aims to invest $1.9 billion over a five-year period beginning in 2019.PSEG Power is constructing and operating five new combined-cycle gas plants — a 755-MW facility at the Keys Energy Center in Maryland; a 540-MW facility on its existing Sewaren station in New Jersey. These projects, when completed will further lower carbon footprints of the company.However,participation in the wholesale energy market exposes Public Service Enterprise to commodity price volatility, which is cyclical in nature.Stringent environmental regulations,risks including breakdown, failure or damage of equipment’s or processes of transmission and distribution may dent growth.Zacks Rank & Key PickupsPublic Service Enterprise has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few-better ranked stocks in the same space are NRG Energy, Inc (NRG  -  Free Report), IDACORP, Inc (IDA  -  Free Report) and Allete, Inc (ALE  -  Free Report).

464,PEG,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 3.27%. However, DTE Energy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.81%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the third-quarter earnings call, DTE Energy’s management announced that it expects to witness higher revenues from the company’s subsidiary DTE Gas in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher gas main renewal revenues at base rates. We expect the yet-to-be-reported quarter’s results to reflect this.However, the company’s service territories as a whole faced warmer-than-normal temperature in the fourth quarter, which in turn is expected to weigh down on revenues. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DTE Energy’s fourth-quarter revenues of $1.91 billion reflects a year-over-year decline of 33.7%.On a brighter note, banking on its stronger year-to-date results as of Sep 30, 2017, DTE Energy raised its 2017 bottom-line guidance. Notably, improved performance at the company’s Gas Storage and Pipelines, Power and Industrial segments backed the guidance raise.The consensus estimate for DTE Energy’s earnings of $1.20 per share for the fourth quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 48.2%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that DTE Energy will beat estimates this quarter.

Moreover, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 1.05%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPer Ameren’s third-quarter earnings call, fourth-quarter 2017 earnings are expected to be impacted by expenses associated with the fourth quarter Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage.However, the company’s earnings are likely to increase on the back of strong rate-based growth and disciplined financial management. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren’s fourth-quarter earnings of 33 cents per share reflects an annual growth of 153.9%.Moreover, we expect the company’s yet-to-be reported quarter’s result to duly reflect the increase in revenue recognition, resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act.  Also the company expects to incur low interest expenses driven by the refinancing of debt in 2017, which is likely to get reflected in the upcoming results, partially.Further, the company’s service territories witnessed almost normal temperatures during the fourth quarter. So we may expect weather condition to have a positive influence on the company’s revenues. Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ameren Corporation Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn’t conclude that Ameren is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

466,PEG,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.’s (PEG  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Public Service Electric and Gas Co. (PSE&G) — recently requested the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (“BPU”) to increase its electric and gas base delivery rates. If approved, the new rates will boost the company’s revenues by 1%.This filing comes as a mandate of the company’s Energy Strong program worth $1.2 billion that got approved by the New Jersey BPU in 2014.Other Details Once approved, the combined residential electric and natural gas customers' annual bill will witness a nominal rise of 1%. The company has assured customers that even after this proposed increase, residential customer bills are expected to be more than 15% lower than they were in 2010.Per management, this rate hike will enable Public Service Enterprise to recover costs that the company incurred to strengthen its electric and gas distribution systems, thereby making them more reliable. Moreover, this proposal reflects the company’s first regulatory rate review in more than eight years.Through this rate filing, Public Service Enterprise has also sought BPU approval for a rate design change, called the Green Enabling Mechanism (GEM). This new rate structure aims at separating the company’s revenues from sales volumes and thereby encourages energy efficiency.  If approved, the GEM will remove the incentive to sell more energy and will instead encourage utility investments in energy efficiency, renewables and other clean energy technologies that will benefit customers by bringing down bills and reducing carbon emissions.The company expects the new base rates as well as the GEM to come into effect from Oct 1, 2018.Our ViewIn May 2014, Public Service Enterprise announced that the New Jersey BPU approved its Energy Strong proposal to proactively protect and strengthen its electric and gas systems to withstand severe weather conditions. Per this proposal, the company aimed at significantly upgrading its infrastructure, which included adding intelligence to its system to help speed restoration during outages.Under the agreement, it was announced that PSE&G will earn an authorized return on equity of 9.75% on the first $1 billion of investment based on an accelerated recovery mechanism.  The impact of the $1-billion investment on the typical residential customer bill is expected to be approximately 2% in 2018 which will be more than offset by transitional charges stemming from deregulation that are expiring in the same time frame.For the remaining $220 million, the company aimed at filling a base rate case after Nov 1, 2017. We believe the latest rate review proposal has been filed by the company to recover this $220 million of the Energy Strong program.Notably, in March 2017, Public Service Enterprise announced plans to spend $12.3 billion for PSE&G’s baseline infrastructure program, which in turn reflects 7% CAGR growth in rate base. The latest rate reform request, if approved, will allow the company to achieve this target.Moreover, Public Service Enterprise continues to undertake several initiatives to support New Jersey Senate’s bill that requires utilities in the state to source 80% of their electricity from renewable energy by 2050. We believe to further comply with this bill, the company has included the GEM clause in the latest rate filing.Notably, in the clean energy space, the company is currently pursuing two solar initiatives, namely, the Solar Loan Program and the Solar 4 All and Solar 4 All Extension programs. In November 2016, the BPU approved a settlement providing for an extension of PSE&G’s existing solar program to construct up to 33 MW of grid-connected facilities with projected investment of approximately $80 million through May 2020.Also, the projected addition of 1,858 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity over 2017 through 2019 will help the company transform itself. Banking on these recently adopted initiatives, management expects nuclear and gas-fired generation facilities to provide more than 90% of the company’s electric output, by the end of this decade.Price PerformanceBuoyed by the solid investment plans, the company's shares have outperformed the broader industry over a year. Evidently, Public Service Enterprise’s share price has rallied 13.7% compared with its industry’s gain of 2.2%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPublic Service Enterprise carriesa Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Pampa Energia S.A.

467,PEG,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.’s (PEG  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), recently got the regulatory go-ahead to start operations for the next phase of its Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP II). The approval for the multi-party settlement was granted by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU).Under GSMP II program, the company plans on investing $1.9 billion for replacing and modernizing its existing gas systems.Details of the Infrastructure UpgradesPSE&G aims at implementing several infrastructural upgrades under the five-year program. It plans to replace 875 miles of aging cast iron and unprotected steel gas pipes with strong and durable plastic piping, reducing the potential for leaks and release of methane gas. Alongside, it will install flow valves in large numbers that would automatically deactivate gas flow when a service line gets damaged.The company also plans on modernizing infrastructural systems, limiting greenhouse gas emissions, maintain service reliability, create jobs and spur economic growth in the New Jersey region. PSE&G will begin neighborhood work related to GSMP II in early 2019.Our ViewThe growth prospect of natural gas continues to be favorable in the long run, as the commodity’s long-term demand is expected to soar due to the transition toward a low carbon future. In line with this, the EIA predicts global demand for natural gas to grow from 340 Bcf (Billions Of Cubic Feet) per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Such massive growth projections must have enticed natural gas providers, like Public Service Enterprise, to strengthen its position in the natural gas space by modernizing its existing gas infrastructure.Furthermore, the ongoing period of low natural gas prices along with the investments made by PSE&G provides a perfect opportunity for the company to replace and upgrade its gas system with minimal cost impact on customers. In fact, management expects that the GSMP II upgrades will keep customer bills low and the average annual bill for a typical residential customer is expected to increase by a mere less than 2% per year, during the five years. Such strategic investment programs are expected to help the company offer more reliable, resilient, cleaner and affordable energy to customers.Price PerformancePublic Service Enterprise Group has outperformed the broader industry in the past one year. During this period, the company’s shares gained 13.8% compared with the broader industry’s decline of 6.3%. The outperformance may have been caused by its solid portfolio of regulated and non-regulated utility assets that offer significant long-term growth potential. Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksPublic Service Enterprise Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few top-ranked stocks from the same space are NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report), TerraForm Power, Inc. (TERP  -  Free Report) and Atlantic Power Corporation (AT  -  Free Report).

468,PEG,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.’s (PEG  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G) — recently announced that the last project of Solar 4 All program has commenced operations. It will be used as backup during extended power outage in Department of Public Works (DPW) building located in Pennington Borough, NJ.Other three solar storage projects of Solar 4 All have already commenced services at Hopewell Valley Central High School, Cooper University Hospital and Caldwell Wastewater Treatment Facility in New Jersey. The Solar 4 All is a 158 megawatt-dc solar program, which is used to develop solar integrated projects to increase reliability of grid resiliency for unplanned prolonged outage.How This Storage System Works?The Pennington DPW solar storage system consists of 1,188-panels, 404-kilowatt-dc solar system with 200 megawatt-hour Tesla Energy lithium-ion batteries for storage. The project can provide power to 65 homes annually directly though grid. During day times, it recharges the batteries along with providing electricity to the building. At night, those batteries are used for supplying power. This way the system ensures emergency power service when required.Prospects in Solar IndustryPer a report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), solar electricity generation in the nation was 211 gigawatt-hour/day (GWh/d), which is likely to increase to 246 GWh/d in 2018. In spite of the rapid uptake, solar contributed just 1.3% of the total U.S. utility-scale generation in 2017, indicating immense scope for growth in the solar market.Realizing the fact that alternative energy will gain traction in the future, many utility providers have recently shifted their focus toward renewables as their preferred source of energy.

479,PEG,"Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. (CWCO  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $14.90 before closing the session a bit lower at $14.80 on Mar 15. The stock has returned 39.6% compared with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 15.8% in the past year.Over the past 52 weeks, Consolidated Water’s shares have ranged from a low of $10.15 to a high of $14.90. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 0.04 million.What's Driving Consolidated Water Higher?Consolidated Water develops & operates seawater desalination plants and engages in water distribution systems. It has operations in the United States as well as in other countries across the globe. To expand its operations, the company is looking for opportunities to tap markets that require potable water.In this regard, the Rosarito project in Mexico is noteworthy. The project encompasses the construction, operation and minority ownership of a 100-million gallon per say seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant. On Mar 7 2018, Consolidated Water announced execution of a subscription agreement for the equity funding required to construct and operate the plant and accompanying pipeline.This indicates the company’s progress in the Rosarito project, which has instilled optimism among investors and culminated into its latest 52-week high share price.It is imperative to mention here successful renewal of several long-term water supply agreements, in which has enabled greater visibility of long-term cash flows, has made the company confident enough to invest in projects like Rosarito. With its fourth-quarter 2017 results scheduled for next week, investors are expecting to come across more such agreements from the company’s part. This is another factor supporting the uptick of share price.Coming to its earnings history, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 11.99% in the past four quarters.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderConsolidated Water carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few other better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG  -  Free Report), American States Water (AWR  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report).

480,PEG,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Feb 27.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 17.24%. Moreover, it failed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average earnings miss being 3.99%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn Oct 2, 2017, AES Corp. transferred 100% of its shares in Shulbinsk HPP and Ust-Kamenogorsk HPP to the Republic of Kazakhstan in accordance with the termination of the concession agreement. As a result, the company anticipates a loss on disposal of at least $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.In December 2017, AES Corp. had hiked its quarterly common stock dividend by 3%. This indicates improved cash inflow from operating activities which we believe will duly get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 32 cents per share projects a decline of 8.6%, while the same for revenues of $3.67 billion shows a rise of 3.6% on a year-over-year basis.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for AES Corp. this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

481,PEG,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PEG  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Public Service Enterprise is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PEG in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 57 cents per share for PEG, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PEG, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.92% heading into earnings season.Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that PEG has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

482,PEG,"Alliant Energy Corporation (LNT  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Feb 22. In the third quarter, the utility company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 14.77%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderAlliant Energy’s earnings are expected to gain from its robust capital expenditure plans and constructive regulatory decisions. The progress, already made by the company in its wind-generation expansion plans and electricity generation from natural gas plans, will aid in meeting its earnings growth objective of 6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share is 38 cents, which reflects year-over-year growth of 35.7%. The new rate of electricity, which became effective from 2017, has helped the company increase earnings.Earnings WhisperOur proven model shows that Alliant Energy is unlikely to beat estimates because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. For a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates and Alliant Energy lacks the right mix.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Alliant Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Alliant Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Alliant Energy Corporation Quote Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is 0.00%.

483,PEG,"CenterPoint Energy Corp (CNP  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Feb 22.Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 4.88%. However, CenterPoint Energy outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.42%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCenterPoint Energy witnessed increased customer count during third-quarter 2017, primarily driven by the acquisition of Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM). The AEM acquisition has been accretive to the company’s results as of Sep 30, 2017, which in turn bolstered its Energy Services segment’s growth. We expect the company’s fourth-quarter results to also benefit from the same.Per management, customer growth, rate relief, energy services and midstream segments are likely to drive CenterPoint Energy’s fourth-quarter performance.Major regions of CenterPoint Energy’s service territory witnessed warmer-than-normal winter during the fourth quarter. This led to lower expenditure for consumers which are likely to dent the company’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents for fourth-quarter earnings marks a 15.4% increase year over year, while revenue estimate of $2.15 billion hints at an improvement of almost 3.4%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that CenterPoint Energy is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

It has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 9.08%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Edison International is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

This in turn is likely to have an adverse impact on the fourth-quarter results.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Edison International’s fourth-quarter earnings reflects 7.9% decline year over year, on 0.2% lower revenues worth $2.88 billion.On a bright note, the company hiked quarterly dividend rate by 11.5%, for shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 29, 2017.

486,PEG,"Electric utility firm Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) is set to release its fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Wednesday, Feb 21. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 46 cents on revenues of $5,410 million.In the preceding three-month period, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider reported stronger-than-expected earnings due to robust performance of its wholesale unit and lower costs.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the utility is on a solid footing, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Southern Company (The) QuoteInvestors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Southern Company surpasses earnings estimate this time too. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Factors to Consider This QuarterA leading utility holding entity in the U.S., Southern Company dominates the power business across the Southeast. With a strong rate base growth and constructive regulation, we expect the firm to generate steady earnings.Also, with operations in a stable and growing industry, Southern Company has a steady stream of cash flow. The utility’s history of consistent dividend payments indicates its confidence in itself.We further believe that the AGL Resources acquisition will be accretive to Southern Company earnings.However, with customer growth tepid and likely to remain so for some time, sales might be affected. This together with a large base, might make it difficult for Southern Company to manage rates. Higher operating and maintenance expenses is another concern.The utility is also bearing the brunt of continued delays and cost overruns over two of its large construction projects — Vogtle and Kemper — which are again expected to weigh on Southern Company's fortunes.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Southern Company will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for this company stands at +0.36%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: However, Southern Company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), when combined with a positive ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company, here are some utilities you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:CenterPoint Energy, Inc.
