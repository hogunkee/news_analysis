1,LEN,"The core personal consumption expenditures price index, the key Fed inflation gauge, rose 1.9% from a year ago in March, nearing policymakers' 2.0% target. Wall Street economists expected a 2% annual increase, with a 0.2% monthly gain.

The 2-year Treasury yield held at 2.49%, up 1 basis point.Treasury yields have surged over the past month as concerns about a trade war with China gave way to worries about firming inflation, a tight job market and a hawkish Fed. But the rise of the 10-year yield to a record high hasn't done much for bank stocks, because short-term rates have climbed even more.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

3,LEN,"Goldilocks has left the building. For proof, just look at interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield eclipsed 3% in late April for the first time in four years, hitting the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq. Clearly, the not-too-hot/not- too-cold economy that supported the nine-year bull market for stocks has fundamentally changed. On Wednesday, the 10-year yield again hit 3%.To some extent, that's good: Higher interest rates largely reflect faster economic growth, unemployment headed to a multidecade low and wage gains that are slowly picking up.Yet financial markets are sending the message that this good news comes with a growing risk of a squeeze on the economy from several directions. First, higher goods and wage costs will squeeze corporate profits. Caterpillar (CAT) warned recently that the first quarter was the ""high-water mark"" for operating margins, and profit pressures already are hitting other companies ranging from airlines to packaged food. Second, higher interest rates will squeeze corporate and household borrowers. Rising rates also could squeeze stock prices as investors opt for higher returns from risk-free short-term government bonds.Yet by far the biggest risk is that policymakers will go overboard. Fed rate hikes to counteract a temporary growth spurt from new tax cuts and government spending could push the economy into a recession if they go too far.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor the stock market, the most obvious sign of peril is the hit to the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average since late January. But worrisome signs lurk in the details. Both homebuilders, which thrive on low interest rates, and banks, which can benefit from rising rates, are among the market's biggest laggards.IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has sunk to 176 out of 197 industries based on stock performance. Shares of Lennar (LEN), the largest U.S. homebuilder, have tumbled from their January high. Meanwhile, the Banks-Money Center group, which includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and more, has slid to No. 158.While the latest data point to a robust housing market, there's no mystery about why housing stocks have tumbled as the 10-year Treasury yield pushes up mortgage rates. But what about the recent underperformance vs. the S&P 500 from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America? While higher interest rates have grabbed the headlines, the more ominous signal is the flattening Treasury yield curve. Over the past year, the gap between the 2-year Treasury yield and 10-year Treasury yield has been cut by more than half. The yield curve is at its flattest levels since the lead-up to the 2007 recession.Higher interest rates boost profits for Bank of America, Citigroup and others when the longer-term rates at which they lend increase more than the short-term rates at which they borrow. But the opposite has been happening, so even bank profits are getting squeezed. Two-year yields have climbed with the Fed's overnight rate and expectations of future hikes. But the 10-year yield's rise has lagged. Investors aren't demanding a big long-term premium, which suggests mild growth expectations beyond two years. The 2-year yield has hit its highest rates since August 2008, squeezing the spread between the 2- and 10-year yields.By the second half of 2019, an economy that the Fed worries is at risk of overheating could hit a soft patch as stimulus levels off. Overly tight Fed policy that raises borrowing costs could turn that soft patch into a ditch.Fed policymakers today are focused on overheating risks, while overlooking the likely slowdown. The Fed's latest projections, issued when the Fed hiked rates in March for the first time this year, penciled in two more rate hikes in 2018, three in 2019 and still two more in 2020. That would lift the Fed's benchmark rate from 1.62% now all the way to 3.375%. If that happens, the 10-year yield could head for 4% and the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage might near 6%.The bond market's reaction to the more hawkish Fed outlook was swift. Within a week, the spread between the 2- and 10-year Treasury yield narrowed to less than 50 basis points, then fell to as little as 40 basis points in mid-April. The spread is around 47 basis points in the stock market today, with the 2-year yield at 2.53% and the 10-year at 3%.Neel Kashkari, the dovish president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, called the flatter yield curve a ""yellow light flashing"" a heightened risk of a recession. His take-away: The Fed ""may not be that far away from neutral,"" a rate that neither boosts nor restrains economic growth.""We are clearly more concerned than the Fed"" about the economic outlook for 2019, wrote Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank. ""As the impact of the (tax cut and spending) stimuli fades, growth rates should begin to slow perceptibly around the middle of the year, before slowing further into 2020.""Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment research at Sun Life Investment Management, told IBD that he expects the 10-year Treasury yield to rise to 3.5% within a year as the Fed follows a path of accelerated tightening. He predicts one rate hike per quarter through 2019, ""which ultimately will lead to recession"" in 2020.To be fair, new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell faces an unprecedented policy challenge. Fiscal stimulus has always been ordered up during a recession or at the start of a recovery. This time, President Trump and Congress are delivering a double dose deep into the expansion, when growth is firm and labor markets tight. To top it off, the deficit financing used to pay for stimulus, which will exacerbate what most economists see as an unsustainable fiscal path, has added to upward pressure on interest rates.Now the Fed's challenge just got even harder. Core consumer price inflation ticked up to 2.1% in March. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption price index, rose to 1.9% in March. That's just below the central bank's 2% target.Average hourly wage growth ticked up to 2.7% in March and will likely head higher in the next few months. CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) all announced pay hikes effective this spring. CVS raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour and Target to $12. They are among dozens of major companies that announced wage increases in the wake of corporate tax cuts passed in December.As core inflation edges past the Fed's target and the jobless rate falls below 4%, standing pat would go against policymakers' deepest instincts.Bandholz expects cooler heads to prevail, with the Fed hiking rates just once in 2019 as data point to a slowdown. But Mullarkey notes that the data ""feedback loop is not instantaneous."" By the time the Fed recognizes that a soft patch has arrived, a recession may be a fait accompli.Even if the Fed does shift gears a year from now, false expectations come at a cost today. If policymakers are determined to stick to a path of steady Fed rate hikes, they could dampen the dynamic impact of lower taxes by adding to the growing and unsustainable federal debt burden.The more future Fed rate hikes that markets price in, the more federal borrowing costs will rise. As the government borrows more to service debt with higher interest rates, borrowing costs for businesses and individuals will face more upward pressure.Deutsche Bank estimates that U.S. Treasury issuance will soar from $1 trillion in 2017 to $1.5 trillion this year and $2.3 trillion next. The surging federal deficit is the main culprit. The Fed will add to the debt pileup as it offloads about $180 billion in government bonds this fiscal year.The Fed set its plan last fall for quantitative tightening, reversing bond buys made to aid the tepid recovery from the financial crisis. Newly passed tax cuts and spending hikes make those balance sheet reductions look like ""bad timing,"" Mullarkey says.Corporations carry a record $8.8 trillion in debt that will be more costly to refinance, working at cross-purposes with the tax-cut stimulus.Meanwhile, higher U.S. interest rates have begun to push up the dollar. That acts to tighten financial conditions not only at home but in developing economies where companies often borrow in dollars.""The risk in all this is a scenario where economic growth doesn't pick up as the supply-siders expect it to but interest rates move higher as a result of the larger federal deficits and the perception that Trump's fiscal stimulus might boost inflation,"" wrote Ed Yardeni, the veteran Wall Street economist who now runs Yardeni Research.That may not happen, but Yardeni sees little evidence that corporations are putting their tax windfalls to work in the real economy: ""We are waiting to see some signs that the supply-siders are on the right track. We aren't seeing any yet, though it has been only four months into the Trump tax cuts.""Stock market history suggests investors shouldn't worry right away about a flatter yield curve, LPL Financial strategists John Lynch and Ryan Detrick write. ""When looking back at the previous five recessions, once the yield curve hit 0.50%, it took a median of nearly a year before the curve inverted,"" they note.An inverted yield curve, meaning long-term bond yields fall below short-term yields, is a reliable predictor of recession. Yet recessions typically haven't begun until 20 months after the yield curve inverts.Also, Lynch and Detrick note, the S&P 500 has enjoyed a median 21.5% gain after the Treasury yield spread narrows to 50 basis points.The problem with counting on that history is that the Fed faces unusual late-cycle stimulus at a time that federal debt has begun an unprecedented spiral upward.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon, These 5 IBD 50 Stocks Share This Winning Growth TraitHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

5,LEN,"The 10-year Treasury yield hit 3% on Tuesday for the first time in more than four years, reflecting expectations that the Fed will hike its key rate four times in 2018. Stocks, which have struggled as Treasury rates have rallied strongly in recent sessions, sold off sharply yet again.Fed expectations are fluid. Around 10 a.m. Eastern Time, the CME Group FedWatch page showed roughly 53% odds of a fourth quarter-point rate hike coming in December, up from one-in-four odds after the deceptively strong March jobs report two weeks ago.But as the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones both closed 1.7% lower and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.3%, the 10-year Treasury yield pulled back to just below 3% and odds of a fourth Fed hike slipped to 39%.Bank stocks were among the better performers in afternoon trade on the stock market today. But Bank of America (BAC) reversed lower for a 0.4% decline as the market closed, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lost 0.5%. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are both still below their 50-day lines.Superregional Fifth Third Bank (FITB) surged 4.1% after soundly beating earnings estimates, but was well off session highs. West Coast-based Umpqua Holdings (UMPQ) gained 1.4%, extending its recent breakout.Bank stocks can see a big benefit from higher long-term rates if the spread vs. short-term rates widens. But the big move in the 10-year in recent weeks has seen narrowing spreads.While a higher 10-year Treasury means higher mortgage rates for home buyers, housing stocks got a lift initially Tuesday from strong earnings and housing data. Shares of PulteGroup (PHM) gapped higher on strong earnings, rising 2.9%, while Lennar (LEN) fell 1.7% and D.R. Horton (DHI) advanced 0.6%.March new home sales rose 4% to a 694,000 annual rate, well above the 630,000 rate expected and not far off November's 11-year high. Also, the Case Shiller 20-City Home Composite Price Index rose 6.8% from a year ago in March, the best gain since June 2014.Still, Tuesday's market action suggests, at least in the near term, that higher market interest rates may pose a hurdle for the S&P 500 and and the stock market generally as it aims to shake off the recent correction.Since jobs day, the Labor Department reported that core consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1% from a year ago in March. And now higher oil prices, which once again rose to their highest level since 2014 on Tuesday, could add to upward pressure on prices.At a minimum, the risk of another inflation undershoot has diminished. All the near-term risk is to the upside. That, in turn, could dampen demand for U.S. debt at a time when deficits are beginning to spiral higher and the Fed is curtailing its own holdings of Treasury and mortgage debt.In a Tuesday note, Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief U.S. economist, projected that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, looks likely to rise to 2.3% by the end of 2019, up from 1.6% in February.Core PCE inflation for March will be reported on Monday, April 30.The Federal Reserve will meet on May 1-2 but isn't expected to hike rates again until the June meeting.

10,LEN,"Consumer stocks led a bounce in the stock market Wednesday afternoon, although tariff worries hurt Dow industrials such as Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX).The Nasdaq composite erased a drop of nearly 2% to rise 0.8%. The S&P 500 also reversed higher, up 0.6% and looking more sure-footed at its 200-day moving average.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.5%. Some of its industrial companies fell after China announced new tariffs Wednesday on aircraft and other U.S.-made products. But losses shrank. Boeing and jet engine makers General Electric (GE) and United Tech were some of the Dow's largest decliners. The tariff news overshadowed Boeing's win of an order of 75 737 Max jets from India's Jet Airways.Tariff troubles were at least part of the reason the transportation sector was the weakest Wednesday. Ship, rail, truck, airfreight and logistics were in the bottom 10 of 197 industry groups.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSmall caps took part in the rebound, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.7%. Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and about the same on the NYSE compared with the same time Tuesday.Select retail and some health care industry groups were up 2% to 4%. Food industries also led, despite that China plans duties on some food imports.China also targeted U.S. auto manufacturers for retaliatory tariffs. Yet the industry group was the best performing on Wednesday. General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) climbed 2% and 1%, respectively. Tesla (TSLA) reversed higher and surged 6%. All three stocks are trying to recover from big corrections.Homebuilders, another proxy for U.S. consumer health, were one of the top industries in today's market. Lennar (LEN), the nation's No. 1 homebuilder by revenue, spearheaded the group's move after it beat profit expectations. The company says it remains ""positive on the outlook of the housing industry in general."" Lennar soared 9% in heavy volume, and rose above the 50-day line.Today's only good breakout was in the consumer space, as well. Boston Beer (SAM) leapt above the 202.45 buy point of a cup-without-handle base in heavy volume. Cowen upgraded the stock to market perform from underperform Wednesday. Market risk is too high for new stock purchases, however.U.S. oil prices fell 2% early but trimmed losses. Oil closed slightly lower at $63.37 a barrel.

11,LEN,"The growing trade spat between the U.S. and China slammed the major indexes early on Wednesday, but the Nasdaq composite bounced back into positive ground and lifted its peer indexes higher. The leading index turned an early loss of nearly 1.9% to a gain of 0.8% in afternoon trading. Tesla (TSLA) led some automakers into positive ground.Tesla stock accelerated its rebound and throttled more than 5% higher to 283.24 in heavy volume. While at least three of the five FAANG stocks also reversed higher, consumer and construction-related shares led the upside. So did defensive sectors, including drugstore, meat, generic drugs, dairy and confectionery firms.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 erased a 1.6% loss and reversed to a gain of 0.7%. For the third day in a row, the large-cap benchmark undercut the long-term 200-day moving average. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.5%, as at least seven of its 30 components were up 1 point or more. They included UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Home Depot (HD) and Apple (AAPL).In IBD Leaderboard, software, e-commerce and apparel firms continue to do relatively better. Retail chain Lululemon (LULU), which joined the Leaders list on Feb. 7, fell more than 1% to 87.52 in dull turnover. But the yogawear apparel leader remains more than 4% above a buy point near 84.The stock has advanced more than 38% since it cleared a bottoming base pattern at 64.91 in November.That bottoming base also served as a first-stage pattern. First- and second-stage bases tend to carry higher probabilities of success following a breakout from those bases.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseJust two of the Dow industrials' 30 components, industrial heavyweights Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), sank 1 point or more as investors fretted over China's expansion of retaliatory tariffs to cover more agricultural and manufactured goods.Caterpillar, off 1% to 143.64, is still holding above the 200-day moving average but is now around 17% below an all-time high of 173.24. Watch to see if the construction and mining gear titan can bottom out and begin to form the right side of a potential new base.A properly formed base sets up a market-leading stock in a position to possibly break out to new highs and stage a solid run. But today, IBD's current outlook for U.S. equities remains ""Market in correction,"" so breakouts are understandably few in number.Floor & Decor (FND) is one of the rare big movers today, rising more than 5% to 55.06 in heavy volume.The flooring products retailer, which imitates Home Depot's large warehouse-style model, is now extended more than 5% past a 51.58 buy point in an eight-week cup-style base. It's best to buy a stock no more than 5% past the proper buy point; buying too high in price can subject an investor to a quick loss if the stock makes a temporary pullback to or even mildly below the breakout entry.Floor & Decor, now a mid-cap stock with a market value of $5.3 billion, went public in April 2017 at 21 a share. It has a float of 84 million shares and currently ranks No. 22 within the IBD 50. The company has grown earnings per share 9%, 75%, 47%, 31% and 58% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters. Sales jumped 25%, 31%, 29%, 27% and 40% over the same time frame.Going back to Tesla, the San Francisco-based firm still trades well below its 52-week peak of 389.61. Plus, the electric vehicle pioneer trades sharply below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. So the stock is nowhere close to a new IBD-style buy point.However, those who bought at the initial April 2013 breakout near 40 still hold a fantastic long-term gain.At this point, it makes sense to wait and watch for the possibility of heavy institutional buying to return. Trading near 280, Tesla is still an institutional favorite. The stock reached a total 1,000 mutual fund and hedge fund holders for the first time during the second quarter of 2016.That sponsorship has grown a bit more to 1,027 funds as of the first quarter of this year. In Q3 of 2017, that number reached 1,095 funds owning a total 54.4 million shares. Earlier this week, Tesla reported confidence in its goal to reach a significantly higher production rate of its Model 3 sedan within the next three months and said it has no plans to raise more capital via debt or equity offerings this year.The company said it built 2,020 Model 3 sedans in the final seven days of March and expects to see that run rate climb rapidly through the second quarter of this year.Tesla is racing to meet the mountain of 500,000 preorders made for the affordable all-electric four-door vehicle. The base price of the Model 3 is $35,000, but many new buyers are likely to add options.Elsewhere, homebuilding-related stocks advanced sharply following a blistering quarterly report from giant Lennar (LEN). The stock rose more than 8% to 61.97 and leapt back above the 50-day moving average for the first time in more than eight weeks.The Miami-based builder posted a sharp increase in earnings for the February-ended fiscal first quarter on a 28% jump in sales to $2.98 billion.LGI Homes (LGIH), a member of the IBD 50, ramped up more than 6% to 70.15 in below average trade. The stock continues to work on the right side of a cup-style pattern. The small cap rose 161% in 2017.Analysts see Q1 earnings rising 37% to 71 cents a share. LGI, which focuses on entry-level homes, grew its profits by 39% to $4.73 a share in 2017.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on growth stocks, new breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Also In Stock Market Today: How Should You Handle Boeing Now? How Are The Best Growth Stocks Doing?

17,LEN,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data.

The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%.

Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion.

20,LEN,"Now that President Trump has turned down the heat on a China trade war, investor concern about rising inflation and a hawkish Federal Reserve may be taking center stage. On Friday, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.96%, just eclipsing the four-year high touched in February. The run-up in yields is a quiet reason for the stock market's struggles late in the week, even though chip warnings and Apple (AAPL) iPhone fears dominated the headlines.

The homebuilder reported better-than-expected fiscal-Q3 results, sending its shares up over 4%. The stock is forming a flat base with a 55.85 conventional buy point, but there is a slightly lower resistance area that could provide an alternate entry — at 54.96. Fellow homebuilder KB Home (KBH) rose 1.2% and is still in buy range after reclaiming its 24.47 cup-base entry Monday.China-based leading stocks were some of the day's strongest performers.

22,LEN,"What do Netflix (NFLX), Chevron (CVX) and Stamps.com (STMP) share in common? They are all near buy points in a cup-with-handle base, one of the most common bullish consolidations.XCompanies and stocks will change, but human nature doesn't. That's why certain bullish patterns reappear through history that signal a higher likelihood of success for a stock that clears the consolidation.The cup with handle, which should look a lot like a teacup, must be at least seven weeks long. (A cup-without-handle pattern must be six weeks.) The midpoint of the handle must be in the upper half of the overall pattern. The handle, which must be at least five days long, should be flat to downward-sloping, ideally on light volume. A slight downward drift helps shake out weak holders before a new uptrend. If and when a stock breaks out from the handle, new buyers must bid up the price because existing investors aren't eager to sell.During Monday's stock market trading, the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow all hit record highs.Futures for the S&P 500 index were up a fraction vs. fair value Tuesday morning. So were Nasdaq 100 futures. Futures for the Dow industrials advanced 0.2%.Investors are reacting to third-quarter production and delivery figures from Tesla (TSLA) released late Monday. While the overall output and shipment figures were in line with analyst expectations, Tesla produced just 260 Model 3 sedans in Q3. Tesla blamed ""bottlenecks."" But that doesn't bode well for the electric automaker's goal of Model 3 mass production by year end. Tesla shares fell more than 2% in premarket trading Tuesday.Meanwhile, Lennar (LEN) reported better-than-expected profit, sending its shares up nearly 4% before the open, as the builder works its way through the right side of a consolidation. Several other homebuilder stocks are at or near buy points.Netflix has been consolidating in a cup base since July 21, really a base on top of a prior flat base. The internet TV giant formed a handle last week, helped by the Sept. 25 tech stock sell-off that acted as a shakeout. That handle lowers the buy point slight to 190.05.Netflix at the time found support at its 50-day moving average and edged a little higher. On Monday, Netflix fell 2.4% to 177.01, dropping modestly below its rising 50-day line.Just because Netflix has formed a cup-with-handle base is no guarantee that it will break out. Netflix could fall back if mutual funds and other big institutions don't step and support and propel the stock forward.Netflix is a member of Leaderboard, IBD's premium service focusing on a handful of stocks, mostly growth plays, providing annotated chart analysis.The Dow energy giant fell 7 cents to 117.43, closing near session highs after falling as low as 115.53. But Monday's action marked the fifth day for Chevron's handle, which now is fully formed, creating a 118.43 buy point.Chevron has been consolidating since late December, as crude prices pulled back from recent highs and then began to rise again. Chevron's fortunes, like those of other oil companies, is largely tied to that of crude futures. U.S. crude, which topped $52 at one point last week, is back to testing the key $50 level once again.Stamps.com rose 4.4% to 211.60.

Backlog value grew 9% to $1.66 billion, with the number of homes roughly flat at 4,411.Outlook: KB Home estimates its effective tax rate will be 27% in 2018, down from 37.7% in 2017. While a one-time, non-cash charge of $115 million will be booked in Q1 for income tax provisions due to a re-measurement of its deferred tax assets, management sees the lower corporate tax rate boosting future earnings.""As we look to 2018, we expect conditions will remain favorable in most of our served markets, with solid demand for housing driven by healthy employment, rising household incomes and strong consumer confidence, and continued limited supply,"" said Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Mezger in a statement.Stock: KB Home rallied 3.4% late. Shares closed up 0.4% at 34.35 on the stock market today, well above buying range along with many of its peers in IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial group, which is ranked No. 9 among 197 industry groups based on stock price performance.The GOP tax legislation will ripple through the housing market in 2018, boosting consumer incomes and confidence overall, but potentially hurting the housing market in high-tax states hit by the limit on deductions for state and local taxes.Citi downgraded KB Home to sell last week, noting its 31% exposure to California and the likelihood it will write down the value of deferred tax assets from past losses.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky.

The Nasdaq, which was down as much as 0.7% early on, closed with a 0.1% decline amid weakness in semiconductor stocks. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slid 1.2%.The S&P 500 fell 0.1% also. The Dow Jones industrial average shed less than 0.1%. Intel (INTC) slid to the lowest level since October. The semiconductor bellwether broke out Dec. 20 from a cup-without-handle base, but its loss has triggered IBD's 7%-8% sell rule.

Winners and losers were even on the Nasdaq, but on the NYSE decliners led by an 8-5 ratio.Wal-Mart (WMT), another Dow component, fell just below the 100.23 buy point of a flat base the retail giant had topped Monday.Small caps' losses were in line with the rest of the market, with the Russell 2000 down 0.1%.The market spent most of the morning and middle part of the day reducing its losses. But selling returned around 2 p.m. ET, on a report that President Trump may withdraw the U.S. from the North American Free Trade Agreement, more commonly known as Nafta. Indexes recovered from that headline and pared losses into the close.Earlier, Wall Street was shaken by a Bloomberg report that Chinese officials may pare or end their purchases of U.S. debt. China is one of the largest buyers of U.S. Treasuries, and a drop in that large pool of demand would send bond yields higher. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note's yield reached as much as 2.59% — the highest since March — before erasing most of its advance.With yields climbing, financial stocks showed relative strength. The SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) and SPDR S&P Regional Bank (KRE) exchange traded funds rose more than 1%. SPDR Financial (XLF) rose less than 1%. All three were among the best sector ETFs.Gulfport, Miss.-based Hancock Holding (HBHC) broke out of a flat base and closed near the 53.45 buy point. Volume was heavy for the Gulf Coast bank. Several other regional banks tried to break out, but their stock action was hesitant.Homebuilders were one of the worst industry groups of today's market, off more than 2%. Lennar (LEN) reported a surprise decline in earnings Wednesday due to a change in the timing of a transaction designed to take advantage of tax-law changes.Several oil industry groups rose after the price of crude remained near three-year highs.

25,LEN,"Just about everything (other than inflation) is lining up against investors in long-term Treasuries: stronger tax-cut-fueled growth; a Congress that is arguing over how much to hike spending; an unwinding of global central bank bond buying; and talks between North Korea and South Korea on easing military tensions. Add to that Wednesday's report that China is souring on purchases of U.S. government bonds.X All of these factors helped push the 10-year Treasury yield up as high as 2.59% on Wednesday, before easing to 2.55% amid speculation that the U.S. will pull out of Nafta. That's still not far below the four-year-high 2.63% touched in March.Yet, in one respect, markets may be underestimating upward pressure on long-term Treasury yields. While a number of Wall Street firms have said that a trillion-dollar deficit could return in fiscal 2019, the realization hasn't hit that annual deficits could approach $2 trillion, about 7% of GDP, by 2027.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rallied modestly early Thursday after retreating Wednesday but well off intraday lows. Bank stocks pushed higher in Wednesday's stock market trading, helped by prospects for wider net interest margins that would come from rising long-term rates without an equivalent rise in short-term Treasuries. Bank stocks edged higher early Thursday.Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC) rose 1.4%, Bank of America (BAC) 0.9% and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) 1.1%.Meanwhile, homebuilder stocks sought to rebound after tumbling on the prospects for higher mortgage rates. Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers (TOL) rose 1% after sinking 2.9% on Wednesday. D.R. Horton (DHI) gained 1.5% after Wednesday's 3.5% retreated. Lennar (LEN), which sailed past fourth-quarter revenue estimates Wednesday but missed earnings due to a tax-related shift, was an exception, climbing 2.4% Wednesday. Lennar rose 1.4% Thursday morning.Some analysts noted that Beijing's reported warning, which may be an effort to gain leverage in trade disputes with the U.S., may not be such a big deal because ""China has not been a big buyer of Treasuries for several years now,"" as Jefferies economists Thomas Simons and Ward McCarthy wrote.Even before the Trump tax cuts passed, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting a $1.5 trillion deficit in 2027 as entitlement spending swells. How could that get as high as $2 trillion? The first step would be to extend individual tax cuts that are set to sunset after 2025, as the GOP vows to do. That could add about $150 billion to the 2027 deficit.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Next, factor in behavioral changes that government scorekeepers didn't expect. Already California, New York and other blue states, whose upper-middle-class taxpayers could be hit by new limits on the deduction of state and local taxes, are trying to nail down ways to protect their residents from paying higher federal taxes. One idea is to allow individuals to make voluntary tax-protected contributions to state government, in lieu of tax payments. Limiting deductions was supposed to save $100 billion a year by 2025.Further, some analysts believe that the official score of the legislation underestimates the revenue loss from pass-through businesses, which account for the vast majority of enterprises, opting to incorporate to take advantage of the new 21% corporate tax rate or otherwise reorganize to minimize tax bills.Here's another coming shock: The Trump tax legislation was supposed to cut government health care spending by $53 billion in 2027 by repealing the individual mandate, but ObamaCare may end up costing substantially more — not less — due to Trump's policies. Despite repeal of the individual mandate and a sign-up period for HealthCare.gov that was half as long, the number of people signing up for coverage barely fell from a year ago, and the total could end up being higher once unpaid enrollment is winnowed out, because millions more were eligible for free ObamaCare bronze plans this year.Even still, most of the 4.5 million uninsured Americans who were eligible for free coverage likely didn't sign up because they didn't realize it or missed the sign-up window. The surge in free bronze plans is a result of President Trump's decision to halt payments for cost-sharing subsidies, which the Affordable Care Act promised to insurers to reimburse their expense for dramatically shrinking deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income households who buy silver coverage.Trump, who had the authority to end the payments funded by President Obama without a congressional appropriation, had long threatened the move as an act of sabotage. But most state health insurance officials seized an opening to jury-rig their exchanges in a way that made the government's cost of subsidies soar and turned the attempted sabotage into a life raft.If Democrats reclaim the White House, expect them to seize on the expansion of free health coverage under Trump with more intensive enrollment efforts, or else states could pursue auto-enrollment initiatives to enroll modest-income households in free plans, substantially boosting the federal government's cost.Putting everything together, as deficits widen from tax cuts that don't expire, state and individual behavioral shifts that further reduce tax revenues, and higher-than-expected ObamaCare costs, debt service costs will balloon as well.A  new projection is out from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that the annual federal deficit will hit $2.1 trillion in 2027 on the current trajectory, including a fuller range of tax extensions, disaster relief, a lifting of annual spending limits known as the sequester and all the additional debt service.One near-term development that could stand in the way of deeper sell-off in long-term Treasuries is the prospect for a government shutdown. The likelihood of a shutdown seemed to dim late Tuesday, when a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to renew protections for Dreamers under President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. While Trump is expected to challenge the dubious ruling in court, the issue may not be a barrier to keeping the government open for business beyond Jan. 19, when the most recent budget authorization expires. Still, Democratic leaders in Congress are talking about the reprieve as temporary and continue to tie a DACA fix to a longer government funding resolution.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Tax-Cut Windfall Mounts: Higher Pay, Lower Utility BillsThese Five Top Stocks Hit Buy Points; Why This One Stands OutHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

26,LEN,"KB Home (KBH) topped expectations late Thursday, but the homebuilder has been making headlines over the last week, not likely for the reasons it wants, amid an ongoing feud between KB Home CEO Jeffrey Mezger and comedian Kathy Griffin.X Estimates: Profits seen rising 12% to 47 cents a share on 23% revenue growth to $1.12 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Per-share earnings of 51 cents per diluted share on revenue of $1.14 billion.Stock: Shares rose late after climbing 2.8% to 22.22 on the stock market today, retaking their key 50-day line as the stock heads toward a 24.47 buy point. Scandal or no, shares have been rising steadily over the last week, staging a six-session win streak.Other builder stocks are in or near buy range. D.R. Horton (DHI) re-entered buying territory earlier this week after breaking out Sept. 12. Toll Bros. (TOL) edged up 1.8% to 40.98 Thursday, closing in on a 41.17 buy point from a flat base. LGI Homes (LGIH) rallied 3.6% to 47.86, clearing an entry of 46.99 from a cup-with-handle base.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Mezger's feud with Griffin went public after the Huffington Post published audio of the KB Home chief executive going on a slur-filled tirade against his next-door neighbor. The board of KB Home slashed his bonus by 25% and said in a regulatory filing that ""if in the future there is any similar incident, he will be dismissed.""Homebuilders have also been buffeted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which sent sales of new homes unexpectedly lower last month.D.R. Horton also has said it sees an 85% backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter, down from a prior range of 88% to 90%, citing delays caused by hurricanes.Lennar (LEN) said Irma damage was ""mild"" but predicted it would delay about 700 deliveries from the Q4 of 2017 into the following fiscal year. Harvey impacted about 120 new orders and deliveries in Q3 and is projected to impact approximately 130 deliveries in Q4.RELATED:KB Home's CEO Has Been Warned: He'll Be Fired For Doing This AgainNew-Home Sales Unexpectedly Fall, But These 3 Builders Are Near BuysD.R.

27,LEN,"New-home sales unexpectedly fell in August while supply surged as hurricanes take their toll on normal sales activity in Texas and much of the South. But shares of most homebuilders rallied Tuesday morning, with D.R. Horton (DHI), Toll Bros. (TOL) and LGI Homes (LGIH) all close to buy points.Sales of single-family new-home sales fell 3.4% to an annual rate of 560,000, after July was revised up slightly to a 580,000 pace, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected a rise to 583,000. The supply of homes at the current sales pace rose to 6.1 months, the highest since July 2014. Some 284,000 new homes were on the block, the most since May 2009, at the tail end of the last recession. Sales fell 4.7% in the South.The storms and the aftermath will likely affect sales and construction for several months.D.R. Horton rose 1% to 37.44 in the stock market today, after reaching 37.61 intraday and briefly topping a 37.54 buy point. D.R. Horton cleared that entry earlier this month but pulled back, finding support just above its 50-day moving average. D.R. Horton lowered guidance on Monday due to the recent hurricanes.Toll Bros. advanced 1 cent to 40.22. Shares of the entry-luxury builder are closing in on a 41.17 buy point.LGI Homes advanced 1.1% to 46.07. As of Tuesday's close, LGI Homes has a proper handle with the minimum five days. That gives the stock a lower entry of 46.99.Meanwhile, Home Depot (HD), which has gotten a lift from prehurricane preparations and post-hurricane repair, edged up 0.1% to 161.26. Home Depot nudged past a 160.96 entry on Monday, but in light volume.RELATED:D.R.

Horton (DHI) trimmed its outlook in the wake of recent natural disasters.The company said it sees an 85% backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter, down from a prior range of 88% to 90%, citing delays caused by hurricanes.The homebuilder also expects selling, general and administrative expenses to be 8.6% of revenue vs. prior outlook for 8.3% to 8.4%, and $150 million in cash flow, down from old guidance for $300 million.Shares closed up 0.5% at 37.08 on the stock market today, as Horton struggles to reach buy range after briefly clearing a 37.54 buy point from a flat base.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now?

32,LEN,"Stocks slumped on Tuesday and the Dow Jones industrial average led the decline, falling more than 0.4%. The 30-component blue chip index gained 2.9% last week, its biggest weekly gain of the year.XThe S&P 500 was off 0.4% while the Nasdaq composite squandered early gains of 0.9% to finish down 0.2%. Volume dropped on both exchanges, according to early data. Small caps got hit hard with the Russell 2000 down 1%.Meanwhile, megacap techs Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) flexed relative strength, and the 0.8% rebound in the latter is perhaps more important. Why? The parent of Google is trying stay on the north side of its fast-rising 50-day moving average and preserve at least some gains since clearing a 1,006.29 buy point in a flat base in October.Apple was off about 0.1% at 169.64 but is maintaining an air cushion above its own 50-day line. Shares of the iPhone, iPad and MacBook giant are also still a touch extended from the proper buy zone after the stock broke out of a good cup with handle at 160.97 on Oct. 27.Alphabet holds a solid Composite Rating of 93 on a scale of 1 to 99 on IBD Stock Checkup.Top industry groups included a few defensive industries, including funeral services and tobacco, also rallied 0.7% or more.Department store, ship transport, oil machinery, oilfield services, metal ores, electric utility and water utility shares got pounded with declines of 1% or more. West and Southwest banks and homebuilders also fell hard.Top homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH) sank for a third straight session, losing 1.3% to 66.84. But shares remain firmly above the key 50-day moving average.LGI, which specializes in homes for first-time buyers, has risen more than 90% past a 34.94 early entry in a long saucerlike base.Miami-based homebuilding giant Lennar (LEN) dropped 1.5% to 62.06 in light turnover. Shares are still acting fine since an Oct. 3-4 breakout from a 15-week flat base with a 55.85 entry. The gain got as high as 14%.Lennar, much like what Apple has done, is engineering a mini turnaround in profits, which fell 75% and 4% vs. year-ago levels in the first two quarters of the current fiscal year ended in November. But in the August-ended fiscal third quarter, Lennar grew earnings 5% on a 15% sales jump, and Q4 earnings are expected to accelerate, rising 10% to $1.48 a share.Building is the top sector among the 33 tracked by IBD in its stock research tables. See the sector rankings by going to IBD Data Tables in the Stock Lists section at Investors.com, then click on ""Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables.""Back to Apple, the megacap is outperforming the Dow Jones industrials with a 46% year-to-date return, excluding dividends. Apple, which also pays a quarterly cash dividend of 63 cents a share, has rallied nearly 49% since its breakout from a bottoming base pattern in early January.That bottoming base was an excellent stage-one cup with handle, showing a 118.12 buy point.Elsewhere, Snap (SNAP) jumped 10% to 14.92 in double normal turnover on a bullish note by a Barclays analyst, who noted that 2018 could mark a turnaround in fundamentals.A turnaround, in fact, is badly needed as the Venice, Calif.-based social network is seeing huge red ink and a slowdown in user growth.While Snap may seem like a ""bargain"" to some traders since shares are still 49% below the 29.44 all-time peak, keep in mind that it's still not clear whether Snap will show the spending discipline in order to turn a profit.Sales growth is marvelous, with the top line growing 406%, 286%, 153% and 62% in the past four quarters. But the growth rate is certainly slowing.The company lost a combined 62 cents a share over those four total quarters and is expected to notch a net loss of 16 cents per share in Q4. As a result, Snap gets a dismal 3 EPS Rating (1 is the worst, 99 the best) and a 15 Composite score from IBD Stock Checkup.RELATED:Investor's Corner: When To Buy A Stock After Its IPOWho Are The New Stock Market Winners?How To Find Top New IPOs: Use This IBD ScreenHow To Spot Major Stock Market Tops: Here Is The Easy WayFinding Outstanding Stocks Today: Peek Inside The IBD 50

36,LEN,"It's been a fantastic year for homebuilders, ranked among the top industries since May. That's made winners of a couple of ETFs, although one is well ahead of the other.X SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) are both in IBD's ETF Leaders screen. Yet, neither is a pure-play homebuilding ETF, and the two funds are structured quite differently.That helps explain why iShares U.S. Home Construction has sharply outperformed, up about 57% this year compared with about 31% for SPDR S&P Homebuilders.SPDR Homebuilders (which holds 35 stocks) is only 33% invested in builders, while iShares Home Construction (with nearly 50 holdings) is more builder-heavy, with nearly two-thirds of the portfolio in those companies.Both also have a good share of building products companies: 33% for SPDR Homebuilders and 15% for iShares Home Construction. The rest of the portfolios consist of home furnishing, home improvement (Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW)), appliance and other companies related to the housing industry.The heavier reliance on homebuilders has indeed helped iShares U.S. Home Construction put up better returns in 2017.For example, D.R. Horton (DHI), which makes single-family homes in 26 states, has surged more than 35% from a breakout to new highs on Sept. 12. D.R. Horton is the largest holding in the iShares fund, with a 13.2% weighting. By comparison, the same stock occupies 4.4% in SPDR Homebuilders, which equal-weights its holdings.Because of that structure, winning homebuilding stocks have about the same weighting as fund laggards such as Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Johnson Controls (JCI).Both funds own the other major homebuilders that have rallied this year, such as Lennar (LEN), NVR (NVR), PulteGroup (PHM), Toll Bros. (TOL) and CalAtlantic (CAA).Chartwise, both ETFs formed three-weeks-tight patterns in the first half of December and are trading close to possible buy points. For iShares Home Construction, the entry is at 44.09 and for SPDR Homebuilders 44.59. The primary risk is in the lengthy advance both ETFs have enjoyed this year.The new tax bill cuts the amount of mortgage interest homeowners can deduct on their taxes, a measure that particularly hit luxury-home builder Toll Bros. But with the U.S. economy trending higher, many analysts maintain a positive outlook.""The National Association of Home Builders' index was released and it indicated that developers are near giddy,"" economist Joel L. Naroff wrote in a note Tuesday. ""The index is now above every reading we saw during the housing bubble.""The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

The futures contract, which expires in January, soared 20% to $18,550 in late-afternoon trade. The cryptocurrency's price was recently near $17,200, according to CoinDesk.

Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and NVR (NVR).The other YTD outperformer is VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals (REMX), with a 61.7% YTD return as of Dec. 5. It came in fourth based on a three-month return of 17.2%. Shares slipped below the 50-day moving average, but could set up a buy opportunity on a solid move above the line. REMX broke out from a cup base in late July and rallied 39% to its Nov. 29 intraday high.SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) came in second with a three-month return of 17.4%. It has been under pressure much of the year — it's down 13.4% YTD.

SPDR S&P Bank (KBE), up 17.2% over the past three months, is in buy range after clearing a 47.09 entry of a long, shallow consolidation. KBE placed third on the list, while SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE), was fifth with a 16.9% three-month gain.

56,LEN,"President Trump launched his push for tax reform on Wednesday, saying it would finally give workers a pay raise and suggested it would be bad for rich guys like himself who rely on loopholes.""Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers,"" Trump said in Springfield, Missouri.Trump offered no details, so no firm conclusions can be made whether the eventual plan will match the populist rhetoric. Wall Street liked the message, with the S&P 500 index rising 0.5% to register its fourth-straight gain, but it remains to seen if Republicans will be able to make the numbers add up with few, if any, Democrats likely to lend their support.While it's too soon to say who might feel the squeeze under the emerging GOP tax plan, two potential tax deductions that have been floated to help offset the cost of tax reform would have a disproportionate hit on the housing sector and upper-middle-class communities with high real estate values — and high property taxes.One potential change would cut in half the current $1 million mortgage cap — up to which interest is deductible. That could have a big impact on buyers of Toll Brothers (TOL) luxury homes, which average about $800,000. Some other homebuilders such as Lennar (LEN), whose homes average $375,000, wouldn't be affected under such a policy.Toll Bros. CEO Doug Yearley called the idea ""very bad policy"" in a CNBC interview last week.IBD'S TAKE: Toll Brothers is ranked No. 5 in IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which companies are setting the pace.Even if the housing sector isn't targeted directly, it could suffer collateral damage if tax reform eliminates the state and local tax deductions, which are estimated to save taxpayers about $1.3 trillion over a decade.The National Association of Realtors has warned that killing that deduction, while doubling the standard deduction (as both the House GOP and Trump have proposed), could sink home prices by 10%. Under this scenario, the Realtors group says that only about 5% of households would itemize, down from 30%, so the mortgage deduction would offer little incentive for buying a home vs. renting.The state and local tax deduction is seen as disproportionately benefiting high-tax states, which are mainly blue, non-Trump states. Yet 20 GOP members of Congress from blue states, along with 50 Democrats, wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in June stressing the importance of retaining the deduction.Bottom line: Trump is right that the U.S. corporate tax rate is too high, even if many companies pay far less than the statutory rate. Yet Republicans have their work cut out for them in crafting a plan that lives up to Trump's, without blowing up the deficit or creating a big enough backlash among tax reform's losers to sink its chances.RELATED:Toll Bros.

57,LEN,"U.S. stock indexes stumbled Tuesday and losses persisted in midsession action. Homebuilders were among the hardest-hit stocks, as the 10-year yield reached 3.06%. D.R.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDespite the ugly action, the major indexes remained above their 50-day moving average. The 50-day line is an important area to watch. The area had acted as resistance until recently, when the indexes retook the line. Now bulls are hoping the 50-day area can act as support.In stock market news today, homebuilders had their own battle going to find support.D.R. Horton, the second-biggest homebuilder by market cap, is down 18% so far this year, including Tuesday's dive. Lennar, the biggest by market cap, is off 16%.On Tuesday, the National Association of Home Builders reported that its housing index for May rose to 70. April's reading was 69, and analysts expected no change in May. The slight beat, though, had to contend with larger concerns about interest rates. (An index reading over 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as good compared with those who view them as poor.)The 10-year yield popped to 3.06%. The yield was at 2.46% at the start of the year. Higher interest rates are generally regarded as a negative for home sales.In terms of earnings and revenue, Lennar and D.R. Horton are doing fine.Lennar grew earnings 594% in its most recently reported quarter, topping views by 44%. Revenue growth stepped up from 12% to 28%.D.R. Horton boosted earnings 42% and 52% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters. Revenue growth accelerated from 11% to 15% to 17%.A stock's fundamentals alone can't guarantee price gains. The homebuilder industry group is No. 182 in six-month price performance, among 197 industry groups.Among those 197 industry groups, losers led gainers by a 5-3 ratio. The best performer for the day was the food and dairy group. Food is regarded as a defensive investment.RELATED:Ford Motor Gets DowngradeOne Stock Chart Can Give Multiple InterpretationsDon't Rely On Investment Gurus

62,LEN,"A British billionaire reportedly is considering buying a stake in Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), prodding shares of the Israeli drugmaker to pop Monday despite a price-target cut following a lackluster quarter.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva jumped 8.9% to close at 12.41. Allergan (AGN) also sustained a price-target cut following its mixed report last week, and shares dipped 0.3% to close at 174.34.Len Blavatnik is looking to acquire up to a $3 billion stake in Teva, according to Reuters, which cited reports from Israeli outlets over the weekend. Teva has a $12.4 billion market cap. Shares hit a 17-year low last week after third-quarter earnings missed and Teva cut its 2017 guidance.Blavatnik could either acquire a stake in Teva through a private stock listing or by scooping up some of Allergan's 10% stake. Allergan received 10% of Teva as part of a deal last year in which it sold its generics business to Teva. Last week, Allergan said it was looking to sell that stake.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan trimmed his price target on Teva to 8 from 14, and kept his underperform rating. He expects the stock to continue to ""languish"" as investors await an updated strategic plan from new Chief Executive Kare Schultz.""Teva left a lot of questions unanswered on their conference call,"" Divan said in a note to clients. ""This is understandable since the new CEO just joined the company the day before, but the lack of insight is still frustrating.""IBD'S TAKE: At least one biotech had ""alarming"" results, though earnings were mixed for most. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on the industry group thus far in the third-quarter earnings season.Teva, the No. 2 maker of generic drugs, now finds itself on the flip side of the coin. Mylan (MYL) just launched a generic version of Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis drug from Teva. Now, Divan sees Teva pulling in $1.01 billion in U.S. Copaxone sales next year, down 71% year over year.""Mylan came to market immediately and at a price that was lower than Teva expected,"" he said.Questions also remain for Allergan, Divan said in a separate report. He cut his price target on Allergan to 224 from 243, though he kept his outperform rating. Like Teva, Allergan is soon to face generic competition for Restasis, an eye drug. It sees competition in either January or July 2018.""Our base case now assumes Restasis generic entry in the U.S. at the start of 2018, instead of mid-2018,"" he said. ""Our base 2018 EPS of $15.25 is down from our previous $16.55 in large part because of this change and what we assume would be a relatively rapid erosion in sales.""Generics could also pressure Namenda EX (extended release), Estrace, Delzicol and Aczone, drugs to treat dementia, a menopausal side effect, ulcerative colitis and a type of acne, respectively.Divan also lowered his estimate for Kybella, a drug to reduce fat under the chin, ""given the limited commercial progress that product has made.""

Net orders grew 8% to 1,874 while the orders backlog climbed to 3,333 homes, up 2.5%. Meritage rose 2.5% to 45.90, extending Monday's breakout past a 44.55 cup-base buy point. Meritage has risen for nine straight sessions.D.R. Horton (DHI) trimmed its outlook last month, saying it sees an 85% backlog conversion rate for Q4, down from a prior range of 88% to 90%, citing delays caused by hurricanes.The homebuilder also expects selling, general and administrative expenses to be 8.6% of revenue vs. prior outlook for 8.3% to 8.4%, and $150 million in cash flow, down from old guidance for $300 million.Last week D.R. Horton, Toll Bros. (TOL) and LGI Homes (LGIH) broke out past buy points.The storms are expected to worsen tightness in the labor market for builders, who have been complaining about shortages of skilled workers. Costs for construction materials may also pick up.Data on the housing market have already been affected. New-home sales unexpectedly fell in August while supply surged as hurricanes took their toll on normal sales activity in Texas and much of the South.RELATED:KB Home's CEO Has Been Warned: He'll Be Fired For Doing This Again

71,LEN,"Treasury yields jumped Tuesday morning with a solid retail sales report, but the rout for both bonds and stocks gathered steam. The 10-year Treasury yield vaulted to 3.09%, the highest since 2011, while the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%-0.8%. Yet better economic growth should mean better earnings, so why did stock investors join in the sell-off?Here are 4 reasons why the market reaction raises concern about the outlook for stock investors:First, the obvious: Higher rates are a negative for interest-rate sensitive stocks, notably housing and autos. Big homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) were among the biggest losers on the S&P 500 on Tuesday.Next, the Fed: The rise in 2-year Treasury yields came as markets began to price in more-hawkish Fed policy. Now markets see a roughly 55% chance of a fourth 2018 Fed rate hike coming in December, up from less than 40% odds a month ago. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Tuesday that he sees three or four rate hikes in 2018 as the ""right direction.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Tuesday, 10-year Treasury yields rose even more than 2-year yields, steepening the slope of the yield curve. That's good for bank net interest margins and explains why Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) bucked the stock market downtrend and rose modestly on the stock market today.But, in general, banks have lagged the broader market in recent months as the yield curve has been getting flatter. The flat yield curve seems to reflect concerns that the Fed will overreact to strong growth fueled by a surge in federal tax-cut and spending stimulus this year. The Fed is seen as setting policy too tight once fiscal stimulus starts to wane, setting the economy up for a letdown in the second half of 2019.Third, rising U.S. interest rates have been accompanied by an upsurge in the value of the dollar vs. other major currencies. The U.S. dollar index rose about 0.5% on Tuesday, hitting a new high for 2018. The greenback is up about 5% from February lows. That's a pretty big negative for U.S. multinationals that derive much of their sales overseas, because those foreign sales are now worth less in dollar terms.A strengthening dollar is also a negative for the global economy because emerging-market economies often borrow in dollars. As the dollar rises relative to their home currencies, servicing dollar-denominated debt becomes more difficult. A higher dollar has added to Argentina's mounting problems.Fourth, higher U.S. interest rates are sapping demand for overseas debt at a time when U.S. borrowing needs are surging due to spiraling deficits and the Federal Reserve's unwinding of financial-crisis-era bond purchases. On Tuesday, bond yields rose across the world, not just in the U.S., which also crimps growths.The bottom line: Higher U.S. interest rates are tightening financial conditions around the world, a negative for earnings prospects at home and abroad.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Squeeze: New Risks For Fed Interest Rates, Recession And Yield CurveBond Markets Send These 2 Gloomy Signals On Fed Rate HikesThese 5 Top Stocks Falter After Their Breakouts Lacked ThisTrump Gave Up His Best Leverage In China Trade Talks — For Beans?

72,LEN,"While President Trump's apparent China trade-war detente grabbed all the headlines on Monday, Treasury yields and Fed rate-hike odds quietly continued their recent surge.That may explain why stocks, which rallied early after Trump's Sunday tweet called for a rescue of Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, had trouble staying positive. The S&P 500 briefly turned negative before the blue-chip index clawed out a 0.1% gain. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite also settled with slim advances.The two-year Treasury yield, which hit a new post-financial-crisis high of nearly 2.55% on Monday, has kept marching higher despite some market-friendly economic data. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.0%, a level first breached in late April.Two data points this month had seemed to set Wall Street up for a monthlong reprieve from Fed rate-hike worries. First, average hourly wages grew a disappointing 2.6% vs. a year ago in April. Then core consumer price inflation unexpectedly held steady at 2.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePerhaps even more important, the Federal Reserve began to send a more forceful message that it won't overreact when inflation creeps above its 2% target, as most expect it will.Nevertheless, odds of a fourth rate hike this year climbed to 51%, up from less than 40% a month ago, according to the CME Group FedWatch page.The message from the bond market is that there will be no reprieve about Fed concerns anytime soon. One possible contributor to the steadily rising market rates is spiraling federal borrowing needs, even as the Federal Reserve reverses some of its financial-crisis-era bond purchases in a move dubbed quantitative tightening.The bond market is sending a second message: Even if the Fed doesn't overreact to inflation data, its current rate-hike trajectory may be too aggressive. And some economists think the Fed's current rate-hike intentions already are. The Fed is pulling away monetary stimulus amid a surge in fiscal stimulus this year. But as federal stimulus starts to wane, the economy is due for a letdown in the second half of 2019.The expectation of strong growth now and a soft patch around the corner explains the narrow gap between the 10-year Treasury and two-year Treasury yields of about 45 basis points.The flat yield curve is bad for banks' net interest margins, since banks borrow at long-term rates and lend at short-term rates.  That's why both homebuilders, which thrive on low interest rates, and banks, which can benefit from rising rates, are among the market's biggest laggards.IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has sunk to 182 out of 197 industries based on stock performance. Shares of Lennar (LEN), the largest U.S. homebuilder, have tumbled 25% from their January high.

88,LEN,"In an odd year for the homebuilding trade, most of the big-name builders have reported their quarterly results, and the housing market continues to struggle like a big dog on a leash.While no homebuilding stocks are currently listed on either the IBD 50 or the Sector Leader lists, a total of five homebuilding names have earned a spot on IBD's Your Weekly Review list: KB Home (KBH), NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH), M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) and Toll Brothers (TOL).Your Weekly Review (see it in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com) casts a slightly broader net for leading stocks, in terms of the vetting process, when compared to the other two lists. The process often turns up gems, but these must be researched with a bit more diligence that the more stringently screened Sector Leaders or IBD 50.Homebuilders stocks absolutely fit that profile.The 25 stocks collected in the homebuilding group turned in a collective gain of more than 48%  for the year through Friday. That has earned the stocks a steady top 10 ranking over the past 13 weeks among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.IBD'S TAKE: Track industry group charts and ratings like a pro using IBD's MarketSmith: a pro-grade arsenal of investment research programs and data. Also, see this Investor's Corner column on how to employ MarketSmith to spot early signs of large sector rotation and catch new breakouts among emerging growth companies.But the industry is turning in confusing data.Lennar (LEN) has now posted two quarters of earnings declines (-75% and -4%) despite accelerating revenue growth. Pulte Group (PHM) reported that earnings growth rebounded in its first and second quarters (from 18% to 29% and 27%), while revenue growth slowed (from 21% to 14% and 12%).The industry's largest name, D.R. Horton (DHI), reported that both sales and earnings growth slowed in its fiscal third quarter and its gains in new orders eased to 11.3% in a second-straight quarterly decline.M.D.C. Holdings reports Tuesday morning. LGI reports next Monday, and Toll Brothers has not yet announced a date for its fiscal Q3 report.The National Association of Realtors on Monday released stronger-than-expected numbers for pending home sales — houses under signed contracts, a gauge of upcoming sales activity for existing homes — in June. The more critical numbers to homebuilding stocks are sales of new homes.June new-homes sales inched up 0.8%, but growth was revised lower in March, April and May. Housing starts bounded 8%, building permits jumped 7% — both strong gains, but with the overall numbers remaining far below levels expected from a healthy market.We should be building total housing starts to 1.2 to 1.4 million, and we are only running at about 1.15 to 1.185 million,"" said analyst Jade Rahmani with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ""So there is about a 100,000-to-300,000-unit cushion of potential undersupply.""Why? Competition for limited land and labor is constraining the construction industry's output. At the same time, costs are rising — not just for labor and land, but for materials and services, including Canadian lumber, on which import tariffs of up to 24% were slapped in April, with another round reportedly on the way.The environment favors big homebuilders, Rahmani says.""We think the public homebuilders can take market share from privates, because they have better access to capital, and they can just tack onto their existing communities,"" he said.Rahmani favors Lennar and D.R. Horton over small- to mid-cap builders. These ""have the potential to face margin pressure as a result of increasing land costs and increasing building materials costs and labor inflation,"" Rahmani said.But recent gains in market shares have generally taken place below the level of the top 10 largest national builders, says Robert Dietz, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders.""There has been some growth (in market share) among the top 20 share or the top 100 share,"" he said. ""The top 10 share has been roughly constant at about a quarter of home sales.""Results from small-cap builders M.D.C. and LGI Homes could be telling. Chartwise, M.D.C. remains in play after a brief breakout above a 36.09 buy point in a six-week flat base. Shares pulled back below the buy point, but stopped short of the 7% to 8% level that would trigger the automatic sell rule.The stock did break below its 50-day moving average in above-average volume. That is a sell signal, but not a hard-and-fast sell rule. That means the stock remains in play. A move back above the 36.09 level in heavy trade would mark a buy opportunity.Shares of LGI are extended after a third rebound from 10-week support since a breakout from a cup base in January.The Commerce Department reports July housing starts and building permits data on Aug. 16, and July new home sales numbers on Aug. 23.RELATED:Spotlight Countdown: 4 Buy Points, 3 Earnings Reports On The WayThis Homebuilder Wins By Wooing New Entrants To HomeownershipNo. 2-Ranked Homebuilder Constructs Successful BreakoutThese IBD 50 Leaders Are Basing As Earnings Come Due

Horton (DHI), Pulte Group (PHM), Lennar (LEN) and LGI Homes (LGIH) all kicked off the week with upgrades to their IBD Relative Strength (RS) Rating.X IBD's proprietary RS Rating identifies technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that indicates how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks matched up against all other stocks.LGI Homes, which broke out last week and remains just within buy range, saw its RS Rating rise from 87 to 91, while Lennar jumped from 70 to 75. The Florida-based company re-entered a buy zone Monday.Decades of market research shows that the top-performing stocks tend to have an 80 or higher RS Rating as they launch their largest runs. See if Lennar can continue to rebound and clear that threshold.Pulte and D.R. Horton saw their ratings rise from 79 to 82 and from 68 to 75, respectively.

Horton (DHI) lost 0.6% to 36.96. But D.R. Horton is still extended after a powerful Friday breakout and Monday follow-on move.NVR (NVR) gave up 0.65% to 2,510.40. It is extended from a pullback to the 50-day moving average.MDC Holdings (MDC) sank 0.8% to 35.84. On Monday, MDC rose 1.6% to 36.13, just retaking a 36.09 buy point.LGI Homes (LGIH) retreated 0.5% to 42.18, still firmly in a buy zone. LGI Homes broke out last Friday past a 40.57 entry —  and helped buoy D.R. Horton and other builder stocks —  on blowout June home closing figures.In more positive news for the housing sector, industry watchers say that household formation among younger adults — hard hit after the financial crisis — is slowly gaining momentum. That trend is reflected in surging demand for housing at the lower end of the price spectrum, according to Morningstar.""New housing supply is changing to meet nascent millennial demand, as homebuilders' mix shifts to affordable starter homes,"" Morningstar's David Whiston wrote recently.Year to date, the homebuilder industry group has shown market leadership and currently ranks No. 3 among the 197 groups tracked by IBD.IShares Home Construction (ITB) and SDPR S&P Homebuilders (XHB), exchange traded funds that track the broad homebuilder market, have rallied roughly 26% and 15%, respectively, year to date through Monday.

97,LEN,"XU.S. stock indexes popped higher midday Monday as the Nasdaq woke from a two-week slumber.The tech-leaning Nasdaq advanced 1.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.7% and 0.5% respectively. Volume in the stock market this afternoon was running lower on both major exchanges. Friday was an options and futures expiration day, which boosted volume, making for a tough comparison.The S&P 500 and the Dow scored new highs, but the Nasdaq was still almost 2% off its high. The Nasdaq lost 0.9% last week and 1.6% the week previous.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's leadership came from a variety of groups, some growth oriented and others defensive.  Growth groups up 2% or more included retail internet, lodging, homebuilders, biomedicals and biotechs. Defensive plays up 2% or more included tobacco, water utilities and food grains.In the internet retail space, Latin American online marketplace MercadoLibre (MELI) rose 4%, following up on a recent bounce off its 50-day line, which established a secondary buy zone. China-based JD.com (JD) gapped up 4%, also following up on a recent bounce off the 50-day line.

98,LEN,"Two homebuilding ETFs find themselves at a crucial juncture, as the once-formidable industry starts showing wear.X SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) are testing their 50-day moving averages. It is the first time the ETFs have pulled back to those levels since they broke out to new highs in September.Both funds own housing-related stocks such as Home Depot (HD) and building materials maker Owens Corning (OC). But iShares Home Construction is more builder-heavy, with nearly two-thirds of its holdings in that industry. That helps explain why the ETF's shares have struggled a bit more around the 50-day line than SPDR Homebuilders, which is only 32% invested in builders.If they can bounce from the 50-day averages, the ETFs have a chance to resume their impressive advances. But a drop below the key line could send them further lower. Both ETFs traded tightly in January, but neither was able to move past potential entries. Instead, shares slid.The first signs of trouble appeared Jan. 25, when Lennar (LEN) said the Justice Department had subpoenaed its mortgage unit due to ""quality control processes"" and the underwriting of loans it sold to the Federal Housing Administration.On the same day, December new-home sales came in 9.3% lower at an annual rate of 625,000, below views for 680,000. Also, NVR (NVR) missed sales and profit expectations. Shares plunged below the 50-day moving average, a break of support that had not occurred since the stock's run began in January 2017, a sell signal.Subsequent earnings reports haven't gone so well.On Tuesday, PulteGroup (PHM) narrowly topped fourth-quarter results, but shares continued to stumble. The company fears margins will be squeezed further due to increasing labor and material costs. D.R. Horton beat earnings estimates Wednesday and nudged higher its pretax operating margin forecast. But shares have met resistance at the 50-day line.On Thursday, Meritage Homes (MTH) and MDC Holdings (MDC) were volatile and M/I Homes (MHO) was little changed after those builders reported earnings.IBD's homebuilding industry group nearly doubled in 2017, its best performance in any year, and rose 23.1% in the final quarter of 2017. An improving economy and demand from millennials have nurtured the sector's growth.Housing stocks tumbled in early November after the GOP tax reform plan reduced deductions for mortgages and property taxes. Yet, the sector recovered, which offers some hope that the ETFs can recover again. At least some analysts believe the industry is going through a normal correction.However, the weakness in both ETFs caused them to drop out of this month's ETF Leaders screen.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market. A computer algorithm selects the ETFs based on relative strength and other objective performance ratings, with periodic adjustments for market trends and conditions.

"
99,LEN,"Homebuilder stocks continued to come under pressure Monday ahead of several key earnings reports in the wake of missing fourth-quarter estimates last week.X In 2017, the Building-Residential/Commercial group topped all 197 industries that IBD tracks, nearly doubling in value.  But weak Q4 results from NVR (NVR) last Thursday raised concerns that the group's long run may be ending. Its shares skidded 5.85% to 3,377.35 that day, plunging through its 50-day moving average and 10-week line for the first time in over a year in massive volume, a clear sell signal. NVR shares lost another 3.3% Monday.Several other homebuilder stocks are testing or undercutting key support as well. Five earnings reports this week may tell investors if NVR is an outlier or not.PulteGroup (PHM) fell 3.2% to close at 33.43 on the stock market today, dipping below its 50-day moving average. Analysts expect PulteGroup early Tuesday to report earnings of 84 cents a share, up 25% vs. a year earlier, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue should climb 12% to $2.788 billion.D.R. Horton (DHI), which reports Wednesday, sank 4% to 48.32, losing sight of its 50-day moving average after closing below that level last week. The company sees EPS climbing 15% to 63 cents, with revenue rising 13% to $3.273 billion.Reporting early Thursday is M.D.C. Holdings (MDC), which held up against its 50-day moving average line despite Monday's 1.6% drop. The consensus earnings per share among analysts was $0.66, which would be a drop of 8% on the equivalent quarter of 2016. The estimated sales of $719 million would be a drop of 2% on the previous year.Meritage Homes (MTH), which also reports early Thursday, fell 3% after undercutting its 50-day moving average last week. Its consensus earnings per share among analysts is $1.25, which would be up 2% on the equivalent quarter in 2016. The estimated sales of $931 million would be a year-on-year increase of 6%.M.I. Homes (MHO) fell 2.9%, marking its seventh straight loss and falling further below its 50-day line. When M.I. Homes reports late Thursday analysts expect earnings of $1.04 per share, which would be a 55% jump. Sales are estimated to climb 13% to $592 million.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.In addition to Pulte, D.R. Horton and other builders reporting earnings, luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) fell below its 50-day line intraday Monday, down 3.7% for its fifth straight loss.  KB Home (KBH) and Lennar (LEN) are approaching their 50-day lines.However in a research note JPMorgan analysts were confident NVR's performance would not be mirrored by other companies in the group.""We do not view these results as a read-through for the other builders and remain comfortable with our outlook for upside to orders and gross margins for the rest of the group this earnings season,"" the research note said.December new-home sales, released Thursday by the Commerce Department shortly after NVR's results, tumbled 9.3% in December to an annual rate of 625,000, far below views for 675,000. But sales were still 14% above a year earlier.Demand is strong as millennials start families and look to move to suburban areas. The economy has also been picking up steam, with job and wage growth solid. Mortgage rates are rising with the 10-year Treasury topping 2.7% Monday for the first time in nearly three years. But they are still at relatively low levels historically. The financial benefit of owning rather than renting is also a boon for demand.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED INEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To WatchNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors.

Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus. On Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) reported sales grew 15% to $3.31 billion and topped the consensus. Adjusted earnings grew 4% but were short. Also Thursday, Celgene beat lowered analyst views. AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views. Verizon (VZ) missed on EPS but topped on revenue. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped views, but fell on a patent ruling vs. its blockbuster arthritis fighter Remicade.President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imported large washing machines and parts, and up to 30% on solar panels. The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%. First Solar (FSLR), which initially popped, closed up less than 1%. China-based Daqo New Energy (DQ) lost about 4%.U.S. crude topped $65 a barrel and Brent edged above $71 briefly as oil inventories continued to drop. Oilfield service provider Halliburton (HAL) crushed quarterly forecasts, with international growth outpacing domestic growth. Shares shot up 5%, clearing a buy point.

But shares fell nearly 6% as markets priced in the possibility that GE would fully spin off the business.Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue. Northrop gave strong 2018 guidance and lifted its dividend. Raytheon and GD said orders and backlog were strong. All three defense firms surged to record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion. Negotiations with Indonesia about ownership of its massive Grasberg mine are progressing but haven't erased uncertainty about the company's outlook.Casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) both put up Q4 results that beat on the top and bottom line, helped by the rebound in Macau, the world's largest gaming market. Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson cited an acceleration in the mass gaming market in the Chinese administrative region, the only area of the nation where gambling is legal. But Wynn shares plunged Friday, erasing nearly all its weekly gains, on a report of allegations of serious sexual misconduct by CEO Steve Wynn.Ford Motor (F) saw EPS climb 30% to 39 cents as revenue grew 15% to $41.3 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of 42 cents on sales of $37.5 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Ford is buying mobility startups Autonomic and TransLoc.

Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) delivered strong results and generally affirmed ambitious 2018 financial targets, sending shares to a fresh 52-week high.New Oriental Education (EDU) logged 8% EPS growth, short of views, while a 37% sales gain to $467.2 million narrowly beat fiscal Q2 estimates. Student enrollments grew 43%. The China-based after-school education provider offered guided Q3 sales views higher, but shares tumbled, though they recouped some losses by the end of the week. TAL Education (TAL), meanwhile, surged nearly 18% on Thursday, retaking their 50-day, after Q3 EPS jumped 168% on 66% revenue growth to $433 million. TAL enrollments swelled 85%.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) beat on both their top and bottom lines. Fiscal Q1 earnings per share jumped 95% at TD Ameritrade as revenue expanded 46% to $1.26 billion. It sees full-year earnings of  $2.55-$3.05 excluding items, vs. expectations for $2.69.

Both metrics topped expectations. But the robot-surgery gear maker gave cautious guidance.Homebuilder NVR (NVR) missed Q4 earnings and sales views. Shares tumbled 11%, crashing through its 10-week line for the first time in more than a year in huge volume. Along with DOJ subpoena of the mortgage unit of Lennar (LEN) and a bigger-than-expected new-home sales decline, other homebuilders also suffered notable declines.

Bitcoin tumbled as South Korea mulled a crackdown.X The S&P 500 and Nasdaq did edge lower on Wednesday, their first declines of 2018, amid reports that China might slow or halt Treasury buys. But the major averages rose sharply for the week, hitting record highs. Oil groups led thanks to soaring crude prices. Delta Air Lines fueled a big boost in airlines, while Lennar and KB Home showed that builders remain a leading group. Many big retailers rallied on solid holiday sales. Intel and many chip-equipment stocks struggled.Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google and Amazon.com (AMZN) battled for the spotlight at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Google Assistant will be built into a wide range of consumer devices, including TVs, headphones and third party home speakers. It will also roll out in cars featuring Android Auto software. But Amazon's Echo devices remain the connected-home market leader, with estimated 70% share. Amazon said it has created a new division called Alexa Voice Services. Kohler strutted out a smart mirror that uses Alexa and plays music. Reports resurfaced at CES that Amazon could begin testing ads on Alexa.Autonomous vehicles also were in the CES spotlight. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) announced a pact with ride-hailing service Uber, as well as expanding ties with Volkswagen (VLKAY) and Baidu (BIDU). Nvidia, citing customer feedback, said self-driving cars will begin to be deployed on a wide scale in 2020. Uber rival Lyft also was active, disclosing partnerships. Intel said that two million vehicles from BMW, Nissan (NSANY), and VW will leverage Mobileye technology to build high-definition maps for autonomous vehicles. Intel bought Mobileye last year for about $15 billion.Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich in a CES keynote speech addressed the chip security flaw that rattled investors in early January. Krzanich framed the chip problem as an industrywide issue and said progress has been made in patching the vulnerabilities.  Meanwhile, Microsoft reported a setback in its efforts to fix the security issues. It suspended issuing patches to guard against the threats after users of PCs with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) chips complained that the software updates froze their computers.Banking giants JPMorgan Chase, PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) topped fourth-quarter earnings views, though Wells' revenue was below estimates. JPMorgan reported a big drop in trading revenue, including a huge loss on a single equity trade for a client. Asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) earnings rose 21%, topping views, as assets topped $6 trillion.Target (TGT), Nordstrom (JWN) and Kohl's (KSS) reported strong November-December holiday sales, following Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) in the prior week. Shares of Target, Kohl's and J.C. Penney enjoyed double-digit weekly gains while Macy's leapt nearly 10%. But Five Below (FIVE), American Eagle (AEO), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Express (EXPR) added to a string of generally weak holiday reports from specialty and apparel retailers. Long-ailing Sears Holdings (SHLD) said it'll close more than 100 additional locations as its holiday sales were weak.Wal-Mart (WMT) will raise its base wage to $11 an hour and offer a bonus of up to $1,000 for employees, as more employers hike wages following the Trump tax cuts and labor markets continue to tighten.

Boeing shares shot up to fresh record highs.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index climbed into solidly optimistic territory, hitting a 10-month high of 55.1 in January and close to the decade-high 56.3 in February 2017. Readings over 50 are positive. Among the subindexes, Americans' views of their personal financial outlook hit a 14-year high amid tax cuts and loftier stock prices. Yet views of government policies soured, as disaffection from Democrats and independents swamped Republicans' giddiness.Lennar (LEN) reported a surprise earnings decline, but only due to a shift in the timing of a transaction to take advantage of tax cuts in 2018.

114,LEN,"The Federal Reserve's unexpectedly hawkish policy outlook on Wednesday foiled a few homebuilder stock breakouts, at least temporarily, with D.R. Horton (DRI) and Lennar (LEN) slipping below buy-zone territory.But the recent news out of Washington isn't all bad for homebuilders. On Thursday, Wedbush upgraded Beazer Homes (BZH) to outperform from neutral, with a 15 price target, citing easier mortgage standards at Fannie Mae (FNMA).Analyst Jay McCanless said that Fannie Mae's policy change should be supportive for homebuilders, and especially so for Beazer, whose ""entry-level consumers"" stand to benefit most from lower lending standards.Wedbush also raised its price target for KB Home (KBH) to 24 from 22, with an outperform rating, citing looser credit from Fannie and expectations of a strong quarter when the homebuilder reports earnings in two weeks.Last week, Fannie Mae, which buys conforming mortgages from lenders and turns them into securities that carry an implicit government guarantee, said that it will ease debt-to-income requirements for borrowers starting July 29 to from 45% to 50%. That means total monthly debt payments can add up to half of income for qualified borrowers, though low credit scores can still doom a mortgage application.Beazer Homes rose 4.6% to 12.88 on the stock market today, off intraday highs of 13.27. KB Home dipped 1.3% to 21.68, a day after hitting its best levels since June 2013.Lennar fell 1.6% to 53.09, back below a 53.89 buy point cleared on Wednesday. D.R. Horton slid 1.6% to 33.80. D.R. Horton topped a 34.64 buy point intraday Wednesday, but closed below that level after the Fed announcement. Pulte Group (PHM) dipped 0.8% to 24.08, still above a 23.71 buy point cleared on Tuesday.The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index out Thursday dipped to 67 in June from a downwardly revised 69 in May, but still signaled industry optimism about current and future sales. Readings over 50 are positive. While the gauge of buyer traffic dipped 2 points to 49, the main industry complaint has focused on ""an ongoing shortage of skilled labor and buildable lots that is impeding stronger growth in the single-family sector,"" NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz said.Even as the Fed has hiked rates three times, the Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has climbed to No. 5 from No. 118 six months ago among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. That's because market interest rates came have come down about 50 basis points since December, meaning financial conditions have eased as the Fed has tightened policy. But if the Fed is right about the need to hike rates four more times in the next 18 months, even as it shrinks its balance sheet comprised of $4.5 trillion in mortgage and Treasury holdings, that benign trend for housing will begin to reverse.RELATED:Fed Hikes Rates, But Hawkish Tone Unnerves MarketsHomebuilders Surge; Pulte Still In Buy RangeHomebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market & Real Estate News

117,LEN,"X Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 rose early Tuesday following a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in the U.K. that left 22 people dead and 59 injured. Several key earnings reports Tuesday may move leading sectors Tuesday morning, with Momo (MOMO) and Toll Brothers (TOL) already topping forecasts.Stock futures, which fell slightly overnight, were modestly higher Tuesday morning. Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average were 0.2% above fair value. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed nearly 0.2% higher.In Asia trading Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei slid 0.3%.

The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average both regained their 50-day moving averages, climbing 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.Netflix (NFLX) celebrated its 15th anniversary as a public company on Monday. That followed a 20-year IPO anniversary for Amazon.com (AMZN) and a five-year anniversary for Facebook (FB) earlier this month. (Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) came public in August 2004.)Looking ahead to Tuesday, hot Chinese internet stock Momo, video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and luxury builder Toll Brothers are due to report earnings before the opening bell.Momo advanced 1.4% to 43.42, paring initial gains in early trading after crushing Q1 views. Toll Bros. reported better-than-expected Q2 EPS and sales growth, sending its shares up 2.55% to 39.All three leading stocks are extended from proper buy points, but Momo and Toll results could affect related stocks such as NetEase (NTES) and Lennar (LEN) that are consolidating near buy points.Meanwhile, Take-Two Interactive shares tumbled 8% in early trading after its Rockstar Games label confirmed late Monday that the release of ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" would be delayed from this fall to Spring 2018.Netflix came public on May 22, 2002. The IPO price was 15 (1.07 split adjusted). Since then shares have skyrocketed 14,568%.Much as Facebook had a costly, expensive shift to mobile, Netflix transitioned from its DVD-by-mail origins to streaming, which substantially raised content costs. But booming subscriber growth, including a near-global expansion, and more homegrown content have offset that.Increasingly, Netflix is seen as a ""necessity"" rather than a luxury. Even as Amazon Prime Video and Hulu have become more-viable rivals, many Americans are signing up for multiple streaming services, rather than picking just one.Netflix has made a big bet on exclusive comedy specials in 2017. Some analysts have speculated that Netflix could decide to expand into exclusive sports content. Facebook, Amazon and Twitter (TWTR) have ventured more into sports (Facebook has begun live-streaming a Major League Baseball game every Friday, with Amazon recently getting the rights to the NFL's ""Thursday Night Football,"" taking over from Twitter.)Netflix shares rose 0.1% to 157.16 in Monday stock market trading, up 27% so far in 2017.

Results were mixed as revenue growth of 3% to $13.34 billion missed estimates and profit gains of 10% to $1.50 a share topped. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) turned in mixed results, topping on profit views, but cable ad revenue was weak.

125,LEN,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years.Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth.Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks.The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern.

Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results.Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees ""significant demand signals"" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose.Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range.Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings.

Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

126,LEN,"Homebuilder stocks sold off Tuesday after the Trump administration imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood lumber imports, a move that could raise housing prices signficantly. Meanwhile, Pulte Group (PHM) reported first-quarter revenue that fell short of analyst estimates, the second builder to deliver disappointing results in less than a week.The U.S. government slapped a retroactive penalty on Canadian softwood late Monday. The tariff could raise the cost of a home by $1,236, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Just the prospect of a tariff had helped push up lumber prices sharply after the a prior U.S.-Canada deal expired at the end of last year.Before Tuesday's market open, Pulte Group earned 31 cents a share excluding various items, up 29% vs. a year earlier. Analysts had expected EPS of 29 cents. Revenue climbed 14% to $1.629 billion, below Wall Street targets of $1.7538 billion.Net orders rose 8% by units and 16% by dollar value.Pulte shares slid 3.8% to 22.20 in the stock market today, falling below its 50-day moving average. The stock is technically above a 22.08 buy point after falling as low as 21.41, but it's the fourth straight loss in above-average volume. Pulte cleared that entry in late February, as builders rallied on tight housing supply and labor markets, with mortgage rates pulling back from postelection peaks.Pulte's recent retreat began when D.R. Horton (DHI) reported quarterly results on April 20. D.R. Horton's earnings were strong, but there were some concerns about guidance and order cancellations. D.R. Horton initially retook a buy point that day but soon reversed lower, dragging down Pulte and other builders. D.R. Horton sank 1.2%, undercutting its 50-day line but closing near session highs.Lennar (LEN) tumbled 1.7%, testing its 50-day moving average. The stock has been forming a flat base after breaking out in late February from a prior consolidation.Meanwhile, investors got  a pair of relatively upbeat economic reports on housing Tuesday.The S&P/Case-Schiller home price index rose 0.7% in February vs. January, seasonally adjusted, below views for a 0.8% gain. But the 5.9% yearly rise just topped views.New-home sales jumped 5.8% in March to an annual rate of 621,000, the highest since July, the Commerce Department said. That was much better than views for a slight dip to an annualized 584,000.Separately, the Consumer Confidence Index fell to 120.3 in April from a downwardly revised 124.9 in March. Economists had expected 123.1. The consumer gauge remains high, but off postelection peaks.RELATED:D.R. Horton Reverses From Buy Point Despite Strong Earnings, Guidance

127,LEN,"U.S. stock indexes were mixed in early trade Tuesday, as hopes for a fourth consecutive up day looked uncertain.The Nasdaq slipped 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and blue chip Dow Jones industrial average each added 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq.Blue chips were up with only a few exceptions in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average. Big gainers included Nike (NKE), up 2%; and Coca-Cola (KO), up 0.7%.High-end homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) topped earnings and sales in fiscal Q2 ended in April. After-tax margin was 9.1% vs. 8% in the year-ago quarter. The stock gapped up 2% but then reversed to about break-even.On Monday, Toll popped 0.5% in volume 214% above average. The stock is extended, but recently cleared a shallow and choppy consolidation. The buy point could be seen as 37.37 with a 5% buy zone up to 39.24.The whole homebuilder group was having trouble getting traction despite Toll's beat on the top and bottom lines. Lennar (LEN) advanced past an early entry at 53.10 in early trade but then reversed back under the buy point. Such action was typical of stocks in the homebuilder industry group.The trouble appeared to be new-home sales data for April, reported this morning by the National Association of Realtors.

131,LEN,"The Pending Home Sales Index jumped 5.5% in February, its best reading since last April and the second-best reading since May 2006, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.Pending home sales reflect contract signings and are a forward-looking gauge to what actual existing-home sales will be in the next month or two.""The stock market's continued rise and steady hiring in most markets is spurring significant interest in buying, as well as the expectation from some households that delaying their home search may mean paying higher interest rates later this year,"" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun in a statement. ""Last month being the warmest February in decades also played a role in kick-starting prospective buyers' house hunt.""The Federal Reserve on March 15 raised interest rates as expected, but chose not to signal faster rate hikes going forward. Treasury yields have fallen sharply on that news, pushing mortgage rates lower as well.Pending home sales shot up 11.4% in the Midwest, while climbing 4.3% in the South, 3.4% in the Northeast and 3.1% in the West.Shares of homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar, KB Home (KBH), Toll Bros. (TOL) and Pulte Group (PHM) were mostly lower just after the 10 a.m. ET pending home sales release.D.R.

The S&P 500 also fell 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average was nearly flat.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 showed some support at the 50-day moving average, a hopeful sign. The S&P 500 slipped below its 50-day line but pared losses and was trading right at the line. The Nasdaq, which had been down 1%, started bouncing as it touched its 50-day line.Volume was tracking higher across the board. Despite the index declines, advancing stocks led decliners by 9-to-7 on the NYSE and Nasdaq. Indeed, the selling was concentrated in chip stocks, while other technology industry groups were basically flat or even higher.The chip sector was rattled after a report said Apple is dropping Dialog Semiconductor power-management chips and will start using in-house technology. The news shook the stocks of other iPhone suppliers. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) fell 1.6% in double its usual volume; Analog Devices (ADI) slipped 1.8% also in heavy trading.Chip ETFs felt the pain also. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Seminconductor (SOXX) fell below the 50-day moving average for the first time in more than four months.Gold stocks led as geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea sparked safe-haven buying. IBD's gold and silver mining industry group was the day's best performer, up 2.4%.Homebuilders also led, after two small-cap companies in the industry agreed to merge. Colorado-based Century Communities (CCS) and San Jose, Calif.-based  UCP Inc. (UCP) will combine in a deal valued at $336  million, including debt. The combined company will have a backlog of more than $450 million and essentially no overlap in territory. Their land is in California, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington.Century shares jumped 2.5% in volatile trading that took the stock to a record high. UCP gapped up 22% and climbed back above the 50-day moving average as it forms a new base.The deal gave the up-trending homebuilding industry a boost just as many of its leaders were starting to sag. Toll Bros. (TOL) jumped 3% and Lennar (LEN) 0.3% as both are rising above short-term trend lines. D.R. Horton (DHI) was little changed but continues to shape a cup-with-handle ahead of next week's earnings report.Mortgage companies, a related industry, rose nearly as much as homebuilders, up 1.3%.HealthSouth (HLS) broke out of a long saucer base, crossing above a 43.48 buy point.

Miller said. ""Since November we have seen a combination of renewed optimism, wage and job growth, and consumer confidence. As a result, our homebuilding operations have gone from slow and steady to a faster than expected sales pace throughout our first quarter.

150,LEN,"The Federal Reserve has been full of surprises lately, and there's good reason to expect another on Wednesday.Back in December, 11 of 17 members of the Fed's policy committee were expecting at least three rate hikes in 2017, and 5 members were expecting at least four hikes.Earlier this month, Fed Chair Janet Yellen, undoubtedly among those December doves penciling in two rate hikes, made clear that she now sees three hikes as appropriate. As Yellen moved to the center, the big question is whether the center itself moved. It wouldn't take much — perhaps only half of the six members who expected exactly three hikes in December to up their expectation by one notch.With the 10-year Treasury yield just below its highest levels since the spring of 2014, a shift in Fed expectations to four rate hikes this year might be the catalyst for a breakout to the upside. That might be good news for financials like Bank of America (BAC) and Dow Jones industrial average components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which can reap higher net interest margins from rising interest rates and a steeper yield curve. But it might be a negative for shares of homebuilders like Toll Brothers (TOL), Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI).In the past few weeks, BofA, JPMorgan and Goldman have consolidated as Treasury yields have soared. Meanwhile, the homebuilder group has been on fire, with Toll and Lennar among a raft of stocks breaking out of bases amid strong earnings and expectations for what is expected to be a strong spring selling season. But a further jump in market rates may begin to dampen the outlook.A more proactive Fed also could continue to drag down gold miners like Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX). The price of gold has slumped close to 5% over the past two weeks as the market has priced in a faster pace of rate hikes and the dollar has strengthened.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve is getting impatient to raise interest rates even though prospects for a near-term economic stimulus from President Trump are diminishing.Already, the Fed's hawkish turn has been both sudden and pretty dramatic. After Yellen spent most of 2016 worrying aloud that the Fed was low on ammunition to combat a downturn, the first surprise came in December. While hiking rates a quarter-point as expected, Fed members' own projections indicated a likelihood of three rate hikes in 2017 — one more than projected in September.Yet markets didn't begin buying into the three rate-hike outlook until a series of hawkish Fed policymaker comments two weeks ago turned expectations for the March meeting upside down. Yellen sealed the rate hike with her March 3 speech saying a rate hike this month would likely be appropriate. She also endorsed the December projection of three rate hikes in 2017 as likely to be appropriate, assuming that the economy doesn't flash unexpected weakness.While Fed members' individual projections are anonymous, Fed watchers assumed in December that Yellen was among the doves. One fewer Fed member will make projections this month, with the retirement of Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart. He was probably among the doves, though that's not quite as clear.President Trump still has three Fed governor openings to fill, so it's very possible that the makeup of the committee will get more hawkish as the year progresses. Still, economic data will be the biggest factor. If the outlook doesn't shift to four 2017 rate hikes this month, more employment reports with 200,000-plus jobs added would certainly move the Fed in that direction by June.Currently, markets see a 56% chance of a second rate hike by the June meeting, with a third move likely but by no means assured as of December.RELATED:Yellen: March Rate Hike 'Appropriate,' Sees Three Hikes In 2017Fed March Rate Hike Odds Double As Dudley Says Move 'Compelling' ISM Manufacturing Index Surges To 30-Month High, Fueling Fed Hawks

165,LEN,"The Federal Reserve hiked its key interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday, signaling that two more rate hikes are likely this year, just as financial markets were expecting.After a hawkish shift that had taken markets by surprise a few weeks back, it seems that the Fed and investors are on the same page, at least for now.With the Fed still projecting three rate hikes in 2018, Fed chief Janet Yellen said in her post-meeting press conference that policymakers' projections of future interest-rate policy were ""essentially unchanged"" since December.That signals the Fed isn't worried about being behind the curve, even as Yellen expressed her ""confidence in the path the economy's on,"" noting a somewhat firmer pace of business investment and acceleration in jobs gains to an average of about 200,000 per month added over the past three months.After the Fed's announcement, broad market indexes added to gains on the stock market today, and kept rising following Yellen's comments. The Dow industrials rose 0.5%, the S&P 500 index 0.8% and the Nasdaq composite 0.7%. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 hit an all-time high, with Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) all reaching record levels intraday.The 10-year Treasury yield fell nine basis points to 2.50%, after running up to its best levels in more than two years as markets priced in a March rate hike.Higher rates are generally a positive for financials like Bank of America (BAC) and Dow Jones industrial average components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which can reap higher net interest margins from a steeper yield curve. But with the Fed sticking to its rate hike schedule, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs turned slightly negative while JPMorgan Chase clung to a 0.2% gain.Faster monetary policy tightening could put further upward pressure on mortgage rates and might be a negative for shares of homebuilders like Toll Brothers (TOL), Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI). Still, even amid rising rates in recent weeks, the homebuilder group has been on fire, with Toll and Lennar among a raft of stocks breaking out of bases amid strong earnings and expectations for what is expected to be a strong spring selling season.The National Association of Home Builders said Wednesday that its Housing Market Index for March jumped to its best level in nearly 12 years.Toll, Lennar and D.R. Horton rallied about 1% after the Fed signaled just two more hikes in 2017.A proactive Fed also could continue to drag down gold miners like Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX). The price of gold has slumped close to 5% since late February as the market priced in a faster pace of rate hikes and the dollar has strengthened. But gold prices firmed after the Fed release while the dollar retreated.IBD'S TAKE: Just three weeks ago, odds of a rate hike at the March meeting looked slim. Yet Fed policymakers have recently signaled impatience to keep raising interest rates, even as the prospects for a near-term economic stimulus from President Trump are diminishing.Markets had been anticipating a rate hike since a series of hawkish Fed policymaker comments on Feb. 28 turned expectations for the March meeting upside down. Fed Chair Janet Yellen, widely seen as among the more dovish members of the rate-setting committee, sealed expectations with her March 3 speech saying a rate hike this month would likely be appropriate. She also endorsed Fed members' December projection of three rate hikes in 2017 as likely to be appropriate.President Trump still has three Fed governor openings to fill, so it's very possible that the makeup of the committee will get more hawkish as the year progresses. Still, economic data will be the biggest factor. Yellen noted in her recent speech, which came before March's 235,000 job gain, that recent job growth of around 180,000 per month is ""notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth — between 75,000 and 125,000 per month.""In December, Yellen was widely believed to be among the doves projecting just two rates hikes in 2017. With Yellen having moved to the center, the big question going into the meeting was whether the center itself would move in a more hawkish direction. That could happen if the job market stays as hot as it has been the past couple of months, but the new Fed projections should give markets some comfort. Here's why: Back in December, there were 5 Fed committee members expecting four or more rate hikes in 2017. The new statement shows that there are still only five hawks, while nine members projected a total of three hikes in 2017 and three members saw even slower tightening.Yellen noted that expectations for future rate hikes were based on incoming economic information, rather than seen as a preemptive way to combat inflation that might percolate if Trump and Congress pass an economic stimulus program. She added that the rate-setting committee will have plenty of time to respond once the fiscal policy outlook becomes clear.RELATED:Oil Up, Metals Stocks Jump; These 5 Sectors Are Rising After Fed Rate HikeJPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Pare Gains After Fed Rate HikeFebruary Jobs Growth Strong, But Not Too Strong To Unnerve Investors, FedYellen: March Rate Hike 'Appropriate,' Sees Three Hikes In 2017Fed March Rate Hike Odds Double As Dudley Says Move 'CompellingS'

166,LEN,"Retail sales rose 0.1% in February, the Commerce Department said Wednesday morning, as expected. Consumer prices also climbed 0.1%, the Labor Department said, meeting forecasts. Cheaper gasoline reined in growth for both sales and prices.A Federal Reserve interest rate hike appears baked in the cake, but today's slew of notable economic reports could help policymakers decide whether to signal a faster tightening path or a continuation of a relatively modest pace.In addition to February retail sales and consumer prices, investors also got upbeat data on March homebuilder sentiment and New York-area manufacturing.8:30 a.m. ETEstimates: Sales up 0.1% from the prior month, up 0.2% excluding autos.Results: Sales climbed 0.1% vs. January, or 0.2% excluding autos. Total sales climbed 5.9% vs. a year earlier. Furniture store sales rose, but department stores, apparel chains and electronics and appliance retailers as well as restaurants all reported lower demand. Grocery stores had flat sales.Nonstore sales, including e-commerce, popped 1.2%. Sales surged 13% vs. February 2016, vs. a 5.6% tumble for department stores.February is not a big month for retail sales, but the latest data don't offer many positives for Macy's (M) and other brick-and-mortar stores as Americans flock to Amazon (AMZN) and other online sites.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's premium chart service Leaderboard typically focuses on growth stocks at or near buy points. But Macy's recently joined Leaderboard, as a short-sale target.IBD's Retail-Department Stores group, rated dead last out of 197 industries that IBD tracks, was the worst performer Wednesday intraday.  Macy's fell 2.9% to 30.04 in early trading in the stock market today. Amazon dipped 0.4%, but is near record highs.While retailers report decent to strong sales growth in their online operations, that isn't moving the needle on their total receipts as sales at physical stores tumble, with the possible exception of discount giant Wal-Mart (WMT), a member of the Dow Jones industrial average.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department's report showed auto sales, in revenue, fell 0.2% vs. January. General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and other big automakers already released U.S. vehicle unit sales.8:30 a.m. ETEstimates: CPI up 0.1% vs. January, 2.7% vs. a year earlier. Core CPI up 0.2% vs. January, 2.2% vs. a year earlier.Results: Consumer prices rose 0.1% vs. January, the smallest increase since last July. Core prices, which exclude food and energy, climbed 0.2%. Consumer inflation was 2.7%, up from 2.5% in January and the highest in nearly five years. But that's in part due to easy comparisons vs. a year earlier when oil prices were near longtime lows. Core inflation was 2.2%, edging down from 2.3% in January.This isn't the Fed's favorite price gauge (the PCE deflator edged up to a 1.9% yearly gain in January), but it's the first big consumer inflation reading for last month. Strong price pressures would give the Fed incentive to accelerate rate hikes.8:30 a.m. ETEstimates: Down 3.3 points in March to 15.4, signaling slightly slower factory growth in the New York area. Positive readings indicate expansion.Results: A headline reading of 16.4, a slim dip from February's two-year high. but better than expected. Gauges for new orders and unfilled orders both hit their highest levels in years.The Empire index is the first regional manufacturing report for the month, with ISM's nationwide March reading not due until the start of April.10 a.m. ETEstimates: Up 1 point to 66. Readings over 50 signal optimism.Results: The March homebuilder sentiment index surged 6 points to 71, the highest since June 2005.Homebuilders are upbeat about President Trump easing environmental rules.Even with mortgage rates jumping in recent months as the 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest levels since late 2014, homebuilders have been among the hottest groups, with Toll Bros.

(TOL) reported an unexpected earnings gain for its fiscal first quarter early Wednesday, breaking out past a buy point, but not giving much help to several other homebuilders near proper entry areas. Meanwhile, January existing-home sales soared to a 10-year high in January despite tight supply and higher interest rates.The builder of homes worth up to $2 million earned 42 cents a share, up 5% vs. a year earlier.

The stock rose 1.6% to 31.99 on Tuesday, rising above its 50-day moving average.Pulte Group (PHM), KB Home (KBH) and Lennar (LEN) also are consolidating close to buy points. Pulte rose 0.5% and Lennar 0.6%, but KB Home reversed to close down about 1%.A tight supply of existing homes is helping to support demand and prices for new homes.Existing-home sales rose 3.3% to annual rate of 5.69 million last month, the Commerce Department said, above views for 5.58 million. The median existing-home price rose 7.1% vs. a year earlier to $228,900. The supply of existing homes for sale retreated 7.1%.Solid job growth is boosting demand even as interest rates have risen somewhat from record lows in anticipation that President Trump's policies will boost economic growth and inflation, also spurring Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.Toll delivered 1,190 homes in its Q1, up 12% vs. a year earlier. But overall revenue fell because the average price sank 11.5% to $773,500.Orders rose 22% to 1,522 homes. Toll expects to sell 6,700-7,500 homes in the current fiscal year, vs. the old target of 6,500-7,500.At 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Reserve will release minutes from its Jan. 31-Feb. 1 policy meeting.

BP (BP) CEO Bob Dudley said Russia is ""very misunderstood"" and is a good business investment.

BP and Russia also announced natural gas expansion hopes during the conference.RELATED:The U.S. economy added 235,000 jobs in President Trump's first full month in office, while the unemployment rate dipped to 4.7%. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings rose 2.8% from a year ago, just a tad behind the fastest growth of the recovery. The Federal Reserve had already telegraphed a near-certain rate hike on March 15 before Friday's report confirmed the second straight month of stellar job gains. Job gains were lifted by warm weather, which fueled a 58,000 rise in construction employment. Yet enthusiasm about the Trump agenda of deregulation, tax cuts and infrastructure spending has clearly been a factor behind the spurt in job growth and economic confidence. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, though dipping slightly to 55.3 in March, remained close to February's 12-year high.The key question is whether the optimism — and strong job growth — is sustained throughout the spring, in which case the Fed's rate-hiking timetable will accelerate.RELATED:House Republicans rolled out legislation to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare, with the legislation clearing some hurdles despite opposition from various liberals, conservatives and moderates.

174,LEN,"Your personal finance plan in 2017 will be like baking a cake. All you'll need is the right recipe. Whether you're investing in stocks, bonds, ETFs or mutual funds in a 401(k) retirement account, now's the time to check to make sure you have the right ingredients at hand.For Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, the recipe involves six ingredients: overweight U.S. stocks in general; underweight 10-year Treasury bonds; and overweight financial services stocks, U.S. small-cap stocks, energy stocks and industrial companies' stocks.Orlando's colleague, Steve Chiavarone, associate manager of $414 million Federated Global Allocation Fund (FSTBX), cites holdings which illustrate that recipe. Among them, Apple (AAPL) could see higher profits if corporate taxes are lowered as President-elect Trump wants. It could also boost stock dividends or buybacks and spend more to develop new products with repatriated cash under Trump's tax proposal. ""Still, Trump has issues with parts of the tech industry, so Apple's may be a more mixed picture,"" Chiavarone said.In addition, a more lenient regulatory environment for banks would convert JPMorgan (JPM) from a something akin to a regulated utility back into a growth stock, Chiavarone says. Oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) should get more mileage out of its run, fueled by rising energy prices, he adds. And construction aggregates producer Martin Marietta (MLM) is poised to benefit from a boom in infrastructure projects.IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta is No. 2 in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete-Aggregates industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 83 IBD Composite Rating and very strong 96 EPS (earnings per share) Rating stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.To Orlando and Chiavarone, the 2017 recipe aims to take advantage of several macroeconomic forces now in play.In financials, $1.2 billion Third Avenue Value (TAVFX) lead manager Chip Rewey says U.S. regional banks are likely to benefit from rate hikes and scaled-back regulation. Their valuations are also relatively low ""since people have shunned them since the financial crisis.""Banks he likes include top holdings Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Comerica (CMA), PNC Financial (PNC) and Keycorp (KEY). All have strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the 80s or 90s.Among other stocks, he said home-builder ""Lennar (LEN) is a new position for Value Fund because housing should do well."" Its balance sheet is improving, it is reducing debt and it is trimming its land bank.He also recently bought shares in Johnson Controls (JCI). Some investors still think of it as a maker of automotive seating, a field it has exited. ""Its hidden gem is its car batteries,"" Rewey said. ""They are a leader in lead acid batteries and in start-stop batteries. And they, not Tesla (TSLA), are the leader in lithium ion car batteries.""In addition, Rewey likes biotech Amgen (AMGN), a relative newcomer to the portfolio, largely ""because the market is ignoring its strong pipeline.""And true to his value orientation, Rewey likes apparel company Ralph Lauren (RL). Earnings per share growth has declined eight straight quarters. The stock's Comp Rating is a dismal 7. ""But Rewey likes CEO Stefan Larsson's turnaround credentials. ""We think it's a great opportunity,"" Rewey said.Lee DeLorenzo, president of United Asset Strategies in Garden City, N.Y., says workers should try to take advantage of the same apparent forces in their 401(k) accounts. At the same time, they should cut their interest-rate risk by shifting 5% to 10% of their weighting in traditional bond funds to stable value funds or flexible, go-anywhere bond funds.She advises increasing exposure to small- and midcap stocks and stock funds. Plan members who can stomach risk, she says, should boost their weightings in financials and energy.Rich Weiss, a senior portfolio manager on a team that oversees 20 American Century target-date, target-risk and asset-allocation funds, says 401(k) plan members should also look at whether the year-end spurt in stock prices threw their target asset allocations out of whack.

Keep the proceeds inside your account to avoid an early withdrawal.Plan members who'd rather not make their own investment decisions should leave the heavy lifting to target-date and target-risk funds within their accounts, he says. If you do want to forge your own investment decisions, you can look for ideas at the asset allocations of target date and target risk portfolios that match your situation. ""But doing that may be more expensive and complex than simply purchasing an appropriate target-date fund,"" Weiss added.If your 401(k) does not offer target-date or target-risk funds? Consider investing that same money instead in such a fund inside an IRA, where your investment choices are almost unlimited.In addition, Weiss says, if your 401(k) offers a Roth option, use it if you are young and if your tax bracket will stay the same or rise after you retire. Meanwhile, contributions are not tax deductible. But earnings grow tax-deferred. And withdrawals normally will be tax-free, unlike withdrawals from a regular 401(k) or IRA.Suppose you share the Orlando-Chiavarone vision of what 2017 is to bring. How do you act on it?One approach would be to boost the assets, sectors and geographies that they expect to thrive by 10% in your portfolio. Trim from assets like long Treasuries and emerging-markets stocks. You can tweak those numbers up or down, depending on factors such as your time horizon, risk tolerance, long-term goals and any near-term need for cash.If you're an aggressive investor in your 30s, for instance, you might want to boost your U.S. small caps by 11% or 12%.In any case, first form your 2017 financial action plan, either with your financial advisor or on your own. Then look for securities that can bring that plan to life. It's not all that hard.

175,LEN,"The Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday, as expected, but policymakers signaled a likelihood of three increases in 2017, up from prior expectations for two moves.In her post-meeting press conference, Chair Janet Yellen called the change in outlook ""a very modest adjustment"" in the path of Fed policy.She noted that some members, but not all, factored in some fiscal stimulus following the election of Donald Trump, into their forecasts, even though his policies are still being crafted. The lower jobless rate, which fell to 4.6% from 4.9% in November, also was behind the more hawkish outlook.The Fed decision comes as economic growth is on the upswing and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index is at a 10-year high. Major stock indexes have surged to record highs amid hopes for President-elect Trump's agenda of tax cuts, an infrastructure-spending binge and regulatory relief.The outlook for better growth, higher rates and a steeper yield curve has propelled shares of big banks, with Goldman Sachs (GS) vaulting to levels unseen since November 2007, before the financial crisis struck. Bank of America (BAC) has set an 8-year best while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has rocketed to an all-time high.However, Yellen said that a ""fiscal boost"" is  ""not obviously needed to get back to full employment,"" in response to a question about whether tax cuts would help the economy and productivity.The major averages initially rose slightly on the stock market today following the Fed's announcement, then turned lower, with the S&P 500 down 0.8%. Goldman, BofA and JPMorgan first extended their gains, then gave up ground with the broader market to turn roughly flat. The 10-year Treasury yield shot up to a 2-year high of 2.57%. The dollar rose against most currencies, hitting a 10-month high against the yen.When Fed policymakers last detailed their economic projections in September, they signaled two more quarter-point rate hikes in the coming year and three additional hikes in 2018. Any indication that the Fed is getting antsy about inflation pressures and ready to rapidly speed up this timetable likely wouldn't go down well with markets. But policymakers were unexpected to take a hawkish turn right on the heels of the election when there's so much uncertainty about the size and thrust of the tax and spending package that President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress will pass.IBD'S TAKE: Optimism is running high over Donald Trump's agenda of lower taxes and more infrastructure spending, yet there are three big factors that could limit what he can accomplish: 1) High deficits and strict budget rules; 2) A tight job market; and 3) A possibility of rising trade tensions that could backfire on U.S. employers.While Yellen said that some members factored a Trump fiscal package into their rate-policy projections, that didn't have much of an effect on members' GDP projections. The median forecast is for 2.1% growth in 2017 and 2.0% in 2018, little changed from the September forecast of 2.0% growth in each year. Yet even Fed policymakers who didn't incorporate Trump tax cuts and infrastructure spending in their outlook probably did factor in the stock-market surge that reflects the Trump agenda.In September, 10 of 15 Fed members projected two (or fewer) rate hikes in 2017. The new projections show 5 of 15 members now see only two rate hikes. Yet Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, says he's ""very confident"" that Yellen and the other most influential policy committee members are among the doves.""Some dots (projections) are simply more important than others,"" Bandholz wrote. ""We thus stick to our forecast of two hikes in 2017.""While Yellen has previously encouraged a more expansionary fiscal policy, she said that now, with the labor market near full employment, the benefit of fiscal stimulus was less obvious. However, she added that lawmakers had to consider a number of factors in setting fiscal policy, including debt levels, and that she was not advising against stimulative policy.Before the announcement, the 10-year Treasury yield had surged nearly 60 basis points to 2.43% since the election, pushing mortgage rates to a two-year high, which is probably a modest negative for homebuilders such as D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN).Shares of D.R. Horton and Lennar extended modest losses after the Fed decision, both closing down nearly 3%.For most sectors, the benefits of better growth are outweighing the drag from higher interest rates, but DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said in an investor webcast on Tuesday that he thinks the positives may begin to fade if rapid rise in Treasury yields continues.""We're getting to the point where further rises in Treasuries, certainly above 3%, would start to have a real impact on market liquidity in corporate bonds and junk bonds (and) bring into question some of the aspects of the stock market and of the housing market in particular.""RELATED:Bank Stocks Mixed Despite Fed's More Aggressive Rate-Hike ViewNovember Retail Sales Rose Just 0.1%: No Trump Holiday Bump?As Trumponomics Cheers Wall Street, Economists FretWhat's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?

177,LEN,"In a darkened master bedroom, David Kaiserman stood in shirtsleeves next to a turned-down king bed. ""Good morning, Siri,"" he said to the iPad in his hand, and the lights went on while the blackout shades retracted.""Your home is ready to rise and shine,"" the virtual assistant replied.Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, Calif., Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar (LEN), was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad.Tap your phone, and AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30,000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple's free HomeKit app.As iPhone sales growth  slows, Apple (AAPL) is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Amazon.com (AMZN).The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of model homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells?Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn't hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem — and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets.""We want to bring home automation to the mainstream,"" said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing. ""The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.""The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn't come cheap. A single motorized, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage ""touch-screen deadbolt,"" which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot (HD) -- and there's always hiding a key under the flower pot.In Fremont, Calif., about 15 minutes from Facebook's (FB) headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home (KBH) is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the color of the light underneath a vanity.With the words ""good night,"" the light turns purple. With a ""good morning,"" it switches to white.KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2,000, ""which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month,"" according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn't include $30,000 worth of gadgets.Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties (BRP) and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale.Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Though that's a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020.For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day.""Give me a break,"" he said. ""That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There's too much crap out there, it's only diluting stuff that's really cool.""Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target (TGT) opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture.In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie — made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant's breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home's lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents.You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail — or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck.""The smart home will get there but it's not there yet,"" Reck said. ""Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.""As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada.When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do.""Certain devices obey, and some do not,"" Giesler said.Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand (IR).Lennar's Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a ""halo effect,"" helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a ""cool"" alternative to an existing one.No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357,000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Fla.With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it's time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog.Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1,000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system.Neighbors ask him for advice on their own smart-home device purchases, and he plans to add motorized blinds.""I'll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds — apparently it's just too much for me at that point,"" Bieber said. ""I'm so used to saying things and they just happen.""Related:No Need To Ask Jeeves When You Can Ask Apple, Amazon, Facebook, GoogleHomebuilder Confidence Cools As Housing Market Takes A BreakApple iPhone 7 Makes Big Q3 Impact In Just 2 Weeks Of Sales

179,LEN,"U.S. stock indexes posted modest gains Monday, but several segments of the market demonstrated strength.The Nasdaq rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both added 0.1%. But the small-cap Russell 2000 popped 0.9%, according to preliminary figures. Volume in the stock market today fell on the NYSE but rose on the Nasdaq, early figures showed.Small caps weren't alone in rising. Building, oil, steel and select retail groups posted muscular gains. President Trump's comments about rebuilding America's infrastructure appeared to be the catalyst.Cement and wallboard provider Eagle Materials (EXP) rose 2.5% in above-average volume. The midcap stock bounced off its 50-day line. A breakout from a flat base Jan. 24 advanced 7% and then rolled over. Eagle Materials never triggered the 8% sell rule, but the down days in heavy volume suggested that at least some funds were lightening positions.Oil equipment maker Dril-Quip (DRQ) shot up 4% in strong volume. Zacks Investment Research upgraded the stock from hold to buy.Specialty alloys manufacturer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) added 2% in soft trade. The stock is trying to halt a four-week losing streak.Home furnishings retailer Restoration Hardware (RH) posted a 4% gain in strong volume. The small-cap stock gapped up 24% Friday, a day after quarterly results were announced. A Guggenheim analyst affirmed its buy rating on Restoration Hardware and a price target of 45. The 45 price target represents a 37% gain from Monday's price.Trump's comments Monday suggested that infrastructure spending and increased military spending were top priorities. Reports of a delay in infrastructure spending appear now to have been wrong. ""We're going to start spending on infrastructure big,"" Trump said Monday. ""Not like we have a choice. It's not like, oh gee, let's hold it off.""As IBD's Big Picture noted late Thursday, the report based on anonymous sources ""could prove to be wrong"" despite the heavy selling on the rumor.Economic news Monday was mixed.Durable goods orders for January rose 1.8%, matching the Street's consensus estimate.Pending home sales in January dropped 2.8% vs. expectations for a 1.1% gain. The drop was blamed on a low supplies. However, the situation — low supply coupled with fairly brisk demand — is driving up prices.The Street apparently took that as a bullish sign for homebuilders. Meritage Homes (MTH) thrust 3%.  KB Homes (KBH) broke out with a 3% pop, but volume was only 13% above average. Lennar (LEN) also broke out in low volume as the stock gained 2%. Toll Brothers (TOL) padded last week's 7% pop with a 2% gain.  Pulte Group (PHM) broke out in average volume as it rose 2%. D.R. Horton (DHI) poked 2% higher in average volume.Coming up Tuesday: The second take on fourth-quarter GDP will be released before the opening bell. The Street expects a revision to 2.1%, vs. the first reading of 1.9%. The range of estimates runs from 2% to 3.1%.Other reports Tuesday will include the Redbook report on same-store sales at department stores, chain stores and discounters; the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index; the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index; The Conference Board's consumer sentiment survey; and the Richmond Federal Reserve's manufacturing gauge.

180,LEN,"As Don Huffines sees it, Donald Trump's election instantly made his Dallas-area pastureland much more valuable. That's because the residential developer expects the president-elect to follow through on a pledge to cut through what he considers environmental red tape.Huffines, a Republican state senator in Texas, blames President Obama's administration for adding to rules protecting wetlands, stream beds, endangered species and clean water. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been blocking a dam to create a lake he envisions as a centerpiece for the 1,000-home subdivision.Trump, the first builder ever to occupy the White House, is stirring hope in the hearts of developers like Huffines that America's lost decade for home construction will end in a flurry of regulatory cuts. And they're brushing off concerns that Trump will worsen the construction labor shortage by deporting millions, or that its inflation-stoking policies will hurt demand by increasing borrowing rates.Builders say regulation is driving up housing costs as homeownership hovers near a 51-year low. Ben Carson, Trump's nominee for housing secretary, on Jan. 12 endorsed this view, saying it is contributing to inequality by locking low-income people out of the market. The industry calculates that a quarter of a home's cost stems from government regulation.""He can rein in these out-of-control federal agencies,"" Huffines said of Trump. ""The biggest risk to the housing market right now is the government.""Some caution to hold off on buying the furniture. Many economists blame tightening mortgage-approval standards after the housing collapse for the anemic growth of single-family construction, still less than half of 2006 levels. Public support for easing environmental laws is also far from assured, and some academics say the industry overstates the costs of federal regulation.Homebuilders have complained about the Endangered Species and Clean Water acts since they were enacted in the 1970s, yet have still prospered since when the economy was strong, according to Joseph Laquatra, professor emeritus of housing and environmental analysis at Cornell University.Laquatra said there's no evidence that federal government rules are making housing unaffordable, or that it's responsible for holding back construction.""Regulations are there so you don't have workers fall off roofs,'' Laquatra said. Without them, ""you'd see species go away and you'd see groundwater contamination because there's construction on wetlands.''Still, confidence among builders surged after the election to an 11-year high in December, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo sentiment index. Investors are optimistic, too. Bloomberg's homebuilder stock index, which includes companies such as Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI), has surged 12% since the election, twice as much as the broader market.""There's a spring in the step of the builders,"" said Carl Harris, a Kansas subcontractor and former government-affairs chair of the industry trade group. ""They feel a lot more confident and they're a lot more willing to go out there and expand.''Harris and his peers remember well Trump's words during the National Association of Home Builders' board of directors meeting in Miami last August.""What's happening with regulations, horrible — 25% (of) the cost of a house"" is due to regulation, Trump said. ""I think we should get that down to about 2%.""The industry may be paying too little attention to another side of Trump's agenda: restricting immigration. Pew Research Center estimates put the proportion of construction jobs now held by undocumented workers at 14%.""The builders also fear that tighter immigration policies would reduce housing demand and exacerbate the current labor shortage,'' said Irvine, Calif.-based homebuilding consultant John Burns.There's also the matter of public support. Almost two-thirds of U.S. adults say stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost, according to a Pew survey last year.The Trump administration said it would nominate Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who is a climate-change skeptic, to head the Environmental Protection Agency, a decision that the National Association of Home Builders said ""will restore common sense to the regulatory process.""Among other targets, the homebuilders group wants the EPA to scale back recent rules that expand the definition of wetlands and thereby increase the need for permits.Nathan Hultman, a University of Maryland professor who worked in the Obama White House on climate and energy policy, said builders may be overestimating Trump's ability to shrink regulations.Changes require public-comment periods, and repeal can take years. Environmental groups will be ready to file lawsuits if the Trump administration stops enforcing existing laws. Many regulations are local, as well.""There's always the possibility they slow-walk and not enforce existing regulation,"" Hultman said. ""But, for the first couple years, it's going to be tough to unroll everything that was done in the last eight.''RELATED:Why Are Developers Still Sinking Billions Into Waterlogged Miami?Homebuilding Lots Now Less Available Than Ever, NAHB SaysArtificial Lakes Floated As A Solution To Real-World Problems

181,LEN,"D.R. Horton (DHI) topped first-quarter estimates Tuesday morning, while the overall supply of housing continues to fall, sending shares of homebuilders higher Tuesday.The homebuilder's earnings jumped 31.2% to 55 cents per share, beating analysts views by 8 cents. Revenue climbed 19.7% to $2.8 billion, above views for $2.71 billion.The number of homes closed in Q1 rose 17% to  9,404 homes. Gross margins narrowed slightly to 19.8% from 19.9% in the year-ago quarter on higher warranty and litigation costs. The company sees average gross margins of 20% for the current housing market.D.R. Horton reaffirmed its full year guidance of revenue of $13.4 billion to $13.8 billion, in line with analyst views for $13.56 billion, with home closings of 43,500 to 45,500.Also out Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors said that existing-home sales fell 2.8% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.49 million, below views for 5.55 million. That was partly due to higher prices. But existing homes for sale tumbled 10.8% to 1.65 million, the lowest since NAR began tracking these data in 1999.Tight existing-home supplies are good news for homebuilders and new-home prices.IBD'S TAKE: Homebuilders KB Home, Pulte Group and others are bullish that President Donald Trump will make the housing market great again. D.R. Horton shares climbed 6.6% to 30.64 on the stock market today, above their 200-day moving average.Top homebuilder stocks, Beazer Homes (BZH) shares vaulted 8.9% to 13.87 and KB Home (KBH) shares were up 2.9% to 16.75. Beazer Homes is back above its 50-day line. KB Home, which has found support at its 50-day line, has a buy point at 17.48.Among other builders, Lennar (LEN) jumped 6% and Pulte Group (PHM) 5.9%, both vaulting above their 200-day lines.

182,LEN,"Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings per share and sales that topped analyst estimates, but many stocks in the sector fell at the open on weaker housing-start data in August.Lennar said that earnings rose 5% to $1.01 a share, topping estimates for 89 cents. Revenue rose 14% to $2.8 billion, above forecasts for $2.68 billion.The Commerce Department on Tuesday said housing starts in August fell from July to an annualized rate of 1.142 million, worse than expected.Lennar's deliveries during the quarter rose 7%, while new orders rose 8%. The company said deliveries increased in all its homebuilding segments except in Houston, which suffered from ""less demand in the higher-priced communities driven by volatility in the energy sector.""Gross margins on home sales were 22.6%, slimmer than the 24.1% a year earlier in part due to steeper land costs. Deliveries and new orders were also weaker than the 12% and 10% gains seen, respectively, in the prior two quarters.At midday, Lennar closed 3.5% lower at 43.50 in the stock market today. KB Home (KBH), which missed third-quarter sales estimates but beat on earnings after the close, ended down 2.4% but rose 5% late. LGI Homes (LGIH)  fell 1.4%, while Pulte Group (PHM) lost 2.9%. Toll Bros. (TOL) slid 1.4%.The slump reverses the gains homebuilder stocks saw on Monday, when the National Association of Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index showed that homebuilder sentiment in September was at an 11-year high.""While the housing market's recovery has continued to progress on a slow, steady and sometimes, choppy path, we have continued to manage our sales and delivery targets in the 7% - 10% range, while focusing on bottom-line profitability and balance sheet strength,"" Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller said in a prepared statement.IBD'S TAKE: As the market digests mixed housing data, see which stocks in the sector could be gearing up for a breakout.KB Home earned 42 cents a share on revenue of $913.3 million. Net orders rose 16%, and deliveries grew 11%. Analysts expected earnings to jump 69% to 39 cents a share with revenue up 12% to $944.56 million.RELATED:  LGI Homes Raises Guidance As Home Prices Climb 6%LGI Homes Breaks Out; Rival Builders Near Buy Points

Likewise, making money in stocks is challenging without a sound selling strategy.Half the battle is buying the right stock at the right time, but it's equally important to know when to sell — on the upside and the downside.Whether the stock didn't pan out the way you hoped or the market falls into a correction, you risk losing far more money if you don't have a set cutoff point at which to get out of a losing position.That's why IBD often stresses the importance of the 7%-to-8% sell rule. If a stock falls 7% or 8% below your buy point — not its peak price — exit the position without asking questions. Don't let a small loss spiral into a bigger one.""The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you're wrong,"" founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""It's also important to keep in mind that there are times when you don't have to wait for a stock to fall 7% to 8% from the entry before cutting it loose. That rule of thumb is the absolute limit. Investors are at greater risk of losses when the market uptrend is under pressure or in correction.So when the market isn't in a confirmed uptrend and a stock you own isn't behaving well, it's perfectly acceptable to get out of a position ahead of a 7% to 8% decline. In this case, cut your losses at 3% to 5% to help preserve your capital. You can then put those funds to work in better-performing stocks or raise cash for the next uptrend.Staying mostly in cash is prudent when the market is in a steep correction or a bear market. When the market is in an uptrend but trading is choppy, aim to sell positions at an even lower threshold, perhaps at 2% or 3% below the buy point.Take Lennar (LEN), for example, back in 2013. The homebuilder emerged from a V-shaped cup base on March 20 in heavy volume. The next session, it pulled back to form another similar cup base. Lennar climbed past a new buy point at 44 on May 14, but closed slightly below it.Lennar attempted to clear the entry, but reversed lower after hitting intraday highs (1). Then the stock fell further in heavier trade. It fell more than 5% intraday from the buy point, before settling for a 3.9% loss from the 44 entry by May 22.The stock staged a 3% upside reversal in fast turnover the next day, though it failed to reclaim its buy point. Lennar again fell as much as 5% during a bearish reversal two sessions later (2).That turned out to be the last-ditch chance to cut losses short. On May 29, the stock sank 4%, slicing its 50-day moving average in heavy volume to fall more than 8% below the buy point (3). From there, it fell as much as 30% from the 44.40 peak to its mid-August low.In addition to a lack of upside volume, Lennar's relative strength line (please go to a Marketsmith chart or IBD chart at Investors.com to see the RS line, painted in blue) lagged as it tried to break out. Distribution days had also been piling up in the market while Lennar was working on both bases. Shortly after the stock's breakdown, the market outlook changed to under pressure, and by mid-June to a correction.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the May 21, 2015, edition of IBD.

188,LEN,"Mortgage applications tumbled 12% in the last two weeks of the year, but demand for buying a home fell much less, holding onto most of its postelection gains despite the recent rise in borrowing costs.Refinancing activity plunged 22%, seasonally adjusted, in the two weeks ended Dec. 30, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday, tumbling more than 50% in just four weeks.Mortgage rates, already climbing ahead of Election Day, soared following the election of Donald Trump. President-elect Trump has pledged tax cuts, regulatory reform and an infrastructure spending blitz that could boost economic growth and inflation, pushing Treasury yields higher.Demand for loans to buy a home dipped 2% over the last two weeks of 2016, and were off 1% vs. a year earlier. But purchase applications are still up nearly 16% since the week ended Nov. 11, which largely included pre-election responses.IBD'S TAKE: A key question for the housing industry in 2017 is how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be. Policymakers have signaled three rate hikes this year, but the Fed may play traffic cop as President Trump hits the gas.The average fixed-rate mortgage fell 6 basis points to 4.39% in the latest week, but is still up from 3.75% in the week ended Nov. 4. The prior week's 4.45% was the highest in two-and-a-half years.Many prospective buyers may be rushing to buy a home while rates are still historically low. But the rush may be fading as higher rates and still-rising home values take their toll on housing affordability, especially millennials.In addition to the recent dip in purchase applications, the Pending Home Sales Index unexpectedly fell to a 10-month low in November, the National Association of Realtors said last week.Other data, including new- and existing-home sales showed increases, with the latter hitting their best levels since before the housing bust. But those reports may not be as timely as the pending sales or the mortgage applications.On the upside for housing demand, job growth continues at a modest pace with indications that wage gains are starting to pick up.Shares of homebuilders, including KB Home (KBH), Toll Bros. (TOL), D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), Pulte Group (PHM) and LGI Homes (LGIH) rallied on the stock market today in afternoon trading.KB Home rose 3.6% and Toll Bros 2%. Both hit recent highs in early December, in part due to Toll's quarterly earnings, and have pulled back modestly since then.D.R.

198,LEN,"Lennar (LEN) on Monday reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat expectations, and the homebuilder said it was well positioned to benefit from economic growth under a Trump presidency despite the prospect of rising interest rates. But shares reversed morning gains after Lennar signaled caution about its gross margins.Earnings per share during the quarter rose 10% to $1.34, topping views for $1.29. Revenue increased 15% to $$3.376 billion, above estimates for $3.304 billion.Deliveries rose 7%, new orders rose 9%, and the company's backlog of homes rose 15%.Lennar said it believes a ""slow and steady recovery"" of the housing market is continuing.""With the anticipation of a new President focusing on accelerating economic growth, we believe that our fortified balance sheet, our diversified business model and our refined product offerings, will continue to hold us in good stead in a high-growth economy, despite the potential of moderately rising interest rates over the next several years,"" CEO Stuart Miller said in a statement.Lennar's optimism jibes with the NAHB Housing Market Index, which showed homebuilder confidence soaring in December to an 11-year high.That comes despite November's 18.7% dive in housing starts after they surged to a nine-year high in October.

201,LEN,"Donald Trump's economic policies, uncertain as they are, have sent the stock market to new highs, but are the days of slow growth really over?While economists are boosting their GDP forecasts for 2017, they are by no means expecting a boom. And some are worried that the gains from tax cuts and more infrastructure spending may be relatively short-lived.Economists are hardly of one mind, and their views should be taken with an even bigger grain of salt than usual given that Trump and Republicans in Congress have yet to show their cards. Still, investors should understand the high degree of difficulty of the maneuver the incoming administration is about to undertake.Consider that the Ronald Reagan boom fueled by tax cuts and defense spending started when interest rates and unemployment had nowhere to go but down, whereas Federal Reserve economists now think the U.S. is close to full employment and the 10-year Treasury yield sank to a historic low of 1.34% in July. In other words, rates have nowhere to go but up and the jobless rate may not be able to fall much without increasing inflation pressure.The spike in interest rates since Trump's election — the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.33% on Monday despite pulling back from last week's 16-month high — will cut total home sales (new and existing) by 5% from October's nine-year high over the next several months, wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.That can't be good news for big homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and Pulte Group (PHM), and the sector has been a laggard during the postelection stock market rally. Still, Shepherdson says, the economic impact of slower housing market activity will be modest for three reasons. The sector makes up a much smaller share of GDP than it did before the mortgage crisis. Further, retailers of building materials and appliances , such as Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD), will only feel the effect of the housing slowdown on a lagged basis, perhaps not until the spring of 2018.But the big reason that the economy won't sweat higher rates next year is the coming fiscal boost courtesy of Trump and the GOP Congress. While Shepherdson thinks tax cuts are more likely to pass than an infrastructure spending package, he notes that the Tax Policy Center's measure of Trump's corporate and individual income-tax cuts comes to $198 billion in fiscal 2017.""Even if half of that money is saved, the boost to GDP growth would be some 0.5 percentage point, more than offsetting the housing hit,"" Shepherdson wrote.Shepherdson said he's upped his GDP growth forecast to 3.25% in 2017. Yet, the election forecast also led to his ""sharply weaker forecast for the second half of 2018,"" because he expects the fiscal boost to lead to higher inflation.IBD'S TAKE: As markets reassess prospects for faster growth, stocks like Freeport-McMoRan, Nucor and Martin Marietta are consolidating postelection gains. Read The Big Picture every day to find out whether the rally has further to run. And check out IBD Leaderboard to look for insight on stock standouts.The big uncertainty is whether the tax cuts encourage a substantial increase in labor-force participation, as Trump's advisors expect. In that case, faster growth won't fuel an overshoot in inflation that leads the Federal Reserve to step up its pace of rate hikes.""We can't know what will happen to the labor market in the face of substantial fiscal stimulus,"" Shepherdson admits, but he's worried that companies will continue to have trouble finding workers who have the skills they need.Another possibility is that the GOP could create more slack in the labor market by changing work-reducing incentives, including the ObamaCare employer mandate to offer coverage to workers clocking 30 hours per week and the Obama administration overtime rule that a federal judge just put on hold.Shepherdson is hardly alone in worrying that a GOP burst of tax-cut and spending fuel is coming at a less-than-ideal time. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in a Nov. 17 appearance before Congress, interpreted the bond-market reaction to Trump's election as factoring in the potential ""inflationary consequences"" from enacting a stimulus when the economy was ""relatively close to maximum employment.""Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, figures that the Trump tax cuts and infrastructure spending worth $650 billion over two years could add up to 0.9 percentage point to annual GDP growth, though the same package could have had twice as much bang for the buck if enacted during a recession.A third big difference between the task facing Trump and the one that faced Reagan is that publicly held federal debt has more than doubled as a share of GDP. That raises the risk that Trump and the GOP Congress will fire their fiscal bullets, leading the economy to overheat, resulting in ""a deeper recession"" because there's less fiscal space to help revive growth several years down the line.It's unclear whether concerns about the budget will limit Trump's coming infrastructure spending package, which has led investors to snap up shares of copper producer Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and steel maker Nucor (NUE).Not everyone is so concerned about the timing of the coming fiscal expansion. In fact, the 35-nation Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday urged policymakers to seize ""a unique window of opportunity to make more active use of fiscal levers to boost growth and reduce inequality without compromising debt levels.""The group sees U.S. growth picking up to 2.3% in 2017 and 3% in 2018.Beyond the issue of timing, economists have big concerns over what steps Trump will take regarding immigration and trade. Moody's Analytics figures that deportations and a less-welcoming environment for unauthorized immigrants under Trump could reduce the labor force by 2.16 million workers. Since GDP growth equals the increase in hours worked plus productivity growth, that would be a negative.Trade is an even bigger wild card. The possibilities range from Trump using his bully pulpit to get Ford (F) and United Technologies (UTX) unit Carrier to keep work in the U.S. to a growth-killing trade war.The forecast from Jefferies & Co. economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons may be about as good as it gets for Republicans trying to protect or expand their majorities in the 2018 elections: GDP growth of around 3% in 2018, with a jobless rate of 4% and the personal consumption expenditures inflation at a manageable 2.5%.""Donald Trump's domestic fiscal policy proposals are pro-growth and will promote a stronger consumer sector (and) improved labor-market conditions for semiskilled and unskilled workers,"" they wrote. ""Reduced regulation will also free resources for more productive uses.""RELATED:What's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?Trump Makes 'Progress' On Indiana Carrier Plant, Using Twitter Bully Pulpit

202,LEN,"Sales of previously owned U.S. homes unexpectedly climbed in October to the highest level since February 2007, a sign of momentum in the housing market a month before a jump in borrowing costs, National Association of Realtors data showed Tuesday.Existing-home sales rose 2% to a 5.60 million annual rate, above views for about 5.44 million. The median sales price rose 6% vs. a year earlier to $232,000.The supply of available homes fell 4.3% vs. October 2015 to 2.02 million, the 17th straight year-over-year decline. At the current pace, it would take 4.3 months to sell the houses on the market, the quickest since January and down from 4.4 months in September. NAR deems six months' supply as normal.Credit steady job growth and accelerating wage gains for fueling demand despite limited inventory that's pushing up prices.But housing demand may falter going forward. October existing-home sales reflect contracts signed a month or two earlier. Since then, mortgage rates have risen sharply, especially since Donald Trump's surprise election win sent Treasury yields soaring. The 30-year mortgage rate has risen to a three-year high.That could curb home buying, especially from millennials and other first-time buyers.The October advance ""may be indicative of pent-up demand that was unrealized in the summer,"" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the Realtors group in Washington, told reporters as the data were released. More recently, ""with the rise in rates, we may begin to see some modest reduction in home sales."" As long as there's job creation, the impact should be ""minimal.""Mortgage applications tumbled last week to their lowest level since January, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.""This is all very encouraging, but it has to be seen in the context of the recent decline in mortgage applications, which if sustained likely will push home sales down sharply in the early part of next year,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd., said in a note. ""We expect further declines in demand as rates climb.Housing-related stocks were mixed. Tuesday afternoon.LGI Homes (LGIH) advanced 2.6% and KB Home (KBH) 0.7%. But D.R.

"
203,LEN,"On Sunday, an ebullient procession of artists, performers, and city residents filled Collins Avenue between Miami Beach's 32nd and 36th streets to inaugurate the Faena Forum, a 43,000-square-foot, $150 million, performing- and visual-arts space that's the cultural centerpiece of the Faena District, a $1 billion development comprising luxury hotels, restaurants and real estate. The complex is the brainchild of Alan Faena, an Argentine fashion designer-cum-developer known for his all-white outfits, and Len Blavatnik, a Ukrainian born, New York-based billionaire whose net worth is estimated by Bloomberg Billionaires to be $18.6 billion.The parade/carnival/performance was titled ""Side by Tide,"" which might be an overly optimistic assessment of Miami Beach's sea level. With ""king tides"" flooding parking garages and a University of Miami study reporting that Miami Beach has seen a 200% increase in flooding in the last decade, the tide isn't on anyone's side. It's already beneath the city, seeping upward, often as not, through the ground's porous limestone and into buildings' backlogged storm drains. Aside from ruining the undercarriages of residents' Porsches, this ground-up flooding has a second, perhaps more deleterious effect on the long-term feasibility of Miami Beach: Normal defenses against a rising ocean — such as sea walls or dikes — are useless.This doesn't surprise Faena, who takes a frank approach to the strip of sand he's just spent half a decade developing. ""The water will start coming up from the floor,"" he said. ""There's not much we can do. That's the reality."" He hastened to add that the city's new hydraulic pumps, installed as a result of initiatives by Miami Beach's mayor Philip Levine, were ""very effective,"" and he advised a wait-and-see approach. ""We have to see how long will last,"" he said. ""And I can tell you that we have a lot of help from the mayor.""It remains to be seen how much the mayor, or anyone, can do. In the meantime, Miami is witnessing an unprecedented flurry of development. One Thousand Museum, a skyscraper designed by the late starchitect Zaha Hadid, has more than 62 stories and sits on the bay front overlooking Miami Beach; farther down the coast, architect Bjarke Ingels' Grove at Grand Bay, a recently completed 98-unit development, overlooks the Dinner Key Channel; SLS Brickell, a 55-story hotel/luxury apartment building, was recently completed and sits two blocks from the water in Downtown Miami; north of Miami Beach in Sunny Isles, the Armani/Casa tower, which is directly on the beach and is estimated to cost $1 billion, has broken ground. The list goes on, with current, future, and hypothetical towers crowding Miami's shoreline.It all raises the question: Are real estate developers cashing in while the land is still dry, planning on getting out before disaster strikes? Or are they, like Faena, merely hoping that something will eventually be done by someone, somehow? Certainly, the brisk (albeit declining) sales in new Miami buildings could be the obvious answer: SLS Brickell is reportedly almost completely sold out. So is the Grove at Grand Bay, where all that remains on the market is a $28 million penthouse. Faena said he sold all his units two years ago; all that's left to sell, he said, are seven penthouse apartments atop his new hotel.David Martin, developer of the Grove at Grand Bay was unavailable for comment, as were Louis Birdman, Kevin Venger, and Gregg Covin, the developers of One Thousand Museum. Carlos Rosso, president of the Related Group's condominium development division, which is involved in the development of the Armani/Casa and SLS Brickell buildings, wrote in an email that ""people will continue to build and develop because Miami attracts people from all over the world, and they want to own a piece of the city."" He is not ignoring the issue of rising tides, he continued. ""Miami is not the only city that has faced an issue like this,"" he said. ""Steps are being taken, buildings are being raised, and Related is committed to South Florida for the long term.""Michael Laas, formerly the director of impact for SH Group, an affiliate of the private investment group Starwood Capital, and currently chief executive officer of the Miami-based environmental consultancy Sustainable Futures Group, said that current Miami development should be viewed as a combination of wishful thinking, clear-eyed realism and pressure for short-term profits. ""Developers want their buildings to be safe, fundable, insurable and financeable,"" he said. ""So what they're doing now is elevating the building at a minimum of 3 feet, and they can do that and it comes at a minimal cost."" (One study predicts that if sea levels rise by just 1 foot, 7-foot storm surges would have the likelihood of occurring once every 21 years.)It's crucial to remember though, Laas said, that sea rise is gradual — current (conservative) estimates predict a 3-foot rise over the next 100 years — ""so a private equity firm buys a property and invests in it,"" he said. ""And their time frame is what, five years? How do you reconcile those two things: It's a 100-year problem and a five-year investment cycle."" The answer is simply that the private equity firm does not account for the long term, but that the city of Miami Beach will have to — soon. The city is already elevating its roads, and the Rockefeller Foundation recently funded Miami's ""resilience officer,"" the first of many in what the foundation expects to be a global array to help organize various cities' responses.But, Laas said, massive infrastructure projects cost money, and that money can be generated only by potentially crippling tax hikes. If rates were raised, things might come to a point where ""developers say to the City of Miami Beach, 'I can't build affordably anymore,' "" Laas said. ""'If you want me to bring in new jobs and new business and new construction, you're going to have to (offer tax breaks), and if not, I can't build here.' "" Laas estimated that steep tax hikes might happen within 10 to 20 years, at which point Miami Beach would become what he called a ""stagnant city.""Faena, for his part, is also looking to the long term, but his own predictions are much rosier. ""I think of the Faena Forum as a legacy to Miami Beach,"" he said. ""This is one building on the beach that will be there forever, and we feel proud to leave this legacy.""MORE ABOUT DEVELOPERS:Artificial Lakes Floated As A Solution To Real-World ProblemsHigh-End Developers Set Their Sights On Bathrooms With A ViewDevelopers Rehab Rust Belt Relics Into Luxury Hotels

But that was all due to volatile multifamily starts. Single-family starts jumped 8.1% in September to the highest since February.Building permits, a gauge of future activity, climbed 6.3% to a 1.225 million pace, the highest since November 2015.On Tuesday, the National Association of Home Builders reported its builder sentiment gauge fell 2 points to 63 in October but was better than expected and near September's recent peak.IBD'S TAKE: Housing stocks have been falling as mortgage rates rise. A key reason is that investors are starting to believe the Fed will raise rates soon.Homebuilder stocks have been under pressure in recent weeks as the rise in bond yields around the world pushes up mortgage rates. They were little changed before the opening bell on the stock market today.LGI Homes (LGIH), which broke below its 50-day moving average earlier this month, edged 0.5% higher on Tuesday amid the NAHB index and a general market rally.KB Home (KBH), which has held up in a flat base consolidation, fell fractionally Tuesday.

That's 0.2% below a year earlier.""An increased number of prospective buyers appear to be either wavering at the steeper home prices pushed up by inventory shortages or disheartened by the competition for the miniscule number of affordable listings,"" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun in a statement.The Pending Home Sales Index tracks contract signings for existing-home sales, foreshadowing actual existing-home closings in following month or two.On Monday, the Commerce Department said new-home sales fell 7.6% to an annual rate of 609,000, but that was much better than expected. Last week, existing-home sales and housing starts came in weaker than expected.IBD'S TAKE: There's an old saying that you should buy the worst house in a nice neighborhood. But that's not how it works with stocks. Look for the very best stocks, hopefully in top-rated groups. LGI Homes is the top rated stocks in IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial group. To see who the other top builders are, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Homebuilders were generally higher in early trade on the stock market today, as Wells Fargo initiated coverage on many builder stocks. But gains largely wilted amid the broader market sell-off.LGI Homes (LGIH) rose 0.4% to 36.88 after hitting 37.79 intraday. LGI Homes has rebounded off its 50-day line after finding support there in recent months.KB Home (KBH) fell 2.2% to 16.09, ending a six-session winning streak.

Sales fell significantly in July to a revised 5.38 million, but from a recovery high.The median home prices rose 5.1% vs. a year earlier to $240,200.Meanwhile, homebuilder Lennar (LEN) said Thursday morning that it will buy smaller rival WCI Communities (WCIC) for $643 million, or $23.50 in cash and stock.WCI Communities shot up 40% to 24.01 on the stock market today.

208,LEN,"Homebuilder stocks LGI Homes (LGIH), KB Home (KBH) and Pulte Group (PHM) surged Monday after a measure of homebuilder sentiment matched its best level since the housing boom.The National Association of Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index surged to 65 in September, according to preliminary data. That was up from a revised August reading of 59. That matched the best level of homebuilder sentiment since October. It hasn't been higher since October 2005.Prior months this year have shown readings in the high 50s to low 60s. Any reading above 50 indicates upbeat sentiment.The results come as the Federal Reserve appears unlikely to decide to raise rates this month, potentially keeping interest rates on loans lower. Homebuilder stocks had tumbled earlier this month, in part on fears of a more hawkish Fed. Fed policymakers meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.The brighter sentiment also comes as the economy continues to add jobs and census data showed that median U.S. household income grew 5.2% last year, even though many parts of the country continue to struggle compared with decades past.KB Home advanced 2.8% to 15.30 in the stock market today, but found resistance at the 50-day line after rising as high as 15.77 in the morning. The stock is making its way through a flat base with a 16.86 buy point. KB reports third-quarter earnings on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: As homebuilder sentiment improves, so do homebuilder stocks.

The stock's premarket move implied an opening just above the base's 81.91 buy point. Premarket moves often do not carry through into regular trade.Luxury home builder WCI Communities (WCIC) erupted in a 38% gain after Lennar (LEN) said it would acquire the company in a cash/stock deal valued at $643 million.

The index's losses narrowed to less than 0.5%.Homebuilder Lennar muscled up more than 2% after its second-quarter earnings, and revenue topped consensus expectations by comfortable margins. Smaller peer KB Home (KBH) is scheduled to report earnings after today's close. Lennar's chart could be read as a long cup base with a 56.14 buy point. But a 32% climb between February and April set the stage for a shorter, shallow base, which offers possible buy points at 48.02 and 49.06.CarMax tumbled 3.5% at the open on a first-quarter report that stopped just shy of consensus projections.United Continental popped 5%.

213,LEN,"Although the future of the U.S. housing market looks a bit shaky after pending home sales dropped in May, just-released figures on the market's overall stability indicate that it's been moving toward increasingly firmer ground.A monthly gauge, called the Multi-Indicator Market Index or MiMi, shows America's housing stability as making a 7.4% gain over last year, to a grade of 84.1. While that's still on the low end of the MiMi's 80-to-120 target range for stable housing activity (with 100 being the benchmark average), it marks a 42% improvement since its all-time low in October 2010. The all-time high on the MiMi, a gauge compiled by mortgage giant Freddie Mac, is 121.7, reached in April 2006. The MiMi measures current conditions against long-term normal activity for purchase applications, mortgages that are not 90-plus days delinquent or in foreclosure, local employment and the ratio of housing payments to income. (See April's scores in the accompanying chart.)
"
214,LEN,"While April marked the 48th consecutive month of year-over-year increases in the national average, there was shakiness in the payment-to-income score, which fell slightly more than 1% from March and nearly 5% from a year earlier. Freddie Mac deputy chief economist Len Kiefer saw the drop as ""reflecting the impact of lower mortgage rates,"" according to a statement accompanying the report's release.Stability of employment also dropped month-to-month, but only by 0.2%. Even so, April's score marked a 5% improvement from the same month in 2015.The most dramatic change among the four key indicators was on the positive side, though. In noting that home purchase applications were up 1.77% from March and 15.27% from a year earlier, Kiefer said ""the strong positive momentum ... is a good sign for a housing market likely to post the best year in home sales since 2006.""Comparing this year's scores for the spring buying season to last year's, 42 of the 50 states and 86 of the top 100 metropolitan areas trended higher in the three-month average; that's down from a year earlier, when 46 states and all of the top-100 metros had improved scores in that time frame.When looked at year over year, however, 49 states and the District of Columbia, were gainers, with score reversals seen only in North Dakota and Wyoming -- states hard-hit by a downturn in fossil fuel's fortunes.The District of Columbia had the highest score. Hawaii was second, Utah was third, and Colorado, Montana and Oregon tied for fourth.Those states with the most-improved year-over-year scores, ranked by percentage of increase, were Florida (15.34%); Colorado (14.73%); Nevada (14.62%); Oregon (14.46%); and New Jersey (13.48%).The metros with the highest scores were Nashville, Tenn., Honolulu, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas. Metro areas with the most-improved year-over-year scores, ranked by percentage of increase, were Orlando, Fla. (20.17%); Tampa, Fla. (17.47%); Denver (17.39); Cape Coral, Fla. (16.69%); and Portland, Ore. (15.99%).As seen in the state results, the energy sector also had an impact among the 100 metros surveyed -- the only one to see a year-over-year decline was the oil town of Tulsa, Okla.Related:Foreclosures Keep Falling In The U.S., Though Not EverywhereAmerica's Hottest Housing Markets Are Mainly Out WestThe Best Homebuying Markets For Millennials.
"
215,LEN,"The U.K.'s surprising and historic decision to leave the European Union overshadowed all other news this week, roiling global markets and raising doubts about the European economy and post-war order.But it was a busy week for business news. In a well-timed release, the Federal Reserve said JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other giant banks passed their ""stress test"" scenarios. Elon Musk's bid to merge Tesla Motors (TSLA) and SolarCity (SCTY) raised doubts, even among long-time devotees. Wal-Mart (WMT) and JD.com (JD) teamed up. Adobe Systems (ADBE), Red Hat (RHT) and FedEx (FDX) gave weak guidance, and the Federal Aviation Administration finalized drone regulations.Gloom overtook world markets after Britons voted to leave the EU amid a wave of nationalist sentiment. The vote will begin a long process of negotiations to determine what parts of the existing business landscape will stay or go for a range of industries that operate in the region. JPMorgan Chase, American Airlines (AAL) and their global peers were hit hard. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said he would step down, while right-wing populists elsewhere on the Continent called for similar referendums in their nations, potentially expanding financial and cultural fissures within the bloc. The Federal Reserve said it is ""prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary,"" but questions remained about how much left was in its arsenal to ward off any coming market turmoil.U.S. stocks had rallied through Thursday, in large part because polls got it wrong and predicted that the U.K. would stay in the EU. Stocks suffered huge losses Friday after the Brexit results pushing the major averages into the red. The Nasdaq lost 1.9% for the week while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials closed off 1.6%. European markets suffered deeper losses. Big losers included carriers such American Air, while Tesla Motors tumbled on its ill-received SolarCity bid. Treasury yields hit four-year lows. The dollar skyrocketed vs. the pound but tumbled vs. the yen.Tesla made a surprise offer to buy solar energy company SolarCity in a stock swap valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is chairman of SolarCity, which is run by Musk's cousins.Analyst reviews of the deal hit a negative tone, calling it a fundamental change to Tesla's business model that could thwart its aggressive efforts to expand production of its all-electric vehicles and add to cash flow and financing concerns. Tesla shares tumbled 10.45% on Wednesday, its worst one-day loss since May 2014. Tesla  fell 10.4% for the week. SolarCity initially spiked on the deal, but closed up just 4.1% as investors doubt a deal will happen. Musk, the top shareholder of both companies, said he won't vote on any merger agreement.The Federal Reserve passed all 33 banks -- including majors JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) -- in the first round of its annual stress tests, as expected. Investors will now focus on the second round of results, set for release Wednesday, that will determine whether banks can carry out their submitted plans to return capital to shareholders. But just because banks can weather a storm doesn't mean it will be fun: Bank stocks were among the biggest losers Friday on the Brexit fallout, erasing gains from earlier in the week.Adobe reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share on in-line sales for its fiscal second quarter ended June 3, but investors focused on its disappointing sales guidance for Q3.The maker of digital media and marketing software earned 71 cents a share excluding items, 3 cents above views, on sales of $1.4 billion. It was Adobe's fourth straight quarter of 20% or greater sales growth and its seventh straight quarter of double-digit gains in adjusted EPS.For the current quarter, Adobe is targeting non-GAAP earnings per share of 72 cents on sales of $1.445 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance. Analysts had been modeling 71 cents, up 31%, on sales of $1.47 billion, up 21%.Adobe shares were down 3.55% for the week, undercutting a buy area.Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) announced a deal to buy an 84% stake in mobile video game company Supercell for $8.6 billion. The transaction values the Finnish game developer at $10.2 billion.Helsinki-based Supercell makes free-to-play mobile games such as ""Clash of Clans"" and ""Clash Royale."" It makes money by selling virtual goods that help players advance in its games. Supercell's games are played by more than 100 million people each day.Tencent is a leader in online games. It owns ""League of Legends"" maker Riot Games and distributes games in China for Activision (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and others.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced an alliance with China's JD.com (JD), with JD taking ownership of Wal-Mart's Yihaodian marketplace, its China e-commerce business, in return for an approximate 5% stake in JD.com in the form of newly issued shares. The move may help both Wal-Mart and JD compete against Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA).JD.com is the second-largest online retailer in China after Alibaba. Wal-Mart has struggled to build its China business.Wal-Mart rose 1.4%, hitting a 10-month high. JD closed up 2.5% for the week.Twitter (TWTR) expanded its push into machine learning with the acquisition of Magic Pony Technology, a London-based startup that specializes in visual processing.Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but the price tag was reported to be $150 million.Magic Pony's technology ranges across computer vision, machine learning, high-performance computing and computational neuroscience.Also, Twitter gave its users more room to unleash their creativity, expanding the length of its video play to 140 seconds from 30, as it battles for viewers with the likes of Facebook (FB) photo and video sharing site Instagram, which has now grown to 500 million subscribers.The Twitter change is designed to help video creators boost their audiences and make money in the process.Existing-home sales rose 1.8% in May to an annual rate of 5.53 million, the highest in nine years, the National Association of Realtors said. But new-home sales fell 6% to 551,000, the Commerce Department said. April new-home sales were revised down sharply to 586,000 from the initial reading of 619,000. Tight supply has limited purchases of new dwellings. But homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Meanwhile, new jobless claims fell 18,000 in the week ended June 18 to 259,000, the Labor Department said. That was a bigger drop than expected, and put the total back near a 43-year low set in March. It's a good sign for the June employment report after May's surprisingly weak payrolls gain.The Transportation Department and FAA finalized regulations for the commercial use of drones, which officials say could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy over the next 10 years. The rules are seen as less restrictive than expected. Under the new regulations, the unmanned aircraft must be kept within the pilot's line of sight and cannot be operated at night, but those restrictions could be lifted under a waiver. Among the publicly traded companies impacted by the new rules are Amazon (AMZN), Wal-Mart, GoPro (GPRO) and AeroVironment (AVAV).Red Hat reported fiscal Q1 revenue and billings slightly above views, as well as in-line earnings. But it forecast full-year profit that was a bit light, citing a new planned acquisition. Some analysts said larger enterprise deals were a bright spot. The open-source Linux software company increased a stock buyback program to $1 billion from its earlier $500 million authorization. Red Hat is expected to update its public cloud strategy at an investor day slated for June 30.Red Hat stock tumbled 4.8% for the week, falling below a recent buy point.FedEx reported strong fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenue growth, both topping analyst estimates. But the company forecast adjusted EPS of $11.75-$12.25 for the current fiscal year. The midpoint of $12 was below consensus of $12.05. FedEx also didn't say how its recently acquired European shipper TNT Express would affect results. Shares fell 4.5% on Wednesday, a day after it issued Q4 results. Shares are off 7.2% this week, undercutting the 200-day line.The No. 2 U.S. package shipper plans to spend about $5.1 billion this year for ongoing expansion of the FedEx Ground network, as well as for planned aircraft purchases to support the FedEx Express fleet modernization program. Rival and No. 1 shipper UPS (UPS) crept out to a 17-month high on Thursday before tumbling Friday to fall less 1% for the week amid the Brexit turmoil on the market.

217,LEN,"A slew of data out Thursday generally signaled that the U.S. economy once again is rebounding in the second quarter after an anemic start to the year. It also bolsters the case for Federal Reserve hawks to raise interest rates in June or July.Durable goods orders spiked 3.4% in April, the Commerce Department said Thursday, much better than forecasts, though business investment fell to a five-year low. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims fell more than expected, the Labor Department said. And pending home sales spiked 5.1% to a 10-year high.Economists had expected durable goods orders would show a rise of 0.3%, while March's gain was revised up 1.1 points to 1.9%. New orders for civilian aircraft from Boeing (BA) and others shot up 64.9%.Orders for big ticket, long-lasting goods excluding transportation rose 0.4%, matching views. But Commerce revised down ex transportation orders going back to 2014.Capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense fell 0.8% in April. The core capital goods orders measure, a proxy for business investment plans, has fallen for the last three months and five of the last six. Along with downward revisions going back to 2014, the core capital goods orders level was the lowest since April 2011.A weaker dollar in April -- somewhat reversed in May amid higher Fed rate hike odds -- makes U.S. exports more competitive. Meanwhile, rising oil prices should stabilize capital spending in the energy sector.Separately, jobless claims fell 10,000 to 268,000 in the week ended May 21. Analysts had expected 275,000. Filings for jobless benefits are near historical lows, but had been creeping higher. The 4-week moving average rose by 2,750 to 278,500.The Pending Home Sales Index shot up 5.1% in April to the highest level since February 2006, the National Association of Realtors said. Economists expected a 0.8% rise in the gauge of existing-home contract signings. The index suggests actual existing-home sales closings should rise in May or June.Homebuilders D.R.

219,LEN,"Scrub the liftoff: The Federal Reserve on Thursday left interest rates near zero, saying 'global economic and financial developments' may curb economic growth and inflation.Fed policymakers stated that ""economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing moderately, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment. On balance, labor market indicators show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.""But inflation has been low, in part due to falling energy prices and non-oil imports. And the Fed highlighted overseas concerns.""Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.""Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker dissented from the decision.Meanwhile, officials also signaled a slower rate hike path going forward, with 13 of 17 saying the Fed will be ready to raise rates by year-end, but that's down from 15 in June. Now three want liftoff next year, while one favors acting in 2017. In June, 15 wanted the Fed to boost rates this year and two favored next year.Fed staff released forecasts trimming growth forecasts, while implying that the central bank sees the natural rate of unemployment at 4.8%-4.9%.Fed Chair Janet Yellen, in a post-announcement press conference, conceded that a case could be made to tighten today. She said that an October rate hike is still on the table, saying if that happens, the central bank will call a press conference. Many analysts had speculated that if the Fed didn't hike in September, it would wait until December, the next scheduled meeting and press conference.Stocks were volatile, rallying to session highs about 45 minutes after the announcement and 15 minutes after Yellen's conference began, but by the close the averages had erased those gains, with the S&P 500 and Dow closing modestly lower. The Nasdaq rose 0.1%.Treasury yields fell sharploy. Stocks and bond yields have been rising in recent days in part on anticipation of a no-hike decision.Earlier, new housing data was relatively strong, while another regional manufacturing report showed factories retreating.Housing starts mixed in AugustStarts ran at a 1.126 mil annual pace in Aug., below forecasts of 1.168 mil and down slightly from a downwardly revised 1.161 mil. Permits were stronger than expected, though, running at a 1.17 mil rate, higher than the 1.13 mil in July. That signals a stronger pace of starts may follow, good news for the housing market and for construction jobs.Homebuilder stocks such as D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) rose 2%-4% Thursday afternoon after the starts data and Fed policy announcement.Jobless claims sink to 2-month lowThere were 264,000 initial jobless claims in the Sept. 12 week, 11,000 below the prior week and forecasts. The 4-week moving average was 272,500, down 3,250. Continuing claims fell 26,000 to 2.237 mil. Claims have trended well below levels normally associated with an economy at full employment.Employment cut 208,000 in benchmark revisionsNonfarm payrolls in March 2015 will be reduced by 208,000 according to preliminary benchmark revisions released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The revisions won't be factored into historical data until they are finalized in early 2016. The report suggests that private payrolls will be cut by 255,000. Professional and business services will be cut by 101,000 jobs while leisure and hospitality will be reduced by 51,000. But construction, transportation/warehouse and government jobs are on track for big upward revisions.Philly Fed index shows manufacturing retreatingThe regional bank's manufacturing survey fell to -6.0 in Sept. from 8.3; economists had expected 6.0. That was the first overall contraction since Feb. '14 and the worst reading since Feb. '13. New orders rose, signaling stronger activity ahead, as did the employment gauge. The future outlook gauge hit its highest point since Jan., at 44. Analysts are watching the manufacturing sector to see if the effect of plunging oil prices on capital spending has diminished. 13.5% of firms expect production to decline by more than 10% in Q3. The New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing index, released earlier this week, held near multi-year lows in September. The current account deficit fell to $109.7 bil in Q2, from $118.3 bil in Q1. Economists had expected a $113.5 bil gap for the broad measure of trade. The lower price of oil weighed on imports while exports were stronger than expected given a strong dollar, a notable concern for both the Fed and multinational corporations. The deficit was equal to 2.5% of GDP in Q2, vs. 2.7% in Q1.U.K. retail sales still strongSales rose 0.2% in Aug., a tick firmer than expected, although the yearly gain of 3.7% was a bit weaker than forecast. Small stores benefitted from a rush to buy school uniforms, and the clothing, textiles and footwear category posted its biggest monthly gain since April. The Bank of England is mulling its first rate hike in 7 years as the economy improves.China wallops Japan's exportsJapanese exports slowed for a second month in Aug., up only 3.1% vs a year ago, vs. forecasts for 4.0%. Exports to China fell 4.6% in Aug. vs. a year ago, the first decline since Feb. The data suggests the Bank of Japan may decide to ease policy further, but also raises broader questions about China's impact on Asia and the entire global economy. Some 41% of U.K. small firms want to leave the European Union, according to a survey from the Federation of Small Businesses. That puts small business at odds with larger corporations, which mostly benefit from stronger ties with Europe. A referendum is expected next year.

Chairman Robert Toll said in a statement.""Interest rates remain low, the job picture continues to improve, home equity values are rising, supply remains constrained and the industry is still not building enough homes to meet the demand that current demographics imply are needed.""Toll Bros. shares closed up 8.7% in the stock market today, gapping above their 50-day average. Among other homebuilders, NVR (NVR) rose 3%. D.R. Horton (DHI) added 4.2%, Lennar (LEN) rose 3.9%, and PulteGroup (PHM) climbed 5.1%.Toll Bros., which sells to more affluent buyers, said adjusted fiscal second-quarter earnings climbed 39% to 51 cents a share, beating analyst estimates by 6 cents. Revenue grew 31% to $1.12 billion, well above analyst views for $1.04 billion.The homebuilder expects full-year revenue of $4.76 billion-$5.36 billion, with the midpoint of the range above views for $5.01 billion. Toll Bros. also expects to deliver 5,800-6,300 new homes for the year, with an average value of $820,000-$850,000.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said the average home price climbed 6% to $379,800.Stifel Chief Economist Lindsey Piegza said the price increase may be too big for some consumers to swallow. ""If the price of new homes continues to go up, it will make it more difficult for the average potential homeowner to buy.""Piegza noted sales are still well below pre-recession highs. In April 2005, there were 1.26 million new homes sold, nearly double the figure this year, according to Commerce figures.Other analysts see strong results ahead.""Today's numbers were eye-popping growth,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. ""There is still plenty of momentum to go forward.""But new questions arose about whether millennials will buy homes at the same rate as earlier generations did. Piegza said they prefer to rent and may stay out of the home-buying market in the near term.And a new Pew Research Center study out Tuesday found that Americans 18 to 34 years old in 2014 were more likely to be live with their parents than in their own household with a spouse or partner. Pew said that is the first time that's happened in the modern era.But Robert Toll remained upbeat about the key demographic group, saying on a conference call that “as millennials mature, studies indicate their appetite for housing is consistent with past generations.”Meanwhile, paint and coatings company Valspar (VAL), which is being bought by Sherwin-Williams (SHW) for $11.3 billion, also said Tuesday that adjusted fiscal Q2 earnings rose 9.9% to $1.22 a share, 4 cents below forecasts.

"
245,LEN,"Recent stock market negativity here and elsewhere will likely have an impact on housing in America, experts say — especially in the pricey end of the sector.Whether that impact is good depends on whether Wall Street's drop leads to a prolonged slump in the stock market or if it produces just a temporary correction.If the latter happens, most real estate investors will likely sit tight and wait for the stock market to rebound, watchers say. This could lead to a slowdown in sales of homes priced $1 million and above.If stock markets in the U.S. and China stay down for an extended period, expect more investors to put their money into comparatively stable real estate investments.Danielle Hale, director of housing statistics at the National Association of Realtors, says a stock market flop ""has two different levels.""Some prospective real estate buyers ""might err on the side of caution,"" she told IBD. ""These buyers tend to leave their current investments alone and avoid any new investments.""Others might look to real estate as ""a more stable asset,"" Hale said. ""They look to real estate as relatively less volatile than stocks, so they might increase their investments in real estate.""FBN Securities analyst Joel Locker offers a similar take.""You can probably list examples of both cases,"" he said. ""If the stock market goes down and investors have less discretionary income, some might stay away from real estate. On the other hand, you hear about people in China going into real estate with the stock market down because real estate is a more stable investment right now.""Officials at the NAR sound upbeat about near-term growth prospects for the high-end housing market.""We had decent buying momentum this summer and we think it will continue, especially as the (U.S.) economy and job markets improve,"" Hale said.An NAR report on existing-home sales shows that sales of homes priced at $1 million or higher rose 17.5% year over year in July, the most recent month that data are available. The biggest gain, at 27.2%, came in the $750,000 to $1 million category.Sales in the $1 million and up category ""have been doing quite well,"" Hale said. ""They're not doing quite as well as in past years as far as the growth rate goes, but they've still grown pretty substantially.""Whether that growth rate can sustain itself in the current environment depends in part on how much money foreign investors are willing to spend.These investors are an important element of the market for homes selling for $1 million and higher.In its annual report on foreign homebuyers, released every June, the NAR noted that an estimated 209,000 U.S. homes were sold to foreign buyers during the 12 months ended in March.That represented about 4% of total existing-home sales.The Overseas LookThe total dollar volume for foreign sales, estimated at $104 billion, represented about 8% of total dollar-volume for sales of existing homes.Also, foreign buyers spend a lot more on average than their American counterparts.Foreign buyers paid on average nearly $500,000 for a house vs. the overall U.S. average house price of $256,000.Buyers from China acquired U.S. properties estimated at $28.6 billion in total value during the 12 months ended in March, up from $22 billion in the 12 months prior.That was more than double the $11.2 billion spent by Canadians, who ranked second.How will China's stock market woes affect Chinese investment in U.S. homes?FBN Securities' Locker says there's a ""correlation"" between global stock markets and investments, and that those investments could slow when stock markets turn sour.""You might go buy a second home in New York or Los Angeles when the stock market is going good because you have more discretionary income to spend,"" Locker said. ""When the market falls, that same amount of discretionary income isn't there anymore.""Falling stock markets aren't the only current headwinds to foreign investment in U.S. real estate.Foreign investors also face negative currency and home-price trends.""For people who are looking at real estate as an income-producing investment, it might not make as much sense now as in past years because of the strong dollar and price appreciation,"" Hale said.The really high-end real estate market — which typically means homes priced $5 million and up in large gateway cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco — already has seen signs of a slowdown, says Locker.Taking A TollLocker's coverage includes Toll Bros. (TOL), which is most closely associated with luxury homes among publicly traded stocks.""Toll has already said the New York luxury market was slowing, and that the higher end of homes $5 million to $7 million and above was soft,"" Locker said. ""If you look at their order numbers, they're not what they used to be.""These trends ""kind of triggered people thinking, 'Could it be the U.S. dollar strength and less foreign buyers?' "" he said.Toll Bros. itself has seen a recent slowdown in business, with two straight quarters of lower year-over-year sales.Last quarter it posted its first earnings decline in two years.Other large U.S. builders that don't focus as much on the high end — including D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and NVR (NVR) — have fared much better lately.Lennar has put together a years-long streak of double-digit sales and earnings growth.NVR has delivered two straight quarters of double-digit gains on the top and bottom lines.D.R. Horton has posted five straight quarters of 28%-or-better sales growth and last quarter logged an 88% gain in EPS.

"
275,LEN,"LGI ended the quarter with roughly 22,200 owned and controlled lots, an inventory it says represents three to five years of supply. In early July it acquired 400 lots in Denver from Jack Fisher Homes.
"
276,LEN,"But since LGI is reliant on low interest rates to keep monthly payments for its target buyers affordable, how would rising interest rates impact its business? Burns says the answer is simple: ""If rates go up, they've said they will build smaller homes.""
"
277,LEN,"Analysts expect LGI's revenue and earnings growth to slow next year but remain in double digits.
"
278,LEN,"In a research note on LGI after its Q2 report, J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Rehaut pointed to the company's ""above average and near industry leading"" growth in closings and orders, and gave the stock an overweight rating.
"
279,LEN,"He noted the company's attractive land position, expansion into new markets, strong gross margins and ""unique marketing and sales approach.""As apartment rents keep rising, LGI Homes (LGIH) derives more marketing power to turn renters into homeowners. With six straight months of 5% or greater annualized rent growth through July, the national apartment market ""could be in its hottest long-term streak since the Great Recession,"" said market researcher Axiometrics.July's annual rent growth rate of 5.2% was the highest in four years, Axiometrics notes.LGI, which is based in the Woodlands, Texas, targets renters for its low-priced, entry-level homes in Texas and seven other states in the Southwest and Southeast.It sends direct mail to renters in apartment complexes near its new-home communities, explaining how they can afford to own an LGI Home for the same amount or less than their monthly rents.Instead of advertising the price of a home, LGI often touts homes' monthly payments of $700 to $1,000 a month.The average price of an LGI home increased 15.8% in the second quarter vs. a year earlier, still a relatively affordable $186,197.""A big part of their strategy is building a very simple home cost effectively so they can charge a low price for it,"" said John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting, a housing-market research firm. ""They have standard floor plans they build over and over.""Qualifying Folks With LessInterested buyers are steered to sales offices in LGI communities, where numbers are crunched to determine if they qualify for a low down payment loan — typically a 3.5% product from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).Or for those who qualify, LGI offers ""no money down"" financing.""If they qualify (for financing), LGI will literally walk them out to a finished home they can purchase,"" said Burns, who compares LGI's marketing strategy to a time-share company's. ""Most of these people don't even think they can become homeowners because they don't have a lot of savings.""LGI may be one of the smallest of the publicly traded homebuilders among giants such as D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) — which also build for entry-level buyers, among others — but it is one of the fastest growing in terms of percentage gains in home closings.In the six months ended June 30, it closed on 1,524 homes, up 32.9% from a year ago. The summer months were even stronger. In July, closings jumped 78.7%. In August they climbed just shy of 75%.The company expects to close 3,000 to 3,300 homes in 2015, up from a previous forecast of 2,800 to 3,200 homes. It closed 2,356 homes in 2014, up 45.7%.LGI set a new quarterly record for home closings in Q2 — up 29% from a year ago to 853 homes. Revenue jumped 49% to $158.8 million. Earnings climbed 53% to 66 cents per share.Moreover, management raised earnings guidance for the full year to $2.15-$2.50 per share from $1.85-$2.25 previously. At the mid-point, it would represent growth of 75% over 2014.""We consistently saw strong and steady traffic, with some of our information centers experiencing standing room only on the weekends,"" CEO Eric Lipar said in the post-Q2 conference call. (Company executives were unavailable to comment for this article.)More than 54,000 potential customers inquired about a home, averaging 100 leads per community per week, he added.Shares Soar Since IPOLGI started building homes in Texas in 2003. Since it went public in November 2013, shares have appreciated about 154%. They soared 23% on Aug. 5, the day LGI reported Q2 results and raised guidance.At quarter's end, LGI boasted 45 active communities in eight states, up from 14 communities a year earlier. Besides Texas, LGI is building in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, Colorado, North Carolina and South Carolina.""They are in areas that are among the fastest-growing economies in the country,"" Burns said.They are also in areas where LGI can build homes relatively cheaply compared to other regions of the country, where land is tighter and more costly. ""You're not going to find them in California or Massachusetts, for example,"" Burns said.LGI says customers continue to flock to its communities in Houston, despite oil-related pressures on the economy there. Four of its top-five selling communities were in Houston. But they are not in the pricey areas, such as the energy corridor on the west side, where many oil executives live, Burns says.LGI projects in Denver and Charlotte, N.C., new in the last year, were two of the firm's top performers outside of Texas.LGI plans to sell homes soon in Seattle, which has seen a surge of young tech workers. ""But it will be in the distant areas of Seattle, not near downtown (where) the land is too expensive,"" Burns said.LGI also plans to expand into Nashville, Jacksonville, Fla.; Raleigh-Durham and Colorado Springs.""The model is very replicable,"" Burns said.Lots Of Lots: 22,200LGI ended the quarter with roughly 22,200 owned and controlled lots, an inventory it says represents three to five years of supply.

The number of homes for sale was the highest since October 2009, while homes underway hit the highest since the end of 2008.That suggests homebuilders are growing a little less cautious about ramping up construction.

293,LEN,"When considering buying a home, it pays to cover all the bases with research. One key consideration for prospective homebuyers and investors should be assessing the risk of natural disaster in the area.""In most cases learning about natural disaster risk will not stop a home sale, but it will help buyers make a better-informed decision about where to buy and also be prepared in terms of appropriate insurance coverage and family contingency plans depending on the type of natural disaster risks most affecting the home they end up purchasing,"" Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac, noted in a report released Thursday on U.S. natural disaster housing risk.The report examined natural disaster risks based on an analysis of housing data and risk for hurricanes, wildfires, floods, tornados and earthquakes.RealtyTrac assigned a natural disaster risk score to 2,318 counties nationwide. Based on its score, each county was assigned to one of five risk categories for overall risk of natural disaster — very high, high, moderate, low and very low.RealtyTrac found that 35.8 million single-family homes and condos with a combined estimated market value of $6.6 trillion are in counties with high or very high natural hazard risk. Those homes represent 43% of the 83.4 million homes and condos in all counties analyzed for the report.States with the most homes in high-risk or very high-risk counties for overall natural disaster risk are California, with 8.4 million; Florida, with 6.7 million; New York with, 2.4 million; New Jersey, with 2.3 million and North Carolina, with 2.3 million.States with the highest percentage of homes in low-risk areas are North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Colorado and Maine, RealtyTrac said.Homes in the very high-risk and high-risk categories had a higher home value than those in low-risk and very low-risk areas, according to the report. Very high-risk counties had an average estimated market value of $170,237, and homes in high-risk counties had an average estimated market value of $191,244, according to the report. The average home value in very low-risk counties was $151,793, and the average home value in low-risk counties was $154,464.Home price appreciation over the past three years has been stronger in higher-risk counties for overall natural disaster, the report found. In counties with a high risk for overall natural disaster, home prices increased 16.6% between 2012 and 2015 on average, while home prices in counties with a very high risk for natural disasters increased 20.4% during the same time period. Home prices in low-risk counties increased an average of 10.1% over the past three years, and home prices in very low-risk counties increased an average of 12.8% during the same time period.But over the past 10 years, lower-priced counties saw stronger home price appreciation than higher-risk counties, the report noted. Among 551 counties, home sales prices in counties with a low risk for natural disasters increased 6.6% on average between 2005 and 2015, and home sales prices in counties with a very low risk for natural disasters rose 9.5% on average during the same time period.Conversely, home sales prices in counties with a high risk for natural disasters decreased 2.5% on average over the past 10 years, while home sales prices in counties with a very high risk for natural disasters decreased 6.4% on average.Homebuilders such as Lennar (LEN), Toll Bros.

306,LEN,"Activist investors Altimeter Capital Management and PAR Capital Management on Tuesday said they would nominate six candidates to United Airlines’ (UAL) board of directors later this year, blasting the airline's directorship appointments a day earlier as a rushed, ""cynical attempt to preserve power by this entrenched board.""The wrangling over United's board is the latest jolt in what has been a bumpy ride at the company's corporate level, and comes amid the company's attempts to better compete with rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL).United called the funds' move a ""hostile action"" that could take focus away from CEO Oscar Munoz's plan to turn the company around as he prepares to return to work full-time on March 14. Munoz suffered a heart attack in October, forcing him to take medical leave.United shares closed down 2.2% in the stock market today. Delta dropped 4.5%, and American slipped 3.2%.The two hedge funds -- longtime United investors that, combined, own around 7.1% of the company's stock -- said in a letter Tuesday that ""meaningful change to United's existing board of directors is urgently required in order to reverse long-standing poor board governance and the resulting many years of substantial and inexcusable company underperformance relative to United's competitors.""They also said that despite weeks of talks over changes to the board, United ""hurriedly added"" three new directors and expanded the board to 15 from 12.United argued that it ""repeatedly"" expressed an openness to changing the company's board, offered to extend its March 12 director nomination deadline, and said the funds ""refused to cooperate in making their nominees available to be interviewed.""The company also defended the three independent directors named yesterday as having ""deep relevant experience"" and backed the airline, citing last year's sky-high profits and improved on-time performance.Altimeter and PAR said they would nominate their candidates at United's annual stockholder meeting this year. They are Gordon Bethune, a former CEO of Continental Airlines and a board member of aerospace tech firm Honeywell (HON); Altimeter founder Brad Gerstner; Tina Sharkey, the CEO of SherpaFoundry; Barney Harford, former CEO of travel site Orbitz; Rodney O'Neal, ex-CEO of Delphi Automotive; and Brenda Yester Baty, the strategic initiatives chief at Lennar (LEN).Even as the fight among the suits escalated, United continued, as other airlines have, to quietly reinvest in making flying more pleasant.The company on Tuesday said it would retire its 747 fleet from scheduled service by the end of 2018. It also ordered 25 Boeing (BA) 737-700 planes, adding to an earlier order of 40 such aircraft. United is set to have the planes delivered at the end of next year.United seeks to shrink its regional fleet of 50-seat aircraft, and the 737s are bigger and more fuel-efficient planes.Those will have bigger overhead bins, along with an interior that ""creates a larger sense of space through sculpted sidewall panels and LED cabin lighting that mimics soft blue skies and sunset colors.""The orders continue a shift among the bigger carriers away from smaller jets. That trend, the Wall Street Journal noted, contributed to regional carrier Republic Airways’ (RJET) filing for bankruptcy protection last month.Image provided by Shutterstock.

308,LEN,"Manufacturing continues to contract, according to the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing Index. Meanwhile, homebuilders are less confident, as housing activity expands but not at a powerful pace.The New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing index improved less than expected from January's worst reading since the Great Recession.Overall business conditions edged up from -19.6 to -16.6 in February, still the second worst since 2009. The six-month outlook also perked up, from 9.51 to 14.48, but January was the worst reading since 2011.New orders and shipments improved, but remained firmly in negative territory, signaling contraction. Employment was barely negative at -0.99, after falling sharply the prior month, but the average workweek continued to get shorter at -5.94.The good news for manufacturers is that the strong dollar has given up ground as markets price out further Federal Reserve rate hikes this year. General Electric (GE) stock rose 1.4% in morning trade on the stock market today, while Caterpillar (CAT) advanced 1.6%.Homebuilders were slightly less upbeat this month, but still feel very positive about the outlook for new home sales.The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo housing market index slipped to 58, down from 61 in January and the lowest since May.Despite lower mortgage rates, the gauge of prospective home buyer traffic fell to a nine-month low of 39.

"
309,LEN,"WeWork, the shared-office company valued at $15 billion, has cultivated a chic vibe to attract the freelancers and startup workers that helped launch the co-working movement. That means hip interior design (some offices have wallpaper created by the Beastie Boys' Mike D) and free micro-roasted coffee and craft beer (the company gave out 90,000 glasses during a single month last year).Now that youthful ambiance is helping attract the olds. General Electric (GE) moved 20 workers from its new energy business, Current, into a WeWork space near Boston's South Station this year as GE readies its new Boston headquarters. Other recent WeWork tenants include business consultancy KPMG, pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK), and British news publication the Guardian -- companies that have been around for an average of 155 years.The moves mean traditional employers can rub shoulders with the young tech set. KPMG rents about 75 desks at a WeWork in Manhattan, which it splits between workers who provide business services to startups, and another team that advises corporate clients on technological innovation. Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), which rents space at 16 co-working offices across the country, including with Galvanize in San Francisco and Centrl Office in Portland, Ore., says the move allows its bankers to work alongside the tech startups it courts as clients. “People literally open the door and say, 'We need to open [a] bank account,'” said Mark Gallagher, who leads the bank’s Boston technology practice.It's also a useful way to manage real estate costs, according to workplace strategy experts. “Anyone doing it now is a pioneer,” said Julie Whelan, head of occupier research for CBRE. “I can’t see that it won’t become a norm, based on how companies have worked to change their footprints in recent years.”It costs the typical U.S. company upward of $12,000 a year for each worker it provides office space, according to CBRE Group (CBG). Co-working spaces can be more expensive than traditional office space on a per-square-foot basis but make it easy for companies to move in and out, letting execs focus more on expanding their businesses than managing their real estate operations. ""If I go and find a space with a five-year lease and build it out, it might take me five years to recoup my expenses,"" said Brent Harrell, president of HeritageBank Mortgage, an Atlanta-based lender who recently moved a team of four mortgage bankers into an Industrious co-working space.Employees tend to like it, too. The homebuilder Lennar (LEN) rents space from Industrious in Chicago and Minneapolis so it can hold meetings near downtown construction projects and because the stylish offices help with recruiting, said Peter Chmielewski, vice president of development for the builder's multifamily arm. In a September report published in the Harvard Business Review, workers in shared offices reported that they were ""thriving"" so much that researchers “had to look at the data again.” The results, the researchers theorize, are largely because the workers tend to have a greater sense of purpose. They’ve opted into a workspace instead of showing up at a site designated by their employer, which tends to produce a community effect that makes them feel empowered.A stylish or flexible workplace doesn't necessarily require a co-working membership. Most employers are more comfortable adopting aspects of co-working than sending employees to shared offices, said Phil Kirschner, senior vice president at JLL (JLL), who consults with employers on workplace strategy. That could mean trading assigned desks for access to a variety of shared spaces. ""(They've) given up a desk and gained a floor,"" Kirschner said.Co-working companies, however, are welcoming the corporate interest. WeWork has raised $1 billion from investors to fuel expansion around the world, and renting space to large companies that need lots of desks is a good way to expand quickly. Thirty percent of WeWork's 45,000 members work for companies that rent more than 10 desks, and large employers make up its fastest-growing market. ""You’re going to see people dip toes in,"" said WeWork Chief Operating Officer Artie Minson. ""People go back to their drab, soulless office and say, I sort of wish I could have stayed there.""Serendipity Labs, which opened its first co-working space in Rye, N.Y., in 2013, says corporate employees make up 45% of members at its two U.S. locations, including workers from PepsiCo (PEP), Microsoft (MSFT), and Heineken International. The company is seeking to open 200 shared offices in the next three years, mostly in suburban locations, to appeal to companies with national footprints, founder John Arenas said. To fuel its rapid growth, Arenas is selling franchises to hotel operators and other hospitality companies. Not every corporate employer wants the kind of hip, downtown spaces associated with co-working, Arenas said.“Instead of having a bro-out Thursday night party, we’re having a Tesla test-driving event,” Arenas said. “We have different members. They can afford a car.”Related:Creative Offices Become The Norm And Get SmarterWhy Rental Rates At Biotech Labs Are SkyrocketingFood Feeds Real Estate Development In Edgy Areas

314,LEN,"Despite what you've heard, Americans don't want politicians who tell it like it is. We want politicians who tell it like it isn't.This election cycle, politicians' promises have gotten bigger, bolder and less tethered to reality than those of previous presidential races. Voters appear to want candidates who will deliver nothing short of their wildest partisan dreams (and delusions), alongside the unconditional silence and submission of their ideological adversaries.If presidential candidates once promised the sun, moon and stars, this time around they're promising multiple galaxies, plus the turtles all the way down.Candidates on both the left and right have pledged complete overhauls on nearly every issue voters care about (and some they don't). That includes health care, reproductive rights, the social safety net, immigration, the Constitution, even basic arithmetic.Donald Trump, whose most attractive quality is supposedly his unfiltered frankness, has built his campaign around the preposterous promise that Mexico will pay for a ""big, beautiful wall"" on the southern U.S. border, despite all evidence to the contrary -- including both common sense and loud, unequivocal refusals from Mexican leaders themselves.He also promises that he can get government to swiftly, cheaply and ""humanely"" round up and deport 11 million people living in the shadows. And his base -- which has, until now, long believed in government incompetence and inefficacy above almost any other political principle -- willingly suspends disbelief.Bernie Sanders likewise promises his base a single-payer ""Medicare for all"" health-care plan, despite the fact that Congress has voted more than 60 times to repeal the (comparatively modest) Affordable Care Act.How would either actually get their ambitious plans through? Why, political revolution and magical underpants gnomes, of course.On some issues, the candidates' plans are quantifiably more grandiose than those of their predecessors. Take for example their tax proposals.Sure, huge tax cuts have been a staple of Republican presidential candidates for at least the past two decades. One (George W. Bush) even enacted those cuts. But the scale of the cuts that Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio propose would be unprecedented, according to calculations from Len Burman, director at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Measured as a share of the economy, the three biggest tax cuts of the past six decades were enacted by Bush, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Of those, the largest was Reagan's suite of tax changes, which cumulatively led to a revenue loss equaling 2.1% of gross domestic product. By contrast, over the next decade, Rubio would cut taxes by an estimated 2.6% of GDP, Cruz by 3.6% and Donald Trump by 4.0%.In other words, candidates are promising to out-Reagan Reagan.Perhaps, you might muse, politicians just propose especially fantastical cuts while they're on the campaign trail. But by my own calculations, today's candidates are promising cuts that are also far larger than what was proposed by Mitt Romney in 2012, John McCain in 2008, Bush in 2000, or Bob Dole in 1996.The story on the left is not so different.Sanders would raise taxes by about 5.9% of GDP, based on revenue estimates from the business-backed Tax Foundation. This, too, is multiples higher than any tax increase enacted in the postwar era.The largest single tax overhaul of all time -- just like the largest deportation of all time, or the largest health-care reform initiative, or the most ambitious constitutional revisions --seems especially improbable over the next four years, regardless of who secures the White House.We are already seeing unprecedented levels of obstructionism, gridlock and allergy to compromise. In 2015, the Senate confirmed the fewest civilian nominations -- including federal judges, ambassadors, regulatory officials and executive branch appointees -- for the first session of a Congress in three decades, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report. The Senate Banking Committee has not voted a single nominee out of its committee this session, the first time that’s happened in at least 50 years.And yet some presidential candidates now promise they’ll be even less cooperative, and concede even less territory to the other side, in the service of delivering the grand delusions they’ve pledged their voters. Quoth Cruz on “Meet the Press”: “This is how we’ve gotten in the mess we’re in now, is Republicans who cut deals with Democrats.”In today’s political climate, pragmatism and cooperation appear toxic; big, beautiful, uncompromising promises score votes.Of course, big, beautiful uncompromising promises are also impossible to keep. So what happens come 2017 when voters get disillusioned by another round of broken vows? What fantasies will an ever-angrier electorate have to be promised then?

315,LEN,"The collapse in crude oil prices has slashed the U.S. oil rig count by 75%, but those expecting Texas to suffer an economic meltdown as it did during the 1980s should think again, economists say.First, the bad news. The Dallas Federal Reserve's region, which is more exposed to energy markets, had another bad month. While its general activity index improved slightly to -31.8 in February from -34.6 in January, it remains deep in contraction and at levels not seen since the recession.The production subindex was also up slightly but still negative, while gauges for new orders and employment were at their lowest since 2009.Layoffs in the energy sector began at the blue-collar level and are working their way up to the white-collar level, according to Patrick Jankowski, senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership.The Texas unemployment rate rose in December to 4.7%, thought it's still below the national average of 4.9%. A 70% plunge in crude oil prices since June 2014 has been a big culprit.Since 2014, Houston-based oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) has cut 22,000 employees worldwide, or 25% of its workforce. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), also based in Houston, has laid off 34,000 globally, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014.Energy's problems are also impacting everything from homebuilders to restaurants. During their most recent quarterly earnings reports, KB Home (KBH), PulteGroup (PHM) and Lennar (LEN) each reported weakness for homes in the Houston market.Meanwhile, Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported seeing some weakness in its Texas chains, and Polaris Industries (PII), a maker of all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles, also found that oil and gas regions hurt Q4 earnings and predicted continued softness this year.So, while things are grim, it's important to keep some perspective. Texas has a population of more than 26 million people, spread out in 254 counties and living in several dozen metropolitan areas and countless rural communities. While Houston has a significant exposure to oil, major cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and El Paso do not.""The economic impact varies across the state,"" said Bud Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University. ""The oil-producing regions of the state have been hit the hardest.""Texas also has a $16 billion rainy day fund, largely derived from the energy sector, which can cover any shortfalls in state tax revenue caused by the oil bust. Texas also relies less on oil and gas taxes than other energy-heavy peers do.The Lone Star State generates about 9% of its revenue from oil and gas taxes vs. more than 40% for states like Alaska and North Dakota.Texas is better suited to withstand sustained low prices than it was during the 1980s, when the bottom fell out of the oil market. With help from the rise of technology, health and other industries, the Texas economy is more diverse.Oil and gas represents about 14% of the state's economy vs. more than 20% in the 1980s, Comptroller Glenn Hegar told lawmakers last month.The Dallas-Fort Worth area, a laggard during the economic recovery after the recession, currently has thriving business services and technology sectors. Its tax incentives, major international airport, and affordable housing costs have attracted companies seeking to relocate their headquarters. For example, Toyota Motor (TMC) is moving its U.S. base to the Dallas suburb of Plano.The petrochemical sector, which often runs counter-cyclical to oil, is performing well, with Dow Chemical (DOW) and Chevron (CVX) building projects in the Houston area.Lastly, limits on interstate banking helped exacerbate the economic crisis in Texas during the 1980s, when collapsing oil prices as well as overbuilding in commercial and residential real estate led to smaller Texas banks failing.Today, big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) have footholds in Texas. Although each lender has boosted its energy loan loss reserves (JPMorgan alone increased its reserve to $1.5 billion for Q1), sustained low oil prices are unlikely to lead to widespread banking failures.Like any industry during a downturn, the Texas oil sector will be forced to become more efficient.""The energy industry will be smaller,"" Jankowski said. ""It will find a way to produce the same amount of oil with fewer people and more technology.""

Horton (DHI) roared back to life Tuesday after it reported better-than-expected sales and earnings for its September-ending fourth quarter as the number of finished homes climbed 23% and new orders rose 19%, led by strong growth in the Southeast.Shares closed up 8.3% in the stock market today. They had dipped more than 2% Monday along with a broad falloff in homebuilder stocks as investors weighed the increased possibility of a Fed rate hike in December. Other homebuilders also sprung back on Tuesday.The Fort Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton earned 64 cents a share in the quarter, two cents above views and up from last year's 45 cents. Homebuilding revenue of $3.05 billion was 28% higher than a year earlier.Smaller homebuilder Beazer Homes (BZH), which also reported results for its September-ending quarter early Tuesday, didn't fare as well early in the trading day after it reported mixed results, including a 12% gain in home closings vs. a year earlier but a slight drop in orders and homebuilding gross margin. But it ended the day up 5.6%.Of Beazer's $354.5 million in net income from continuing operations, nearly $324 million came from a tax benefit. The company said that it expects ""significant"" growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2016 and beyond, however.While D.R. Horton's net sales orders — a future-looking barometer — increased 19% to 8,477 homes, the value of those homes rose 22% to $2.5 billion. The biggest gains were in the Southeast, where the number of communities had grown sharply over the last couple of years.Orders in the Southeast jumped 40% to 2,868 homes. Orders in the South Central region, which includes the firm's home state of Texas, rose nearly 8% to 2,367 homes, but their value increased 19%.Horton's average selling prices in the quarter were up only 3.4% as sales of lower-priced, entry-level Express Homes increased. With an average price of $191,000, they accounted for more than 20% of homes sold and 14% of home-sales revenue, the majority of sales coming from Texas, Florida and the Carolinas, said a company spokeswoman.In a conference call, executives said that they expect Express Homes and the firm's high-end Emerald Homes division to continue expanding, with Express Homes seen rising to around 20% of home-sales revenue by the end of fiscal 2016 and Emerald Homes in the high single digits.At the end of September, Horton had a sales order backlog of 10,662 homes, up 10% in value from a year earlier and a ""well-stocked supply of land and lots,"" Chief Executive David Auld said in a morning conference call. That, he added, gives it a ""strong competitive advantage.""Horton raised its quarterly dividend 28% to 8 cents a share, payable on Dec. 14.Lennar (LEN), the second largest homebuilder, was up 3.35% at the close Tuesday.

"
442,LEN,"A decade later, Rogers died at age 86 and was buried in Apple Valley. Evans followed him in 2001 at 88.Roy Rogers started out as Len Slye. And he was hardly riding high. He sang at Depression-era parties, passing the hat for contributions to buy food for his family. Then, in 1937, he caught a break.He sneaked into a Republic Pictures audition and won a screen test, signing a contract for $75 (worth $1,240 now) a week.After a few small films, he was cast as the lead in 1938's ""Under Western Stars,"" replacing Gene Autry.""Autry was the studio's number one box office draw among the Western stars,"" wrote Howard Kazanjian and Chris Enss in ""The Cowboy and the Senorita: A Biography of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans."" ""When Autry began making demands and seeking to make changes to his contract, (Republic President Herbert Yates) was determined to send the actor a message.""Republic gave Len his new name to remind audiences of popular cowboy comedian Will Rogers. Roy Rogers' first movie, ""Under Western Stars,"" was a home run at the box office.For the next 15 years, Rogers would be on the list of Hollywood's top 10 money earners.High-Riding MarriageHe co-starred with his wife, Dale Evans, in a popular 1950s TV show.He was the King of the Cowboys and she Queen of the West.Rogers (1911-98) was born in Cincinnati, where his family lived in a tenement.Before he was 1, the Slyes built a houseboat from salvage lumber, sailed to nearby Portsmouth, maneuvered the boat onto land and continued living in it.Six years later, they bought a farm and built a home in Duck Run, up the road from Portsmouth. The patriarch supplemented their income by working at a shoe factory. Soon he could afford to buy a horse for his son, who became adept at riding.Lacking a radio, the family made its own fun. They often invited neighbors to their Saturday night square dances, where Len, despite painful shyness, sang and played.In his sophomore year of high school, the family moved back to Cincinnati, where Len joined his father at a shoe factory. After falling asleep repeatedly at night school, he never returned.By the 1930s, the family had moved to California. Dad drove trucks for a firm that went bankrupt. The Slyes went north to pick peaches and lived in a labor camp.Soon young Len was in Los Angeles, playing at parties.He was so entertaining, his sister Mary suggested that he audition for a radio contest. He didn't win, but a few days later the leader of a band, the Rocky Mountaineers, invited him to join.Over the next couple of years, he changed groups until he co-founded Sons of the Pioneers. By 1934, they were a national item via syndicated radio segments.They made their first record that year; one of their first songs was ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds,"" an enduring hit.""Tom Spencer and Bob Nolan were genius songwriters, but Roy was the driving force, and it was his sense of purpose and discipline that moved their career forward,"" Michael Sheehy, a producer of CDs for the Rogers family, told IBD.Throughout his career, Roy used the Sons in films, TV and radio, as well as on promotional tours.His first solo hit was ""A Little White Cross on the Hill,"" which reached No. 7 on the Billboard Country Music chart in 1946.The next year, he reached his career high at No. 4 with ""My Chickashay Gal.""Len began shifting to a career in movies. ""Slightly Static"" was his first picture in 1935; 104 would follow.He rode Trigger for the first time in ""Under Western Stars"" and eventually bought the palomino for $2,500 (worth $34,000 now).He was soon a competitor with Gene Autry for the title of America's favorite singing cowboy. Unlike most stars, each usually played a character using his own name.Rogers' first marriage was to Lucile Ascolese in 1933.He married Arlene Wilkins in 1936, and they adopted Cheryl.Arlene gave birth to Linda in 1943 and three years later to Roy Jr., nicknamed Dusty. But Arlene died of a brain embolism shortly thereafter.The Roy-Dale TeamIn 1947, Rogers wed his co-star Evans, who had a son, Tom, from a prior marriage.In 1950 she gave birth to a daughter, Robin, with Down syndrome, who died before her second birthday. Evans wrote about the experience and their Christian faith in the book ""Angel Unaware."" They adopted several more children and became advocates for adoption.In the Motion Picture Herald's ""Top 10 Money-Making Western Stars,"" Rogers held first place from 1943 to 1954, thanks to smash hits such as ""Sunset in El Dorado,"" ""Eyes of Texas"" and ""Spoilers of the Plains.""In 1952 he appeared with Bob Hope and Jane Russell in ""Son of Paleface,"" the comedy Western sequel to ""The Paleface."" It was not only a hit in America but also the No. 1 movie in Britain that year. And Rogers' prior flicks continued to do well at the box office as he focused on TV.""The Roy Rogers Show"" broadcast 100 episodes on NBC from 1951 to 1957 and has been in reruns on other networks ever since.Like most Western films of the time, the show featured traditional cowboy culture in modern settings. Trigger became a star in his own right, with the camera following him on solo adventures.The program was nominated for an Emmy in 1955. Its theme song, ""Happy Trails,"" written by Evans and sung by Evans and Rogers over the end credits, lives on as their signature tune.The pair traveled the country to promote their films and TV programs with live shows, using trains to transport their horses. When they had time, they visited burn wards of children's hospitals.Upbeat Aim""Roy was always an incredibly hard worker, and he had to learn everything from yodeling to sharpshooting from scratch and stuck with each skill until he had mastered it,"" said Sheehy. ""But he did everything with a little twinkle in his eye because he was always a kid at heart and knew how to entertain other kids.""In his contracts, Rogers retained merchandising rights, and his name was everywhere.

443,LEN,"New-home sales plunged 11.5% to a 468,000 annual pace in September, the Commerce Department said. It also revised down August figures by 33,000 to a 529,000 rate.September's figure sharply missed analyst forecasts of a 549,000 pace and seems at odds with the 10-year high for homebuilder confidence notched last week.Builder results have been mixed: Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) beat expectations and reported double-digit order increases, but Pulte (PHM) reported weaker-than-expected results as labor shortages and a slower pace of construction weighed on closings.The sharp drop in sales took the September supply of available homes to 5.8 months' worth, about in line with long-term averages. That should signal little reason for builders to increase their activity, although inventory remains extremely tight among existing homes.The median price rose 2.7% in September to $296,900. That's 14% higher than a year ago.

444,LEN,"Major averages lost ground Thursday and tech stocks lagged, but the losses weren't ominous with less than two hours remaining in the session.The Nasdaq lost 0.4%, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2% and the S&P 500 eased 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly lower than Wednesday's levels in the stock market today.In economic news, the first look at Q3 GDP showed growth of 1.5%, a tad below the consensus estimate of 1.7% and a sharp slowdown from 3.9% growth in Q2. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims fell more than expected and pending-home sales for September missed badly.Top-rated homebuilders slumped on the weak housing data. D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and LGI Homes (LGIH) showed losses ranging from 4 to 5%.In the health care space, Allergan (AGN) jumped 6.5% after the drugmaker confirmed that it's in early talks with Pfizer (PFE) about a merger. Shares of Pfizer fell 3%.Ellie Mae (ELLI) was a big winner inside the IBD 50 . Shares jumped 5% after the company reported strong earnings late Wednesday. Shares are up 11% so far this week. Ellie Mae is back above its 10-week moving average as it approaches its all-time high of 82.92 .On the downside, NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) crashed 20% after the chip designer reported a sharp deceleration in Q3 earnings growth and flat sales.Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) was another casualty, cratering 20%. Late Wednesday, it reported Q3 EPS of $1 a share, 29 cents below the consensus estimate. Revenue also missed.Starbucks (SBUX) lost 2% ahead of its earnings report after the close.

Netflix (NFLX) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) were hit especially hard.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%, the S&P 500 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average was essentially flat in the stock market today. Volume was mixed, rising 9% on the Nasdaq and declining a fraction on the NYSE compared to the same time Monday.Computer hardware, steel and entertainment stocks led on the downside, while shipping and defense stocks rose.Super Micro Computer, a maker of computer server systems and components, plunged 28% to its lowest level in more than two years. The drop came after Super Micro Computer late Monday slashed its fiscal Q4 sales and earnings outlook.Netflix tumbled nearly 14% after much weaker-than-expected subscriber growth trumped better-than-expected Q2 profit. Netflix's shares are 36% below their 52-week high. The stock has been consolidating since December.Lockheed Martin (LMT) rose as much as 3% to a new high after the defense major posted a 12% gain in Q2 profit to $3.28 a share on an 11% rise in revenue to $12.91 billion. Both figures beat Wall Street forecasts. But Lockheed stock reversed lower to dip into the red. That could be related to conference call concerns about cash usage on plane constructionLockheed Martin, maker of the F-35 fighter jet, also raised its 2016 outlook. The stock is still in the 5% buy zone from 245.47 entry of a flat base.In economic news, the Commerce Department said housing starts rose almost 5% in June, to an annualized rate of 1.189 million, above forecasts for 1.17 million. However, May figures were revised lower.Building permits, a guide to future activity, rose more than 1% to an annualized rate of 1.153 million, above expectations for 1.15 million.However, most leading building stocks were lower. Shares of D.R. Horton (DHI), Pulte Group (PHM) and Lennar (LEN) each posted small losses. So did LGI Homes (LGIH).D.R. Horton and Pulte Group report earnings this week.

447,LEN,"Stocks opened with minor losses Tuesday, despite a strong read on June housing activity.Dow industrials fell 0.1% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq eased 0.2%.Some big earnings reports rolled out late Monday and early Tuesday, led by Netflix (NFLX), Goldman Sachs (GS), IBM (IBM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The stock market is so far enjoying a healthy July. The Nasdaq is up 4.4% for the month through Monday, its best performance since October. The S&P 500's 3.2% gain is its strongest since March. Among small caps, the Russell 2000 has a 4.9% gain for the month -- also its best since March. If the market pauses or pulls back, however, a few telling factors could clue in investors to where institutional investors might be headed next.The Commerce Department said June housing starts rose almost 5%, to an annualized rate of 1.189 million vs. a 1.135 million tally for May that was revised downward.  Economists had projected a rate of 1.17 million.Building permits, a guide to future activity, rose more than 1% to 1.153 million on an annualized basis. Consensus had forecast permits issued at a pace of 1.15 million.The reaction among homebuilding stocks was muted. Pulte Homes (PHM) rose 0.2% at the open. Toll Brothers (TOL) added 0.7%.  Lennar (LEN), D.R. Horton (DHI) and LGI Homes (LGIH) posted small gains. Pulte and D.R. Horton report results on Thursday.Netflix opened with a 13% loss after second-quarter subscriber growth of 1.68 million fell far short of the company's 2.5 million new-subscriber target. Earnings growth blew past analyst expectations, while revenue met estimates. Netflix shares have been consolidating since December.Goldman Sachs slipped 0.5% at the open after reporting second-quarter earnings, and revenue fell less than projected.IBM edged up 0.5% after reporting upside second-quarter results late Monday, aided by a 30% gain in cloud-based revenue.Johnson & Johnson rose 1% after beating analysts' second-quarter earnings and revenue forecasts, as well as raising its full-year guidance above consensus views.VMware (VMW) spiked 8% at the open after strong second-quarter results.Super Micro Computer (SMCI) toppled 26%. The server system and computer components manufacturer after management sharply reduced its fiscal fourth quarter sales and earnings guidance late Monday.Auto parts retailer Genuine Parts (GPC) dropped 3% at the open. The Atlanta-based chain reported Q2 sales and earnings below analyst targets, and guided full-year earnigns to the low end of the consensus range.Oil traded up and down, with West Texas Intermediate futures just above $45.50 a barrel. Gold inched up a fraction to above $1,331 an ounce. The dollar gained vs. the euro, yen and pound.

"
448,LEN,"New-home sales fell 6% in May to an annualized rate of 551,000, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Analysts had expected a drop to 565,000. April was revised to 586,000 from the initial reading of 619,000.Existing-home sales rose 1.8% in May to an annual rate of 5.53 million, the highest in nine years, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Economists had expected 5.570 million.On Tuesday, homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.In other economic news, new jobless claims fell 18,000 in the week ended June 18 to 259,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. That was a bigger drop than expected, and back near a 43-year low set in March. It's a good sign for the June employment report after May's surprisingly weak payrolls gain.The Chicago Fed National Activity Index fell to -0.51 in May from April's downwardly revised 0.05 reading. The 3-month average dipped to -0.3 from April's -0.23. Sub-zero readings indicate below-trend economic growth, not recession.
"
449,LEN,"Builders broke ground in July on the most homes since 2007, another sign of the housing market's gathering momentum. That helped boost several homebuilder stocks to longtime highs Tuesday, even as the major market indexes retreated.Starts ran at an annual pace of 1.21 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, above forecasts and 0.2% above an upwardly revised June. Even better: Single-family starts leapt 12.8%, also to near 8-year highs.Permits, which foreshadow starts, dived 16%, led by a 60% drop in the Northeast, where a New York tax credit that expired in June had pulled activity dramatically forward in the spring months.A host of other data suggests the housing market may have finally hit its stride and may even be poised to lead the economy.""We're seeing the market successfully transition from an investor-driven recovery to one that is being driven by traditional buyers,"" said Daren Blomquist, vice president for housing data firm RealtyTrac. ""That's a very good thing because it's more sustainable for the long term.""Cash Is No Longer KingSales of existing homes surged to the fastest pace since 2009 in May, helped by first-time buyers. They represented 32% of purchases in May, the most since 2012 but still solidly below the long-term average of about 40%. June existing-home data will be released Thursday.All-cash sales are also dwindling. Those sales made up 31.9% of the total in May, CoreLogic said, the lowest since July 2008. Cash sales are often considered a proxy for investor, rather than owner-occupied, purchases.Cash buyers are also frequently foreign, Blomquist said, and their presence in the market has helped push up prices. ""We're seeing those pull back and that is opening the door for the traditional buyers. But if global influences push more buyers back into U.S. real estate that could put upward pressure on prices.""As inventory of both existing and new homes remains tight, prices are likely to keep surging, challenging many traditional buyers, especially first-timers.But as the job market heats up, homeownership is starting to seem more attractive — and more feasible — even for millennials.Homebuilder Stocks RiseShares of homebuilders catering to first-time buyers have done especially well.D.R. Horton (DHI) opened an entry-level division, Express Homes, in early 2014. The firm's stock rose 1.4% to a 9-year high. LGI Homes (LGIH), also targeting the entry level market, edged higher Tuesday after hitting a record high Monday. Shares are up 40% since it reported strong earnings on Aug. 5.Lennar (LEN), which also has significant first-time buyers and multiunit construction, rose 3.1%, hitting an 8-1/2-year high.Even luxury-focused Toll Bros. (TOL) advanced, rising 2.8% to its best level in nearly 10 years.The housing market isn't too affected by China, Greece and other overseas concerns, and as those headwinds have rocked markets in recent weeks, that's reduced mortgage rates. While most analysts expect an initial Federal Reserve rate hike in September, Blomquist believes it will turn out to be a ""non-event.""All that is making homebuilders seem like a relatively safe-haven growth sector right now.IBD's Building-Residential Commercial group was rated a solid No. 34 out of 197 industries as of Monday's close, up from 98 just six weeks ago.July's hot starts pace was still about 40% lower than it was during the bubble years of 2005-06, and most analysts think that's healthy. Blomquist calls builders ""wisely cautious.""But a closely watched survey of sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders hit the highest point in a decade in its August read, out Monday.The NAHB's future sales sub-index ""has a decent track record of leading starts by about six months or so,"" ITG Chief Economist Steve Blitz wrote in a client note. ""The relationship suggests single-family starts getting up to 800,000 units (annualized) in the next several months.""Single-family homes currently account for 65% of total starts, down from 80% before the bubble. As homeownership has tumbled to a 48-year low, apartment building has surged to meet demand for rentals.Blomquist thinks it's OK if inventory stays tighter than in the past. There have been about five months' worth of homes available in 2015, compared to the long-term average of six months.Still, lean supply coupled with strong demand is pushing up prices.""The majority of markets are still affordable by historical standards,"" Blomquist said. ""The ones that are unaffordable by historical standards are the big markets with the most jobs. So it is a concern to start to see the affordability equation break down.""

544,LEN,"A good stock idea isn't much use if you don't understand what you're looking at. Is it an institutional-quality stock? Is it a cyclical play that probably will only profit from its industry cycle? Is it a turnaround story that involves the fixing of a company problem? Is it a fad stock that will run hot until people tire of the novelty?
"
545,LEN,"The strategy and target will differ for each of these situations, and it will vary by the kind of uptrend the market is in.Peg the stock wrong or the market wrong, and you will probably lose money or at least make less than you should.If an investor is going to make big money, institutional-quality stocks, operating in a strong uptrend, will most often be the investor's best choice. However, there are times when a cyclical stock, turnaround or fad stock can deliver good gains.Where can an investor find or identify great stock ideas? Your Weekly Review (YWR), also known as the 85-85 list, is a good place to look in Friday's IBD.In this screen, stocks must score an 85 in EPS Rating and in Relative Price Strength Rating. The 85 means that the stocks must be in the top 15 percentile among stocks in IBD's database. Stocks also must be within 15% of a 12-month high.Charts are listed by industry group, but charts aren't printed for every stock. Additional stocks are listed in the fine-print listing on the last page of YWR, today on A8.The big net makes the 85-85 a good place to look for stock ideas. A low-hurdle screen will pick up more cyclicals, turnarounds and fad stocks than a high-hurdle screen.Some people sneer at ""fad stocks."" They argue that such stocks are dangerous, won't last and aren't for serious investors.Well, all stocks are dangerous. While fad stocks might have a shorter life, sometimes all we're talking about is a solid company indirectly benefiting from a fad.For example, egg producer and distributor Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) rode the Atkins diet to big stock gains in 2003.In other cases, fads develop into longer-lasting trends.For instance, Deckers Outdoor (DECK) bought UGG Holdings in August 1995 and eventually turned the Ugg boots — once popular mostly with surfers — into a broader fashion trend.From October 2002 to October 2011, Deckers Outdoors shares rose 9,193%, with Uggs deserving much of the credit.How might the 85-85 be used?Let's look at the 85-85 screen that was published in IBD on Oct. 24, 2014, not long after a market low and the Oct. 21 follow-through day. A follow-through day soon after a market low is often the best time to scout for breakouts, retaking of buy points and bounces off the 10-week moving average, as seen in the minicharts.An investor could've found five institutional-quality stocks in the 85-85 that soon set valid entries: Apple (AAPL), Celgene (CELG), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Illumina (ILMN) and Skyworks (SWKS). Gains varied from 15% to 79%.Four cyclicals in the 85-85 eventually offered entries: Landstar System (LSTR), Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), FedEx (FDX) and Lennar (LEN). Gains ran from 11% to 15%.Turnarounds and fads were scarce.The market itself was and had been choppy, which is why taking a 10% to 15% profit in Apple was prudent.

570,LEN,"Ranked No. 2 in Tuesday's IBD, the homebuilding industry group has a number of positive factors going for it. First, the benchmark 30-year mortgage rate is still near the record low levels hit in 2012. Even as prices have moved higher, demand remains strong. In August, new-home sales rose by the fastest pace in more than seven years.While the rebound in the housing market has been in effect for several years, it still has further to go, according to Toll Bros. (TOL) CEO Doug Yearley.Last week, Yearley told CNBC that the housing recovery is just in its ""fourth or fifth inning.""With a new market uptrend in place, a number of leading stocks in the homebuilder group are forming bases and deserve attention.M/I Homes (MHO) is forming a consolidation with a 27.10 buy point, although an alternate entry is shaping up at 26.46.Its Accumulation/Distribution has improved sharply after falling to a D- a couple of months ago. The volatile session on Aug. 24 is a black eye in the pattern.

The Nasdaq pushed into its highest levels of the day.A day after the major indexes traded quietly, the tech-rich Nasdaq composite jumped more than 1% higher, on track for its biggest single-session gain since a nearly 0.8% lift March 16.

The stock, up 2% in heavy volume, is now up 7% past a 1665.10 early entry within a three-month consolidation. Horton and NVR are both rising, also because of better-than-expected fiscal Q1 results by Miami-based giant Lennar (LEN), up nearly 2% in big turnover. Lennar is trying to reclaim its 200-day moving average, an area of upside resistance. Lennar is 15% below a 56.04 52-week high, meaning that it, too, is coming within the typical range in which a high-quality growth stock can set up a successful breakout.Lennar posted a 26% rise in profit for the quarter ended in February, walloping the Street's consensus view by 21%. Revenue rose 21% to $1.99 billion, showing accelerating growth vs. the 14% gain seen in the November-ended fiscal fourth quarter.

624,LEN,"Labor shortages may play a role, and delays are often ""weather-based,"" said Linda Wilson, broker-owner of Wilson & Co. Sotheby's International Realty in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Wilson says that buyers of new homes should consider having an agent or lawyer help them review the contract.
"
625,LEN,"""Some people are under the misconception that the builder's Realtor is working for them — and (he or she) is not,"" said Debbie Bennington, an agent with Dickson Realty in Reno, Nev.
"
626,LEN,"""Your agent can help you understand the contract, but the builder isn't going to change it,"" said Wilson. Most builders have a standard contract that's not negotiable.
"
627,LEN,"So buy from a reputable builder with strong financial backing, says Wilson. Also, be warned that the best prices come with the highest risk. Buying early, at phase one, will get you the best price, but you'll be living in a construction zone for a long time and likely without some promised amenities.
"
628,LEN,"""Each phase, the price goes up,"" said Wilson. ""If it's a new project, and you don't know much about it, then I'd wait for the second or third phase.""
"
629,LEN,"And figuring the final price of your home isn't easy either. Most builders offer a long list of upgrades — granite counters, hardwood floors, top-line appliances, etc. So make sure that your price estimate includes all the finishes that you want .
"
630,LEN,"Comb the contract to understand the nitty-gritty — price, deposit, schedule for payments, time for performance and ""what happens with delays and change orders,"" said David Jaffe, vice president, legal advocacy, with the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, D.C. And, Jaffe says, review what the contract says about disputes: How will they be handled, and is there an arbitration clause?
"
631,LEN,"Warranties And Inspections
"
632,LEN,"Often a contract will also include a ""cost escalation"" clause, said Eugene Graf, president of E.G. Construction in Bozeman, Mont. Graf says that costs for ""Sheetrock, shingles and plywood"" can change ""rapidly,"" so builders want the contract to cover possible material cost increases. He also said that banks lending on a new home often ""require a stated potential overage amount.""
"
633,LEN,"New homes usually come with a warranty, but the length can vary. Typically a builder will warrant all of his work for the first year. Beyond that, state laws set the rules for new home warranty coverage and length.
"
634,LEN,"Some buyers opt out of having their new homes inspected as they would an existing home, because they believe that the local building department has fully vetted it. Agents say that opting out can be a huge mistake. ""Residential building inspectors don't inspect everything. ... They don't inspect every home and every mechanical system,"" said Bennington.
"
635,LEN,"Graf, however, says that the building inspectors in his area are very thorough. He also has ""open job sites"" so a buyer ""can go see"" his or her home during construction. He added: ""It's one of our best selling features.""
"
636,LEN,"Jaffe says that unfortunately, some warranties are ""vague,"" and buyers and builders may disagree about what's a defect and what's normal aging. On its website, the NAHB offers information to help buyers understand the construction process and quality standards.
"
637,LEN,"Closing escrow and moving into a home with a major building flaw means that you won't have any leverage to get the builder to fix it quickly and to your satisfaction, and you'll be living through the repair.
"
638,LEN,"Wilson says that she had one client who was ready to move into a new home, but a home inspector found that the driveway drainage was wrong and, during a big rain, water would run into the home's garage. The buyer wouldn't close on the house until the driveway was fixed. The builder initially refused to fix the driveway but eventually agreed to tear it out and replace it.
"
639,LEN,"Amenities And HOA Rules
"
640,LEN,"Do you fully understand the association rules of your new development? What are the parking, landscaping and exterior maintenance requirements for all properties? Can you remodel? If so, what's the permit process? If it's a senior community, what are the restrictions about having family visit?
"
641,LEN,"""It's super exciting to buy new and early, but there are a lot of unknowns,"" said Bennington.
"
642,LEN,"Even the types of homes that a builder is putting up can change.
"
643,LEN,"During the bust, Bennington said, ""There were communities where they said they were going to build a certain size of home, and then they built smaller homes.""
"
644,LEN,"You'll also want to ask detailed questions about any promised amenities, a fancy clubhouse or pool, and when they'll be finished.
"
645,LEN,"Buyer beware. ""Amenities may not show up for years,"" said Wilson, ""and they may not show up at all.""Buying a new-construction home is like purchasing a stock at its initial public offering. It's a bet on the future. Will the home turn out as you expected and be finished on time? Do you fully understand the contract and the ""cost escalators""? If you're buying in phase one, will all the amenities actually get built and meet your expectations? Do you understand the warranty and your rights?After the real estate bust, residential new construction is having a strong year. PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) is forecasting housing starts of 1.11 million for all of 2015 and 1.18 million next year, up from 1 million in 2014.Housing starts ""look good and they're getting better,"" said Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at Pittsburgh-based PNC.But are we back to a full building boom? No. Faucher said that builders are ""afraid of getting burned, so they're hesitant to expand."" And he says that the building industry is experiencing a labor shortage.The National Association of Realtors said in a news release earlier this month that homebuilding for all housing types ""is underperforming in roughly two-thirds of measured metro areas.""Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said, ""Even as the labor market began to strengthen, homebuilding failed to keep up and is now contributing to the stronger price appreciation and eroding affordability currently seen throughout the U.S.""Top U.S. homebuilders include Toll Bros.

Jobless claims are at levels once associated with full employment, a boon for the housing market in the future.Housing delivered stronger-than-expected data again Thursday, confirming that its rebound is for real and may even be enough to power the economy as the factory sector flags.Sales of new single-family homes ran at an annual pace of 552,000 in August, the strongest in 7-1/2 years, the Commerce Department said. August's rate was 22% higher than a year earlier, making it the 9th straight month of double-digit yearly gains.The current sales pace would take 4.7 months to clear all inventory, well below the long-run average of 6 months. Even so, prices ticked up only 0.5% in August. The average yearly price gain for new homes in 2015 is 3.6%, down from an average 7.1% in 2014. That slower pace of price growth helped draw more first-time buyers to existing home sales in August.Lean supply, along with improving fundamentals like a jobless rate at a 7-year low and subdued consumer inflation, is helping bolster demand for housing.Builders Are BenefitingIt's also helping homebuilders. KB Home (KBH) on Thursday reported double-digit gains in orders and deliveries, and said that its average sales price rose 9%. Lennar (LEN) on Monday noted ""significant pent-up demand"" as it beat earnings estimates.""Sales of new homes on which construction has not yet started have accounted for over one-third of all new home sales over the past seven months,"" wrote Regions Bank chief economist Richard Moody Thursday.Housing's long-awaited resurgence is good news at a time when another economic engine, manufacturing, has lost steam.The price of oil is down more than 50% since mid-2014, wreaking havoc with many firms' capital budgets. The dollar's jump to the highest in a decade also has sunk demand for U.S. exports.In a separate report Thursday, the Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods fell 2% in August; orders excluding the volatile transportation sector were flat, below estimates for an 0.3% gain. Both measures have been below year-ago levels in every month since February.On Thursday, construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT) said that it will slash thousands of jobs as it aims to cut costs by about $1.5 billion.""Absolutely, manufacturing is the weak part of the economy,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist for analyst High Frequency Economics. He believes that the sector may weaken even further in September or October. But for home sales, ""it's pretty clear the trend has been up.""Housing will start to contribute more to the economy as the mix of new homes shifts from multifamily homes to single-family, O'Sullivan said.Builders broke ground on more homes in July than in the past 8 years, and single-family starts rose to a 7-year high in August, though they still make up a smaller portion of all starts than before the downturn.While manufacturing makes up 12% of the economy, ""the other 88% is chugging along,"" O'Sullivan noted. Jobless claims are at levels once associated with full employment, a boon for the housing market in the future.

696,LEN,"The housing market is back. A closely watched sentiment index from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) hit a high not seen since the heady days of the housing bubble.Homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI) and LGI Homes (LGIH) hit new highs, as did home improvement giant Home Depot (HD).The NAHB index rose 1 point in August to 61. Two subindexes, measuring current sales conditions and the next 6 months, were relatively unchanged at high levels: 66 and 70, respectively.The traffic index rose by 2 points. At 45, it's still below the neutral 50 mark — but traffic has been above that mark only briefly, and that was just before the bubble burst.If homebuilders are bullish, it's probably a signal that housing is in good shape. It could also be a good sign for the rest of the economy, since a humming housing market propels so much other activity, especially hiring.Horton shares rose 2% to a 9-year high Monday. LGI fell lightly after making an all-time high; Lennar (LEN) rose 3% and PulteGroup (PHM) 1%.Meanwhile, in the mobile software industry, GrubHub (GRUB) is facing pressure in online food delivery from rivals led by ride-summoning service Uber, which recently began highlighting its big push into food delivery with a new look on its app.Uber had buried the UberEats app at the bottom of its site. But starting last week, UberEats has appeared prominently next to Uber's car-summoning icon. It's the latest salvo in the app-based food delivery service wars, wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Kevin Kopelman in a research report on Monday.""We view this as a subtle but significant change recognizing food delivery as Uber's second major category ahead of a broader rollout,"" wrote Kopelman.Uber is hiring for its UberEats on-demand meal-delivery service in at least nine U.S. cities and could operate in as many as 15 cities in coming months, Kopelman says.""UberEATS remains small today in both geographic scope, food options and user adoption. However, Uber's recent moves signal some traction in markets where UberEATS has rolled out and point to aggressive expansion of food delivery as a core Uber service,"" Kopelman said.Uber is pioneering the ""ultrafast"" food category, offering a limited selection of prepared foods in thermal bags that couriers deliver within 10 minutes for a flat all-in delivery fee of $3 to $4.Competition from Uber and other companies that deliver food — which include Google (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — is pressuring GrubHub's order growth, which slowed to a 25% year-over-year gain in Q2 2015 from 33% in Q4 2014, wrote Kopelman. ""We note that new competitors, most notably Postmates, Yelp (YELP)-owned Eat24, DoorDash, Munchery, Caviar and UberEATS, are on track to capture 50% of U.S. industry growth in fiscal 2015 vs. 25% in 2014, and (excluding Uber) have raised $500 million year to date,"" Kopelman wrote.

"
716,LEN,"A baseball or basketball team will have a tough time without a good defense.Likewise, making money in stocks is challenging without a sound selling strategy.Half the battle is buying the right stock at the right time, but it's equally important to know when to sell — on the upside and the downside.Whether the stock didn't pan out the way you hoped or the market falls into a correction, you risk losing far more money if you don't have a set cut-off point at which to get out of a losing position.That's why IBD often stresses the importance of the 7%-to-8% sell rule. If a stock falls 7% or 8% below your buy point — not its peak price — exit the position without asking questions. Don't let a small loss spiral into a bigger one.""The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you're wrong,"" founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""It's also important to keep in mind that there are times when you don't have to wait for a stock to fall 7% to 8% from the entry before cutting it loose. That rule of thumb is the absolute limit. Investors are at greater risk of losses when the market uptrend is under pressure or in correction.So when the market isn't in a confirmed uptrend and a stock you own isn't behaving well, it's perfectly acceptable to get out of a position ahead of a 7% to 8% decline. In this case, cut your losses at 3% to 5% to help preserve your capital. You can then put those funds to work in better-performing stocks or raise cash for the next uptrend.Staying mostly in cash is prudent when the market is in a steep correction or a bear market. When the market is in an uptrend but trading is choppy, aim to sell positions at an even lower threshold, perhaps at 2% or 3% below the buy point.Take Lennar (LEN), for example, back in 2013. The homebuilder emerged from a V-shaped cup base on March 20 in heavy volume. The next session, it pulled back to form another similar cup base. Lennar climbed past a new buy point at 44 on May 14, but closed slightly below it.Lennar attempted to clear the entry, but reversed lower after hitting intraday highs (1). Then the stock fell further in heavier trade. It fell more than 5% intraday from the buy point, before settling for a 3.9% loss from the 44 entry by May 22.The stock staged a 3% upside reversal in fast turnover the next day, though it failed to reclaim its buy point. Lennar again fell as much as 5% during a bearish reversal two sessions later (2).That turned out to be the last-ditch chance to cut losses short. On May 29, the stock sank 4%, slicing its 50-day moving average in heavy volume to fall more than 8% below the buy point (3). From there, it fell as much as 30% from the 44.40 peak to its mid-August low.In addition to a lack of upside volume, Lennar's relative strength line lagged as it tried to break out. Distribution days had also been piling up in the market while Lennar was working on both bases. Shortly after the stock's breakdown, the market outlook changed to under pressure, and by mid-June to a correction.

"
730,LEN,"U.S. home prices will rise moderately this year and next as demand picks up but inventory stays low, a panel of housing economists said Friday. Rents rising, perhaps faster, are expected to benefit landlords, while homebuilders undergo a continuing profit pinch.After a 6% gain the last 12 months, home prices should rise 5% both this year and next, predicts Frank Nothaft, chief economist at property analytics provider CoreLogic (CLGX).""By the end of 2017, I think we'll be back up to the peak where we were in 2006,"" he told the National Association of Real Estate Editors (NAREE) conference in Miami, Fla. ""But those are nominal prices ... in inflation-adjusted terms, prices will still be about 20% below the 2006 peak.""He sees home sales also rising 5% this year to the highest since 2009.Homebuying is happening amid stock market gains and better consumer confidence, which hit a 5-month high in a University of Michigan survey out Friday.Panelists saw a variety of reasons for a low inventory of existing homes for sale. They ranged from owners hesitating to sell because they don't find a suitable replacement home to reluctance to move after refinancing a mortgage at a very low rate.Also, large investors who have bought homes are not putting them back on the market, said National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun.Whatever the reasons, the low-inventory phenomenon has an impact on builders, said David Crowe, senior economist at the National Association of Home Builders.""New-home sales come primarily from existing-home sellers,"" he said. ""If we're not getting existing sellers to sell their house, we can't find someone to buy their new house.""So ""builders aren't going to build what they think they can't sell.""That's despite a 30-year mortgage rate that Yun expects to end the year at an average of just 4.3%.Crowe sees single-family housing construction starts rising from 647,000 in 2014 to 726,000 this year and 935,000 in 2016.He notes that after the housing downturn and recession, when builders braked with the marketplace, their supply chains — from labor to lending — were interrupted .Now, Crowe says, ""builders are seeing a profit squeeze — they're having to pay higher prices for their land, and they're having to pay more for labor ... and they're suffering either from no credit or very expensive credit.""A lack of credit availability through small community banks particularly affects regional and local builders, the NAREE panelists said.One thing affecting the housing supply is that many existing homes have become rentals, as owners and small investors seek income streams and as the institutional single-family-home buyers that Yun referenced act as landlords.""We've had a big increase in the one-family-home component of the rental stock,"" Nothaft said.""We've seen rents rise on single-family homes about 4% this year. ... In some markets, double-digit increases in rent and in other markets growth (are) a lot weaker,"" he added, citing April data.Zillow (Z) chief economist, Stan Humphries, sees rents up more than home prices.""Rents are rising 4.3% year over year while home prices are up 3.3% year over year (in May),"" he said. ""We're very tight in terms of rental vacancies. It's no surprise why rents are on a tear in this country.""Humphries says that he continues to be very bullish on rental demand, noting that while some renters will move into homes, millennials and restrained wage growth support the rental market.""The kid in your basement is not going to go buy a house,"" Humphries said. ""He's going to move into rental stock.""The builder stocks in IBD's Building-Commercial/Residential industry group are up a collective 10% this year. Three of the five largest by market cap are highly rated by IBD, with a Composite Rating of 89 or better out of a potential 99: Lennar (LEN), D.R. Horton (DHI) and NVR (NVR). Among builders with a market cap of at least $1 billion, two more have a Composite Rating that high: Ryland Group (RYL) and Tri Pointe Homes (TPH), both with a 91.Homebuilders rallied after the largest by market cap, Lennar, beat analyst estimates in its second quarter earnings report Wednesday. And Lennar stock rose 5%.The builder's gross margin on home sales of 23.8% was down from 25.5% a year earlier.""Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased primarily due to an increase in land costs, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered,"" Lennar said in its report.KB Home (KBH) stock has jumped 16% since its earnings report June 19 that topped analyst estimates. That builder's gross profit margin came in at 16%, down from 18.9% a year earlier, attributed in the report to ""higher land and construction costs, increased pricing pressure in certain markets, start-up field costs associated with new community openings, and an increase in the amortization of previously capitalized interest.""

823,LEN,"As D.R. Horton (DHI), the nation's largest homebuilder by volume, reported strong results for its June-ending quarter Tuesday, sending shares up 3%, a leading housing expert warned that the rate of home-price gains would likelier slow than accelerate the next two years.

"
825,LEN,"The economy rose at a 2% annual rate in the third quarter, revised down from 2.1% and Q2's 3.9%, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The U.S. is on pace for a 10th straight year of failing to achieve 3% annual growth. That helps explain why it took nearly a decade for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, and why Donald Trump has had so much support in his presidential run.
"
826,LEN,"In the third quarter, exports were a little weaker than previously estimated, as U.S. manufacturers and others struggle to sell to weak overseas economies amid a strong dollar. Inventories rose a little less than expected, subtracting 0.7 percentage point from Q3 GDP growth. Most economists expect business destockpiling still has a ways to go.
"
827,LEN,"Business investment rose at a 9.9% pace, the best in a year. Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of economic activity, rose at a solid 3% pace amid improving jobs and wages and cheap gas prices at the pump.
"
828,LEN,"But through the first nine months of 2015, GDP has risen at a 2.2% rate. Most economists see Q4 growth as lackluster, leaving the economy with less than 3% yet again. This decade of futility would the worst in the post-World War II era.
"
829,LEN,"Sluggish growth has left wages stagnant for Americans, especially noncollege educated men. This blue collar discontent has generated resentment and forms the base of Trump's populist presidential run. More than two-thirds (69%) of Trump supporters say the U.S. is still in a recession, according to the latest IBD/TIPP Poll, even though the current expansion started in June 2009; 44% of Trump supporters are in job-sensitive households, meaning they or someone in their family are looking for work or worried about losing their job.
"
830,LEN,"The decade of weak economic growth — including the sharpest recession since the Depression and the weakest expansion since WWII — also lines up with the Fed's reluctance to raise rates. Until this month's move, the Fed hadn't hiked since mid-2006, and for nearly 7 years the rate had been near zero.

831,LEN,"Job growth has been sluggish and wages too. Yes, unemployment has fallen to 5%, but much of that reflects a sharp decline in the labor force participation rate.

Existing-home sales fell 3.8% vs. a year earlier. The median price rose 6.3% vs. a year earlier to $220,300. New mortgage disclosure rules appeared to delay existing-home closings, perhaps pushing some closings into November.
"
836,LEN,"NAR also once again blamed a lack of supply for the weak housing sales figures. The number of existing homes for sales fell 3.3% to 2.04 million — down 1.9% vs. a year earlier. Tight supply and rising home prices should spur more activity from D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and other homebuilders.

Economists had expected a reading of -0.5, just below break-even. New orders, shipments and work hours remained negative, but employment turned positive and so did unfilled orders, which have been negative for most of the year. Manufacturers also were more upbeat.

Total inventory was up 10% in April, but still lower than a year ago, and the 5.3 months of supply on the market is lower than the long-term average of 6 months' worth.That's pressuring prices upward as well: the median price of $219,400 was 8.9% higher than a year ago, and represented the biggest yearly gain in any month since January 2014.

Both single-family and multifamily starts jumped by double-digits in the month, but single-family starts are up 15% vs. a year ago.Starts in the weather-battered Northeast offered some proof of the temporary factors that have been wreaking havoc with economic data in past months. They tumbled 57% from January to February, then rebounded 115% in March and 86% in April.Homebuilders have had a mixed spring. D.R. Horton (DHI) said orders jumped by nearly a third in Q1, but that margins could be pressured as entry-level homes make up a greater share of the total. Meritage (MTH) is forecasting revenue that's higher by as much as 25-20% in 2015, but PulteGroup (PHM) saw profit drop 26% in Q1.

""I think we're experiencing a general market improvement and also some pent-up demand created by an unusually harsh winter.""He anticipates a ""good season"" for vacation home sales.""A lot of it is due to an improved economy and improving job market,"" he adds.At the end of the first quarter, his team had 24 properties under contract vs. 18 last year.He says most agents at his firm say second homes are the biggest part of their business.Allan Dechert, co-owner of Ferguson Dechert Real Estate in Avalon, N.J., is also upbeat about the vacation-home market in the Stone Harbor and Avalon beach areas.""I'm optimistic this year will be a great year,"" he told IBD.Second-home sales activity was ""pretty steady"" in 2014 and into the year's fourth quarter, he says.So far this year — despite the harsh winter weather — the activity through the first quarter was ""really good,"" Dechert said. This year's first quarter was ""significantly above"" last year's for his team in dollars and in units.He says purchases have been priced across the board. In March, for example, sale prices ranged from $460,000 to $2.5 million.Overall, the total sales inventory on Stone Harbor and Avalon, is down 20% from a year ago, Dechert says, adding that things are ""tightening up"" with fewer properties on the market, which means pricing will go up.Arizona's ExperienceKris Anderson, team leader for Your Premier Team at Re/Max Excalibur in Scottsdale, Ariz., is also seeing some pickup in vacation home buying activity.In the first quarter, 15.2% of all sales in Arizona's Maricopa County — which includes Phoenix — were for vacation homes, up from 9% in the 2014 fourth quarter, she told IBD.In the first quarter of 2015, vacation home sales for the county were up 1% from a year earlier.Another indication that activity is up in the county: Pending home sales under contract were up 7% from a year earlier in the first quarter and the median sales price increased by 5.5%.Vacation homes made up 15% of total pending sales, the same percentage as last year, Anderson said, adding, ""that's not a great percentage, but we're happy with 15%.""

1104,LEN,"As the peak earnings season kicks in this week, five homebuilder stocks will be among dozens of companies reporting their March quarters, days after reports showed disappointing housing starts for the month.If analyst estimates prove right, builder earnings for the quarter won't be much to write home about — unless you like to share uninspiring news.Earnings per share of the five reporting this week are seen falling from year-ago levels or showing little growth.Reston, Va.-based NVR (NVR) starts the parade on Tuesday, followed by No. 1 builder D.R. Horton (DHI) on Wednesday and PulteGroup (PHM), Meritage Homes (MTH) and small-cap M/I Homes (MHO) on Thursday.D.R. Horton's profit is expected to show zero growth, coming in the same as last year at 38 cents a share, according to the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. PulteGroup's profit is seen rising 5% to 20 cents, the best growth rate in the group.The rest are expected to show declines of 13% (Meritage) to between 22% and 25% (M/I Homes and NVR, respectively).Bad weather during the quarter may affect some of the builders. NVR, for example, has a majority of its communities in the hard-hit mid-Atlantic and Rust Belt, noted analyst Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee in a preview report on Friday.Of the five reporting, McCanless has buy ratings on only two — PulteGroup and Meritage. (He didn't report on M/I.) He expects Pulte's year-over-year orders in the quarter to be up 5%, above expectations for a little over 2%, and the average selling price to also come in above views, up 6.3% to $336,936.Meritage previously reported that January orders jumped 48% vs. a year earlier, which McCanless attributed to the addition of Legendary Homes in August and improving sales in the Southeast. He sees unit orders growing 16% for the full quarter, below views.McCanless noted that Fort Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton is taking a ""cautious approach"" in Texas oil markets of Houston and Midland, which accounted for 6% of the builder's fiscal 2014 housing revenue.In D.R. Horton's December-ending first quarter, orders were higher than expected and its speculative home count grew by more than a third, McCanless noted.D.R. Horton is the highest rated stock in IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group, with a Composite Rating of 96 out of a possible 99. Next highest is Lennar (LEN), which reported its February-ending first quarter last month. Lennar's earnings and revenue in the quarter topped views but gross margin fell, as expected, on higher costs.Homebuilder stocks fell in unison late last week after government data showed that March housing starts were up just 2% to an annualized rate of 926,000, missing views for 1.04 million. Starts were 2.5% lower than a year earlier.RELATED:Will Builders See Spring Home Sales Heat Up?

1145,LEN,"""The decrease in vacation and investment sales prices is likely due to the increase in vacation and investment buyers purchasing condos and townhouses, which contributed to a decline in the median size of 200 square feet for both,"" noted Yun.Vacation home sales soared to a record high last year, according to a report that the National Association of Realtors (NAR) released Wednesday, as high-end households put some of their stock market and real estate earnings into second homes in spots that support a leisure lifestyle.But the high-enders pulled back on investment purchases, which fell for the fourth straight year.The median price paid was lower both for homes purchased with vacation-use plans and for homes intended as investment.The NAR survey, which covers existing- and new-home transactions in 2014, shows that vacation home sales surged to an estimated 1.13 million last year, the highest amount since NAR began the survey in 2003. Vacation sales were up 57.4% from 717,000 in 2013.The trend bodes well for homebuilders such as Toll Bros.

""The data sets for first-time buyers are typically a month to three months late, but we believe the trends established in late 2014 and early 2015 suggest demand is growing,"" he wrote in a client note on Monday. That bodes well for…
"
1154,LEN,"The harsh winter blast may have chilled temperatures in parts of the U.S., but that hasn't dampened a solid start to the key spring selling season for the nation's homebuilders amid increased demand.But builders may have to pay more for lots and labor, a trend which some of them have warned is creating margin pressure.Though Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) both reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings last month, their profit margins fell amid higher costs, as the two homebuilders had warned.Recent financial results from some top builders and recently released key housing indicators, however, bode well for the spring selling season.The pending home sales index, which is based on contract signings, was up 12% year-over-year in February and 3.1% from January, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. The index hit its highest level since June 2013.""It looks like the buyers want to come out to the market and they are eager to find the right home and make an offer,"" Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR, told IBD. ""Therefore, I expect the second quarter of this year to be easily ahead of last year in terms of sales activity. Pending contracts are implying that the closing activity in coming months will be quite solid.""Another key indicator, the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, was released Tuesday. It rose 4.6% vs. a year earlier and 4.4% from December.Yun says the S&P/Case-Shiller index is a ""lagging indicator,"" which is ""likely to accelerate"" in coming months.What Builders See NowHomebuilders such as Toll Bros. (TOL) and Meritage Homes (MTH) are among builders encouraged by the start to the spring selling season.""We're pretty pleased on how the spring selling season got underway,"" Meritage Homes spokesman Brent Anderson told IBD.The spring selling season normally kicks off in the days following Super Bowl Sunday, which was Feb. 1. Anderson says the buying pickup started earlier this year — around Jan. 1 — a trend he's heard across the industry.Meritage's January orders surged 48% from a year earlier. That was a ""strong number,"" Anderson said, against the prior January, which wasn't the company's ""best month.""He says vs. this January's numbers, ""February and March won't be nearly that strong, but there will still be pretty strong growth.""""If the spring selling season gets off to a good start and we see a good follow-through,"" he said, ""it bodes pretty well for the first half of the year, when you're making most of your sales.""Marty Connor, chief financial officer for Toll Bros., is encouraged by the luxury homebuilder's results for the first quarter, which ended Jan. 31.The dollar value for signed contracts rose 24% vs. a year earlier in Q1. Since the start of the second quarter, which began on Feb. 1, contracts in units rose 13%, the company said when it delivered the Q1 report on Feb. 24.""That makes seven months in a row where sales improved over the prior year,"" Connor told IBD. ""We feel pretty good.""Robert Denk, senior economist at the National Association of Homebuilders, says ""builders are optimistic"" about the spring selling season. The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index fell in March but any level above 50 is a good sign for builder confidence, he notes.A recent uptick in housing starts bodes well for builders, says Denk.Single-family housing starts averaged over 700,000 October through January, which was a ""big improvement"" from the first half of 2014 when such starts were ""struggling"" around 650,000, he says.""We had a strong finish to 2014,"" he added. ""That makes us optimistic that 2015 and the spring selling season are going to be very good.""This season looks ""much stronger"" than the last spring season, which was weighed down by weather and a less robust jobs market, Morningstar analyst James Krapfel said, adding ""we're seeing lower interest rates and better job growth.""'Sustained' Sales IncreaseAndres Carbacho-Burgos, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, says between December and February there was a ""sustained increase"" in new home sales.""That seems to indicate that the market for new homes is starting to tighten,"" he told IBD. ""That's a good sign. But we have some way to go because demand is still not as strong as we would like it to be.""He says the current inventory-to-sales ratio is slightly below five months of sales, which is still above the 1997-2005 average, which was four months.""If we can bring it down to four months that would be good because 1997 to 2005 was the period when we saw sustained new home construction before the housing bubble,"" he said.Svenja Gudell, senior director of economic research for Zillow (Z), says there will be enough demand for new homes for the spring selling season. The question for builders is will they be able to (have) enough land and build enough homes to meet the demand?""She says builders are building on smaller lots, driven by the point that land can be very expensive and financing hard to get, and some builders face labor shortages.""They're maximizing land space,"" she added. ""To increase their margins or keep their margins stable, they're putting larger houses on smaller pieces of land.""Denk says materials prices for construction are less of a problem than finding labor and lots.""Labor and lot shortages are forcing builders to bid up prices for limited supplies and raising house prices, squeezing margins,"" he said. ""In some cases, that's killing the deal and making it unprofitable. In other cases it forces (builders) to raise prices. And if they can't raise them enough it hurts profitability.""A Perspective On ProfitOverall, builder profit margins have improved from the abysmal losses"" they saw during the economic downturn, Denk says.Still, he adds, they're only about ""halfway back to healthy levels.""The year-over-year gross margins for homebuilders are declining from the ""cyclical peak levels"" seen in 2014, says Krapfel.""Home price appreciation is decelerating significantly and there has been rapid inflation in land costs in recent years,"" he said.While fuel costs are going down there's ""continued inflation"" in labor costs, Krapfel adds. He expects builders' gross margins to ""normalize"" from ""cyclical peak levels of 2014"" over the next two to three years.""We're seeing much more normalization of home prices and input costs,"" added Anderson. ""I wouldn't say costs are pressuring margins, but we're not enjoying the excess margins that we did when home prices were rising rapidly.""Toll Bros.' gross margin for Q1, excluding interest and write-downs, improved to 27.3% from 24.4%. But the company expects ""flat margins"" for the full-year 2015.Connor says the builder expects margins to be ""improved"" in 2016 as it will have some deliveries in New York City, which are very high margin, and it's seen an increase in sales the first four months of this year.

Those figures come as builders ramp up home construction from low-growth years.The median price is seen rising about 6% for all types of existing homes and 3% for new houses, in the National Association of Realtors' April outlook report.""Several markets remain highly competitive due to supply pressures, and Realtors are reporting severe shortages of move-in ready and available properties in lower price ranges,"" NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement Monday with the latest pending home sales report.""The return of first-time buyers this year will depend on how quickly inventory shows up in the market,"" he said.Following demand patterns, homebuilders the past few years have tended to tailor their price ranges toward move-up and luxury buyers, not first-timers, though some homebuilders have waded back into that market in anticipation of an eventual flock of first-timers.""First-time home buyers remain absent from the market, restricted by tight lending conditions,"" National Association of Home Builders Chief Economist David Crowe said in a data release in March.Low End Lifting?With demand rising at the low end of the market for existing homes, prices for distressed properties have been going up.Homebuyers — whether they're investors or first-timers looking for an affordable place — now get about a third off the price of a comparable nondistressed home, according to the latest estimate by RealtyTrac. But that's not as advantageous as the 40% off they got in September 2013, says Daren Blomquist, a RealtyTrac vice president.Real estate site Zillow (Z) predicted in December that 2015 would be a ""breakthrough year for first-time buyers "" amid rising rents. It predicted that the best markets for first-time buyers, based on a variety of factors, would be Pittsburgh; Hartford, Conn.; Chicago; Las Vegas and Atlanta.Builder Stocks In FocusBuilder stocks in IBD's Builders-Commercial/Residential industry group are up 8% collectively this year, and the group ranks No. 55 in performance among 197 groups tracked.Four stocks in the group hold an IBD Composite Rating above 90 (out of a possible 99) — Lennar (LEN), D.R. Horton (DHI), Standard Pacific (SPF) and Toll Bros. (TOL) The ratings are based on a variety of metrics from earnings growth to stock market performance.Toll and Meritage Homes (MTH) are among builders who've told IBD they're encouraged by the recent pace of sales. The spring selling season is a key period for homebuilders, when homebuyers come out from wherever they have been wintering to shop for a new place.The homebuilding industry faces profit-margin pressure this year amid potentially higher costs for lots and labor than during the lull years.Despite the higher sales forecast for new homes this year in the NAR's April outlook, 33.4% vs. 1.6% in 2013, housing starts are lagging so far this year. They fell in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 897,000 in a Census report, 3.3% below the year-earlier rate.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter: @IBD_DHowell.Related: Home Price Gains Follow Job Growth; Which Cities Rose?

1257,LEN,"Encouraged by recent financial results and prospects for the housing market to pick up from last year's slow going, some top builders are stepping up the pace of land buying.They'll have to pay more than they used to — in a year when several builders have warned they're facing profit-margin pressures — but they see the higher payments as the price of a rising housing market. And a handful of builder stocks are currently highly rated.Homebuilders such as Toll Bros. (TOL), Meritage Homes (MTH) and TRI Pointe Homes (TPH) are a few builders actively scouting out land.""We're pretty bullish on the housing market right now,"" TRI Pointe CEO Douglas Bauer told IBD. ""We just reported full-year 2014 and fourth-quarter results, and orders for the first two months of this year have improved significantly over 2014.""Bauer says that TRI Pointe will continue to be a ""significant player"" in the 10 markets where it builds and that it will keep growing organically in each of those markets.TRI Pointe operates in markets such as Northern and Southern California, Colorado and Arizona.Adds Frederick Cooper, senior vice president of finance at luxury homebuilder Toll Bros.: ""Speaking for Toll Bros., we are upbeat about the housing market. We just announced (first-quarter fiscal 2015) results, and our contracts were up 24% in value from the prior year.""An improving economy and more job creation are helping to drive up housing demand, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, told IBD.Yun forecasts that existing-home sales will rise 7% to 5.3 million units this year. He estimates that new-home sales could rise 30% to about 590,000. Yun says it would be up from ""depressed levels,"" but still below a ""normal level"" of 800,000.Morningstar analyst James Krapfel says that in the aggregate, homebuilders will increase their spending on land in 2015. He says that the trend is toward higher and higher land prices, which could put pressure on margins.""That's going to dissuade some builders from reaching their spending budgets,"" he said. ""It has become more difficult to underwrite land"" to ""acceptable"" margins.Added Brad Hunter, chief economist for real estate researcher and consulting firm Metrostudy, a Hanley Wood company, in an email: ""Many (homebuilders) are running low on their supply of lots bought (cheap) at the bottom. So margins will go down as they start using more recently bought lots that were a great deal more expensive. Lot prices shot up starting in 2011-2012. That will have a significant negative impact on profit per house.""Margin Pressure DebatedBut builders, which set ""target"" margins when underwriting land buys, say higher land prices don't necessarily mean margin pressure.""There is a common misconception that when land prices go up, builders' profit margins will be lower, but that's not necessarily true,"" said Meritage Homes spokesman Brent Anderson. ""Land prices normally go up because home prices are going up, allowing you to pay more without sacrificing margin.""And, he adds, home prices have been rising more than land prices over ""much"" of the last three years.Anderson says it's not that difficult to ""more than cover"" the higher price of land when the selling prices of homes are going up.""Once the selling price of homes levels out or starts declining, that's when margins get squeezed and have the potential to come down, potentially below your target level,"" he said. ""You might even lose money on that land.""Meritage Homes looks to earn a 20% gross margin.""Starting with the home prices (in a market), you can back into what you can afford to pay for the land,"" Anderson added.Bauer says TRI Pointe looks to underwrite land at a target gross margin range of 18% to 22%.""The rationale for buying any of our land in any marketplace is fairly consistent (with) our underwriting,"" he said.

1276,LEN,"Emerging from the recession, energy markets saw a robust real estate recovery as high oil prices ignited exploration and production investment in places like the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas and the Bakken in the Northern plains.Now oil's price plunge threatens to cap the recovery, particularly in cities like Houston, Oklahoma City and Williston, N.D.However, housing analysts such as the National Association of Realtors' Danielle Hale and Trulia's Jed Kolko expect potential slumps in home sales, prices and construction to be confined to energy markets.Largely based on expectations that a strong job market will induce millennials to become first-time homebuyers, the NAR projects that existing-home sales will climb 8% in 2015 and home prices 4% to 5%. It predicts that single-family home starts will jump 21%, and new-home sales 25%.""While uncertainty will have an effect on areas where the overall economy and jobs market are very tied to oil, there are enough areas that will benefit from lower oil prices,"" Hale said. ""So we're expecting the effect to be a wash nationally.""Outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas said Thursday that 38% of the nearly 104,000 U.S. job cuts in January and February were directly tied to oil, the price of which has dropped by about half since July. Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and Weatherford International (WFT) alone have all announced layoffs totaling thousands of workers in the last several weeks.The 1,267 drilling rigs operating nationwide at the end of February represented a 28% drop from a year earlier, according to oil service firm Baker Hughes (BHI), which is being acquired by Halliburton.""I'm bullish about every sector of the national economy that's not in oil and gas,"" said Mark Dotzour, chief economist for the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. ""I'm not bullish about the oil and gas impact on Houston, Oklahoma City and Williston.""Housing demand in energy markets has yet to crater, and weakness likely won't surface until late 2015 or in 2016, according to a recent report on energy markets by Trulia, recently acquired by Zillow (Z).In Oklahoma City, some 20,500 homes sold in 2014, a 6.7% rise over 2013, according to the Oklahoma City Area Association of Realtors, which lumps together single-family homes with half-duplexes, condos and patio homes. The median price at year-end was $150,000, about $6,000 higher than a year earlier. In Houston, single-family home sales increased 2.8% in 2014 and the median home price surged 10.6% to $199,000, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.Waiting For The WaveStill, executives at homebuilders Lennar (LEN), Beazer Homes USA (BZH) and D.R. Horton (DHI), which are active in Houston, anticipate some softness in the market, according to comments made during their respective earnings calls in January.Houston-based apartment developer Camden Property Trust (CPT) also projects a slowdown, particularly with 20,000 new apartments slated to open in Houston this year.Even so, its same-store annual revenue growth has averaged 8% over the past four years in the market, and executives expect it to fall only to the 20-year average of 3.4%, according to remarks on the company's earnings call in January. Unlike the oil bust in the 1980s, when Houston was more dependent on the energy industry, the area now boasts strong health care and port sectors, as well as significant refining and petrochemical industries, Dotzour says. He adds that potential homebuyers in careers that are tied to the energy industry, including attorneys and accountants, are in a ""wait-and-see mode.""""I think the unknown right now is, how will the people outside the oil and gas industry respond to the uncertainty in the energy business?"" Dotzour said. ""Will a cardiologist choose to delay buying a home just because three or four oil executives own homes in the neighborhood?""Falling oil prices failed to keep Houston office landlords from lifting rents 3.6% to $27.35 a square foot in 2014, even with 16.6 million square feet under construction, according to commercial property brokerage Transwestern.Between layoffs and firms looking to sublet unused office space, the area's average vacancy rate has likely ticked up 90 basis points from 10.2% at the end of 2014, says Kevin Roberts, president of Transwestern's Southwest operations.Transwestern predicts that Houston's vacancy rate will climb above 12% over the next two years. Office tenants and buyers are already starting to push for better deals, he says, but landlords are hardly panicking.""Everybody is looking for 2015 to be a little bouncy,"" he said. ""The good news is that the real estate is not financially impaired — tenants are pretty healthy and paying rent, and occupancies are still high.""Building Homes In The BakkenIn northwest North Dakota, Williston is ground zero for the Bakken oil formation and is in the midst of a severe housing shortage. The number of residents more than doubled to 29,595 from 2010 to 2014, and a 2014 Williston Economic Development report projected the city's population to approach 40,000 in 2017. Observers remain upbeat, given the steady environment.""Demand has tempered a bit, but for the most part it's still going strong,"" said Terry Metzler, operations manager for Casper, Wyo.-based Granite Peak Development, a land developer that entered the market in 2011.He acknowledges that apartment rents started to decline in the area, but he attributes most of it to an increase in supply.Developers applied for 422 single-family, multifamily and commercial property building permits valued at $435 million in 2014, up from 276 permits totaling $291 million in 2013, according to the Williston Area Home Builders Association.Among other projects, private equity firm KKR & Co. (KKR) and Denver-based Continuum Partners are developing the Ridge, a community of 1,537 single-family homes, apartments and town houses.Like real estate observers in other energy markets, Metzler hopes the oil price dip is temporary. He notes that as drilling has slowed, work at producing wells continues.""I don't think you're going to see the amount of apartments being built slow down that much,"" he added. ""If we see an extremely prolonged period of very low oil prices, we might see things change.""

"
1395,LEN,"""Management teams don't get rewarded for meeting expectations,"" Mian said. ""They get rewarded pretty handsomely for beating them.""Falling oil prices and a declining energy sector are expected to have dragged down corporate earnings in 2014's fourth quarter, but the overall picture for S&P 500 companies remains strong.The difference is remarkable: S&P 500 companies should average solid 4.2% Q4 profit growth. But when excluding energy firms, profits probably rose a brisk 7.2%.With both U.S. and Brent crude oil prices falling fast in Q4 — now below $50 per barrel, down about half since the summer — the S&P's energy sector is forecast to post poor fourth-quarter numbers, with an estimated 20% decline in earnings and a 14.2% drop in revenue expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That's a staggering decline from the 11.1% earnings growth analysts had predicted Oct. 1 for Q4.As a result, the overall S&P 500 earnings estimate of 4.2% growth in Q4 is the weakest since the third quarter of 2012. Revenue is expected to have grown a measly 1.3% overall in Q4 vs. 3.9% when excluding energy stocks.Picture Improves In 2015The trend looks similar as the picture improves in 2015. Analysts expect earnings to grow 5.2% in Q1 on revenue growth of 1.6%. Excluding energy, that growth would be 10.5% profit improvement on a 4.7% revenue hike.Energy companies are expected to post a 33% decline in Q1 earnings on a 16% drop in revenue.The year-end earnings reporting season moves into high gear with all of the big four banks and others disclosing data this week.""Really, the picture outside of (energy) is still pretty solid,"" said Gregory Harrison, a senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters. The growth is ""really much better than it appears at first.""Powered by biotech, health care companies are leading all industries with earnings up 17.4% and revenue growing 9.4% in Q4, the analysts estimate.One of the hottest leaders, Gilead (GILD), is expected to report profit up 298% on sales up 115%. Amgen (AMGN) apparently performed closer to the biotech norm, with profit estimated to have risen 7.5% on sales up 3.5%.Telecom Follows The LeaderTelecom profits come next, expected to have risen 13.8%, followed by utilities, up 11.2%; industrials, up 9.9%; and technology, up 8.9%.AT&T (T), with the second-largest market value among telecoms in the U.S., is expected to lag its sector with profit up 7.5% on sales rising 3.5% when it reports Q4.Those industrials include transportation, aerospace and defense contractors, expected to report 9.9% earnings growth on 2.4% better revenue as a group. Southwest Airlines (LUV) is one of the leaders, with earnings expected to grow 67%. Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) are forecast to grow earnings 12% and 38%, respectively.Making Tech Look GoodThe tech sector's 8.9% earnings growth looks good but not spectacular. Facebook (FB) alone is estimated to have grown Q4 EPS by 55% and revenue by 46%.Up next, the S&P's consumer discretionary sector is expected to post 7.9% earnings growth on 4% better revenue as cheaper gasoline means more money for consumers to spend elsewhere. These companies mostly serve U.S. consumers, who drive 70% of the economy.Consumer discretionary play Lowe's (LOW) is expected to post 39% earnings growth, while analysts estimate homebuilder Lennar (LEN) to have earned 32% more in Q4. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is expected to have earned 91% more than a year earlier.Financials, a powerhouse of growth in most recent years, with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) leading the way, appears to have flattened with forecast 1.3% growth in earnings on a 1.4% gain in revenue.Yet, for all the winners from cheaper oil, there are some non-winners that are difficult to call losers because they're still profitable, just less so.

1439,LEN,"When the National Association of Realtors begins tallying its 2015 study data on how much money international homebuyers spend in the U.S., one thing you can likely bet on is that China will widen its lead vs. the rest of the world.You can also expect a rise in the prices that foreign buyers pay, experts say, as well as more international investment outside of the usual gateway cities New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Washington, D.C.China will be the center of attention when the NAR starts tallying its 2015 survey, which spans the 12 months ending in March.Although Canada ranks first in terms of the number of purchases involving U.S. homes by international buyers, China took the lead in dollar volume a couple years ago and continues to expand its lead.It's not just the residential real estate market where China has become a top player. Chinese investors also have made a big move in commercial real estate developments such as office buildings, medical facilities and tech centers.""The investments from China are exponentially increasing each year in terms of real estate. It's very much a growing trend,"" said Scott Picken, founder and CEO of Wealth Migrate, an online global real estate investment marketplace.That's certainly been the case in terms of U.S. homes purchased by Chinese investors. The NAR estimates that Chinese investors spent about $22 billion on U.S. homes in its 2014 study (which covers the 12 months through March 2014), or roughly 24% of the total dollars spent by international buyers. It was up from $12.8 billion and 19% a year earlier in the 2013 study.Snowbirds Stock UpIn contrast, Canada ranked second in both dollars spent and market share. Its numbers were $13.8 billion and 15%, respectively, in the 2014 study vs. $11.8 billion and 17% in the 2013 study.China's lead in dollars spent should widen more when the NAR begins tallying 2015 study data this spring, says Jed Smith, the NAR's managing director for quantitative research. The group's yearly profile of international homebuying activity is usually published in June.""The country making the move up the ladder is China, and it has been moving up considerably. We expect that to continue,"" Smith told IBD. ""Canada is leading in terms of the number of transactions, but China is a close second.""In the number of transactions by international buyers, Canada ranked first in 2014 with 19% of the total vs. 16% for China. But Canada's lead is narrowing. In 2013, Canada accounted for 23% of total transactions vs. 12% for China.Why Chinese, Canadians BuyMany Canadians buy vacation or retirement homes in Florida and Arizona, Smith says. Those markets tend to be less pricey than the large urban markets that Chinese investors prefer — primarily Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, greater New York and Washington, D.C.Canadians often put down stakes for the long haul, but many Chinese investors take a shorter-term view.""The Chinese buy for a variety of reasons, and those reasons are increasing,"" Smith said. ""In addition to investment and diversification of assets, they are increasingly buying for educational reasons. Many are buying houses for kids who go to school here. They will rent out some of the rooms to others, then eventually sell the properties after the kids graduate.""The NAR notes that more than half of international homebuying activity in the U.S. is in five states: Florida, California, Arizona, Texas and New York. Arizona, Florida and Texas tend to draw the lion's share of Canadians and Latin Americans. New York and California draw the most Asians and Europeans.International buyers account for about 4% of all houses bought in the U.S. each year, Smith says, but 7% of the total value of the market.""They tend to buy upscale,"" he said. ""The overall market for international buyers is under $100 billion a year, but that's still a lot of money, and they buy about 200,000 houses — which is an awful lot .""The international customer base is particularly attractive for real estate firms with operations in big gateway cities — homebuilders such as Lennar (LEN), KB Home (KBH) and Toll Bros. (TOL), and commercial property firms such as CBRE Group (CBG) and Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).Smaller Cities Make The MapAt the same time, one of the recent trends — particularly in commercial real estate — is an influx of international cash into other cities, Wealth Migrate's Picken says.""America has been a major focus for individual players, and in the past they mainly tended to go to Tier 1 cities like New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami,"" he told IBD. ""But now we are seeing a lot of investments in other places — like Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Charlotte, Memphis, even Oklahoma.""There has also been a lot of investment in Detroit, Picken says, mainly because international investors can grab up some prime real estate at cheap prices. That's not the case in other markets, however.""The property values in many parts of America are back to where they were pre-crash,"" Picken said. ""But you are still seeing a rise in interest from international buyers because prices are still so much higher in places like London and Sydney than they are in the U.S. You can still get good value in America.""Medical buildings have become particularly popular among international investors because, he says, ""doctors don't move — you have a lot more stability in terms of leases.""In the residential market, the amount of money that international investors are spending reflects a rise in U.S. home prices. The median purchase price of U.S. homes by international buyers was $268,000 in the NAR's 2014 study. It was up from $226,000 the prior year. Smith expects another rise for 2015.""The preliminary indications are that the amount of international activity is about the same this year as last year. But prices are up, so that would impact the value ,"" he said.

Horton, which bills itself as ""America's Builder"" and is the largest in the group by annual revenue, will release first-quarter financial results Monday before the market opens.The consensus of analysts is for a 2-cent drop in earnings per share to 34 cents. Investors hope Horton can reverse that to a beat after missing analysts' EPS estimates the prior two quarters.Revenue is projected to rise 27.2% to $2.075 billion.D.R.

And Lennar said it expects lower profit margins this year amid rising costs.KB Home (KBH) also reported a revenue gain on Jan. 13, but EPS fell 9.7% and was half what Wall Street expected.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

1624,LEN,"Remember that new issue you bought awhile back this year when it was breaking out of a first-stage IPO base? Up 7% in heavy volume with solid fundamentals?A thing of beauty. But instead of rising even more, the stock reversed in higher volume. Then it fell again. And again. Before you knew it, you were sitting on an 8% loss just a few days after the breakout. What went wrong?It was the market.To boost your portfolio's performance immediately, invest only when the trend is upward and rising, not downward and falling.Major averages can show signs of distribution any time during a confirmed uptrend. When the selling intensifies, IBD's current outlook (see the Market Pulse today on B8) can quickly switch to ""Uptrend under pressure"" or even ""Market in correction,"" the time to be cautious, sell stocks and wait for better conditions.Never underestimate the 'M' in CAN SLIM. Just because it's the last letter in the acronym doesn't mean it carries the least importance. In fact, it's arguably the most important.You might be great at identifying names that have potential to be big market leaders, but if institutional investors are selling and major averages are going down, great stocks will have a difficult time making headway.How should you monitor the health of the broad market?Along the top of A1, you'll find a quick summary of the day's action. In the B section, the What's The Market Trend? page shows big daily charts of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq with key data. Keep tabs on the market's leading industry groups over the past six months and the day's top movers.The Big Picture, also on B8 today, guides investors through day-to-day market action, providing unique market commentary with a three-tiered market outlook scale: market in confirmed uptrend, uptrend under pressure, and market in correction. Money should be put to work in stocks during confirmed uptrends, while cash should be favored during market corrections.It can be scary when heavy selling starts to hit the major averages and the market enters into a corrective phase. Growth stocks tend to fall at least twice as much as the broad market, so it's important to keep them on a tight leash when selling starts to intensify.At the same time, it's also important to be ready when the market confirms a new uptrend with a follow-through day. Your confidence may not be high, but try to buy at least one stock. Get the vehicle in motion. If the follow-through day is strong, you'll gain more confidence and will be totally ready to scoop up more breakout opportunities.The market's latest follow-through day caught some market pros off guard, but it was a viable one on Oct. 21 when the Nasdaq soared 2.4% in higher volume on the fourth day of its rally attempt.Plenty of individual growth names were ready to participate. IBD 50 name NetEase (NTES) cleared a 91.16 buy point on the same day the Nasdaq followed through. It's been hitting new highs since then as shares remain under accumulation.Other names that started to move around the follow-through day include Lennar (LEN), Celgene (CELG), Apple (AAPL) and Boise Cascade (BCC) and SolarWinds (SWI).Lennar has proved itself the leader in IBD's home-building group. It's still holding comfortably above a 42.07 cup-with-handle buy point cleared last month.

That means they are allocating resources to areas with the best demand, such as certain markets in Texas, California, Florida and Georgia — Forsyth County north of Atlanta, for example.Single-family housing starts in some markets were up as much as 45.8% over the 12 months ending Sept. 30, says Metrostudy. That high mark was in Naples/Fort Myers in Southwest Florida.""It's a market that was badly beaten up during the downturn, but it's also a market with strong fundamentals,"" Hunter said.Besides being a retirement and second-home magnet for affluent buyers, the area has a university, growing middle class and job growth, he says.""Wealthy people need estate planning, lawyers, accountants, bankers and medical care. There's a very large medical industry there,"" Hunter said.Top homebuilders in the Naples/Fort Myers market are PulteGroup's (PHM) active-adult division Del Webb, Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI), according to a survey by drive-by teams from Metrostudy.Existing-home prices in the region's Lee County are back to early 2004 levels and new homes are mostly in the $300,000 to $400,000 range, Hunter says.Home construction in Southern California is up 28.4% in the same recent 12-month period, Metrostudy says, with the greatest gains in another bruised area, the Inland Empire east of Los Angeles.""All the excess supply is gone,"" Hunter said of the Inland Empire's Riverside-San Bernardino area near the I-15 corridor flanking L.A. ""That area turned around from being massively overbuilt and with falling prices to coming back strong and prices moving up.""The top two builders in that market are KB Home (KBH) and Lennar, according to Metrostudy.Lennar is also active in other parts of California and in Texas, including Houston, which is the No. 1 market for housing starts.Still, Stuart Miller, CEO of Lennar, believes the housing market is far from recovered. In remarks after the firm's latest quarterly results were released, he compared the ""extremely low volume of dwellings"" built over the past seven years to a housing depression.""Before this downturn, anything below 1 million housing starts in a year was considered almost a housing depression,"" he said. ""This recovery is just now getting us back to that level of starts.""The recovery is still only at the ""halfway"" mark back to normal, says David Crowe, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders. He was referring largely to single-family homes, which he said comprises the bulk of the home-building industry.""This is a much slower recovery (than) from any of the recessions since the Great Depression,"" Crowe said.However, multifamily construction, mostly rental apartments, is back to normal as builders try to satisfy demand from millennials and others who can't afford or don't want to buy a home just yet.""A normal market would be at least 1.5 million housing starts (annually),"" said Piegza. ""We were down to 500,000 (in 2009) and it took five years to make progress up to 1 million. Given that trajectory, it would be five-plus years to get to 1.5 million, when we can say it's a healthy market.""Overall housing starts in October were pacing at an annualized rate of a little over 1 million units, 2.8% below the revised September estimate but 7.8% above October 2013, the Census Bureau said last week.Crowe of the builders' trade group thinks a back-to-normal builders' market will occur sooner, in 2017. There would have to be a lot of fast catching-up.Crowe thinks single-family home starts will increase next year to around 800,000, from an expected 640,000 this year. If that comes to fruition, it would be the best gain since the recession ended.New-Home Sales Rise SlowlyActual sales of new single-family homes tracked at an annualized pace of 458,000 in October, the Census Bureau said Wednesday. That is just 0.7% above September's revised rate and 1.8% above the 450,000 seen in October 2013.""The low was about 350,000, so we haven't made much progress in terms of home sales,"" Piegza said.Like other housing watchers, she blames the usual suspects: strict lending, slow wage growth and low numbers of first-time homebuyers, due in part to millennials being dragged down by student debt and low wages.""It comes back to the ability to finance, access to credit and being able to put 20% down,"" she said. ""Credit is looser, but it is still tight.""Toll Bros. (TOL), which targets the luxury market, is not as impacted by credit challenges as builders with lots of entry-level products. Its buyers typically put 30% down, and 20% pay all cash, Hunter says, ""so they are somewhat insulated from these mortgage issues these days.""October's median price of a new house rose to $305,000 in October from $264,300 a year earlier, the Census Bureau said. That gain ""reinforces our view that move-up and luxury buyers remain the most eligible buyer in the U.S. market,"" noted analyst Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee.As for existing homes, pending sales fell modestly in October, according to the National Association of Realtors' Pending Home Sales Index, which is based on contract signings. The index fell 1.1% to 104.1 from 105.3 in September. Anything above 100 is viewed as an average level of contract activity.Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, noted less competition from investors paying all cash.The median price for an existing home of any type in October rose 5.5% from a year earlier to $208,300. Last year through October the average month's year-over-year gain was 11.5%, the NAR says.Price gains, moderating though they are, give previously stuck homeowners with little or no equity ""the ability to sell,"" Yun noted. And when an existing home sells, oftentimes the seller will move into a newly built home.

"
1628,LEN,"As Investor's Corner begins a long series of columns on sell rules, none is perhaps more definitive or more frequently discussed in IBD than the 7% or 8% sell rule.It is the cardinal rule of selling. It is easy to understand and to apply, and it has proven its worth over the years.If you don't know it by now, the rule says to sell all your shares of a stock if it falls 7% or 8% below the price at which you bought it. That should be the largest loss you should ever accept on any investment — big or small. When the market is weak, consider cutting losses at even less — say, 4%.This is a sell rule, but you should also consider it a portfolio-management rule. That's because keeping losses short and manageable is one of the most important lessons about investing.By keeping losses small, you can afford to take several hits and more than make up for them with gains in other stocks of 20% to 25%, sometimes more.A combination of small losses and solid profits will keep you ahead, even when your flops outnumber your wins.The Math Behind Stock LossesCutting losses short also makes practical sense, if you do the math.Say you bought XYZ Inc. at 55 a share. When the stock falls 6%, shares are at 51.70. To get XYZ shares back to the level where you bought them would take a rebound of 6.4% — not so insurmountable.If you let the loss grow to 15%, it would take a 17.6% rebound to get back to break-even.With a 25% loss, you're looking (hoping, probably) for a bounce of 33.3% to win back your losses. The bigger the hole, the more it takes to recover.And for a stock to make up a 33% drop — which requires a 50% gain — is asking a lot.The 8% point sounds arbitrary, but it really isn't. Research has shown that leading stocks, when purchased at the proper buy point, rarely fall more than 8% from their entries.Of course, sometimes they do fall more than 8% and bounce back. What then? You may feel foolish for letting go of a stock that ends up being profitable. But you should not feel bad for being disciplined.One option is to buy the stock again after it wins back the buy point in heavy trading. Make sure the market is in a healthy uptrend. Use The Big Picture every day (today, it's on B3) to confirm the market's trend.Move OnMore often, though, it pays to just walk away and find another opportunity.Last year, homebuilding stocks were coming back as the housing market improved. Lennar (LEN) formed a couple of bases. A breakout March 20 past a 43.32 cup entry quickly fell apart.Investors got another shot at the stock a couple of months later, when it cleared a narrow cup without handle (1). Again, the breakout fizzled quickly. By May 29, the stock was 8% below the 44 new buy point (2). It was time to sell. There would be no recovery in the stock for many months.All the while, the general market was trending higher, generating better opportunities for investors.

The S&P/Case-Shiller index softened to a 10.8% yearly rise in April, down from 12.4%, a positive sign in a market that has wrestled with affordability.The latest data follow Monday's National Association of Realtors report, which found that existing-home sales rose 4.9% to an annualized 4.89 million in May, marking the first stretch of back-to-back gains in a year.U.S. stocks initially rallied on the strong housing data but reversed lower amid ongoing Mideast violence. Homebuilders held on to some of their gains. Lennar (LEN), which reports earnings Thursday, rose 1%.Inventory Building UpHigher prices are among the headwinds suppressing demand for homes. Mortgage rates shot up a full point last summer after the Federal Reserve suggested that interest rates would soon shift higher.At the same time, banks facing uncertain regulations have been more reluctant to extend credit, especially to would-be first-time buyers with low salaries and high student-loan debt.While a combination of factors conspired against housing in 2013 and the first half of 2014, rising inventory will be key to jump-starting the market, said Stephanie Karol, an economist with IHS (IHS) Global Insight.The supply of new and existing homes has remained well below long-term averages, but the number of new homes for sale has risen by double digits on the year for five straight months.""Housing is often a perfect storm of the exact right or wrong conditions,"" Karol said.Zillow chief economist Stan Humphries says that the real estate site has seen a 12% increase in listings over the past year.More inventory is a positive signal, he notes, because it shows that builders are increasingly willing to take a chance on ramping up new construction. It also reflects market psychology, as homeowners who previously sat on the sidelines while prices soared may now be induced to sell as prices come back to earth.""We're still 5-6 innings into the game, seeing a real shift from a fast-paced recovery that created enormous price spikes to one which is a more normal recovery driven by increases in household formation and income growth,"" Humphries said. ""That type of recovery is slower but more sustainable.""Though most signs show the economy brightening, it has lacked several ingredients that would propel a more robust housing recovery. Wages have stagnated and are barely keeping up with inflation. And while job gains have topped 200,000 for 4 straight months, most new jobs have been in low-wage sectors.Those factors are suppressing household formation and pushing young people increasingly to rent rather than buy, Humphries says.Investors or other all-cash buyers have accounted for a disproportionate share of purchases for several years — some 38.7% in March, according to CoreLogic, down from 41% a year ago but still well above the 25% share seen in a normal market. Analysts worry that all-cash buyers are crowding out other buyers.Those factors make mortgage credit availability even more important, Karol says. She's hopeful that lenders will grow comfortable with new regulations.""We think we're going to continue to see the recovery proceed,"" she said. ""It's not going to be as fast as we thought this time last year, but we have a positive outlook.""

1669,LEN,"The younger crowd may be skittish about moving into the housing market due to sparse financial resources and lack of credit.But it's a different story for Americans age 55 and over. Those who can are jumping into homebuying — selling their existing houses to move into new ones aimed at their age group. Many are at or near retirement, while others are seeking a change in lifestyle — and at this age they can have financial flexibility.Some have reaped hefty gains from the stock market, adding to a nest egg saved over the years. Rising home values in the housing recovery have also given more of them the ability to finally sell, at an appreciated price or at least one that can cover the mortgage.Top homebuilders such as PulteGroup (PHM), Lennar (LEN) and Toll Bros. (TOL) report brisk sales for their active-adult homes and homes that appeal to the 55-plus crowd.Take PulteGroup, which builds the Del Webb brand of active adult communities for adults 55 and over.""Consistent with the overall housing market, we have seen sustained improvement in demand for our active adult homes for the past two-plus years,"" PulteGroup spokesman James Zeumer told IBD via email.Signing Up SalesThe company's active-adult sales lifted from roughly 4,100 homes in 2011 to about 5,300 in 2013. Zeumer says the recovery in active-adult home demand continued into 2014. Sign-ups in the first quarter were up 7% and in the second quarter they rose 11% over a year earlier.One gauge of demand in the single-family 55-plus housing market is the National Association of Home Builders 55+ Housing Market Index. In the second quarter the index increased three points from a year earlier to a level of 56. That's the highest second-quarter reading since the inception of the index in 2008 and the 11th straight quarter of year-over-year improvements.The prognosis for homebuying across all age groups looks improved this summer with Thursday's release of July data on contracts signed to buy existing homes, and that could further bolster the 55-plus group's prospects to sell their old homes.The pending home sales index rose 3.3% from June on a seasonally adjusted basis, though down 2.1% from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported. It's at the highest level since last August and at 105.9 is above the level of 100 considered an average activity level.""One of the factors contributing to the positive signs in the 55+ housing market is the slow but steady increase in existing-home sales in the last three months,"" said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe in a press release. ""The 55+ market is strongly driven by consumers being able to sell their existing homes at a favorable price in order to buy or rent in a 55+ community.""Domino Effect AppliesAdds NAHB Director of Economic Services Stephen Melman: ""The best thing that could happen for new construction is that the existing-home market improves. Every prospective buyer, like the age 55-plus buyer, has to sell their existing home before they buy a new one. The real key (to the index rise) was the existing-home market.""Total existing-home sales lifted 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.15 million in July, according to the NAR. Sales notched their highest pace of 2014 and have risen four straight months. But they remain 4.3% below the 5.38 million-unit level last July, the peak of 2013. ""Existing-home sales are continuing to move up,"" said Melman. ""But the one caveat is the first-time homebuyer's share (of those sales) was less than 29%. Typically that would be 40%. So existing-home sales are increasing, but the first-time buyer isn't in there full tilt. So it may be the 55-plus (group) buying homes that meet their demand.""Sales of new single-family homes fell 2.4% monthly in July, the Commerce Department reported Monday. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales, at 412,000, marked the lowest level since March, although it was a 12.3% rise from last July.Demand for new homes by the 55-plus age group is on the rise.Toll Bros. Active Living is the luxury homebuilders' active-adult division, with single-family homes, condos and town houses. As of April 2014, it accounted for 8% of the company's revenue, says Toll Bros. Group President Chris Gaffney. He says all of Toll Bros.' homebuyers, including the 55 and over active adult group, have been motivated to buy in the past year or so.""During this recent downturn, so many people were out of the buying market,"" Gaffney told IBD. ""Now, they've seen their portfolios grow again, and they're extremely interested in making a move because interest rates are still fabulous.""Gaffney says there's ""plenty of pent-up demand"" on part of the active adult buyers following a pullback during the recession, and the ""affordability index is quite high when you look at history.""These older buyers, he adds, have gotten ""tired of putting their lives"" on hold in the wake of the recession. "" Generally these folks are extremely savvy and successful, they have tremendous FICO (credit) scores, they've built up their portfolios over the years and understand exactly what they want with their lifestyle and what they're looking to do as they move forward in life. .""Melman said by email: ""The stronger 55+ market could be put in context of the overall strength of the trade-up market/higher-income buyers, except this group is focused not on larger homes but new homes better designed for their needs. As existing sales slowly increase, more people who put plans on hold can now sell their existing home to finance what they really want for the next ten or twenty years: quality design, low maintenance, accommodations for family.""Homes Built To FitMajor homebuilders are luring this group with a raft of amenities.Besides its active adult communities, Lennar offers an option for multigenerational families living under one roof. The ""Next Gen"" home within a home features a suite with a separate private entrance, bedroom, bathroom, laundry, eat-in kitchenette and living room.Jeff Roos, Western regional president for Lennar, says many buyers want to let their children live in the suite. Since it started making these homes available at the end of 2011, Lennar has sold over 2,000. It has 120 Next Gen communities and more than 50 floor-plan options.""The Next Gen is growing every day as we expand across the country,"" Roos told IBD. ""This is the first time a homebuilder came out with a great solution for a multigenerational home. It's the first time (the different generations) can live together, but independently. We're seeing a big movement toward it. Our reception to the product has far exceeded our expectations.""Zeumer calls Del Webb homes ""perfect for empty-nesters who may be looking to downsize, but not necessarily downgrade the features and finishings of their next home.""Options can include big garages, flex spaces, wet bars, hearth rooms, raised dishwashers and sunrooms.

Revenue climbed 53% to $1.06 billion, also above consensus.The top line was helped by a 12% year-over-year rise in the average price of homes delivered, to $732,000. Unit deliveries gained 36% to 1,444 units.Toll's focus on higher-priced homes has helped it weather recent housing challenges better than builders that specialize in first-time or midpriced homes.Rising home valuations have hurt sales of many lower-priced homes, even as mortgage rates fall back down to their lowest levels in more than a year. Some builders, including D.R. Horton, have had to offer discounts in certain markets to increase sales. Those issues are not a big problem in the upper end of the housing market.""High-end buyers have the financial wherewithal to make those transactions, and they also feel much more confident because the stock market is doing well,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.Toll CEO Douglas Yearley said that he was ""encouraged"" by August's 19% year-over-year gain in traffic per community. But analyst Rehaut noted that contracts fell 4% per community .

1718,LEN,"CEO Leonard Schleifer makes sure that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is all about the study of drugs.That wide view of science has worked wonders the past three decades for Regeneron (REGN).But the philosophy sparked contention early in the biotech firm's publicly traded life.Its board and advisers debated whether Schleifer's long-range building toward a blockbuster drug would drag on too long.Those officials wanted Regeneron to focus strictly on one opportunity and get a magic drug to market as soon as possible.Schleifer, who had founded the company in 1988, said no. He knew that his overall pharmacology approach would pay off.And it has. Regeneron's 2013 sales hit $2.1 billion. And since the company's IPO in April 1991, the stock is up about 1,300%.The stock turned even healthier Wednesday, with shares leaping 6% after the Food and Drug Administration approved its flagship drug Eylea to treat diabetic macular edema (DME), a leading cause of blindness.Eylea was initially approved in November 2011 to treat age-related wet macular degeneration. Now it's in the thick of a DME market that's potentially lucrative for Regeneron due to the global diabetes epidemic.Enlightened Path""Our formula is surprisingly easy to articulate but difficult to emulate,"" Schleifer told IBD. ""We set out to have the world's best science and follow that science. That's what we've done for the past 25 years.""Schleifer, 62, started on his path to pharmaceutical success while growing up in Queens, N.Y.He went to Forest Hills High School where he was captain of the tennis team. He was also a junior New York state chess champion.Schleifer got his work ethic from his father, a Depression-era sweater maker born to poor immigrants in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. ""His advice was that I should get as well-educated as possible, because he believed that education was the weapon to fight the world with,"" the son recalls.Schleifer honed that weapon by attending his dad's alma mater, Cornell University. To save his family money, Len finished in three years. He earned a bachelor's degree in neurobiology and behavior, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1973.Schleifer then went to the University of Virginia for doctorates in medicine and pharmacology.While at UVA, Schleifer studied under Alfred Gilman, who would share the 1994 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with Martin Rodbell. Schleifer watched Gilman do the research that led to his Nobel Prize, calling it ""enormously inspiring.""After being trained as a scientist and clinician, Schleifer returned to the Cornell system to work as a neurologist and junior faculty member at Cornell's New York Hospital.It was there that he became fascinated with the biotech revolution — while reading stacks of paper from Genentech, an industry leader before folding into Roche in 2009. ""I was trained as a biochemist, but I had an interest in molecular biology,"" Schleifer said.Genentech was a pioneer in DNA technology, but as Schleifer pondered going into business on his own, he aimed for another path: diseases of the nervous system.The business would be Regeneron Pharmaceuticals — named for regenerating nerve cells — with headquarters in Tarrytown, just north of New York City.With help from Gilman, Schleifer contacted top minds in the biotech field to lead him to the right people for Regeneron's 1988 start.Two early mentors were Roy Vagelos and George Yancopoulos.Roy Vagelos has held the chairmanship at Regeneron since 1995. He came over from Merck (MRK), where he was one of the greatest CEOs in American history, according to Schleifer.Yancopoulos is Regeneron's chief scientific officer.Schleifer recruited him in 1989 from Columbia University, where Yancopoulos led research in molecular immunology — and now is a star. Yancopoulos is the principal inventor of Eylea and most of the drugs in Regeneron's pipeline.Schleifer lauds him: ""He's one of the greatest scientists and entrepreneurs of his generation.""Joining Regeneron wasn't a hard decision for Yancopoulos. ""I really believed in Len and what he was trying to do,"" he said. ""I knew he was doing it for the right reasons.""Such talent around Schleifer is a key to Regeneron's drug and revenue generation.""We decided to build a company where we not only valued the science but also the scientists who did the science,"" Schleifer said.He likes to point out that he works for Yancopoulos, not the other way around.Tough StartThe early going for Regeneron was filled with adversity. The firm developed a protein in the early 1990s to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis — Lou Gehrig's disease — but patients lost too much weight as a side effect. The company halted trials in 1993.Then Regeneron's obesity drug never made it past the FDA. ""Failure in our business is just part and parcel, but it never really changed our view that we were on the right track,"" Schleifer said. ""Great successes in life come from failure.""Regeneron's first approved drug was Arcalyst in 2008. The drug, to treat a rare genetic disease, was widely considered a success inside the walls of Regeneron.But analysts weren't impressed with a drug that cost about $200 million to develop and wasn't contributing meaningfully to the bottom line.Arcalyst did just $3 million in sales in the first quarter, but the science behind the drug has been critical to further drug development at Regeneron. ""Wall Street missed the whole point,"" Yancopoulos said. ""We were building a company with an infrastructure, technologies and capabilities to not only innovate once but repeat it over and over again with new drugs in new therapeutic areas.""Opening The WayPipeline prospects are bright for alirocumab, an antibody for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, called bad cholesterol because it collects in the walls of blood vessels, causing blockages.On Wednesday, Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY) reported positive phase three results for alirocumab.Phase three trials for Regeneron's rheumatoid arthritis drug sarilumab are showing progress.Then there's dupilumab, in clinical trials for asthma and other diseases. Along with that late-stage production is Regeneron's early-stage pipeline, growing with 15 antibodies in the company's labs.""We have what some consider to be the most enviable pipeline in the industry, and it's all home-grown,"" Yancopoulos said.Meanwhile, Regeneron has stayed with Sanofi. The French firm recently raised its stake in Regeneron to 22.5% from 20.5%. Sanofi has the right to own to up to 30% of Schleifer's company.Regeneron also recently embarked on a research and development initiative with Avalanche Biotechnologies (AAVL) to develop next-generation gene therapy products in ophthalmology, a branch of medicine concerned with treating disorders of the eye.In its initial public offering Thursday, Avalanche went the opposite direction of what its name implies, gushing 60% in early trade.What about buying another company? ""Acquisitions don't give us a competitive advantage,"" Schleifer said. ""Our competitive advantage is our science.""Yancopoulos also weighed in on acquisitions, using a sports metaphor: ""A baseball team that spends a lot of money on an older free agent doesn't have a farm system. We believe in building internally using our farm system. We're producing prize prospects left and right.""On the personal side, Schleifer will celebrate 40 years of marriage with his wife, Harriet, in December. They live in New York and have two sons. He said that when it comes to recreation, he's into golf, chess and ""an occasional poker game with good friends.""Persistence has paid off for the CEO, and other personality traits have also helped.""I have an exaggerated sense of fairness that has allowed me to value the true value creators in a company like Regeneron,"" he said. ""This, combined with my overall optimistic nature, has allowed me to stay true to my conviction that talent at Regeneron will succeed over the long haul.""

"
1740,LEN,"Now that it has leapfrogged up the ranks of homebuilders for a coast-to-coast scope, TRI Pointe Homes wants to become the poster child for a new kind of builder.Call it a hybrid: a cross between a publicly traded builder with a national presence and a small, regional builder with local connections, says CEO Doug Bauer.Monday's $2.8 billion merger with the homebuilding division of timber giant Weyerhaeuser (WY) gave Irvine, Calif.-based TRI Pointe Homes (TPH) five new regional homebuilding brands, with operations stretching to the East Coast.The deal enabled Weyerhaeuser, a real estate investment trust (REIT), to focus on its core timberland and wood-product business.Bauer says that the acquisition positions the company for the housing recovery in some of the nation's most attractive housing markets — in areas such as Southern California, Texas hot spots Houston and Austin, Arizona and around Washington, D.C. And he expects to build a whole new business template.""The big guys have deep pockets, and the regional guys are a little more nimble,"" he told IBD. ""The new vision for TRI Pointe is what I call the next generation of homebuilder, a family of regional homebuilding companies.""You maximize your income by running a local business at a regional level, but you have the deep pockets, economies of scale and (financial) sophistication of a public company. It's the best of both worlds.""Investors seem skeptical of the deal. TRI Pointe stock fell 1.7% Wednesday. And Thursday, shares fell 3% intraday to around 15.TRI Pointe hasn't traded above its January 2013 IPO price of 17 since late May.Stock Market HopscotchUntil the Reverse Morris Trust merger closed on Monday, TRI Pointe had been one of the smaller publicly traded builders in the U.S.It operated in just two states, California and Colorado, and had 3,000 developable lots, though that was up from virtually nothing in 2009, when Bauer and his partners started the firm from scratch.Now it has more than 30,000 lots, a market capitalization lifted from just over $500 million to $2.6 billion and 900 employees, up from 150.The five new homebuilding companies from Weyerhaeuser include Pardee Homes in Southern California and southern Nevada, Quadrant Homes in Washington state, Maracay Homes in Arizona, Trendmaker Homes in Houston, and Winchester Homes in Richmond, Va.Bauer plans to keep the company names and management teams.""My job is to steer this family of homebuilders to generate results as a pure homebuilder vs. being part of a REIT,"" he said.Under the REIT structure, he says, returns from homebuilding operations often were plowed back into the parent company for general operations. Much of the profits were returned to shareholders.But the deal has a potential downside: more inventory than Bauer wanted.Having learned the pitfalls of being stuck with too much in a downturn when he worked for California builder William Lyon Homes (WLH), Bauer had vowed to keep inventory down to no more than three years' worth.Now inventory is at nine years, due in large part to Pardee Homes in California.""I've adjusted my horizon to five years (inventory),"" Bauer said, adding that he thinks it'll take about three years to achieve.""We're going to focus on project sizes of no more than 500 units so we can build and sell them in 36 to 48 months,"" he said. ""That will allow us to weather the ups and downs of the housing business.""As for further expansion, he puts Texas at the top of the list near-term, using the new Houston homebuilding operation as a springboard.""In the short run, probably the closest market I'd like to focus in on is Austin, to the northwest of Houston,"" Bauer said.He says that the new TRI Pointe is comparable in size to such builders as Standard Pacific Homes (SPF), Ryland Group (RYL) and Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC), which also went public last year. Like TRI Pointe, those builders have struggled in the stock market and have low Relative Strength Ratings from IBD.TRI Pointe will also compete in many of its markets with Lennar (LEN), the No. 1 homebuilder in the country by market cap.

Consumer confidence data out Tuesday from the Conference Board touched a 6-year high, but fewer people said they planned to buy a home in March than in February and in most of 2013.That hesitation is likely due to rate concerns, said Russell Price, senior economist for Ameriprise Financial. Yet he thinks that once the spring buying season kicks into high gear, the specter of higher rates and the expectation of rising prices may motivate prospective buyers.""Look to the spring to tell the tale of the housing sector,"" Brown said. Housing and the overall economy lost some steam in the winter, he said. ""The next couple of months are going to be critical.""Builders may be key to getting some of that mojo back. The Na tional Association of Home Builders' sentiment gauge plunged into contraction territory in February and stayed there in March. Builders continue to cite multiple constraints, from a shortage of labor to a slower supply chain.""This was never going to be a quick recovery,"" Brown said. ""It could be many, many years before we get back to normal.""In a research note, IHS Global Insight economists noted that homebuilders have had to contend with construction prices that accelerated every month.""However, the price of lumber has been retreating in year-on-year terms, which should give builders the wiggle room they need to raise wages,"" the economists noted.Tight inventory is dampening the market by driving prices to unsustainably high gains. Price thinks housing will return to normal once appreciation settles around 5%. All the pieces are in place for builders to start supplying more inventory, he added.Pre-downturn supply has been absorbed and builders are below the sustainable rate based on normal demographic trends.""There's a lot of upside for new construction,"" he said.Homebuilder stocks, hard hit in recent weeks, mostly fell modestly Tuesday, including Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH).

1854,LEN,"Residential building started 2014 on stronger financial footing than recent years, fueled by the ongoing recovery in the housing market, according to private company data from Sageworks.In a preliminary analysis of financial statements for the 12 months that ended in January, Sageworks found that private residential construction companies' sales and profits remained healthy, as did other key financial fundamentals such as liquidity ratios. The report includes data from general contractors, builders and design-build firms.Profitability continued to strengthen from the last couple of years. Residential construction companies, on average, had a hefty 7.4% net profit margin for the 12-month period, up from 3.6% margins in 2012, according to the data released Tuesday.After seeing some steep declines during the housing bust, the firms regained some sales momentum in the last two years as the market and economy have improved. In the last 12 months, sales for residential construction companies increased about 14%, on average, which is close to the 15% percent growth of 2012 and up from the 2% growth averaged over the last five years.Liquidity ratios were also healthy in 2013. The debt-service coverage ratio, which shows a firm's ongoing ability to repay both principal and interest on loans, was 4.39, on average — the highest since 2006.Many of the nation's top public builders also started the year posting healthy sales and profit gains.Lennar (LEN), the largest homebuilder by market cap, saw earnings surge 150% from a year earlier to 35 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, which ended in February.

1894,LEN,"Sales agents at Main Street Realtors in Long Beach, Calif., didn't enjoy the usual postholiday downtime. But they aren't complaining.""On January 2 the phones started ringing again,"" said Geoff McIntosh, managing broker and co-owner of the agency in the Pacific Coastal city south of Los Angeles.And they've kept on ringing.""We continue to see an extremely active marketplace,"" he said. ""We've had a lot of pent-up demand and incredibly short inventory.""What's called the spring homebuying season, typically the busiest of the year, is now under way — if not yet in full swing everywhere in the U.S. It typically lasts from February through the end of May, though spring doesn't officially begin till March.But in many markets — especially those untouched by polar-vortex woes — it's just as strong as last year's sizzling selling season, when ultralow mortgage rates had yet to creep up much.""We seem to have the same number of buyers,"" McIntosh said. ""We just don't have enough inventory to sell to them.""Activity is brisk in many markets around the U.S., including several in California, Florida and even freezing New York City.""Last year was very strong, almost historic,"" said Steve James, president of the Manhattan Brokerage division of Douglas Elliman Real Estate. ""Looking at the first couple of months of signed contracts this year, we're basically almost parallel to last year.""Even with expected new development this year in New York, ""prices will continue to go up because of the low inventory,"" he said.While inventory remains tight in many markets, helping lift prices if not the number of sales, it's seen improving as sellers decide to list as buyers adjust to higher rates, but before rates go up too much.""Fear of higher interest rates is motivating people to buy now,"" said Andrew Barbar, a broker with Keller Williams Realty Services in Boca Raton, Fla., and president-elect of Florida Realtors.Mortgage rates are expected to hit 5% or more by the end of the year. That's still low by historical standards, but well above the 3.4% early last year.Total housing inventory in the U.S. at the end of January rose 2.2% to 1.90 million homes, representing a still-tight 4.9-months supply at the current sales pace, said the National Association of Realtors. A supply of 6 to 6.5 months represents a balanced market.January's Pending Homes Sales Index for the U.S., a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, comes out Friday. It fell 8.7% in December from November, due in part to abnormal weather, and was 8.8% below the year-earlier period.Getting a jump on Friday's pending home sales report, the California Association of Realtors said Wednesday that its pending home sales index vaulted 22.9% in January from December, based on signed contracts. That reversed a two-month decline. Pending sales in California were still down 17.5% from the previous January, but the CAR noted that statewide housing inventory was slowly improving as more sellers listed their homes.""We're starting to see a turning point in the market as we approach the spring homebuying season,"" stated CAR President Kevin Brown.Frigid temperatures in recent months in parts of the U.S. have been tied to the polar vortex weather system. But warm-weather markets can't blame the polar vortex for housing woes. South Florida's busiest housing season starts earlier than most, in January, when visitors flock to the area during the so-called ""high season"" from January to March. Many check out properties while they're there.""We're in a sellers market. If it's priced right, it will get multiple offers,"" Barbar said of the South Florida market now.January closings in the tri-county region from Miami-Dade to Palm Beach counties were up 20% over January 2013, Barbar says.""We're expecting February to show continued strength in demand,"" he said.There are fewer investors in the market as prices have gone up, meaning less competition for buyers who intend to live in their homes full-time or part-time.Florida's statewide new listings for single-family homes rose 13.8% in January vs. a year ago and were up 7.4% for townhomes/condos.Unusually severe winter weather across other parts of the country likely impacted home sales into February, especially where driving is essential.NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun commented last week that ""some housing activity will be delayed until spring"" because of ""disruptive and prolonged weather patterns across the country.""Purchase applications for loans for the week ending Feb. 21 fell 4% from the week prior on an adjusted basis to the lowest level since 1995, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported this week.""This is the time of year we would expect a significant pickup in purchase activity, and we are not yet seeing it,"" stated Mike Fratantoni, MBA's chief economist.Construction and sales bounce back at least partially in the month after bad weather ends, says Jed Kolko, chief economist with real estate web site Trulia (TRLA).""But with this harsh February weather so far, that bounceback might not come until March,"" he said in a recent email.He noted that the polar vortex hit hardest in regions with less housing activity, the Northeast and Midwest. The South and West account for 76% of new-home starts and 64% of existing home sales, he said.January new-home sales jumped 9.6% from December, the government said Wednesday. It was the fastest pace since July 2008. At month's end, an estimated 184,000 new homes were for sale, a supply of 4.7 months, down from 5 months at the end of December.Homebuilder Lennar (LEN), which builds in many warm-weather markets such as California and Florida, said in its quarterly report early this month that it expects a strong spring selling season.The spring homebuying season still faces challenges. Luxury builder Toll Bros. (TOL), skewed to markets hit hard by winter storms, reported a 6% drop in orders in its first quarter ending Jan. 31 and trimmed the top end of its 2014 delivery forecast.Construction of new homes, a much smaller portion of the overall housing market, is still far below normal levels.Tight credit, limited inventory, and higher prices and mortgage rates ""will hinder home sales activity until the positive factors of job growth and new supply from higher housing starts begin to make an impact,"" Yun said in an NAR report.

1898,LEN,"As mortgage rates rise, subprime loan products are expected to creep back into the lending mix in a more meaningful way.And that could be a catalyst for homebuilders with high exposure to entry-level buyers, said Sterne Agee analyst Jay McCanless in a research note this week.He says KB Home (KBH) may be the ""best positioned"" of homebuilders to benefit from the returning product, which all but vanished after the housing market crashed.Not only does KB Home cater to first-time buyers, it already has a relationship with mortgage servicer Nationstar Mortgage (NSM), which is one of the companies seen growing subprime product. Another emerging player: Wells Fargo (WFC).Other builders that should benefit from greater availability of subprime credit are D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), Beazer Homes (BZH), and MDC Holdings (MDC), McCanless said, noting that entry-level homes account for 40% or more of their sales mix.Los Angeles-based KB Home has long targeted first-time buyers. But as tight credit shut many would-be first-timers out of the market in the last few years, the company has been shifting into the move-up market more. Builders' shift to higher-priced product has left holes in the entry market.""We have many first-time buyers who are trying to find a foothold in the market,"" said Geoff McIntosh, co-owner of Main Street Realtors in Long Beach, Calif., which is south of Los Angeles. But supply is tight and new construction in the entry-level market on the coast is ""insignificant,"" he added.Entry-level buyers made up just 26% of existing home sales nationwide in January, according to the National Association of Realtors. That's down from the 40% to 45% historic norm.""We anticipate a return of subprime lending could close the gap between the 26% and the historical 40%-to-45% range and potentially lift the gross amount of home sales higher in a given month,"" McCanless wrote.KB Home, for one, might finally be in the right place at the right time with its original focus on first-time buyers. Shares have moved up roughly 10% in three days.

2065,LEN,"A couple of months ago Tri Pointe Homes was a smallish homebuilder with a heavy concentration in California and little fanfare on Wall Street.Today the company is poised to become one of the nation's 10 biggest builders as it prepares to move into a handful of new, high-growth markets from one coast to the other.For that, Tri Pointe (TPH) can thank its proposed buyout of Weyerhaeuser Co.'s (WY) homebuilding division in a $2.7 billion deal announced Nov. 4.The acquisition brings Tri Pointe around 27,000 lots and five brands: Pardee Homes in Southern California and Nevada; Trendmaker Homes in Texas; Maracay Homes in Arizona; Winchester Homes in the Washington, D.C., metro area; and Quadrant Homes in the Puget Sound region of Washington.The deal is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2014. When it does, Tri Pointe would have a market cap of around $2.5 billion, going by current stock levels. That would move it into the top 10 among U.S. homebuilders. The company's current market cap is about $600 million.Good Supply Of LandOfficials involved in the deal said the Weyerhaeuser unit, known as Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co., or Wreco, will give Tri Pointe nine years' worth of land and lot supply.According to industry reports, that compares favorably with the roughly 7.4 years of average supply for leading U.S. homebuilders like Pulte Group (PHM), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN).Part of Tri Pointe's new supply will be in and around large urban markets such as Las Vegas, Houston, Phoenix and Seattle.A majority of the lots — more than 16,000 — are in California, where available land in top markets is shrinking.On a conference call with analysts, Tri Pointe CEO Doug Bauer said the combined company will give Tri Pointe ""a stronger and deeper California market position, a relatively high average-selling-price product line (and) land positions and brand recognition in the nation's most attractive markets.""Wall Street reacted favorably to the news. Tri Pointe's stock, which touched a low of 13.43 on Oct. 9, has since rallied about 35% and currently trades near 18. The stock went public in late January at an IPO price of $17.Even before the deal was announced, Tri Pointe was seeing sales increase sharply. For the past five quarters, revenue has risen by at least triple-digit percentages from a year ago. The Wreco assets should kick growth into an even higher gear, analysts say.""The acquisition of about 27,000 lots in several of the nation's best housing markets will permit Tri Pointe Homes to continue its robust growth pace,"" Brendan Lynch, analyst at Sidoti & Co., noted in a report.""In addition to bolstering inventory, we think Wreco's land .. . will contribute to gross margin expansion to 23.5% in 2014 and 24% in 2015, vs. our call for 22% in 2013,"" Lynch added.Under the terms, Weyerhaeuser shareholders will get 130 million shares, or 80.5% of the combined company. Tri Pointe will get 19.5%.However, Tri Pointe's management will run the firm. Bauer will remain as CEO and Barry Sternlicht will continue as chairman. Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group owns a large stake in Tri Pointe.The Tri Pointe-Weyerhaeuser deal is part of a recent trend that has seen homebuilders use acquisitions to gain quick entry into new markets.In July, Ryland Group (RYL) made its fourth acquisition in a year when it bought the operations and assets of Cornell Homes, a developer in Philadelphia, western New Jersey and Delaware.In September, Meritage Homes (MTH) announced its acquisition of Phillips Builders, a Nashville-based builder.Weyerhaeuser, a timberland owner that makes wood, container board and paper products, began exploring the idea of selling its homebuilding unit in June.In a statement at the time, Weyerhaeuser CEO Dan Fulton said that ""given the improving fundamentals of the housing market, we believe now is a prudent time to explore strategic alternatives for this business.""The Tri Pointe-Weyerhaeuser deal was structured as a tax-free Reverse Morris Trust, which allowed Tri Pointe to buy a larger firm while Weyerhaeuser shareholders would own the majority of shares.When the deal closes, Tri Pointe will have a chance to expand well beyond its current market, which mainly focuses on houses in California and Colorado that sell for $300,000 to $1.5 million.""We have accelerated our long-term plan to be a leading regional homebuilder in some of the nation's fastest-growing markets,"" Bauer said on the conference call. ""The combination of Wreco's local market knowledge and Tri Pointe's strong and established history of success should result in a powerful and focused homebuilding company.""Prices And Revenue GrowingHe made those comments following Tri Pointe's third-quarter earnings release. The company posted earnings of 15 cents a share, topping estimates for 9 cents. Revenue rose more than 480% year over year to $58.5 million, above views for $44.9 million.The average selling price of homes delivered climbed 57% to $624,000 as Tri Pointe benefited from the opening of three communities in Southern California.New home orders nearly doubled to 135 from 74 a year earlier, while homebuilding gross margins improved to 23% from 11.7% the prior year.Tri Pointe said it will have nine active communities by the end of 2013. It expects to open 20 to 24 new communities in 2014, excluding the Wreco assets.""We project that Tri Pointe will sell all of the remaining homes in a few of the nine communities that are open, resulting in an active community count of 27 at year-end 2014,"" analyst Lynch noted.Analysts expect Tri Pointe to post full-year EPS of 47 cents in 2013 and $1.09 in 2014.

2168,LEN,"TRI Pointe Group, Inc.’s (TPH  -  Free Report) shares have been riding high of late, gaining 24.7% over the past year compared with the industry’s 3.9% growth.Indeed, the overall outlook for the U.S. housing industry remains positive, with a healthy economy and strong job market aiding the demand side of the equation. However, the limited supply of homes for sale, rising rates and higher material prices have raised concerns among investors regarding certain U.S. sectors, particularly construction. Evidently, share price performance has not been an encouraging one for the homebuilding industry so far this year. However, despite belonging to the same industry, TRI Pointe has managed to navigate smoothly. The industry has declined more than 17%, whereas TRI Pointe registered only 6.2% fall year to date.This Irvine, CA-based homebuilder, which is mainly involved in the design, construction and sale of single-family homes, continues to exhibit strength given strong order growth and high backlog.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has increased 0.5% in the past 60 days, thus reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects and substantiating its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. What Makes TRI Pointe a Solid Pick?Solid Order Growth and High Backlog: TRI Pointe delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in the first quarter of 2018, given continued strength in absorption paces. California continues to be a major contributor to its growth. Given strong order growth and high backlog, the company is well positioned for robust top and bottom-line growth in 2018.In the last reported quarter, order value increased 29% year over year. Similarly, order units grew 15%. Solid delivery growth and strong price appreciation led to 48.6% growth in homebuilding revenues. Order growth was driven by 12% increase in absorptions and a 3% increase in community count. Meanwhile, as of Mar 31, 2018, backlog was up 39% (in value) on a 24% increase in backlog units.Additionally, TRI Pointe is blessed with a massive California presence where it continues to register strong demand. This is helping the company to offset the industry’s limited supply scenario, allowing for relatively strong pricing power. This is evident from its homebuilding gross margin that expanded 390 basis points year over year in the last reported quarter.Solid Growth Prospects: TRI Pointe reported robust first-quarter results, with the bottom line increasing 460% year over year to 28 cents per share. The quarter benefited from solid top-line growth, significant increases in unit deliveries, average sales prices and significant expansion of gross margin.TRI Pointe has solid growth prospects, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.86 per share for the current year, which is expected to grow 31% year over year. Meanwhile, the company’s sales are expected to increase 17.1% in 2018. Meanwhile, the company’s 2019 earnings are expected to increase 14.3% on 12% growth in revenues.The company has a three-five year expected EPS growth rate of 11.7%.Valuation Looks Rational: Given homebuilders’ asset-driven nature, it makes sense to value companies based on their price-to-book (P/B) ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.3. This is lower compared with the current P/B for the industry and S&P 500 that are pegged at 1.4 and 3.9, respectively. Its lower-than-market positioning indicates that there is room for an upside in the quarters ahead, substantiating its Value Score of B.Solid VGM Score: The company has an impressive VGM Score of B. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics. In fact, our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer solid investment choices.Superior ROE: TRI Pointe’s return on equity (ROE) supports growth potential. Its ROE of 13.6% compares favorably with the industry’s average of 12.4%, implying that it is efficient in using its shareholders’ funds.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report) and Aegion Corporation (AEGN  -  Free Report).Lennar sports a Zacks Rank #1 and its fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to grow 37.5%.M.D.C. Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #2 and its earnings for the current year are likely to increase 32.6%.Aegion is also a Zacks Rank #2 stock and its earnings for the current year are expected to grow 34%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2169,LEN,"On Jul 10, President Donald Trump escalated fears of a trade war further by threatening to impose 10% tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods. The move comes within days of the two countries imposing tit-for-tat tariffs on goods worth $34 billion. This once again made investors jittery, leading to huge selloffs on Tuesday.Trade war fears have been keeping markets volatile for some time now and there seems to be no sign of the Trump administration pulling back anytime soon. Given this scenario, there are still a few sectors with domestic focus that seem to be safe from the ongoing U.S.-China trade spat.Trade War Fears Escalate AgainOn Tuesday, Trump once again raised his stake in the trade dispute, with China threatening to impose additional 10% tariffs on goods worth $200 billion. The new list contains more than 6,000 items that include food items, tobacco, chemicals, steel and aluminum, minerals and consumer goods. Per Bloomberg, the new list could be released by the end of this week.However, China’s commerce ministry didn’t say how it would retaliate but stated that it was “shocked” and would complain to the World Trade Organization. Understandably, China too is taking measures to retaliate to Trump’s threats, which will only extend the already-hostile relation between the two countries.Situation Worsens for U.S CompaniesU.S. companies have been feeling the heat for quite some time now, with Trump constantly threatening to impose tariffs on a host of Chinese goods. Finally, on Jul 6, the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. Consequently, China retaliated with tariffs on a similar amount of U.S. goods.Trump had already said that the United Stated could impose tariffs on goods worth as much as $500 billion if China retaliated. Understandably, Trump is going by what he had said and has hit back with tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Many U.S. companies generate a significant portion of their revenues from China. Trade war fears had kept U.S. companies under pressure for the last few months. The markets finally took a beating on Tuesday, with Trump announcing a new set of tariffs. It goes without saying that fresh tariffs are a clear indication that the trade war is unlikely to come to a halt anytime soon.Our ChoicesTrade war fears are unlikely to ebb which and U.S. companies’ revenues from China are likely to decline from the raging trade storm. And a second wave of tariffs has only escalated these fears. Given this scenario, U.S. companies with a domestic focus look a lot safer as these remain insulated from the trade tensions.  So it makes sense to add stocks with domestic focus to your portfolio right away.However, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Lennar Corp.

2171,LEN,"After increasing for most of the spring, mortgage rates dipped for the week ending Jul 5 to the lowest level since mid-April, renewing hope for would-be homebuyers. Notably, the cost of borrowing fell in five of the past six weeks.According to Freddie Mac, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 4.52% in the week ending Jul 5 compared with 4.55% in the week earlier. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.99%, down five basis points, while the five-year adjustable-rate mortgage was 3.74%, down from 3.87%.Bond yields declined simultaneously with mortgage rates given the speculation of escalating U.S.-China trade war. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has been declining, as demand for safe-haven assets increased. The yield peaked in May to 3.11% and has since then dipped to 2.83% for the week ending Jul 3.Source: Freddie MacRelief for Homebuyers?Although the recent declines bring some respite for buyers, builders are increasingly concerned that tariffs placed on Canadian lumber and other imported products are already hurting housing affordability. Record-high lumber prices have added nearly $9,000 to the price of a new single-family home since January 2017. Additionally, the U.S. Government’s recent move of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum has also raised concerns over the construction sector.Meanwhile, rising mortgage rates, in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed, is equally damaging to investor sentiment toward the housing industry.Challenges like inventory shortage are prevailing in the U.S. real estate market and creating upward pressure on prices in several parts of the country, thereby affecting affordability. Per the latest report from CoreLogic, the real estate data company, the nationwide home price index was 7.1% higher in May when compared with a year earlier. On a month-over-month basis, prices increased by 1.1% in May compared with April. CoreLogic’s home price index has dipped just once in the past 12 months. The real estate data company also expects the national home price index to grow 5.1% in May 2019 from May 2018.Nonetheless, declining mortgage rates along with robust economic and job market scenario should create ample room for growth.Alongside its pricing report, CoreLogic also conducted an extensive consumer housing sentiment study that revealed the strong desire for homeownership over the long-term among renters in markets having the highest home-price growth. The report reveals, across the United States, 15% of homeowners and 28% of renters have expressed their desire to buy a home in the next 12 months, while only 11% have hinted at selling.It clearly shows that as the economy continues to improve and the millennial generation comes of age, pent-up demand for homes will continue to be released. After all, a low supply level in both new and existing homes ensures strong demand and pricing.The recent sales figure has also been encouraging. According to a report released by the Census Bureau and Department of Housing and Urban Development, sales of newly constructed single-family homes hit a six-month high in May, increasing 6.7% month over month and 14.1% year over year.Also, housing starts made a comeback in May with a 5% increase, reaching the highest level since 2007. The figure also improved 20.3% on a year-over-year basis. Single-family and multi-family starts surged in May.With solid economic fundamentals in place, the overall homebuilding picture is pretty encouraging for 2018.4 Must-Buy Housing StocksAdding some housing stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart move at this point, as there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector over both the short and the long term. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on four stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and favorable metrics.

2173,LEN,"Lennar Corporation’s (LEN  -  Free Report) shares have been rallying since the second-quarter fiscal 2018 release on Jun 26, 2018. In fact, the nation’s largest homebuilder has outperformed the homebuilding industry so far this year. Although Lennar deteriorated 17% year to date, it fared better than the broader industry’s 19.7% decline.Recently, Lennar posted stellar second-quarter results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Notably, second-quarter fiscal 2018 was the first full quarter with CalAtlantic. Its top and bottom lines grew considerably, primarily on higher orders, along with improved gross margins and SG&A expenses. Revenues grew 67% as the Homebuilding (up 75.5%), Financial Services and Multifamily segments performed significantly well. Lennar witnessed robust market improvement, aided by 57% increase in deliveries and 62% rise in new home orders (up 79% in dollars).U.S. homebuilding was quite a rage in 2017, giving investors ample scope to rake in handsome gains. The industry is equally attractive this year, courtesy of solid economic growth and job market. Consistent job growth, growing interest from first-time homebuyers as well as high homebuilders’ confidence are the main factors driving the momentum.Lennar is one such company that continues to display strength in several areas. Hence, adding the stock to your portfolio should not be a disappointment. Earnings estimates for Lennar have exhibited an uptrend, reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2018 and 2019 earnings has also been revised upward by 12.2% and 2.5%, respectively, over the past seven days. Let’s delve deeper into the other factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock a profitable pick. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. What Makes Lennar a Solid Pick?Solid Growth Prospects: Presently, the problem of adequate supply of land is taking its worst shape, as demand continues to scale up in the homebuilding industry. Given significant pent-up housing demand, Lennar has secured a decent backlog. In the quarter under review, backlog grew 92% from the year-ago quarter to 19,622 homes. Potential housing revenues from backlog increased 114% year over year to $8.6 billion.Meanwhile, rising land and labor costs are threatening margins of major homebuilders. In this respect, the company has managed to control costs prudently, as is evident from gross margin expansion. The company’s home sales gross margin expanded 10 basis points in the fiscal second quarter.Lennar has solid growth prospects, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings of $5.24 per share, which is expected to grow 37.5% year over year. Meanwhile, the company’s sales are expected to increase by a stellar 64.9% in fiscal 2018. Overall, Lennar constitutes a great pick in terms of growth investment, supported by a Growth Score of B.Leading Homebuilder: Lennar is considered as one of the leading homebuilders in the United States. The company offers a diversified line of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers.The acquisition of CalAtlantic Group Inc. in February 2018 made Lennar one of the country’s top three homebuilders in 24 of the top 30 U.S. markets. Lennar remains confident that the company will exceed its prior $100 million synergy-savings expectations for 2018 and is on track to meet $365 million synergies for 2019 as well. The latest earnings result also speaks of the synergies that the company is experiencing.Valuation Looks Rational: Because of homebuilders’ asset-driven nature, it makes sense to value them based on the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.3. This is lower compared with the current P/B for the industry and S&P 500 that are pegged at 1.4 and 3.9, respectively. Its lower-than-market positioning indicates that there is room for an upside in the quarters ahead, substantiating its Value Score of B.Solid VGM Score: The company has an impressive VGM Score of B. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics. In fact, our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 make solid investment choices.Superior ROE: Lennar’s return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Its ROE of 14.2% compares favorably with the industry’s average of 112.4%, implying that it is efficient in using its shareholders’ funds.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report), Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report).M.D.C. Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 and its earnings for the current year are likely to increase 32.6%.Beazer Homes, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, is expected to witness 6.5% earnings growth for the year.D.R. Horton also carries a Zacks Rank #2 and its fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to grow 35.4%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2175,LEN,"Undoubtedly, the overall outlook for the U.S. housing industry remains positive, with a healthy economy and strong job market helping the demand side of the equation. However, the limited supply of homes for sale is the biggest issue facing the market right now and will prevail in the balance of 2018.Meanwhile, there are other factors that can deal a fresh blow to the housing industry. The U.S. Government’s recent move of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum has spurred concerns among investors about certain U.S. sectors, particularly Construction.Although a healthy job market and an impressive supply-demand balance will probably draw buyers, rising interest and mortgage rates -- as well as land and labor shortages -- raise concerns, as do tedious underwriting standards. Intensifying competition also poses a threat.It would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at the dampeners before investing in this space. Below we discuss the impact that these can have on the sector in the coming months and years.Trump Tariff & Rising Material Costs to Shake the IndustryConstruction materials’ prices continued to rise in March, after a notable spike in February. Meanwhile, tariffs on steel and other goods could push up construction costs.According to an Associated Builders and Contractors (“ABC”) analysis of information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”), March construction material prices increased 0.8% month over month. On a year-over-year basis, the price of construction materials increased 5.8%, marking the steepest rise since 2011.“Prices increased for many items in March, even before tariffs announced for steel, aluminum, and additional items imported from China have taken effect,” said Ken Simonson, AGC of America’s chief economist.Notably, in March 2018, U.S. President Trump has announced hefty new tariffs for imports of steel, at 25%, and 10% for aluminum in an attempt to boost U.S. manufacturers. The proposal, which is in sync with Trump’s America First policy, however, will hit the Construction sector that accounted for 40% of U.S. steel demand in 2017 (as per the data provider Statista).Steel is an integral part of the supply chain and widely used in every part of it, from sourcing raw material to construction and manufacturing activities as well as for freight purposes.An increase in import tariff will escalate raw material cost for homebuilders already grappling with increased cost thanks the recent imposition of lumber tariff. Notably, in 2017, tariff was imposed on lumber, another major input material in the construction sector. The tariff imposed in retaliation to Canada's restrictions on the import of U.S. dairy products, averaged 20.83% on Canadian lumber imports, which are used mostly for home building in the United States.Association officials warn contractors that the Trump administration’s additional proposed tariffs might further increase construction costs, resulting in potential project delays and cancellations.Labor/Land Shortage Continues to HurtApart from the rising material costs, the U.S. housing industry is already challenged by a shortage of homes for sale, suitable land and skilled labor. Limited supply of homes for sale has been the biggest issue facing the market and the problem will continue, particularly in the entry-level market.Per a recent report by the National Association of Realtors (NARs), the supply of existing homes in April 2018 decreased 6.3% from April 2017 but increased 9.8% month over month. It has fallen year over year for 35 consecutive months.As such, it will take only four months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR. Investors should note that it is preferable to have about six months’ supply for a healthy market. Land supply could remain a challenge for the housing industry in the coming quarters as well.Also, the problem of skilled labor shortage is taking its worst shape in the homebuilding industry, as demand continues to scale up. Rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as these limit homebuilders’ pricing power. Labor shortage is resulting in higher wages, while land prices are inflating due to limited availability. There could be more inflation ahead. This is eating into homebuilders’ margins.The impact of labor/land shortage is twofold. On the one hand, residential construction is failing to meet demand in the absence of sufficient workers. On the other hand, to make up for rising labor costs, homebuilders are being compelled to raise home prices to maintain margins that would deter entry-level homebuyers. In April, first-time buyers comprised 33% of sales, which is down from 34% a year ago but up from 30% in March.Rising land and labor costs have hurt gross margins for the likes of Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) and others. Lennar, PulteGroup and Toll Brothers carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Officials at the Federal Open Market Committee concluded the May 2 meeting with a unanimous decision to keep the Fed’s benchmark interest rate unchanged, in the range of 1.5% to 1.75%.The Fed last raised interest rates in March, by a quarter of a percentage point. The target range for benchmark short-term interest rate stands between 1.5% and 1.75%. This was the sixth-rate hike undertaken by the Fed since 2015. The Fed expects to increase interest rates two more times in 2018. Fed officials now project a median federal funds rate of 2.9% by the end of 2019, which indicates three rate hikes in 2019 against two predicted in the last Fed meeting in December 2017. They expect the rate to move up to 3.4% in 2020 from the previous expectation of 3.1%.Meanwhile, mortgage rates, which loosely follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury, started the year at around 4% but began rising thereafter. Mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U.S. government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed.The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose to an average interest rate of 4.61% for the week ended May 17, 2018, the highest level since May 2011, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.The rise in interest rates comes at a time when values of homes are marching up with higher demand and lesser supply. The situation could be detrimental to first-time buyers, raising affordability issues. This is evident from the latest report of Mortgage Bankers Association, unveiling the seasonally adjusted weekly survey for the week ending May 18, 2018. The report stated that total mortgage applications fell by 2.6% from a week earlier. Purchase applications for new loans fell 2% from the previous week, while refinance applications plunged 4%, the MBA reported. The refinance index is currently at its lowest level since December 2000.Speculation of further rate hikes is niggling investors in this space. Although we see limited impact on housing demand from the upcoming rise in mortgage rates given the job market strength, its influence on the industry is undeniable and uncertain.However, with the Fed announcing a hike in the benchmark Federal Funds’ target rate, mortgage rates will probably rise in the balance of 2018 or thereafter. High mortgage rates dilute demand for new homes, as mortgage loans become expensive. This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes, revenues and profits of homebuilders.Additionally, the rise in mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are taking baby steps into the housing market. Higher interest rates will only flare up the issues and further delay home purchases by millennials.Rising Prices Hurting AffordabilityRising material prices, along with shortage of buildable lots and skilled labor are creating upward pressure on home prices and hindering a stronger housing recovery.April’s median sales price of existing homes grew 5.3% from the comparable period a year ago to $257,900, marking the 74th straight month of year-over-year gains. In 2017, prices increased 5.8%, rising for the sixth straight year. Additionally, the median sales price of new homes sold in April was $312,400, 0.4% higher than a year ago.Overall, rising prices may keep home buyers at bay with many postponing their search for the time being.Sales Continue to FalterMost recent data showed that sales of new U.S. single-family homes dropped in April after gaining in March. In fact, new home sales faltered in three of the last four months this year, suggesting the travails of the housing market in winning back momentum. Housing starts and building permits also fell 3.7% and 1.8%, respectively, in the month.Sales of newly constructed single-family homes, accounting roughly 10% of all U.S. home sales, dropped 1.5% in April from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662,000 units, as per data released on May 23 by the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, sales data for the prior three months was also revised down. The revisions revealed that sales in the first three months of the year were not as strong as earlier reported.Moreover, existing-home sales faltered in April on both a monthly and annualized basis, according to the National Association of Realtors, after moving upward for two straight months.Total existing-home sales decreased 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million in April from 5.60 million in March. With last month’s decline, sales are now 1.4% below a year ago and have fallen year-over-year for two straight months.We would prefer to avoid M/I Homes, Inc. (MHO  -  Free Report) stock for the time being, given its unfavorable Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Bottom LineIn “Builders’ Confidence, Economic Growth Raise Hopes for Housing” we focused on the conditions that are expected to drive the industry going forward.As you can see, there is some catching up to do for these homebuilders even though the economy paints a picture of recovery. But what about investing in the space right now? Will the opportunities outweigh the risks to lure short-term investors?Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2176,LEN,"Although the home sales data is not impressive so far this year, the larger picture is indeed a big success. Homebuilders still expect strong demand for new homes as low unemployment and steady economic growth support Americans’ buying power.Of course, finding buildable lots has been a major challenge in the industry in recent times, which could limit their ability to meet demand. That said, homebuilders are currently well placed, belonging to a top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 14%), suggesting that the market headwinds were unable to take the sheen away from the sector.There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector for both the short and the long term. Below we discuss a few key factors driving the sector and what investors can expect going ahead.Robust Economic GrowthThe U.S. economy is anticipated to grow at a 4% annualized rate in the second quarter, per the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow forecast model showed on May 25. This is quite a sharp increase from 2.3% GDP growth registered in the first quarter of 2018.Fueled by robust economic growth, Fed policymakers are looking at three rate hikes this year, setting the stage for an increase in mortgage rates. Nevertheless, Americans are seeing wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade.President Trump aims to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts, deregulation and higher infrastructure spending. Although this may face varied obstacles, we expect the plan to help the economy grow at a faster clip in 2018.This upbeat expectation holds particularly true when one of the nation’s key economic drivers, i.e. construction activity, is gradually strengthening its footprint accompanied by a declining unemployment rate. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9% in April 2018 — the lowest since December 2000.Improving economic growth supported by a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and provides the basis for stronger demand.Solid Builders’ Confidence Builders’ confidence increased two points to 70 in May from a downward revision of 68 in April, reinstating builders’ confidence in the current housing market. Importantly, the reading was above the 50 mark in the first five months of 2018, indicating a favorable outlook. Moreover, this is the fourth time in 2018 that the index has reached 70.Notably, the National Association of Home Builders or NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) includes builder perceptions of current single-family home sales, sales expectations for the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers.Higher Demand, Low Inventory to Boost PricesSteady economic growth along with favorable demographics and the attractiveness of ownership versus rental are driving demand. Although recent home sales have been volatile month over month, the year-over-year growth rates are indeed compelling. New home sales were up 11.6% year over year in April 2018.On the other hand, a shortage in buildable lots, skilled labor and available capital for smaller builders are limiting home production, thereby lowering the inventory of homes, both new and existing. The convergence of healthy demand and low inventory levels is giving a boost to prices and is expected to continue doing so for some time.The supply of April existing homes decreased 6.3% from the year-ago period. It has fallen year over year for 35 consecutive months. As such, it will take only four months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market versus 4.2 months a year ago, according to NAR.Thanks to low inventory and high demand, median sales price of existing homes increased 5.3% in April 2018 from a year earlier. The median sales price of new homes sold in April was $312,400, 0.4% higher from the year-ago period.We believe prices will continue to scale as demand for homes is likely to grow on high consumer confidence and low unemployment. Improving labor markets, declining unemployment rates and limited home supplies are driving home prices, thereby giving a boost to homebuilders’ top line.For 2018, National Association of Home Builders or NAHB expects continued growth for home construction and remodeling. The home improvement sector should also remain strong given recent home price gain, increases in homeowner wealth and other lifestyle improvements.Millennials Take InterestMillennials — those born after 1980 — are anticipated to continue to make up a large and growing portion of the buyer section, although many disagree with this view. This is due to the fact that millennials occupy the largest adult generation and make up the greatest percentage of the workforce.First-time buyers comprised 33% of sales in April 2018, which is up from 30% in March but slightly down from 34% a year ago. NAR’s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, released in late 2017, revealed that the annual share of first-time buyers was 34%.Boosting Land Bank Amid Rising CostsU.S. homebuilders have been seeking various ways to increase their land holding amid rising land acquisition costs and a tight labor market that hinder efforts to tap the recovery in the housing market.Again, limited capital for land development has left entitled lands in short supply, while growing demand drives land prices. The labor market has also tightened with limited availability of labor, arresting the rapid growth in housing production.Land development and homebuilding are correlated but fundamentally different operations. Prominent homebuilders are buying out major land developers that will help them address the ongoing issues.In February 2018, Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc. in a $9.3 billion deal (including debt), which creates one of the country’s top homebuilders. Since the closing of the transaction, Lennar remains confident that the company will exceed its prior $100 million synergy-savings expectations for fiscal 2018 and is on track to meet $365 million synergies for fiscal 2019 as well.In February 2017, Lennar acquired Florida-based homebuilder WCI Communities Inc., a premier lifestyle community developer and luxury homebuilder of single and multi-family homes, to enhance its land holdings.Meanwhile, in March 2018, M/I Homes, Inc. (MHO  -  Free Report), one of the nation's leading builders of single-family homes, closed the acquisition of the residential homebuilding assets and operations of Pinnacle Homes, a homebuilder in the greater Detroit, MI market.Again, William Lyon Homes (WLH  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of RSI, a Southern California and Texas-based homebuilder, and three related real-estate assets on Mar 9, 2018. This addition spreads the company’s footprint in the Inland Empire of California and marks its entry into Texas.How to Play the IndustryMajor homebuilders are well poised on the positive fundamentals of the housing market. Particularly, given the cheap valuation compared with the broader market, this is perhaps the right time to pick a few stocks from the Zacks Homebuilding Industry.We recommend those that are witnessing positive estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report), M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH  -  Free Report), William Lyon Homes and Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report).Century Communities and M.D.C. Holdings sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while the rest carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.ConclusionThough homebuilders admit to rising labor shortage and land/labor costs, they remain optimistic about a measured recovery this year in tandem with steady economic growth.The housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels, prevailing economic conditions and interest rates. Although rising interest and mortgage rates, land and labor shortages, and rising material prices raise concerns, the 2018 outlook for homebuilding seems to be solid given strong economic growth and labor market. Investors could also take advantage of the homebuilding-sector opportunities in the near term.Check out our latest Housing Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2177,LEN,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to bolster its presence in the smart home market with its own voice assistant Alexa and a strong portfolio of home automation products.The company’s tie-up with Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report), a home construction company, is likely to be a win-win situation for both the parties.Lennar specializes in building smart homes with built-in Wi-Fi in order to accentuate the experience of Amazon’s Alexa. Though Alexa will remain the prime focus, the smart homes will also feature Echo range of smart speakers, Dash Buttons, Blink’s wireless security camera, Ring’s internet connected video doorbells to name a few.Lennar’s first 15 model homes will be located in Dallas, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, San Fransisco, Seattle and Washington DC. However, the company intends to deliver 35k homes equipped with Amazon’s home automation products across 23 U.S. states this year.Showcasing of Amazon’s Home ProductsThe latest move will showcase Amazon’s home automation products in the model homes. This will provide Amazon an experience centre for its home products, which is anticipated to attract customers to its platform by delivering better services and experience to the owners.Moreover, the partnership gives a significant boost to Amazon’s clientele, leading to construction of more smart homes with built in home automation products and consequently generating more revenues.Further, the latest deal will reinforce Amazon’s dominant position in the market.These factors are likely to provide Amazon a competitive edge in the home automation space, where it is facing competition from the likes of Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report).Shares of Amazon have returned 37.1% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s rally of 21.2%. Moreover, the return is better than Apple, Facebook, Alibaba and Alphabet’s gain of 11.2%, 5.4%, 21.3% and 3%, respectively.Growing Smart Home MarketThe smart home market is growing at a rapid pace with the development of innovative home automation products like voice assistants, voice controlled devices, internet connected security products and so on. Moreover, increasing use of internet and smartphones worldwide is giving rise to demand for these products.Per the data from Markets and Markets, the global smart home market is expected to reach $137.91 billion by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 13.6% between 2017 and 2022.Further, the United States is likely to be the high growth market for smart homes. This is evident from the data provided by Statista which shows household penetration rate in the country is expected to reach 32% in 2018. Further, revenues in U.S. smart home market are projected at $18.9 billion for this year. Additionally, the revenues in this market are expected to reach $32.8 billion by 2022 by growing at a CAGR of 14.8% between 2018 and 2022.Its no wonder that the tech companies are trying to increase their footprint in this rapidly growing space. However, Amazon enjoys a first-mover’s advantage in this market. The increased adoption of Alexa and Echo devices has helped the company gain significant prominence within a short span of time.Competition IntensifiesNevetheless, competition is increasing for Amazon. In the area of voice assistants, Google’s Assitant and Apple’s Siri provide tough competition to Amazon’s Alexa. The global market for voice assistants is expected to grow at CAGR of 39.27% between 2017 and 2023 and reach $7.8 billion by 2023.Further, Facebook is planning to add a feature to its Marketplace by collaborating with three firms — Handy, HomeAdvisor and Porch. The new update will allow the users to find and contact local contractors for home improvement services quickly. This is going to compete with Amazon’s Home Services which provides similar kind of services.In case of voice controlled speakers, the competition is getting stiffer. Per a latest report by Strategy Analytics, Google with the introduction of Google Home Mini accounted for 26.5% of market share, up from 12.5% in the year-ago quarter.Apple’s HomePod which was launched early this year gained traction by acquiring 6% market share. Also, Alibaba was successful to acquire 7.6% share.On the other hand, Amazon with several iterations of the Amazon Echo maintained its dominant position in the smart speakers market by acquiring 43.6% market share in the last quarter. However, the company’s share has come down from the year-ago quarter, when it accounted for 81.8% of market share.Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2178,LEN,"According to the report released by the Census Bureau and Department of Housing and Urban Development, sales of new single-family homes fell by 1.5% sequentially in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662,000.The decline was led by a 7.9% fall in new home sales in the West, while Midwest and South remained almost unchanged. Sales, however, improved 11.1% in the Northeast.April’s data fell shy of March’s new home sales, which were up 4% sequentially. However, the sales figure was better on a year-over-year basis. April’s new home sales were up 11.6% year over year, while the same for March increased 8.8%.The median sales price was $312,400, down 6.9% sequentially. The average home price was $407,300, up 11.3% sequentially, due to higher construction wages and rising construction prices.Home Builders GainApril’s slight monthly decline in new home sales was not much of a concern as it was taken as a slight correction. Shares of prominent homebuilders such as D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) and KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) escalated after the release. This reinforced the positive sentiment among homebuilders.Moreover, the recent data on builder confidence showed an increase by two points to 70 in May from a downward revision of 68 in April, reinstating optimism in the current housing market. Importantly, the reading was above the 50 mark, in the first five months of 2018, indicating a favorable outlook.Moreover, high demand and limited supply have pushed home prices above the levels last seen in early 2006. Also, new construction remains below historically normal levels, which is exerting an upward pressure on prices. Notably tight inventories and rising home prices should aid homebuilders.Housing demand should remain crisp from nationwide economic growth, underpinned by record low unemployment, growing wages and strong business and consumer confidence.Headwinds RemainNevertheless, builders continue to face headwinds relating to high wages, paucity of land, lack of buildable lots, and increasing lumber and other raw material prices. These factors might cause home prices to escalate. This can further harm housing demand as builders pass on the high cost to home buyers. Moreover, increasing mortgage rates might be another factor inhibiting buyers to stay away from the higher burden of interest on housing loan.However, these factors haven’t had a marked impact on the industry's performance, which has been maintaining a lead position for quite some time. The Zacks Homebuilding Industry's rank (top 10% among more than 250 industries) instills investors’ confidence in this space.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Early Q2 results have started coming out, with total earnings for the 15 S&P 500 members that have reported fiscal May-quarter results up +41.7% on +13.2% higher revenues. The proportion of these early reporters beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking above other recent periods.  •    For the S&P 500 index as a whole, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +19% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth.•    Earnings growth in the last earnings season (20018 Q1) reached its highest level in more than 7 years at +24.5% on +8.7% revenue gains.•    Q2 estimates moved up modestly since the quarter got underway, in contrast to the very strong positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the start of the Q1 earnings season.•    Q2 estimates for the Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors went up since the quarter got underway, while estimates for the Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Autos, and Conglomerate sectors went down.•    Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +24.1% on +10.7% higher revenues, which would follow +31.1% earnings growth on +13.1% revenue growth in Q1. Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +18.2% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues.•    Other major sectors with strong expected growth in Q2 include Energy (+140% earnings growth), Basic Materials (+53.9%), Industrial Products (+24.6%) and Retail (+17.9%). The Autos and Conglomerates sectors are the only ones expected to have lower Q2 earnings compared to the year-earlier level.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +31% on +9.2% higher revenues, which would follow +27.4% earnings growth on +8.4% revenue growth in 2018 Q1.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +20.2% on +6.3% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, total earnings are expected to be up +9.8% and +9.6%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.6% in 2019, and +4.5% in 2020.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.6X and index close, as of June 26th, is $156.26. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $171.62 for 2019 (P/E of 16X) and $188.18 for 2020 (P/E of 14.6X). The multiples for 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Q2 earnings season Gets UnderwayThe Q2 earnings season will really get going with the July 13th releases from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). But the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already, with today’s ConAgra (CAG  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) reports part of the 15 S&P 500 members that have reported results already.All of these early results are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May, but they form part of our June-quarter tally. We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results.Total earnings for these 15 index members are up +41.7% on +13.2% higher revenues, with 93.3% beating EPS estimates and 80% beating revenue estimates.It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this small sample of Q2 results, but two trends nevertheless stand out when we compare the Q2 results from these 15 index members with what these same companies reported in other recent periods.These two standout trends pertain to revenue growth momentum and more numerous EPS surprises, as the comparison charts below show.Q2 Expectations as a WholeTotal Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology. This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +140%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +15.6%.  The chart below contrasts the expected Q2 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

2180,LEN,"Sales of new homes in the United States dropped in April after gaining in March. In fact, new home sales faltered in three of the last four months this year, suggesting the travails of the housing market in winning back momentum. Housing starts and building permits also fell 3.7% and 1.8%, respectively, in the month.Sales of newly constructed single-family homes, accounting roughly 10% of all U.S. home sales, dropped 1.5% in April from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662,000 units, per data released on May 23 by the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, sales data for the prior three months was also revised down. The revisions revealed that sales in the first three months of the year were not as strong as earlier reported.April’s figure was curtailed by a sharp decline in the West that sank 7.9%. On the contrary, sales rose 0.3% in the South, which accounts for the majority of new home sales. Again, sales jumped 11.1% in the Northeast and were unchanged in the Midwest month over month.On a positive note, new home sales were up 11.6% year over year, despite the month-to-month irregularity. This was driven by a 26.4% improvement in the Midwest, 18.9% in the West, 6% in the South and 5.3% in the Northeast.Again, although April starts and permits tumbled from the March figure, housing starts were up 10.5% from April 2017 buoyed by a 7.2% increase in single-family homes, and a 19.1% surge in apartments. Again, permits were 7.7% above the April 2017 rate of 1.26 million units prompted by a 7.9% surge in single-family homes and 6.4% growth in buildings with five units or more.  Is Tight Inventory or Rising Mortgage Rate the Culprit?The U.S. housing industry is already challenged by a shortage of homes for sale, suitable land and skilled labor. That said, there were 300,000 new homes on the market in April, the highest in nine years and up 0.7% from March and 12.4% from a year ago. This is expected to bring some relief in the beginning of the spring selling season. At April’s sales pace, it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, slightly up from 5.3 months in March.Limited land availability is pushing up prices, as the median sales price of a new home rose 0.4% year over year to $ 312,400 last month.Again, higher mortgage rates could also be the reason for this downfall. Mortgage rates, which loosely follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury, started the year at around 4% but began rising thereafter. Mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U.S. government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose to an average interest rate of 4.61% for the week ended May 17, 2018, the highest level since May 2011, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Higher mortgage rates accompanied with higher home prices might be hitting on affordability.Separately, according to the latest Mortgage Bankers Association's (“MBA”) seasonally adjusted weekly survey for the week ending May 18, 2018, total mortgage applications fell by 2.6% from a week earlier. Purchase applications for new loans fell 2% from the previous week, while refinance applications plunged 4%, the MBA reported. The refinance index is currently at its lowest level since December 2000.Fed Sees Next Hike SoonMinutes from the meeting, which ended May 2 and were released on May 23, reveal that Fed officials are on track to raise rates again in June. Officials at the Federal Open Market Committee concluded the May 2 meeting with a unanimous decision to keep the Fed’s benchmark interest rate unchanged, at the range of 1.5% to 1.75%. The Fed last raised interest rates in March, by a quarter of a percentage point.The rise in interest rates comes at a time when values of homes are marching up with higher demand and lesser supply. The situation could be detrimental for first-time buyers, raising affordability issues. This is evident from the latest report of purchase applications for new loans that fell 2% from the earlier week.Importantly, some of the notable stocks in the homebuilding sector have been slumping. Shares of Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) have declined 18.2% since the start of the year, while D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is down 18.6%. Meanwhile, shares of luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) have dipped 16.9% this year, while KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) stock is down 17.8%. In comparison, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has slipped 19.5% so far this year.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

2181,LEN,"Vulcan Materials (VMC  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.8%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average earnings beat being 10.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Adverse weather conditions in many markets might mar Vulcan’s results in the to-be-reported quarter, thanks to shipment delays. Vulcan Materials is susceptible to bad weather conditions as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Also, the company’s production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects the company’s ability to produce and distribute products. It also has a negative impact on demand as construction work can be hampered by weather. The first and fourth quarters are most affected by winter. Hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are prevalent during these periods.Weak Top-Line GrowthThough adverse weather conditions is expected to mar growth  prospects in the quarter, Vulcan’s various bolt-on acquisitions can be expected to provide some cushion to revenues. Moreover, improvement in private construction activities, especially private residential construction, bodes well. As a result, demand for Vulcan Materials’ products is likely to rise, which will drive revenues.Coming to the segments, Aggregates segment sales (accounting for more than 78% of total revenues) will fall 1.5% in the quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Nevertheless, in the first quarter, revenues are expected to grow 26% year over year in the asphalt segment, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Concrete segment revenues are projected to rise 10% in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, Calcium segment revenues are likely to be up 5.8% in the to-be-reported quarter.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $798.6 million, up  1.4% year over year.Earnings to DeclineIncreased cost that includes freight distribution costs, rise in the unit cost of diesel fuel and storm-related costs is anticipated to hurt margins. The tepid sales growth along with increased costs is likely to dent earnings. Earnings are estimated at 22 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of 34.3%.Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vulcan Materials Company QuoteQuantitative Model PredictionPer our proven model, Vulcan Materials will not beat estimates in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is +2.68%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Vulcan has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Vulcan’s earnings estimates for the quarter declined 7 cents over the last 30 days, reflecting analysts’ pessimism surrounding the earnings growth of the company.Peer ReleasesPulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) reported impressive first-quarter 2018 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) also reported solid first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) surpassed earnings and revenue expectations in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

2182,LEN,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Early Q2 results have started coming out, with total earnings for the 15 S&P 500 members that have reported fiscal May-quarter results up +41.7% on +13.2% higher revenues. The proportion of these early reporters beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking above other recent periods.  •    For the S&P 500 index as a whole, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +19% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth.•    Earnings growth in the last earnings season (20018 Q1) reached its highest level in more than 7 years at +24.5% on +8.7% revenue gains.•    Q2 estimates moved up modestly since the quarter got underway, in contrast to the very strong positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the start of the Q1 earnings season.•    Q2 estimates for the Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors went up since the quarter got underway, while estimates for the Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Autos, and Conglomerate sectors went down.•    Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +24.1% on +10.7% higher revenues, which would follow +31.1% earnings growth on +13.1% revenue growth in Q1. Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +18.2% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues.•    Other major sectors with strong expected growth in Q2 include Energy (+140% earnings growth), Basic Materials (+53.9%), Industrial Products (+24.6%) and Retail (+17.9%). The Autos and Conglomerates sectors are the only ones expected to have lower Q2 earnings compared to the year-earlier level.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +31% on +9.2% higher revenues, which would follow +27.4% earnings growth on +8.4% revenue growth in 2018 Q1.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +20.2% on +6.3% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, total earnings are expected to be up +9.8% and +9.6%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.6% in 2019, and +4.5% in 2020.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.6X and index close, as of June 26th, is $156.26. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $171.62 for 2019 (P/E of 16X) and $188.18 for 2020 (P/E of 14.6X). The multiples for 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Q2 earnings season Gets UnderwayThe Q2 earnings season will really get going with the July 13th releases from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). But the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already, with today’s ConAgra (CAG  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) reports part of the 15 S&P 500 members that have reported results already.All of these early results are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May, but they form part of our June-quarter tally. We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results.Total earnings for these 15 index members are up +41.7% on +13.2% higher revenues, with 93.3% beating EPS estimates and 80% beating revenue estimates.It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this small sample of Q2 results, but two trends nevertheless stand out when we compare the Q2 results from these 15 index members with what these same companies reported in other recent periods.These two standout trends pertain to revenue growth momentum and more numerous EPS surprises, as the comparison charts below show.Q2 Expectations as a WholeTotal Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology. This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +140%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +15.6%.  The chart below contrasts the expected Q2 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

2184,LEN,"Lennar Corporation’s (LEN  -  Free Report) shares have gained 7.5% in pre-market trading, after surpassing earnings as well as revenue expectations in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 – the first full quarter with CalAtlantic.The company’s second-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.58 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents. The reported figure mainly excludes integration costs related to the acquisition of CalAtlantic Group, Inc. and backlog/construction in progress write-up related to purchase accounting. Including these items, the reported figure came in at 94 cents per share in the quarter, increasing considerably from the year-ago profit level of 89 cents per share.The improvement was primarily attributable to greater demand for homes accompanied with higher prices.Total revenues of $5.46 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.23 billion. Revenues also increased 67% year over year as the Homebuilding, Financial Services and Multifamily segments performed significantly well.Lennar Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Lennar Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lennar Corporation QuoteSegment DetailsHomebuilding: The segment’s revenues increased 75.5% from the prior-year quarter to $5.06 billion, driven by higher number of homes delivered and greater average selling prices. Within the Homebuilding umbrella, home sales constituted $5 billion (up 74% year over year) and land sales amounted to $78 million (up from $15.4 million a year ago).New home orders increased 62% from the year-ago quarter to 14,440. Potential value of net orders increased 79% year over year to $6 billion.Home deliveries increased 57% from the prior-year quarter to 12,095, buoyed by higher number of homes delivered across all homebuilding segments, courtesy of significant increase in volume resulting from the CalAtlantic acquisition.The average selling price (ASP) of homes delivered was $413,000, reflecting an increase of 10.4% year over year. In the quarter under review, backlog grew 92% from the year-ago quarter to 19,622 homes. Potential housing revenues from backlog increased 114% year over year to $8.6 billion.MarginsGross margin on home sales was 16.8% in the quarter. Excluding the above-mentioned backlog/construction in progress write-up, gross margin on home sales was 21.6% compared with 21.5% a year ago. The improvement was due to higher average sales price of homes delivered and increased volume.As a percentage of home sales, SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses declined 60 bps to 8.7% from 9.3% a year ago. The improvement was due to improved operating leverage, owing to higher home deliveries. Benefits from technology initiatives also added to the positives.Financial Services: Financial Services revenues increased 11.4% to $232.1 million in the quarter. Operating earnings at the segment were $52.4 million, up from $43.7 million a year ago.Rialto Investments: Rialto Investments’ revenues of $45.2 million decreased from $68 million a year ago.

2185,LEN,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before markets open. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32.4%.However, Martin Marietta has a dismal history, at least in terms of bottom-line performance. The company surpassed expectations in only three of the last 10 quarters. Well, the obvious question that arises is whether Martin Marietta will be able to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported.Let us delve into the factors that are likely to affect Martin Marietta’s first-quarter 2018 earnings.Adverse weather conditions in many markets might mar Martin Marietta’s results in the to-be-reported quarter. Weather-related risks have been affecting the company’s performance, thanks to the exterior nature of the business, in spite of improving economic conditions, cost management and enhanced operational efficiency.  The first and fourth quarters are most affected by winter. Hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are prevalent during these periods.Nevertheless, string of acquisitions, divestitures and an uptick in private construction activity are expected to provide some cushion to revenues and earnings. Sustained growth in construction activity drives demand for aggregates and cement businesses. This can be expected to boost results to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, for the first quarter, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate is 41 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of 38.8%. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $805.1 million, indicating a rise of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that Martin Marietta is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. Martin Marietta has an Earnings ESP of -13.04% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2187,LEN,"The PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) made its debut on 10/26/2005, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is sponsored by Invesco Powershares. It has amassed assets over $283.87 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs. PKB, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Building & Construction Intellidex Index.The index is comprised of stocks of U.S. building and construction companies. The Index is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including fundamental growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness and risk factorsn.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.63%.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.20%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing.

2188,LEN,"D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the homebuilder delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.31%. The company surpassed/met the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 5.83%.Like other homebuilders, D.R. Horton is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory point toward strong demand in 2018.Resultantly, shares of D.R. Horton, one of the top builders in the United States, have increased more than 32% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 17.9% rally.D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | D.R. Horton, Inc. QuoteLet’s See How Things are Shaping Up for This AnnouncementWith an impressive sales backlog, along with a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, D.R. Horton is well positioned for 2018. The company expects its backlog conversion rate for the second quarter to be in the range of 97-100%.The company’s homebuilding revenues increased 14% year over year in the preceding quarter. For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues (comprising about 98% of total revenues) of $3,695 million indicates an increase from $3,252 million in the last quarter and $3,164 million in the year-ago period.Net sales orders increased 16% to 10,753 homes on continued improvement in the preceding quarter. For the upcoming release, the consensus estimate for net sales orders of 15,779 units reflects an increase from 13,991 units a year ago and 10,753 units in the prior quarter.Last quarter, home closings increased 15% to 10,788 homes, while growing 14% to $3.2 billion in value. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, home closings are estimated to be 12,089 units compared with 10,685 units a year ago.On the other hand, the consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $93 million indicates an increase from $81 million in the prior quarter and $87 million a year ago.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $3.75 billion, implying 15.3% year-over-year growth.Apart from solid revenues, D.R. Horton expects home sales gross margin to be around 20-21%, compared with 19.8% in the year-ago quarter. In the preceding quarter, the company’s gross margin on home sales expanded 100 basis points (bps) year over year to 20.8%. The upside was driven by lower warranty, litigation and interest costs as a percentage of homebuilding revenues.However, investors should note that the company’s home sales gross margin decreased 20 bps to 20% in fiscal 2017. Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc.

2190,LEN,"The Q1 earnings season is gathering steam and investors are eagerly awaiting results from major homebuilders, which have remained in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons. The quarter witnessed massive volatility on uncertainty over the number of interest rate hikes and inconsistent monthly homebuilding data.Evidently, the S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index has dropped 8.8% year to date. Again, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has declined 1% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the broader market’s (S&P 500) return of 3.8%.Indeed, the U.S. stock market seems to have taken a brief hiatus. That said, positive momentum at the start of the first-quarter reporting cycle remains intact for the industry given the solid earnings outlook and favorable economic fundamentals.Homebuilding at a GlanceSales of previously-owned homes jumped in February, marking the first gain in the last three months. This shows that an increasing number of Americans are looking to buy homes despite rising prices and limited availability.As revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales ticked up 3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units from 5.38 million in January. Sales increased 1.1% from the year-ago level. The surge in existing-home sales (accounting for 90% of the market), after the slump in the last two months, indicates that competition is expected to heat up in the traditional spring home-buying season.Meanwhile, new home sales increased 0.5% year over year in February but dropped 0.6% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 622,000 units. Building permits, though down 5.7% month over month, rose 6.5% year over year in February.Rising mortgage rates and high prices of homes from inventory squeeze are indeed a bottleneck for buyers (mostly first-time). Apart from concerns over possibilities of a series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders continue to grapple with growing labor shortage, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment. These are keeping homebuilders from responding to growing demand.That said, the homebuilders’ confidence reading for March was a solid 70 buoyed by growing demand. In spite of inventory shortage, robust demand from a solid economy and a cheerful job market are making the industry go strong. With the strong economic fundamentals in place, the overall homebuilding picture is pretty encouraging for 2018.Solid Q1 Earnings ExpectationsMajority of the Zacks broad sectors (14 out of 16) are expected to be in the positive territory in the first quarter of 2018. Notably, homebuilding companies are broadly grouped in the Construction sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and companies seem to be on solid ground.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, construction sector earnings are expected to increase 35.4% in the first quarter compared with 20.6% in the preceding quarter. Revenues are expected to rise 15.8% (13.3% growth in Q4), while margins are likely to grow 1% (0.4% in Q4).In spite of the inventory woes and higher costs, it is a profitable strategy to zero in on a handful of housing stocks that are poised to beat earnings this quarter. An earnings beat would also pave the way for stock price appreciation.Notable Q1 Releases So FarA close look at the recently-released numbers of the nation’s homebuilding bigwigs unveils an encouraging picture. KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) came up with stellar first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on solid fundamentals. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3% and surged 116.7% from the year-ago quarter. Though revenues missed the consensus mark, it increased 6% year over year, driven by higher housing revenues.Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected earnings and sales on solid demand. Notably, the company completed the CalAtlantic buyout in February. Stuart Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Lennar, said, ""Our first quarter results begin to display the true power of this combination.  Although these results do not include 2 ½ months of CalAtlantic's operations, all company metrics have performed as expected or better and we have grown more confident in our ability to exceed our $100 million synergy target in 2018 and we are on track to meet our $365 million synergy target in 2019.""Which Are the Right Picks?Picking the right stocks could be a daunting task given the wide range of companies in the housing space. One way to do it is by choosing stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Winning StocksFor investors ready to try out this strategy, we have highlighted four homebuilding stocks that may stand out this season.Our first choice is PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report). The company primarily engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses in the United States. This leading national homebuilder topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.51%. It also seems to be poised to beat expectations in the to-be-reported quarter. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +4.55%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 44 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.PulteGroup is scheduled to report first-quarter of fiscal 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens.We have chosen Meritage Homes Corporation (MTH  -  Free Report) that designs and builds single-family homes in the United States. The company topped earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 20.22%. It looks poised to beat expectations in the first quarter as well. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +31%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 74 cents.Meritage Homes is slated to report fourth-quarter results on Apr 25, after the closing bell.D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), a leading Texas-based national homebuilder, makes another attractive pick. The company has surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.83%. The company is poised to beat expectations in the to-be-reported quarter as well. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.72%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at 86 cents. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.D.R. Horton is scheduled to report second-quarter of fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26, before market opens.The fourth option is a Denver, CO-based homebuilder M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report) that engages in homebuilding and financial service businesses in the United States. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9.23%. Nonetheless, the company has surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 29.24%.For the upcoming release, M.D.C. Holdings has a Zacks Rank #3 along with an Earnings ESP +1.89%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter earnings is 53 cents.M.D.C. Holdings will likely announce first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell.Bottom LineTaking the recovering economy and solid job market into consideration, one should ideally snap up housing stocks before they release their earnings numbers.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

2191,LEN,"Lennar Corporation’s (LEN  -  Free Report) diversified line of home offerings for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers, and positive housing market fundamentals are the driving factors for this leading homebuilder in the United States. Additionally, synergies from its recent acquisitions are also encouraging.Recently, this leading homebuilder reported stellar first quarter of fiscal 2018 results wherein earnings as well as revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.7% and 3.3%, respectively.The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.11 per share that exclude integration costs related to the acquisition of CalAtlantic Group, Inc. and one-time non-cash write down of deferred tax assets due to reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate. Including these items, the reported figure came in at 53 cents per share in the quarter, increasing considerably from the year-ago profit level of 16 cents per share. The improvement was primarily attributable to greater demand for homes accompanied with higher prices.Total revenues of $2.98 billion increased 28% year over year as the Homebuilding, Financial Services and Multifamily segments performed significantly well.Meanwhile, Lennar’s shares have outperformed its industry year to date. Earnings estimate revisions have been mixed in the past seven days. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 have moved down 2.3% but rose 2.5% for 2019, in the said period. Let’s Take a Look at Lennar’s Key Growth DriversPrudent Strategic Investments: Lennar is one of the well-positioned homebuilders to capitalize on the housing recovery driven by diverse revenue mix, steady top-line performance, above-average order growth and improving SG&A leverage.The company offers a diversified line of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers. Additionally, it regularly upgrades homes to cater to the changing consumer requirements. For example, it introduced NextGen homes, or a home within a home, to allow homebuyers — who need to accommodate children and parents — to share the cost of their mortgage and other living expenses.Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and investments in technology. The company was successful in meeting its target of achieving the lowest SG&A percentage in its history in 2016 and continuing in fiscal 2017 as well. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, SG&A expenses contracted to 9.2% in the fiscal 2017, from 9.4% in the year-ago period.  In the fiscal first quarter, as a percentage of home sales, SG&A expenses declined 60 basis points (bps). Lennar has plans to reduce SG&A expenses to 8.8-9% in fiscal 2018.Importantly, acquisitions form an integral part of Lennar’s growth strategy. These buyouts have enhanced the company’s product portfolio, and expanded its geographic footprint and market share.In February 2017, Lennar acquired WCI. With a portfolio of high quality, low-cost land and 51 communities, the integration is expected to produce strong gross margin going forward. Again, in February 2018, Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc. in a $9.3 billion deal (including debt), which will create one of the country’s top homebuilders. Since the closing of the transaction, Lennar remains confident that the company will exceed its prior $100 million synergy-savings expectations for fiscal 2018 and is on track to meet $365 million synergies for fiscal 2019 as well.Positive Housing Market: Overall fundamentals of the housing market remained positive through 2016 and 2017, and are expected to improve further in 2018. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically low mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory point toward a strong demand in 2018.ConcernsRising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. The company’s gross margin on home sales decreased 90 bps year over year in fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home. Although the company’s gross margin expanded 50 bps year over year, it expects gross margins to have a significantly adverse impact from the CalAtlantic acquisition date through the early part of the fiscal third quarter, as a result of the backlog writeup. Over a five-month period after the closing date of the CalAtlantic transaction, Lennar will only recognize a percentage of the gross margin on the homes it delivered during that time.Nonetheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to benefit in the near term owing to the synergies arising out of the CalAtlantic buyout. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors may consider stocks like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report) and Lyon William Homes (WLH  -  Free Report).KB Home, a Zack Rank #1 stock, surpassed earnings in all of the trailing four quarters with a positive earnings surprise of 19.5%.M.D.C. Holdings holds a Zack Rank #2 (Buy). Its earnings are expected to grow 15.5% in 2018.Lyon William Homes carries a Zacks Rank #2. Its earnings are expected to grow 38.1% this year.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

2192,LEN,"Shares of U.S. industrial giant General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Thomas Edison’s old company, are trading up higher than 6.5% in today’s pre-market on new headlines that the long-beleaguered firm will be spinning off its healthcare business and exiting its position on oil & gas company Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) over the next 2-3 years, reducing its considerable debt by $25 billion in the process. This comes on the very day GE is being replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) on the 30-company blue-chip index.Since he was appointed to take the reins of GE last August, CEO John Flannery has acknowledged the difficulties he had inherited and that he will be focused on turning its core businesses around. Since then, and despite GE stock having gone south by roughly 50% year over year, it would appear he has stayed true to his word. The company focus will now be in the realms of Power (with a particular interest in renewable energy such as wind turbines) and Aviation.

This compares to earnings of $0.91 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 251.11%.

2195,LEN,"D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 31, before the opening bell.The homebuilder delivered in-line earnings last quarter. The company surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 5.01%.Like other homebuilders, D.R. Horton is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically low interest/mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory, point at strong demand in 2017.Resultantly, the company’s share price has increased more than 41% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s 29.9% rally. Let’s See How Things Are Shaping Up for Q1Recently, D.R. Horton updated it guidance for fiscal 2018 tax rate. The company now expects it to be 26%. It will be taking approximately $115 million non-cash charge in Q1 due to a change in the Federal tax code. The company expects 25% tax rate for fiscal 2019.Let’s take a look at the other metrics of the company, i.e. revenues, order growth and gross margin. D.R. Horton, one of the top builders in the United States, now expects its backlog conversion rate for the first quarter to be in the range of 83-86%. This compares favorably with the year-ago level of 82%.The company’s homebuilding revenues increased 11.4% year over year in the preceding quarter. However, for the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues (comprising about 98% of total revenues) of $3,189 million indicates a decrease from $4,067 million in the last quarter and $4,066.5 million in the year-ago period. This downside may be due to the weather issues.Net sales orders increased 18% to 10,333 homes on continued improvement in the preceding quarter. For the upcoming release, the consensus estimate for net sales orders were 10,477 units compared with 9,241 units a year ago. Home closings is estimated to be 10,470 units compared with 13,165 units in the preceding quarter and 9,404 units a year-ago.On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $85 million indicates a decrease from $93 million in the prior quarter and $92.6 million a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $3.28 billion, implying 12.8% year-over-year growth.Now, for the company’s gross margin, D.R. Horton expects home sales gross margin to be around 20%. In the year-ago quarter, it was 19.8% in the preceding quarter, the company’s gross margin on home sales contracted 10 basis points (bps) year over year to 20.3%. Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) among others.For SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, the company expects it to be in the range of 9.5-9.8%. This compares with the year-ago level of 9.5%.Nonetheless, D.R. Horton remains well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Overall, for the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 63 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 14.6% year over year.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.D.R.

2197,LEN,"Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, sank more than expected in May 2018, marking the second consecutive monthly downfall. It seems that a flourishing economy is giving little boost to the traditional spring homebuying season as supply shortage, higher home prices and rising mortgage rates are somewhat creating hurdles for buyers.Key Takeaways: Tight Supply Continues to UpsetThe National Association of Realtors (“NAR”) said on Wednesday that existing home sales slipped 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.43 million units (5.53 million expected) last month from a downwardly revised 5.45 million in April.Existing home sales decreased 3% on a year-on-year basis in May. This is the third straight month of yearly declines.Regionally, sales were mixed. Sales in the Northeast rose 4.6%, but that was the only region to register an increase. In the Midwest,South and in the West, sales dipped 2.3%, 0.4%, and 0.8%, respectively.Sales grew in the Northeast, which accounts for a small fraction of the market, but it dropped in the West, South and Midwest.Meanwhile, May’s median sales price grew 4.9% from the comparable period a year ago to an all-time high $264,800, marking the 75th straight month of year-over-year gains.Again, inventory continued to slip, leaving less homes for future sales. The supply of existing homes decreased 6.1% from the year-ago period. However, housing inventory increased 2.8% from April. It would take just 4.1 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR.Current Mortgage Rates & ViewsAccording to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage moved higher to their second highest level this year. It rose eight basis points to an average of 4.62% for the week ending Jun 14, 2018, following a decline for two straight weeks.Meanwhile, last week, the Federal Reserve hiked funds rate for the second time this year as expected by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2%. Moreover, chances of two more rate hikes this year are high. Hence, mortgage rates are expected to surge further and dilute demand.Rising mortgage rates and high prices of homes from inventory squeeze are indeed creating hurdles for buyers (mostly first-time). In May, first-time buyers comprised 31% of sales, which is down from both a year ago and prior month level of 33%.That said, Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, believes, “Incredibly low supply continues to be the primary impediment to more sales, but there’s no question the combination of higher prices and mortgage rates are pinching the budgets of prospective buyers, and ultimately keeping some from reaching the market.”He further added that a solid U.S. economy accompanied with a healthy labor market should help the housing market reap better gains going forward than what has been seen so far this year.Builder Confidence SlipsThough consumer demand is still robust, we cannot ignore the current headwinds that are restricting the industry. The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped in June to the lowest level this year and below its six-month average of 70 as tariffs on lumber and other imported materials are coming in the way of buyers’ affordability, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.Tariffs on Canadian lumber are pushing up the already high cost for wood, which are fueling prices higher of up to $9,000 for a new single-family home, according to the National Association of Homebuilders.In addition to the Trump administration's 20% tariff on imported Canadian lumber, imposed in January, the U.S. Government’s recent move of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum has also stirred concerns among investors about the construction sector. According to an Associated Builders and Contractors’ (“ABC”) analysis of information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, May construction material prices increased 2.2% month over month, representing the largest monthly increase in 10 years (since May 2008). On a year-over-year basis, the price of construction materials increased 8.8%.Our TakeInnumerable problems have been slowing down the homebuilding industry , as evident from the 18.7% year-to-date decline against a 3.7% rise of the S&P 500 Composite. Even big names like Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup (PHM  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and NVR Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) have plunged 17.4%, 17.4%, 11.7%, 17.5% and 11.6%, respectively, so far this year.Though homebuilders admit to rising labor shortage and land/labor costs, they remain optimistic about a measured recovery this year in tandem with steady economic growth. The housing industry is cyclical and affected by consumer confidence levels, prevailing economic conditions and interest rates. Although rising interest and mortgage rates, land and labor shortages, and rising material prices raise concerns, the 2018 outlook for homebuilding seems to be solid given strong economic growth and labor market, and a lower tax rate.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2198,LEN,"The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped in June to the lowest level this year and below its six-month average of 70 as tariffs on lumber and other imported materials are coming in the way of buyers’ affordability, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.Shares of homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers (TOL  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) fell 1.6%, 2.1%, 2.4% and 1.6%, respectively, on Monday. Apart from builders’ perception, looming trade war concerns after China's retaliation to U.S. tariffs pulled Wall Street down modestly yesterday.Nonetheless, homebuilders remain confident about the upcoming period, given the robust consumer demand.Key TakeawaysHomebuilder sentiment fell two points in June to 68 and all three indices — present sales, future sales and buyer traffic — declined one point. In the words of NAHB Chairman Randy Noel, a custom homebuilder from LaPlace, LA, ""builders are increasingly concerned that tariffs placed on Canadian lumber and other imported products are hurting housing affordability. Record-high lumber prices have added nearly $9,000 to the price of a new single-family home since January 2017.""Notably, all three Housing Market Index components fell one point in June. Current sales conditions decreased to 75. Buyer traffic decreased to 50 and sales prediction over the next six months slipped to 76.Meanwhile, challenges like inventory shortage are still prevailing in the U.S. real estate market and creating upward pressure on prices in several parts of the country, thereby affecting affordability. Additionally, mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U.S. government bond yields, in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed. Rising mortgage rates may dilute demand for new homes.Construction Prices Are SoaringApart from tariffs on lumber, the U.S. Government’s recent move of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum has also stirred concerns among investors about the construction sector. According to an Associated Builders and Contractors (“ABC”) analysis of information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, May construction material prices increased 2.2% month over month, representing the largest monthly increase in 10 years (since May 2008). On a year-over-year basis, the price of construction materials increased 8.8%.ABC Chief Economist Anirban Basu is concerned about rapidly rising construction materials prices and stated that current solid economic expansion may eventually disappear as inflationary pressures become increasingly apparent. He added that real estate and construction cycles are particularly vulnerable to increases in borrowing costs.Myriad problems have been decelerating the homebuilding industry of late, as evident from the 17.1% year-to-date decline against a 4.1% rise of the S&P 500 Composite. Even big names like Lennar, D.R. Horton, PulteGroup (PHM  -  Free Report), KB Home and NVR Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) have plunged 17.9%, 17.9%, 10.9%, 19.6% and 11.5%, respectively, so far this year.Robust Demand Raises HopeDespite June’s drop, NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz remains optimistic about the industry given solid housing demand (mainly for single-family construction), improved economic growth and continued job creation.Regionally, on a three-month moving average, builder sentiment in the Northeast rose 2 points to 57, while the West and Midwest remained unchanged at 76 and 65, respectively. Sentiment in the South fell 1 point to 71.It is to be noted that any reading above 50 indicates that more builders expect sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has remained above 60 since September 2016. Growth is expected to accelerate in the coming period as the industry starts to feel the impact of bigger after-tax paychecks along with a strong job market.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2202,LEN,"Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) surpassed earnings as well as revenue expectations in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.The company’s first-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.11 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents by 20.7%. The reported figure mainly includes integration costs related to the acquisition of CalAtlantic Group, Inc. and one-time non-cash write down of deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate. Including these items, the reported figure came in at 53 cents per share in the quarter, increasing considerably from the year-ago profit level of 16 cents per share.The improvement was primarily attributable to greater demand for homes accompanied with higher prices.Total revenues of $2.98 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89 billion. Revenues also increased 28% year over year as the Homebuilding, Financial Services, Rialto and Multifamily segments performed significantly well.CalAtlantic AcquisitionIn February, Lennar completed its strategic acquisition of CalAtlantic. Its first-quarter results benefited from this integration, as well as a strong economy and an improving job market. The company remains enthusiastic about its current results as well as future expectations, owing to this takeover.Stuart Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Lennar, said, ""Our first quarter results begin to display the true power of this combination.  Although these results do not include 2 ½ months of CalAtlantic's operations, all company metrics have performed as expected or better and we have grown more confident in our ability to exceed our $100 million synergy target in 2018 and we are on track to meet our $365 million synergy target in 2019.""Lennar Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Lennar Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lennar Corporation Quote Segment DetailsHomebuilding: The segment’s revenues increased 34% from the prior-year quarter to $2.66 billion, driven by higher number of homes delivered and higher average selling prices. Within the Homebuilding umbrella, home sales constituted $2.65 billion (up 33.5% year over year) and land sales accounted for $13 million (down 63%).New home orders increased 30% from the year-ago quarter to 8,456 in the fiscal first quarter.

This was due to an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered and increased volume.As a percentage of home sales, SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses declined 60 bps to 9.7% from 10.3% a year ago. The improvement was due to improved operating leverage, owing to higher home deliveries.Financial Services: Financial Services revenues increased 15.6% to $171.1 million in the quarter.

2203,LEN,"As expected, the Federal Reserve hiked funds rate for the second time this year by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2%. Moreover, chances of two more rate hikes this year are high. The rate hike was imminent given the solid economic scenario backed by low unemployment and solid wage growth along with a rise in prices.The unemployment rate fell to an 18-year low in May to 3.8% from the previous month. For the first time since 2000, the number of job openings now exceeds the number of workers to fill in the positions. Fed expects the rate of unemployment rate to be 3.6% this year, down from 3.8% expected earlier.A tight labor market invariably leads to an increase in wages, with total wages up 2.7% in the last 12 months. Again, more income in the hands of individuals leads to increased demand for goods and services which in turn leads to higher prices. In the 12-month period through May, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was up 2.8%, its biggest year-on-year rise since early 2012. The core CPI measure, which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, rose 2.2% from May 2017. Fed expects inflation to rise 2.1% for this year through 2020.Therefore, to put a check on inflation, an interest hike was quite imperative. Though an increase in interest rates increases the cost of borrowing, Fed officials are confident that the economy won’t be affected by higher borrowing costs. The committee sees economic growth of 2.8% for 2018, highlighting an increase of 0.1 percentage point from the estimates issued in March 2018.Impact of Rising Rates on HomebuildersWith two more hikes expected this year along with three in 2019, investors in the housing space are jittery. Shares of prominent homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers (TOL  -  Free Report) lost around 4% while that of PulteGroup (PHM  -  Free Report) fell 6.7% and KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) slipped about 7%.A hike in the benchmark Federal Funds’ target rate will probably lead to a rise in mortgage rates in the remainder of 2018 or thereafter. High mortgage rates dilute demand for new homes as mortgage loans become expensive. This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes, revenues and profits of homebuilders.Will This Lower Affordability?The rise in interest rates comes at a time when home prices are increasing owing to supply constraints and increased raw materials costs. Builders are spooked by higher aluminum and steel costs, thanks to the newly-imposed tariffs. This coupled with increased lumber prices owing to an import tariff is denting builders’ margins, prompting them to bump up prices. Further, troubles like labor shortage and limited land availability continue to make things difficult.Additionally, the rise in mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are taking baby steps into the housing market. Higher interest rates will only flare up such issues but will also delay home purchases by millennials.Total mortgage applications fell 1.5% in the week ending Jun 8 as is evident from the latest Mortgage Bankers Association report. Purchase applications for new loans fell 2% from the previous week, while refinance applications plunged 2%.Are Housing Stocks a Safe Shelter Now?Though myriad problems have been decelerating the homebuilding industry of late, as is evident from the 17.2% year-to-date decline against a 3.9% rise of the S&P 500 Composite, the larger picture is convincingly strong.Consumer demand is robust as is evident from the new home sales data that point to an 11.6% increase year over year in April despite the month-to-month irregularity. Housing starts were up 10.5% from April 2017 buoyed by a 7.2% increase in single-family homes and a 19.1% rise in apartments. Again, permits were 7.7% above the April 2017 level prompted by a 7.9% rise in single-family homes and 6.4% growth in buildings with five units or more. Also, builder confidence remained above 50 in the first five months of 2018, indicative of a favorable outlook.The solid momentum is expected to continue in the rest of 2018, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence.Picking the Right StocksInvestors can consider four homebuilding stocks that are currently trading at a discount and have ample room to run.

2204,LEN,"Yesterday, at its policy meeting, the Fed went ahead with its highly anticipated move of hiking the interest rates by 25 basis points. While the policy makers were happy about a strong U.S. economy, the rate hike raised eyebrows in the housing market.  Shares of home builders — PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) — tanked 6.67% 4.01%, 4.32%, 4.25%, respectively, following the news release, on concerns that increasing interest rates might ruin the affordability of home buyers in the form of higher interest cost on home mortgages. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Fed Raises Interest RatesAgainst the backdrop of declining employment rates and faster-than-anticipated increase in interest rate beyond the 2% threshold level, the fed funds rate was pulled up for the second time this year.Moreover, the dot plot of the Fed the policy makers hinted at a step up in the pace of rate hike, with two more upward moves for the balance of the year compared with the previous plan of one more. The Fed also sees three rate hikes in 2019.Rising Interest Rate to Impact AffordabilityMortgage rate, which loosely follows the yield on the 10-year Treasury, started the year at around 4% but began rising thereafter. Mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U.S. government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed.There seems no respite for mortgage rates as the Fed continues with its aggressive policy moves. High mortgage rates dilute demand for new homes, as mortgage loans become expensive. This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes, revenues and profits of homebuilders.The rise in interest rates looks all the more unwelcoming for the industry, which is already facing higher house demand and constrained supply.  This phenomenon might pinch first-time homebuyers the most.         Consequently, higher mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are trying to make their dream come true of owing a house. Nevertheless, higher interest rates will only act as a dampener in this case.High Input Prices Pose Another ConcernHigh input prices, which include raw material, wages and land cost, have caused an escalation in the end prices of house and at the same time shrink margins of homebuilders.Median price of existing homes was higher for the sixth straight year in 2017. April median sales were up for the 74th consecutive year.This shows continued pain for both hombuilders as well as buyers.Already Soft SalesHome sales have not been really encouraging so far this year, which to a certain extent reflects the struggles of the industry. Per the most recent data for the month of April, sales of new U.S. single-family homes were down in three of the last four reported months.Sales of newly constructed single-family homes, accounting roughly 10% of all U.S. home sales, dropped 1.5% sequentially in April, along with a downward revision in sales for three months prior to that.The Pending Home Sales Index, a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, decreased 1.3% sequentially to 106.4 in April, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline. The index is also down 2.1% year over year.Housing starts and building permits also fell in two of the last four reported months.Year to date, the industry has fallen by 13.5% compared with the 4.3% growth in S&P 500 Composite.Bottom LineNevertheless, a strong U.S. economy and favorable employment picture should offset some of the weakness in the housing industry.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2205,LEN,"United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) shares have rallied 54.7% in the past year, outperforming the 20% gain of the industry it belongs to. Being the largest equipment rental company in the world, United Rentals enjoys strong brand recognition, enabling it to draw more customers and build customer loyalty.The price performance of the company is backed by an impressive earnings history. United Rentals surpassed earnings estimates consistently in eight of the past nine quarters. Moreover, earnings estimates have risen in the past few weeks, suggesting bullish sentiments on United Rentals.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rose 2.4% and that of 2.6% for 2019. This bullish trend justifies the stock’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. What Makes United Rentals a Solid Pick?Solid Growth Prospects: The company’s main strategy is to improve profitability by providing superior standard of service to customers, optimizing customer mix and fleet mix, strategic acquisitions to expand core equipment rental business, along with continued expansion of trench, power and pump footprint and tools offerings. In particular, United Rentals’ strategy calls for the implementation of Project XL, which is a set of eight specific work streams focused on driving profitable growth through revenue opportunities and generating incremental profitability via cost savings.The company has a robust earnings growth profile. The company’s earnings grew 23% per year on an average over the last three years (as of 2017). The company’s top line also increased 10% per year on an average over the same time period. The company has gradually increased its industrial exposure along with non-cyclical specialty acquaintance.United Rentals has solid growth prospects, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.53 per share for the current year, which is expected to grow 46.3% year over year (higher than the industry average of 29.3%). Meanwhile, the company’s sales are expected to increase 13.9% in 2018, higher than the industry average of 4.6%.Expansion Via Acquisitions: United Rentals is expanding its geographic borders and product portfolio through acquisitions and joint ventures. In March 2018, United Rentals acquired the assets of Industrial Rental Services, a leading U.S. provider of two-way radio solutions and industrial blinds, primarily in the Gulf and West Coast regions. The acquisition expands United Rentals’ Tool Solutions specialty rental fleet by more than 35,000 isolation blinds, flanges and racking systems for industrial applications as well as approximately 16,000 radios, repeaters and accessories for plant maintenance, and construction personnel.The two most important acquisitions made in 2017 were of Neff Corporation and NES Rentals. Neff Corporation enhanced the company’s earthmoving equipment and efficiencies of scale in key market areas. On the other hand, the acquisition of NES Rentals expanded United Rentals’ geographic footprint in key markets like East Coast, Gulf States and Midwest, and further established the company as an aerial supplier.United Rentals’ adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 140 basis points year over year in the last reported quarter, as it continues to benefit from its integration of two sizable 2017 acquisitions, namely NES and Neff.Valuation Looks Rational: United Rentals has a Value Style Score of A, putting it in the top 20% of all the stocks we cover from this perspective.The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 13.9, below the industry’s average of 20.8x. This indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. Also, the company has a forward P/E ratio of 10.6, lower than the industry average of 17x, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term.Also, the company currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.5, below the industry average of 27.5x.Positive Construction Market: Demand for United Rentals’ products is largely related to the performance of the broader construction market. Per the latest report from the United States Department of Commerce, construction spending in April surged to its highest settlement since January 2016. This also marks its biggest increase since 2012. Per the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Commercial Construction Index, 93% of the total contracts in the country would witness a surge in profit margins by 2019.As such, demand for United Rentals’ products should increase as well, thereby driving its revenues. Also, the industry to which it belongs has a decent industry rank (among the top 12% out of 265 industries), signaling that companies in this space are likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report), Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) and Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report).Century Communities sports a Zacks Rank #1 and its earnings for the current year are likely to increase 47%.Beazer Homes is a Zacks Rank #2 stock and its earnings for the current quarter are expected to grow 78.3%.Lennar carries a Zacks Rank #2 and its fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to grow 18.4%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

2206,LEN,"Undeniably, the overall outlook for the U.S. housing industry remains positive, with a healthy economy and strong job market helping the demand side of the equation. Conversely, the limited supply of homes for sale, rising rates and higher material prices have spurred concerns among investors regarding certain U.S. sectors, particularly construction.The share price performance has not been an encouraging one for the homebuilding industry in the past three months. However, despite belonging to the same industry, M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report) has managed to navigate smoothly. The industry has witnessed a fall of 7.9% against the S&P 500’s gain of 0.8%. Meanwhile, M.D.C. Holdings’ shares have rallied 12.7% in the same time frame.Hence, this homebuilder is one such company that continues to display strength in several areas. Adding the stock to your portfolio should not be a disappointment. Earnings estimates for M.D.C. Holdings have exhibited an uptrend, reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2018 and 2019 earnings has also moved up 12.3% and 11%, respectively, over the past 60 days. Let us delve deeper into the other factors that make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock a profitable pick. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. What Makes M.D.C. Holdings a Solid Pick?Lucrative Growth Prospects: Presently, the problem of adequate supply of land is taking its worst shape, as demand continues to scale up in the homebuilding industry. Given significant pent-up housing demand, M.D.C. Holdings has secured a decent backlog. At the end of the first quarter, potential housing revenues from backlog grew 18% year over year to $1.88 billion (as of Mar 31, 2018). Meanwhile, net new orders were up 15% year over year in values.Meanwhile, the rising land and labor costs are threatening margins of major homebuilders. In this respect, the company has managed to control costs prudently, as is evident from its gross margin expansion. The company’s home sales gross margin expanded by a whopping 230 basis points in the first quarter.Overall, the company reported robust first-quarter results, with its bottom line increasing 70% year over year to 68 cents per share. The quarter benefited from solid top-line growth, a significant expansion of gross margin and much lower effective tax rate.M.D.C. Holdings has solid growth prospects, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.37 per share for the current year, which is expected to grow 30.6% year over year. Meanwhile, the company’s sales are expected to increase 14.9% in 2018.Solid Industry Fundamentals: There’s no denying that the steel and aluminum tariffs, announced by President Trump, along with rising interest rates are expected to create headwinds. In contrast, the overall outlook for the residential construction industry remains positive, with a healthy economy and strong job market continuing to drive stocks higher. The positive momentum is evident from the robust Zacks Industry Rank (Top 24% out of 256 industries) that instills optimism surrounding the housing stocks’ earnings prospects.Solid Dividend Yield: Given the robust fundamental backdrop, which is expected to be further strengthened over the course of this year, it is best to pick the ones that have high yields and pay dividends consistently.In this regard, M.D.C. Holdings has a robust annualized dividend yield of 3.79%, considering the company’s closing price of $31.77 on Jun 5. The company’s dividend payments increased 30.7% year over year to $16.9 million at the end of first-quarter 2018.Valuation Looks Rational: Because of homebuilders’ asset-driven nature, it makes sense to value them based on price-to-book (P/B) ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.25. This is lower compared with the current P/B for the industry and S&P 500 that are pegged at 1.4 and 3.9, respectively. Its lower-than-market positioning indicates that there is room for an upside in the quarters ahead, substantiating its Value Score of A.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report), Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) and Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report).Century Communities sports a Zacks Rank #1 and its earnings for the current year are likely to increase 47%.Beazer Homes is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock and its earnings for the current quarter are expected to grow 78.3%.Lennar carries a Zacks Rank #2 and its fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to grow 18.4%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2208,LEN,"Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 26, before the opening bell. Lennar has been showcasing solid top-line performances and the trend is supposed to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well, courtesy of robust demand for homes, favorable job market and impressive economic conditions.Let’s take a look at how the company's margin is shaping up for this earnings season.Lennar Corporation Gross Margin (TTM)  Lennar Corporation Gross Margin (TTM) | Lennar Corporation QuoteGross Margin: Despite an impressive revenue performance, Lennar and a number of renowned homebuilders have been under pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins. On one hand, labor shortages are leading to higher wages and on the other, land prices are inflating due to limited availability.That said, Lennar has managed to boost its margin in the last reported quarter, courtesy of an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered and increased volume. Adjusted gross margin on home sales expanded 50 basis points (bps) to 21.6%.Meanwhile, in February 2018, Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc. in a $9.3-billion deal (including debt), which is expected to position Lennar among one of the country’s top three homebuilders in 24 of the top 30 U.S. markets.Now, as part of the CalAtlantic acquisition, the company needs to evaluate the assets and liabilities acquired, and record them at fair value on the acquisition date. These adjustments will include, but not be limited to, adjustments to inventory, investments in unconsolidated entities, other assets, goodwill and debt. The company had earlier warned that some of these adjustments will impact gross margins, going forward. There will be a more significant impact on gross margins from the acquisition date through the early part of fiscal third quarter, as a result of the backlog writeup that is required for homes that have already been sold.In the first quarter, the adjustments had negatively impacted gross margin by 210 bps, thereby bringing down gross margin from 21.6% to 19.5%. The company expects gross margin to be impacted by approximately 750-800 bps in the second quarter and 100-150 bps in the third quarter, as a result of the adjustments.SG&A Expenses: Meanwhile, Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG&A line via operating leverage and investments in technology. Notably, in the last reported quarter, SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenues from home sales, came in at 9.7%, improving 60 bps year over year. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Operating Margin: Lennar anticipates full-year operating margin to be in the range of 12.5-13.25%. Overall, the increase in volume is expected to have a positive impact on operating margin. However, lower gross margin owing to the CalAtlantic deal will likely have a negative impact on operating margin.Overall, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is expected to witness lower gross margin and earnings in the fiscal second quarter, owing to merger-related costs. Nonetheless, Lennar’s diligent efforts to improve operating efficiency via digital marketing strategies, dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives are expected to offset the headwinds to some extent.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsOverall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents for second-quarter earnings reflects 50.6% decrease from the prior-year period’s profit of 91 cents per share. Meanwhile, the consensus mark for revenues of $5.23 billion represents a 60.4% increase on a year-over-year basis.(Read More: Will Higher Housing Demand Aid Lennar's Q2 Earnings?).Lennar’s shares have declined 13.5% in the past three months, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s 11% decline. Earnings estimates for the fiscal second quarter and 2018 have remained stable in the past 60 days, limiting the stock’s upside potential for future earnings. Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are M.D.C.

2209,LEN,"Sales of previously owned homes jumped in February, marking the first gain in the last three months. This means that more Americans are looking to buy homes despite rising prices and a limited availability of homes.Exchange traded funds or ETFs that track the homebuilding industry jumped on Wednesday, after the news release. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) gained 1.6% while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) increased 0.9%. Meanwhile, PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) was up 0.7%.Shares of prominent homebuilders such as Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) surged 3.7%, 2.9%, 2.1%, 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively, in the last session.Now, as the Federal Reserve (Fed) has adopted a more hawkish stance, do investors need to worry about the momentum of the U.S. housing market? The latest positive housing data undoubtedly reassures the industry’s strength courtesy of solid economic growth amid supply shortages.February Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales increased 3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units from 5.38 million in January. Sales increased 1.1% from the year-ago level. This surge in existing-home sales (accounting for 90% of the market) after declining sales in the last two months indicates that competition will heat up during the traditional spring home-buying season.Regionally, sales were mixed. Sales in the Northeast and Midwest plunged 12.3% and 2.4%, respectively. However, sales surged 11.4% in the West and increased 6.6% in the Midwest.Meanwhile, February’s median sales price grew 5.9% from the comparable period a year ago to $241,700, marking the 72nd straight month of year-over-year gains.Again, inventory continued to slip, leaving less homes for future sales. The supply of existing homes decreased 8.1% from the year-ago period. However, housing inventory increased 4.6% from January. It would take just 3.4 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR.Fed’s Hawkish Stance: A Boon or Bane for Housing?As expected, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75% in its first policy meeting under the new chief Jerome Powell, on March 21. The central bank also indicated that there will be at least two more hikes for 2018, highlighting its rising confidence that tax cuts and government spending will boost the economy. Fed officials see a stronger U.S. economy and signaled a slightly faster pace of interest rate hikes in the coming years.Meanwhile, according to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage moved higher for the fifth straight month to 4.33% in February (highest since 4.34% in April 2014) from 4.03% in January.Rising mortgage rates and high prices of homes from inventory squeeze are indeed creating hurdles for buyers (mostly first-time buyers). In February, first-time buyers comprised 29% of sales, which is down from 31% a year ago but unchanged from the prior month. However, NAR holds a bullish stance stating that a solid U.S. economy accompanied with a healthy labor market will help the housing market reap solid gains.Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, pointed out, “Mortgage rates are at their highest level in nearly four years, at a time when home prices are still climbing at double the pace of wage growth.” He further added, “Homes for sale are going under contract a week faster than a year ago, which is quite remarkable given weakening affordability conditions and extremely tight supply. To fully satisfy demand, most markets right now need a substantial increase in new listings.”Latest homebuilders’ confidence reading for March was also solid at 70 fueled by growing consumer demand. In spite of shortage in inventory, robust demand from a solid economy and cheerful job market is keeping the industry alive. With these strong economic fundamentals in place, the overall homebuilding picture is pretty encouraging for 2018.Notably, following the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the Fed now expects faster economic growth of 2.7% this year, up from the forecast of 2.5% in December. For 2019, GDP growth is now expected to be 2.4%, up from the previously projected 2.1%. The Fed now projects the unemployment rate to fall to 3.8% this year from the present rate of 4.1%, which is a positive for the housing industry.4 Homebuilding Stocks to Bet OnWe have zeroed in on four homebuilding stocks that are worth investing in with solid growth potential amid above-mentioned woes.Meritage Homes Corporation (MTH  -  Free Report) is one of the leading homebuilders in the United States.

2211,LEN,"Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 4, before market open. Lennar has been exhibiting solid top-line performances and the trend is expected to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well, thanks to the strong demand for homes, favorable job market and impressive economic conditions.Let’s take a look at how the company's margin is shaping up for this earnings season.Gross Margin: Unlike an impressive revenue performance, Lennar and a number of renowned homebuilders have been under pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins. On the one hand, labor shortages are leading to higher wages and on the other, land prices are inflating due to limited availability.Lennar’s gross margin on home sales decreased 90 basis points or bps year over year in the fourth quarter as well as fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home. This trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, in February 2018, Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc. in a $9.3 billion deal (including debt), which is expected to put Lennar among one of the country’s top three home builders in 24 of the top 30 U.S. markets.Now, as part of the CalAtlantic acquisition, the company needs to evaluate the assets and liabilities acquired and record them at fair value on the acquisition date. These adjustments will include, but not be limited to, adjustments to inventory, investments in unconsolidated entities, other assets, goodwill and debt. The company had earlier warned that some of these adjustments will impact its gross margins going forward. There will be a more significant impact to gross margins from the acquisition date through the early part of fiscal third quarter, as a result of the backlog writeup that is required for homes that have already been sold.Lennar Corporation Gross Margin (TTM)  Lennar Corporation Gross Margin (TTM) | Lennar Corporation QuoteSG&A Expenses: Meanwhile, Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and investments in technology. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, SG&A expenses contracted to 9.2% in the fiscal 2017 from 9.4% in the year-ago period, due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries. Notably, in the last reported quarter, SG&A expenses came in at 8.4%, marking the lowest fourth quarter in the company's history. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Operating Margin: Lennar anticipates full-year operating margins to match the fiscal 2017 level of 12.9%. Seasonality will impact operating margin in the upcoming quarters, with the first quarter being the lowest. However, with the increase in volumes throughout the year, operating margin is expected to show improvement. Overall, Lennar expects operating margin to be fairly consistent with the prior year in each quarter of fiscal 2018.Meanwhile, the synergies of CalAtlantic combination will lower direct construction costs, reduce cycle times, leverage SG&A and increase sales base, all of which are expected to boost profitability and internal rate of return on invested capital.Overall, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is expected to witness lower gross margin in the fiscal first quarter, owing to higher construction costs. Nonetheless, Lennar’s diligent efforts to improve its operating efficiency via digital marketing strategies, dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives are expected to offset the headwinds, thereby driving growth for this homebuilder.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsOverall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents for first-quarter earnings reflects 39% growth from the prior-year period’s profit of 59 cents per share. Also, the consensus mark for revenues of $2.65 billion represents a 13.5% increase on a year-over-year basis.(Read More: Lennar to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).Lennar’s shares have gained 6.5% in the last six months, outperforming 1.8% growth of its industry. That said, earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter and fiscal 2018 have been trending upward, increasing 2.5% each for both the periods in the last 60 days. This reflects analysts’ confidence in the company’s future earnings. Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are Beazer Homes USA, Inc.

2212,LEN,"We still have a few more weeks to go before the big banks start reporting June-quarter results. But the Q2 reporting cycle has (officially) gotten underway, with results from 9 S&P 500 members already out. All of these early earnings releases are from companies that have fiscal quarters ending in May, but these get counted as part of the June-quarter tally.We have another 11 index members with fiscal quarters ending in May on deck to report results this week. All in all, we will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members by the time JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) (unofficially) kick-off this earnings season on July 13th.The notable earnings reports coming out this week include:Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) reports on Tuesday (6/26) before the market’s open, with the homebuilder expected to earn $0.45 per share in earnings on $5.23 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.91 per share on $3.26 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock was up big following the last earnings release, but overall it has been a tough period for Lennar shares as well as the broader homebuilder space.Lennar shares are currently trading close to 52-week lows and are now down -18.8% since the start of the year, underperforming the Zacks Construction sector’s -8.1% year-to-date decline vs. the S&P 500 index’s +4% gain. KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which is scheduled to report results Thursday morning (06/28) is down even more than Lennar (down -19.9% YTD).    General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) reports on Wednesday (6/27) morning, with the company expected to earn $0.75 per share on $3.91 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.73 per share on $3.81 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. Estimates have come down a bit in recent days and the stock has lost ground following each of the last two earnings reports. The stock was down big in the run up to and the day of the last earning release on March 21st and has essentially remained flat since then. General Mills shares are currently down -22.3% since the start of the year, underperforming the struggling Consumer Staples sector’s -10.3% year-to-date decline.Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) reports after the market’s close on Thursday (6/28), with the company expected to earn $0.64 in EPS on $9.39 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.60 EPS on $8.68 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock was down following each of the last three earning releases, but has been an impressive performer this year, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector as well as the broader market. Nike shares are currently trading close to their 52-high and are up +18.6% vs. the Consumer Discretionary sector’s +4.7% year-to-date period.Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) will report before the market’s open on Thursday (6/28), with the company expected to earn $1.71 per share in earnings on $10.02 billion in revenues, up +12.5% and +13% from the year-earlier period, respectively. Accenture has been spotlighting its opportunity in the digital, cloud and security areas in recent quarters and revenues from those areas should show strong momentum in this release as well. Management’s commentary about technology spending trends typically has read through for IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The stock was down big following the last quarterly release on March 22nd, but has recovered since then and is currently up +4.9% in the year-to-date period.The chart below of weekly reporting calendar for the S&P 500 index clearly shows that we still have another three weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season really takes off.Expectations for Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +18.5% from the same period last year on +7.9% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors. This would follow +24.6% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +8.6%, the highest growth in almost 7 years.The chart below plots the evolution of Q2 earnings growth expectations. As you can see, the growth rate has ticked up a bit, partly reflecting results from the 9 S&P 500 members that have reported results already. But even after accounting for the results that have come out, Q2 estimates revisions are nowhere near the impressive positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season.A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes, which was obviously a one-off development. Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes, we would have seen only EPS estimates go up, with no changes to revenue estimates. But that wasn’t the case, as revenue estimates had gone up as well, which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction.But as the chart above shows, we didn’t see much in positive revisions. In other words, while the overall growth picture remains very strong – there is no other way to describe +18.5% quarterly earnings growth - there is not much improvement in expectations for Q2 and beyond. The recent strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend.This flattish aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding, June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 7 sectors. The sectors enjoying positive revisions in the aggregate include Technology, Energy, Medical, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, Business Services, and Retail. Estimates have gone up the most for the Energy sector, reflecting momentum in oil prices. Excluding the gains made in the Energy sector, the aggregate revisions picture for the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q1.The Earnings Growth PeakThe chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 quarters.Please note that while the Q2 growth pace represents a deceleration from the preceding quarter’s impressive level, the overall level of total earnings is in record territory, as the chart below shows.The two charts above provide different answers to the ‘peak earnings’ question. The first chart shows that the growth rate likely peaked in 2018 Q1, while dollar earnings aren’t expected to ‘peak’ till the last quarter of 2018. Even with respect to the growth rate, it is very much possible that final growth rates for Q2 and Q3 may surpass what we saw in Q1.We should keep in mind that this earnings cycle got underway back in 2009 when the U.S. economy got out of its last recession. By this time, earnings growth should have come down to the historical ‘normalized’ pace in the mid-single digits level. The reason we have these impressive growth numbers and positive revisions trend is thanks mostly to the effect of the tax cuts, which will start wearing off towards the end of 2019.In other words, earnings likely haven’t peaked yet. But with this cycle so long in tooth, we are steadily moving towards that stage.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>Here is a list of the 36 companies including 11 S&P 500 and reporting this week.Company Ticker Current Qtr Year-Ago Qtr Last EPS Surprise % Report Day Time CARNIVAL CORPCCL0.60.5220.93%MondayBTOIHS MARKIT LTDINFO0.460.4212.82%TuesdayBTOLENNAR CORP -ALEN0.450.9120.65%TuesdayBTOJINKOSOLAR HLDGJKS0.070.28-47.83%TuesdayBTOFACTSET RESHFDS2.141.853.41%TuesdayBTOSCHNITZER STEELSCHN1.250.56-1.10%TuesdayBTOAEROVIRONMENTAVAV0.521.30.00%TuesdayAMCDANAOS CORPDAC0.180.2233.33%TuesdayAMCDETERMINE INCDTRM-0.13-0.129.41%TuesdayAMCSONIC CORPSONC0.490.4313.33%TuesdayAMCGENL MILLSGIS0.750.730.00%WednesdayBTOPAYCHEX INCPAYX0.610.541.61%WednesdayBTOUNIFIRST CORPUNF1.561.3628.97%WednesdayBTOEROS INTL PLCEROS0.15-0.04-50.00%WednesdayBTOPIER 1 IMPORTSPIR-0.4-0.0416.67%WednesdayAMCNOVAGOLD RSRCSNG-0.02-0.03-50.00%WednesdayAMCBED BATH&BEYONDBBBY0.320.584.96%WednesdayAMCFRANKLIN COVEYFC-0.23-0.233.33%WednesdayAMCFULLER(HB) COFUL0.860.620.00%WednesdayAMCCALAMP CORPCAMP0.210.260.00%WednesdayAMCINVESTORS RL ESIRET0.090.11-10.00%WednesdayAMCRITE AID CORPRAD0-0.0550.00%WednesdayAMCPROGRESS SOFTWAPRGS0.440.3715.79%WednesdayAMCACCENTURE PLCACN1.711.525.33%ThursdayBTOCONAGRA BRANDSCAG0.430.378.93%ThursdayBTOMCCORMICK & COMKC0.930.829.89%ThursdayBTOWALGREENS BAIWBA1.471.3311.61%ThursdayBTOGMS INCGMS0.670.48-55.00%ThursdayBTOLINDSAY CORPLNN1.391.020.00%ThursdayBTOOMNOVA SOLUTIONOMN0.190.1628.57%ThursdayBTOSHAW COMMS-CL BSJR0.280.2573.91%ThursdayBTOAPOGEE ENTRPRSAPOG0.520.627.79%ThursdayBTONIKE INC-BNKE0.640.630.77%ThursdayAMCKB HOMEKBH0.490.3333.33%ThursdayAMCSYNNEX CORPSNX2.32.081.42%ThursdayAMCCONSTELLATN BRDSTZ2.422.349.20%FridayBTO

2213,LEN,"Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) is slated to report results for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended May 31) before the opening bell on Jun 26.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.7%. This Miami-based homebuilder surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 7.1%.Notably, Lennar’s diversified line of home offerings for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers, and positive housing market fundamentals prove favorable for this leading homebuilder in the United States.Factors at PlayAlthough higher prices, mortgage rates and supply shortages are taking a toll on the housing industry of late, Lennar has been reporting solid top-line numbers and the trend is expected to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well, owing to strong demand for homes, favorable job market and impressive economic conditions.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s Homebuilding segment revenues (comprising almost 89.3% of total revenues) of $4.7 billion are likely to increase from $2.9 billion in the year-ago period and $2.7 billion recorded in the prior reported quarter. This improvement is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog. The company’s new order trend (in units) also remained solid, growing 30% in the last reported quarter and 11% in fiscal 2017.The Financial Services segment is also performing well in tandem with its homebuilding operations and innovation of new products such as recently announced creative student-loan program. The company expects the segment’s second-quarter profit to be between $45 million and $48 million for the to-be-reported quarter. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $288 million, reflecting 68.4% sequential growth.While Lennar’s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, its ancillary businesses like Rialto and Multi-Family provide diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities.On the flip side, Lennar, like other renowned homebuilding companies, has been under considerable pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins. While labor shortages are resulting in higher wages, land prices are increasing due to limited availability.Lennar’s gross margin on home sales expanded 50 basis points (bps) in the fiscal first quarter but decreased 90 bps year over year in fiscal 2017. The decline was primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home. For the second quarter, the company expects gross margin to be in the 21.0-21.6% range compared with 21.1% in the year-ago period. Gross margins are expected to be impacted by 750-800 bps in the second quarter related to the CalAtlantic acquisition.Overall, Lennar’s diligent efforts to improve operating efficiency via digital-marketing efforts, dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives are expected to offset the headwinds, thereby driving growth for this homebuilder. In this regard, the company is working hard to improve its SG&A expenses via operating leverage and investments in technology. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, SG&A expenses contracted 60 bps to 9.7% in the fiscal first quarter, due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries. However, the impact of purchase accounting related to CalAtlantic acquisition is expected to hurt margins and thereby the bottom line of the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 45 cents, reflecting a decrease of 50.6% year over year. That said, the same for revenues is pegged at $5.23 billion, implying 60.4% growth.Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lennar Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Lennar does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

2214,LEN,"Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results (ending Feb 28) before market open on Apr 4.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 14%.

This improvement is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog. The company expects a backlog conversion ratio of approximately 65-70% for the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s order trend (in units) also remained solid, growing 12% in the last reported quarter and 11% in fiscal 2017.The Financial Services segment is also performing well in tandem with its homebuilding operations and innovating new products such as recently announced creative student-loan program. However, the segment is likely to register a significant decline in refinanced volume that impacted 2017. This will likely continue to impact the first half of fiscal 2018. Because of this headwind, first quarter and second quarter are expected to result in lower year-over-year earnings. The consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues of $161 million reflects 19.1% sequential decline. However, it is expected to grow from $148 million recorded in the year-ago period.While Lennar’s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, its ancillary businesses like Rialto and Multi-Family provide diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities.On the flip side, Lennar, like other renowned homebuilding companies, has been under pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins.

2215,LEN,"Sales of previously owned homes increased in February 2018, despite low inventory and higher prices. The data came in as a breather after the last two month disappointed in terms of existing home sales.Exchange traded funds or ETFs that track the homebuilding industry gained on Wednesday, after the news release. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB) gained 1.6% while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) was up 1.07%.Shares of prominent homebuilders such as D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) escalated yesterday after the release.February Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales, which account for about 90% of U.S. home sales, increased 3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units from 5.38 million in January. It came in above the consensus estimate of 5.42 million. The same fell by 3.2% and 3.6% in January 2018 and December 2017, respectively.Also, sales were up 1.1% from the year-ago level, reversing the 4.8% year-over-year decline in January.The data showed uneven sales across regions. Sales in Northeast and Midwest, which continued to reel under cold weather, were down 12.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Sales were up respectively 11.4% and 6.6% in West and South. March winter storms are expected to disrupt home sales in the Northeast in the coming months.Also, February’s median sales price grew 5.9% from the comparable period a year ago to $241,700, marking the 72nd straight month of year-over-year increase. The price rise has to some extent restricted first-time buyers to enter the market as they comprised 29% of sales in February, down from 31% a year ago. NAR’s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers – released in late 2017 – revealed that the annual share of first-time buyers was 34%.Again, the supply shortage is palpable. Though the inventory of existing homes increased 4.6% from January it was down 8.1% from the year-ago period. This happens to be the 33rd straight month of year-over-year decline. At the current pace , it will take only 3.4 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR.Housing Market ConstraintsThe U.S. housing industry is gradually recovering from muted sales that stemmed from a severe winter. But interest rate hikes, growing labor shortage, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are restricting homebuilders to respond to this growing demand. The levy of tariff on steel, one of the major raw materials in the home building industry, is another headwind.  Also, caps on the deduction for mortgage interest following a recent overhaul of the tax code is likely to slow demand this year.Increase in borrowing cost due to higher mortgage rate is yet another dampener. According to data released on the same day, from the Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey for the week ending March 16, 2018, mortgage applications decreased 1.1% from a week earlier, compared with an increase of 0.9% in the week before that. The Refinance Index decreased 5% from the previous week. The average fixed 30-year mortgage rate, however, edged down by 1 bps to 4.68%.Strong Economic Growth a Bright SpotYesterday, the Federal benchmark rates were hiked by 0.25%. Also, the central bank gave indications of two more hikes this year. This increase in benchmark rates should further increase the borrowing cost thereby putting pressure on sales. Despite the odds facing the industry, the sector is expected to keep up a good show in the upcoming period, led by a steady rise in wages and a record low unemployment rate.Moreover, a strong economic growth outlook for 2018 and 2019 from the policy makers keeps the optimism surrounding the housing market intact.  The Fed forecasts that unemployment this year will fall to 3.8% from the current rate of 4.1%. That would be the lowest jobless rate since April 2000. Unemployment is projected to fall even further in 2019 to 3.6% which would be the lowest rate since 1969.Spring EffectThe housing sector should buoy on the spring selling season (a peak time for home sellers) which is already on. Normally, the season starts in March and lasts through May-June thanks to warmer weather after a chilly winter and buyers’ tendency to move into a new house before the next school calendar starts. The season has traditionally favored the sector.All eyes are now on new home sales data, to be released on Friday, which economists expect will show a gain. This is particularly so as sales of new U.S. single-family homes had dropped for the second straight month in January and in four of the past six months.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2216,LEN,"Every day a new article pops up about the latest thing that Millennials “killed.” The list ranges from beer and napkins, to running and marriages. This is the way life goes; previous generations typically bemoan the perceived faults of the current as they begin to transform the economics of the day and redefine societal norms.Each generation is different. Millennials might have simply pushed some of life’s bigger responsibilities back a few years, unlike say Baby Boomers or even Generation Y. But for all the stories of ruin and doom, the stock market is chugging along at unprecedented rates and the economy is humming while new technologies transform the world.In fact, in some cases, Millennials themselves have disproportionately created positive, long-lasting economic changes, making investors from older generations a lot richer. And as Millennials begin to age, many will begin to pump even more money into important corners of the economy, and soon enough, the negative focus will shift to the soon-to-be scrutinized Generation Z.With that said, let’s take a look at five stocks that might benefit from the aging Millennial generation.1.      PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report)This multi-brand homebuilding company is set to grow in the coming years, especially as more Millennials begin to buy homes. PulteGroup is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 20.51% over the next three to five years. On top of the long-term earnings growth projections, the homebuilding firm currently presents outstanding value and is trading at just 11.37x earnings. PulteGroup has also been able to build a growing cash supply and has seen its stock price climb nearly 80% over the last 52-weeks. PHM is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).2.       Restoration Hardware (RH  -  Free Report)This upscale home furnishing power has been able to get ahead of new experiential retail trends and even expanded into the restaurant business, which helped its stock price skyrocket 216% over the last year. The company’s new operations have resonated with Millennials—who are now at the right age to be buying home goods. Restoration Hardware is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Furthermore, the company is expected to see its bottom-line expand for years to come as its earnings per share figures are projected to expand at an annualized rate of 20% over the next three to five years.3.       Facebook (FB  -  Free Report)  Millennials are nearly solely responsible for Facebook’s meteoritic rise to one of the most valuable companies in the world—as they were the founders and the first wave of users. Facebook is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and the company’s 109.17% cash flow growth rate should help it further invest in new technologies such as AI and augmented reality. Millennials are unlikely to ditch Facebook’s platform in the coming years, and the company is still actively growing its user base. The social media giant is also expected to see its bottom-line surge at an annualized rate of 26.82% over the next three to five years.4.       Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) For all of the businesses that Millennials have supposedly harmed, they have definitely helped lift Amazon’s e-commerce division. Amazon has been able to secure a growing cash reserve and is only set to expand its sales as the need for cloud computing and web hosting increases. Meanwhile, Millennials are using the site to buy everything, including groceries—plus, they already love Whole Foods. Looking down the road, the company is expected to see its EPS figures grow at an annualized rate of 20.87% over the next three to five years. Jeff Bezos’ company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).5.       Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report)This Miami-based home construction company has seen its stock price climb 59.62% over the last 52 weeks. Some might think this is a result of short-term demand, but we’re likely just seeing that start of the Millennial home buying boom. On top of strong 2018 top- and bottom-line growth projections, Lennar’s EPS figures are expected to expand at an annualized rate of nearly13% over the next three to five years.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

The savings include lower overhead costs and elimination of duplicative corporate expenses.Meanwhile, shares of Lennar have gained 28.9% year to date, underperforming the 50.5% growth of its industry.

2218,LEN,"The current housing scenario doesn’t seem all that rosy with housing data for the July-August period showing dismal growth. Of late, the industry has been dealing with a shortage in inventory which is raising prices in several parts of the country.Meanwhile, the devastating Harvey and Irma hurricanes created uncertainties for builders. This, along with higher labor, land and material costs has also been affecting the homebuilding industry.Meanwhile, National Association of Realtors (NAR) has cut its 2017 forecast for existing-home sales owing to a tepid spring selling season and the impact of hurricanes. The group now expects the sale of 5.44 million homes in 2017, down 0.2% from 5.45 million in 2016 and well below 5.52 million expected earlier.What Do the Numbers Say?Existing home sales, which make up a larger part of all the U.S. real estate activity, fell to a one-year low in August (down 1.7%), per the latest report by NAR. This marked the fourth decline in five months, bringing down the annual rate to the lowest level in 12 months. Housing starts dropped 0.8% sequentially in August. In July, existing home sales slipped 1.3% from the previous quarter while housing starts dropped 4.8% sequentially.It is important to note that on a year-over-year basis, housing starts were 1.4% higher in August. Single-family starts were even stronger, growing 17.1% from a year ago. Meanwhile, building permits, another economic indicator of the health of the housing sector, increased 5.7% sequentially and 8.3% year over year.Is Declining Data a Matter of Concern?It is important to note here that the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has managed to outperform the broader market (S&P 500) in the third quarter of 2017 despite the recent dampeners. The industry gained 6.2%, compared with the S&P 500 index’s 3.8% increase. Notably, the homebuilding industry ranks among the top 25% of all Zacks industries.In spite of the lackluster monthly figures, the housing industry seems to be still going strong on a healthy economy, solid job market and affordable mortgage rates.The U.S. economy grew 3.1% in the second quarter, showing a significant jump from 1.2% growth in the first quarter. Along with strong economic growth, the labor market helped the industry to maintain its stature.Although the unemployment rate was weak in September in the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, economists are expecting the numbers to rebound in the coming months and the economy to continue growing. Average hourly wages rose 2.9% from a year ago. Improving economic growth supported by a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and provides the basis for stronger demand. Along with this, solid homebuilder confidence raises optimism for the entire housing industry. Although the index dipped 3 points in September from August, it remained at a confident level of 64 points, according to the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo Housing Market Index report. Notably, the index has remained above 60 since September 2016.Thus, though the homebuilding industry might face some bottlenecks in the short term, the overall picture is pretty compelling.Q3 So Far and Expectations for 2017The Q3 earnings season has already seen releases from 26 S&P 500 members. For the quarter as whole, total Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 1.2% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues. With expectations of double-digit earnings growth in each of the first two quarters and high single-digit growth in the concluding quarter of the year, Q3 is anticipated to see the lowest growth.The Q3 earnings season has so far seen releases from 15.4% of the construction companies in the S&P 500 cohort. According to the latest Earnings Trends, 100% of the companies have surpassed earnings estimates while 50% beat revenue expectations. Total earnings at these construction companies increased 7% on 12.2% higher revenues.For 2017, total earnings for the broader construction sector are expected to increase 14.2% and revenues are expected to increase 9.1%.Offsetting the recent adversities, homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) reported stellar third-quarter results. KB Home’s earnings and revenues grew 21.4% and 25.3% year over year, respectively, on strong demand and favorable industry fundamentals.The company ended the quarter with a double-digit rise in deliveries and housing revenues. Strong orders in value (up 15.3%) and backlog (up 14.5%) bode well for KB Home in 2017. The company also expects the uptrend to continue till 2018.Lennar surpassed expectations on both the counts for the seventh time in a row. The company’s earnings and revenues rose 5% and 15%, respectively, courtesy of solid demand for homes.Stocks to Build Your PortfolioInvestors can bank on these housing stocks, which are making the most of the positive housing momentum despite the ongoing adversities.

2219,LEN,"There’s no denying that the U.S. housing data has been weak in the recent months, as inventory shortage has started taking toll on sales’ pace and pushed the average home prices higher nationwide. Additionally, the U.S. Government’s latest move of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum has propelled concerns among investors regarding certain U.S. sectors, particularly construction.Nonetheless, overlooking the sector will not be advisable, as there are a number of companies with a decent performance history and strong fundamentals, signaling toward a profitable investment opportunity. After all, the overall outlook for the U.S housing industry remains positive, with a healthy economy, strong job market and builders’ confidence continuing to drive stocks higher.Atlanta-based homebuilder, Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) is one such company that continues to show strength in several areas. Adding the stock to your portfolio should not be a disappointment. Shares of Beazer Homes, one of the country’s largest single-family homebuilders, have gained 23.7% over the past year, outperforming the 10% growth of its industry.Earnings estimates for Beazer Homes have exhibited an uptrend, reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-quarter earnings has also moved up 7.9% over the past 60 days. Let us delve deeper into the other factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock a profitable pick. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. What Makes the Stock an Attractive Pick?Solid Growth Prospects: Presently, the problem of adequate supply of land is taking its worst shape, as demand continues to scale up in the homebuilding industry. Given significant pent-up housing demand, Beazer Homes has secured a decent backlog. In the last reported quarter, the company generated a backlog conversion ratio of nearly 67%, up from 64% recorded last year.At the end of the fiscal second quarter, Beazer Homes had a backlog of 2,312 homes, up 3.4% year over year. Potential housing revenues from backlog grew 14% year over year to $885.4 million (as of Mar 31, 2018).Meanwhile, the rising land and labor costs are threatening margins of major homebuilders. In this respect, the company has managed to control costs, as is evident from its gross margin expansion. The company’s homebuilding gross margin expanded 70 basis points in the first six months of fiscal 2018.The company’s adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $189 million in the fiscal second quarter and also grew 17.9% in the first half of the year. The company remains on track to achieve its underlying 2B-10 goal of $200 million EBITDA by the end of fiscal 2018.Beazer Homes has solid growth prospects, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 41 cents per share for the current quarter, which is expected to grow 78.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the company’s sales are expected to increase 7.8% in the current quarter. Overall, Beazer Homes constitutes a great pick in terms of its growth investment, supported by a Growth Score of A.Valuation Looks Rational: Because of homebuilders’ asset-driven nature, it makes sense to value them based on price-to-book (P/B) ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 0.89. This is quite low compared with the current P/B for the industry and S&P 500 that are pegged at 1.4 and 3.88, respectively. Its lower-than-market positioning indicates that there is room for an upside in the quarters ahead, substantiating its Value Score of A.Solid Industry Fundamentals: The company’s business is exposed to the new single-family housing construction market. Despite the month-to-month hiccups, new home sales were up 11.6% year over year in April. Additionally, although April starts and permits tumbled from the March level, housing starts were up 7.2% year over year in single-family homes. Permits were 7.7% above the April 2017 rate of 1.26 million units, prompted by a 7.9% surge in single-family homes and 6.4% growth in buildings by five units or more.On the other hand, builder confidence increased two points to 70 in May from a downward revision of 68 in April, reinstating builders’ confidence in the current housing market. Importantly, the reading was above the 50 mark in the first five months of 2018, indicating a favorable outlook. Moreover, this is the fourth time in 2018 that the index has reached 70. Builders are particularly optimistic about growing consumer demand for single-family homes.Homebuilders are currently well placed, belonging to a top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 23%), suggesting that the market headwinds were unable to take the sheen away from the sector.Solid VGM Score: The company has an impressive VGM Score of A. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics. In fact, our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 make solid investment choices.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report), M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report) and Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report).Century Communities sports a Zacks Rank #1 and its earnings for the current year are likely to increase 47%.M.D.C.

2220,LEN,"Housing starts and building permits declined 7% and 5.7%, respectively, in February after registering impressive growth in January. Meanwhile, construction costs escalated in the month, driven by price increases of several building materials including steel and aluminum, per the latest report released by the Associated General Contractors of America of Labor Department. But is it really a thing to fret about? Let’s delve deeper into the numbers to get a clearer picture of the current scenario.Low Multi-Family Units a DampenerThe decline in housing starts was largely propelled by a fall in multi-family starts that decreased 28% from the January figure. The February tally roughly doubles the losses, expected by analysts.However, single-family starts actually went up 2.9%. Consistent job growth and increased interest from first-time homebuyers are adding to this momentum.Residential building permits, an indicator of upcoming construction activity, dropped 5.7% in February to an annualized rate of 1.3 million units from January. Single-family home permits dipped 0.6% while the same for construction of multi-family homes declined 14.8%. Clearly, this indicates home builders are more optimistic about Americans opting for single family houses over apartments.Is the Reduced February Data Really a Concern?The latest disruption is not really a concern as single family units, which are generally of higher importance and are indicative of the economy strengthening further, have improved. Though building permits declined on a month-over-month basis, the figure rose 6.5% year over year.Solid economic growth and job market make us reasonably confident about the industry’s performance. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.1% in February, marking a 17-year low. Moreover, a healthy builder’s confidence reading in March is encouraging, too. Per the latest report of the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo, the Housing Market Index reading in the current month is still very strong at 70.Yet, builders are concerned about growing labor shortage and limited land availability that are shrinking margins. Apart from concerns  related to a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders are now worried about higher material costs due to the newly imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel. These are restricting homebuilders from responding to rising demand. However, these factors have failed to mar the industry’s performance to a great extent, which has been top notch for quite some time.The Zacks Homebuilding Industry has rallied 21.1% in the past year, comparing favorably with 16.3% growth of the broader market (S&P 500). Moreover, a good industry rank (top 33% of more than 250 industries) supports the growth potential of the stocks in this industry.Again, this industry’s expected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 17.9% for three-five years is better than the broader market’s 9.7%.A few major homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) are well poised on bullish fundamentals of the housing market.All four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2221,LEN,"U.S. retail sales declined for the third straight month in February, as consumers cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and other expensive items, indicating a potential drop in GDP in the first quarter. Out of the 13 major sectors, seven reported declines (read: Will Wall Street Hit the Brakes in 2019? ETFs to Play).Retail sales data is going to play along with the market’s expectations of the previously expected three rate hikes in 2018, after muted inflation data reported earlier this week alleviated fears of more aggressive rate hikes by the Fed. Consumer prices increased 2.2% year over year in February, up from 2.1% reported in the previous month.Into the HeadlinesOverall retail sales declined 0.1% in February compared with expectations of a gain of 0.3% after 0.1% drop in the prior month and December. This was the first time since April 2012 that retail sales have declined for three consecutive months. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, core retail sales increased 0.1% in February after staying unchanged in January. Core retail sales are most closely aligned with the consumer spending component of GDP (read: 3 ETFs to Benefit as Faster Rate Hike Worries Cool Down).Consumer spending accounts for over two-thirds of the United States’ GDP and seems to have slowed in 2018. It grew 3.8% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 but tepid wage growth in February might have dented purchasing power. Average hourly earnings in the United States inched up 0.1% in February compared with 0.3% in the previous month.In February, auto sales declined 0.9%, after a similar drop in January, and receipts at gasoline stations declined 1.2%. However, sales at building material stores increased 1.9% in the month while receipts at clothing stores gained 0.4% and sales at online retailers rose 1.0%.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sectors impacted.First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report)This fund focuses on providing exposure to the global automotive sector.

2222,LEN,"U.S. homebuilding was quite a rage in 2017, giving investors ample scope to rake in handsome gains. The industry is equally attractive this year, courtesy of solid economic growth and job market. Consistent job growth, growing interest from first-time homebuyers as well as high homebuilder confidence are adding to the momentum. Reflecting the positives, total earnings for the construction sector are expected to grow 33.4% in 2018 from the same period last year on 12.6% higher revenues.Meanwhile, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are keeping homebuilders from responding to rising demand to some extent. Despite these challenges, notable homebuilders like PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) have been consistently performing well.Among the industry bellwethers, Lennar and D.R. Horton are the most prominent ones. Despite the companies having strong business lines and solid prospects, Lennar — a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock — appears to be comparatively better as an investment option than the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) D.R. Horton. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Before drawing a head-to-head comparison between Lennar and D.R. Horton, let’s check out a few key statistics of the companies.What Defines the Housing Giants?D.R. Horton, with a market cap of $18.9 billion, offers a diverse line of homes across various price points through a multi-brand platform. Moreover, the company enjoys one of the broadest geographic diversities in the industry and is not dependent on any particular market.D.R. Horton is fast acquiring homebuilding companies in desirable markets. In October 2017, the company acquired a 75% stake in Forestar Group, a residential and mixed-use real estate development company, for $558 million. The deal will help D.R. Horton expand operations in Texas — an area which has been witnessing positive housing momentum of late. It is also expected to contribute around $1 billion to D.R. Horton’s annual revenues over the next five years.With a market cap of $14.4 billion, Lennar offers a wide range of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult buyers. While Lennar’s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, its ancillary businesses like Rialto, Multi-Family provide diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities.In February, Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc. for $9.3 billion (including debt) which will create one of the country’s top three home builders in 24 of the top 30 U.S. markets.Price PerformanceComing to price performance over the last six months, Lennar has gained 18%, compared with the broader industry’s 13.1%. Meanwhile, D.R. Horton has rallied 20.4% over the period, exceeding both Lennar’s and the broader industry’s performance. Prospects, Estimates Revisions, Earnings HistoryThe ability to consistently boost profit levels defying industry woes is a defining characteristic of the best companies. Analysts expect D.R. Horton to grow earnings at a 10% rate over the next three to five years. Comparatively, Lennar’s earnings are expected to grow 18.3% over the same time frame. Hence, Lennar’s higher growth rate implies greater potential for capital appreciation.For the near term, the expected current-year earnings growth rate for D.R. Horton stands at 30.7% compared with 38.9% for Lennar.Over the past 30 days, Lennar’s earnings estimates for the current year edged up 0.8% to $5.29 per share. Meanwhile, D.R. Horton’s estimates for the current year have increased 0.3% to $3.58.D.R. Horton’s projected sales growth for the current year is 14.8%, better than Lennar’s average of 12.7%.Hence, Lennar is a clear winner in terms of earnings growth expectations.Meanwhile, considering a more comprehensive earnings history, D.R. Horton has delivered positive surprises in all of the trailing four quarters. However, Lennar has surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters. D.R. Horton has a slightly superior average earnings surprise of 5.8% compared with Lennar’s 4.2%.Profitability and ReturnsProfitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company’s business and its growth opportunities. Return on Capital (ROC) of Lennar is 6.90%, while D.R. Horton has a ROC of 10.5%. The interpretation is that D.R. Horton’s business generates a higher return on investment than Lennar’s.Again, Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. ROE for the trailing 12 months for Lennar and D.R. Horton is 12% and 14.8%, respectively. While both the stocks have scored above the industry level of 11.8%, D.R. Horton has an edge here.ValuationBoth the stocks are a little overvalued as is evident from their unfavorable P/E, P/B and P/S ratios compared to the homebuilding industry.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple for Lennar and D.R. Horton are 15.7 and 15.2, respectively, while the industry’s is 14.7. D.R. Horton’s shares look a shade cheaper compared with Lennar.Again, trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B) multiple for Lennar is 1.82, compared with 2.09 for D.R. Horton. The industry’s P/B is 1.79.Trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) multiples for Lennar and D.R. Horton are 1.14 and 1.18, respectively, compared with the industry’s 1.05.Lennar is cheaper of the two stocks on book value and sales basis.VolatilityTo gauge the market risk of a particular stock, investors use beta. Stocks with beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk. Lennar has a beta of 1.31 while D.R. Horton’s beta is 1.20. D.R. Horton’s shares are therefore less volatile than that of Lennar.Bottom LineLennar beats D.R. Horton in terms of earnings growth expectation and valuation, while the latter enjoys an advantage in terms of market cap, revenue expectation and returns.Both the companies remain positive about the overall homebuilding market that will continue to gain on solid demand for homes, favorable job market and strength in economy.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved.Zacks has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market.Click here to access these stocks>>

2223,LEN,"Sales of new U.S. single-family homes dropped for the second straight month in January and in four of the past six months. Does this give smoke signals of a downtrend in the housing market?Exchange-traded funds or ETFs that track the homebuilding industry dropped on Monday, after the news release. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) fell 0.7% while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) dropped 1%. Meanwhile, the PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) was down 1.3%.Shares of major builders of the U.S. housing industry like D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) slipped following the news release on that day.Is Weather or Higher Mortgage Rates the Culprit?Sales of newly constructed homes, accounting of roughly 10% of all U.S. home sales, fell 7.8% in January from the prior month and 1% from the year-ago period to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units, as per data released on Feb 26 by the Commerce Department.Notably, last month’s figure is the lowest since August 2017, weighed down by sharp declines in the Northeast and South. Sales sank 33.3% in the Northeast and fell 14.2% in the South, which accounts for the majority of new home sales. Sales rose 1% in the West and 15.4% in the Midwest.The downside was probably due to cold weather, particularly in Southern states, rather than any economic factor. Otherwise, all regions would have experienced deterioration.Again, higher mortgage rates could also be the reason for this downfall. Mortgage rates are surging in proportion with U.S. government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to an average interest rate of 4.15% for the week ending Jan 25, 2018, the highest level since March 2017, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.Again, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 4.40% for the week ending Feb 22, the highest level since April 2014, from 4.38% in the prior week. It has increased for seven straight weeks. Higher mortgage rates accompanied with the loss of homeowner tax breaks in certain expensive markets might be hitting on affordability.Apart from the recent weak new home sales report, last week’s report from the National Association of Realtors also showed dismal existing home sales. Existing home sales dropped 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million units last month. Existing home sales, which account for about 90% of U.S. home sales, tanked 4.8% on a year-on-year basis in January.Meanwhile, the industry has already been challenged by shortage of homes for sale, suitable land and skilled labor. Total housing inventory at the end of January rose 4.1% to 1.52 million existing homes available for sale, but is still 9.5% lower than a year ago and has fallen year over year for 32 consecutive months. That said, the inventory of new homes was up 15% from a year ago in January, which is expected to provide some relief as we head toward the spring selling season.Limited land availability is driving prices higher, as median sales price of a new home jumped 2.4% year over year last month. The median house price increased 5.8% for existing homes from a year ago and was the 71st consecutive month of year-on-year price gain.Adding to the woes, first-time buyers comprised 29% of sales in January, which is down from 32% in December 2017 and 33% a year ago.Will the Current Downfall Linger Through 2018?Apart from concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment. These are restricting homebuilders to respond to growing demand.Nonetheless, homebuilders remain confident about the upcoming period. In spite of shortage in inventory, robust demand from a solid job market is keeping the industry alive. Americans filing for unemployment benefits plunged to a 45-year low for the week ending Feb 17, 2018, indicating strong job growth. Job additions grew at a solid pace in January, and the record low unemployment rate and strong wage growth show that the labor market is in good shape. Notably, wage growth hit the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Although home price increases have surpassed wage growth, which remained 2.9%, the optimism surrounding the U.S. housing market remains intact amid overall economic growth. Along with this, a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and demand.Given this mixed scenario, we should keep an eye on how the housing sector responds to rising rates as we approach in Spring, which according to Fitch Ratings, is traditionally more upbeat than the rest of the year.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018? Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

2224,LEN,"Two devastating hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — are taking a toll on homebuilders’ forecast for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) has reduced its fourth-quarter as well as fiscal 2017 forecasts due to delays caused by the recent tropical storms.Leading national homebuilder D.R. Horton now expects its backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 85% compared with the previously guided range of 88-90%. SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, is now estimated to be roughly 8.6% compared with 8.3-8.4% projected earlier.Importantly, the company radically trimmed its 2017 forecast for cash flow from operations due to delays caused by the catastrophes of late. D.R. Horton, which mainly sells single-family homes, now anticipates cash flow from operations of about $150 million for the fiscal year, down from the previous forecast of about $300 million.Not only D.R. Horton but another noted homebuilder Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) has also provided views recently regarding fiscal third-quarter deliveries and new orders, post the havoc of hurricanes. The company maintained that the natural disaster is anticipated to cause delays in home deliveries. Sad but true, the destructive hurricanes have affected Lennar’s communities across Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, representing 40% of the company’s annual homebuilding revenues.Per Atlanta-based homebuilder Beazer Homes USA, Inc.’s (BZH  -  Free Report) recent report, the company also expects new home sales and closings to be lower in the quarter ending Sep 30 on a year-over-year basis due to storm-related impacts.The latest U.S. housing data also reflects the ongoing weak sales pace. Existing home sales declined to a one-year low in August, per the latest report from National Association of Realtors or NAHB. Existing home sales slipped 1.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million. This marks the fourth decline in five months, bringing the annual rate to rock-bottom level in 12 months. Purchases in Houston dropped 25% year over year and sales would have been flat excluding the Harvey effect.Housing starts also came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million last month. This is 0.8% down from a revised July estimate of 1.19 million.Earlier this month, September readings gauging builders' view on sales over the next six months slipped from August. Economists are of the opinion that ongoing higher labor and material costs have already been hitting the industry hard. Also, inventory shortage has started taking toll on the sales’ pace. Now, scarcity of skilled construction labor is further anticipated to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive construction costs higher causing delays.Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar, KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) among others.Nonetheless, homebuilders remain optimistic and expect post-disaster rebuilding efforts to drive higher demands for new homes next year.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

2225,LEN,"D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 9, before the opening bell.Recently, the company reduced its fourth-quarter as well as fiscal 2017 forecast due to delays caused by the recent tropical storms. D.R. Horton, one of the top builders in the United States, now expects its backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 85% compared with the previously guided range of 88-90%. This compares favorably with the year-ago level of 83%.SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, is now estimated to be roughly 8.6% (versus 8.3-8.4% projected earlier). This also compares favorably with the year-ago level of 8.8%.Importantly, the company radically trimmed its 2017 forecast for cash flow from operations due to delays caused by the recent catastrophes. D.R. Horton, which primarily sells single-family homes, now anticipates cash flow from operations of about $150 million for the fiscal year, down from the previous forecast of about $300 million.Meanwhile, rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) among others.In fact, D.R. Horton’s gross margin on home sales contracted 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 19.8% in the last reported quarter. Now, storm-related cost pressures are likely to create added pressure in the to-be-reported quarter. The company expects housing gross margin to be around 20%. In the year-ago quarter, it was 20.5%.Nonetheless, D.R. Horton remains optimistic and expects post-disaster rebuilding efforts to drive higher demands for new homes next year. Although challenges posed as a result of the recent hurricanes are bound to negatively impact its results to some extent in the fourth quarter, D.R. Horton is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario.Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically-low interest/mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory, bode well.Homebuilding, comprising about 97.6% of total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $3.94 billion reflect growth of 6.9% sequentially and 7.9% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $97 million indicates an increase of 5.4% from the prior quarter and 7.4% year over year.Overall, for the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 9.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $4.04 billion, implying 8% year-over-year growth.D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | D.R.

2226,LEN,"The Chinese Year of the Dog kicked off on Feb 16, which has historically been promising for the U.S. stock market. Astute investors, thus, should turn bullish and use this encouraging calendar year to their advantage. And why not? The Republican tax overhaul is expected to have a positive effect on earnings this year. Fears of surging inflation and higher interest rates, on the other hand, are unwarranted and likely to ease.Year of the Dog is Great for the U.S. Stock MarketThe U.S. equity market traditionally performs well in the Year of the Dog, per LPL Research. Data from as early as 1950 showed that the 12-month return on the broader S&P 500 in the year was up more than 15% on average.In four of the last five Year of the Dog, the market clocked double-digit gains. In 1958, returns were the highest, up 32.9%. In the most recent one ending in 2006, the returns were also quite solid, increasing 12.4%. YearS&P 500 Return in the Year of the Dog195832.9%197012.7%198220.7%1994-2.3%200612.4%Average15.3%(Source: LPL)Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist at LPL added that “in fact, out of the 12 zodiac signs, no year sports a better average return.” In the past Year of the Goat, Tiger, Ox, Rabbit, Pig, Monkey, Dragon, Horse, Rat, Rooster and Snake, the S&P 500 had given an average return of 14.9%, 13.8%, 13.5%, 10.6%, 10.5%, 9.2%, 8.7%, 6.3%, 3.2%, 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively.Though a few may be skeptical about investing based on stars, but this Year of the Dog has certainly started off on a bullish note. The S&P 500 managed to log its sixth straight rise on Feb 16. After all, U.S. earnings expectations have sharply accelerated on tax stimulus, while inflation scares are overblown.Tax Plan to Boost EarningsThe Trump administration’s tax cut policy is expected to boost earnings, in a market that already has historically high valuations. The headline-grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate is lowered from 35% to 21%. Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35% (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Earnings growth this year is set to be healthy. Most of the S&P 500 companies have provided guidance that exceeded expectations, while the Q4 earnings season is already on track to be quite impressive. For the 398 S&P 500 members that have reported results, earnings are up 14.5% from the same period last year on 9% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 75.6% surpassing revenue estimates.In fact, Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 14% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. This will follow the 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the third quarter of 2017 on 5.8% higher revenues (read more: What Will Retail Earnings Show?).Inflation and Rate Hike Fears OverblownA surge in inflation in January possibly leading to faster-than-expected rate hikes did trigger a sudden panic among investors. Higher inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to hike short-term interest rates at a faster pace than expected. This, in turn, will increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which could eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy.But, market pundits believe that the spike in inflation last month will fizz out. Even though the consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.5% in January from the previous month, it stayed at 2.1% in January on a year-over-year basis. Thus, it has fallen from the nearly 3% annual growth rate in the last three months. Meanwhile, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has been below the central bank’s 2% target since mid-2012.  Wage growth in January also doesn’t hint at a surge in cost of living. After all, wages rose on colder-than-normal weather condition, which is a seasonal factor. Further, if managers and supervisors’ salaries are excluded, hourly wages increased at a sluggish pace. This showed that much of the increase was not evenly distributed and concentrated mostly on managers (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).5 Biggest GainersGiven the bullishness, investing in stocks that can make the most of the Year of the Dog seems judicious. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that are poised to yield stellar returns this calendar year that constitute bulk of the Year of the Dog.These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.

2227,LEN,"Housing starts and building permits made an impressive comeback in January, after declining 8.2% and 0.1%, respectively, in December 2017, due to cold weather. Moreover, home builder sentiment is at 72, making us reasonably certain about the positive momentum in the industry.Housing Starts Hit a 15-Month HighPer the latest jointly-released report from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, new home construction (housing starts) increased 9.7% to 1.33 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in January 2018 from December 2017. This also marks the highest rise since October 2016. The figure improved 7.3% on a year-over-year basis, courtesy of a 3.7% rise in single-family housing starts and 23.7% spike in multi-family starts.Moreover, residential building permits, an indicator of upcoming construction activity, increased 7.4% in January to an annualized rate of 1.34 million units from December. This marks the highest surge in more than 10 years.Builders Remain ConfidentU.S. homebuilders’ confidence remains unchanged at 72 in February. The figure improved from the year-ago level of 65. The National Association of Home Builders or NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) includes builder perceptions of current single-family home sales, sales expectations for the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers. A reading above 50 is considered confident enough. The upside was driven by higher sales expectations in the future, which rose two points to 80. Traffic of prospective buyers were steady at 54, but the component gauging current sales conditions dropped one point to 78.The current reading indicates that builders feel good about the recent tax cuts and have no qualms as such regarding the rising interest rates. Fueled by robust economic growth, Fed policymakers reckon three rate hikes in 2018, setting the stage for an increase in mortgage rates.NAHB Chairman Randy Noel, a custom homebuilder from LaPlace, Louisiana, stated, ""Builders are excited about the pro-business political climate that will strengthen the housing market and support overall economic growth.""Will the Upbeat Scenario Continue Through 2018?The positive momentum is expected to continue in 2018, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs.In spite of shortage in inventory, robust demand from a solid labor market is keeping the industry alive. General unemployment rates in the United States have been at a 17-year low of 4.1% for the fourth straight month, with around 200,000 jobs added in January 2018.  Other hurdles such as rising prices, thanks to the limited land availability which is keeping the affordability in check. Again, homebuilders continue to struggle against higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment.The economy is also in a good shape. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.President Trump aims to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts, deregulation and higher infrastructure spending. Although this may face various obstacles, we expect the plan to help the economy grow at a faster clip in 2018.Housing Industry’s StandThis positive momentum that the housing industry has been experiencing is evident from the improvement in its Zacks rank.

From 2016 levels, revenues are anticipated to increase 11.2% while adjusted earnings will decline 6%.Earnings are expected to be lower in 2017 due to higher-than-anticipated losses in the businesses being restructured.

2229,LEN,"This week we have several very important economic reports coming out.  These top tier reports will give us key data on future indicators regarding factory orders, inflation, retail sales, housing, and consumer sentiment.The biggest report is coming out Wednesday; the Consumer Price Index.  With the current inflation worries, and the implications of the Fed raising rates at a faster pace, this will be the most closely watched report this week.  The last report showed that wages grew by +2.9% which spooked the markets and caused the flash crash.  Current year over year expectations are for a slight dip from 2.1% to 2%. Any pullback will be viewed as a positive for the markets, but if we see an uptick it could cause the markets to fall once again.Also on Wednesday, the Retail Sales report will be released and this will tell us if the recent strength in the segment will continue.  Expectations are for +0.3% gain which would be the seventh consecutive month of a positive reading. A positive reading would help many retail companies like Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), Conn's Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) all of which currently hold a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy rating.The Retail report will also be tied to Friday's Consumer Sentiment announcement which is expected to remain elevated.  Source: Bloomberg.comAs you can see in the table above, consumer sentiment has been around a reading of 95 for over a year.  If consumer sentiment remains at or near its current levels it bodes well for the retail sector, as this report gauges consumer spending, and the overall attitude of the economy.  This week we will also see two regional manufacturing reports, the Phily Fed, and the Empire State.  These reports will give us the conditions in local regions, and will be an indicator for the more important ISM manufacturing index coming out on March 1st.  The recent readings have been very strong, and have shown positive momentum in production and new orders over the past several months. Currently, the regional reports are expected to show continued strong growth.  Lastly, we will also see two very important housing reports this week.  On Thursday the Housing Market Index will be released. This forward looking report has remained high for the past several months.Source: Bloomberg.comTwo closely watched parts of the report will indicate if the increasing interest rate trend will begin show any signs of having a negative impact on the index.  And if the uptick in mortgage rates is impacting housing affordability.This report coupled with Friday's Housing Starts data will be an important barometer for the housing sector and several other sub sectors that rely on new housing.Housing starts took a bit of a dip last month due to weather related issues as you can see in the chart below.Source: Bloomberg.comBut this month's data should be clean of weather related issues, and is currently expected to show a snap back to 1.23 million units, well above December's reading of 1.1 million units.  Also, housing permits are expected to remain high at 1.3 million. A combination of an uptick in both the housing market index, and housing starts will be beneficial for home builders like KB Homes (KBH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp (LEN  -  Free Report), and D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), all of which currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 Buy rating.The data will also be a forward indicator for companies that depend on new homes who supply them with furniture, appliances, and other household needs. Companies that can benefit from positive housing data include, Restoration Hardware (RH  -  Free Report), At Home Group (HOME  -  Free Report), Beacon Roofing (BECN  -  Free Report), and Eloctorlux ELUX-B, all of which currently carry a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy rating. If these data points come in as expected, it will set an overall positive tone for the markets for the next several weeks.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

The estate will also have energy and water saving systems, helping home buyers manage their utility bills.Notably, one of KB Home’s key business strategies is to drive revenues through growth in community. In fact, over the last three years, the company has focused on four strategic initiatives to drive profits and revenues, ensuring success in fiscal 2017 and beyond. These initiatives include boosting community count, achieving higher revenue per community with a higher profitability per unit, and increasing asset efficiency through return on capital invested.The company is taking various initiatives to drive its community count. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, KB Home reported an average community count of 238, down 2% year over year. For fiscal 2017, the company expects community count to remain flat. Furthermore, higher cost of labor and supply constraints in the U.S. homebuilding space pose a challenge for KB Home.Nonetheless, the company’s relentless efforts in attracting homebuyers to community homes and thereby acquiring higher revenue per community poises KB Home well for the analysts’ speculation.

Moreover, revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,585 million.Further, the company achieved 8% organic growth in the fiscal first quarter that reached to a new all-time high.

Also, on a constant currency basis, organic revenues increased 5% on the back of strong performance in the company’s transportation and water markets in the Americas. The transportation and water markets were driven by improved funding as well as continued growth across international markets.Construction Services (CS) revenues increased 21.4% to $2,125.5 million on a year-over-year basis. On a constant currency basis, organic revenues were up 11%. Stellar performance of this segment was driven by Building Construction and Power businesses.On the other hand, Management Services (MS) revenues registered an impressive year-over-year growth of 9.9% to $843.4 million.

Record backlog and accelerating revenue growth proved conductive to the company’s growth.Moreover, the company’s diversified portfolio comprises both designing and construction services. The company is also efficient in dealing with cyclical market volatility that helps it capitalize on the upside of its business during downturns. More than 70% of AECOM’s profits are generated from infrastructure and defense markets that are poised to benefit from the favorable political climate, both in the United States and abroad.However, cyclical demand of the company’s services and currency fluctuations are likely to thwart growth, going forward.

The downside was primarily due to the strategic shift of a transaction to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Nonetheless, the company remains positive about the overall homebuilding market, solid demand for homes, favorable job market, and solid economy, along with the added tailwinds of recent tax law changes that will continue to propel the housing market forward.Total revenues of $3.79 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.62 billion by 4.5%.

The improvement was due to a decrease in external broker commissions as a percentage of revenues from home sales and improved operating leverage.Financial Services: Financial Services revenues increased 1.4% to $198.6 million in the quarter. Operating earnings at the segment were $42.1 million, down from $51.4 million a year ago.Rialto Investments: Rialto Investments’ revenues of $73.4 million decreased from $81.5 million a year ago.

2238,LEN,"On Dec 27, shares of KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) rallied to a 52-week high of $32.20. The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $31.82.The homebuilding company has seen its shares rise roughly 25.9% so far this year significantly outperforming the 9.7% increase for the industry over the same period. Also, the company has outpaced the industry in each of the 4-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.The stock has a market cap of $2.7 billion. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months was approximately 2.55 million. Over the last one week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for KB Home moved up 0.6% for fiscal 2017 and 0.9% for fiscal 2018, reflecting analysts’ optimism. Earnings for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company are expected to grow 57.7% and 23% in fiscal 2017 and 2018, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We also note that the company displays long-term earnings growth rate of 19.5%, reinstating investors’ confidence in the stock.Can the Rally Continue?The company’s four strategic initiatives to drive profit and revenues are encouraging. These initiatives include giving a boost to community count, achieving higher revenues per community and higher profitability per unit, and increasing asset efficiency and return on capital invested.  KB Home remains focused on its core KB2020 business strategy, which aims to boost scale in existing geographic footprint, improve profitability per unit, creating higher operating margin, while generating positive cash flow to redeploy for growth and debt reduction.The company reported an impressive 23% growth in revenues, double-digit increase in deliveries and 41% surge in net income, in the first nine months of 2017. The upside was primarily driven by the ongoing favorable housing industry fundamentals.Per the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, sales of new residential houses jumped 17.5%. This was above the revised rate in October and 26.6% more than the year-ago estimate in November 2017. The data comes on the heels of a report issued by the National Association of Realtors (“NAR”), which reflected that existing home sales jumped for the third straight month in November. According to the NAR, November existing-home sales represented the strongest pace since December 2006, with sales growing to 5.81 million, increasing 5.6% from October.Homebuilding companies like KB Home, NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) are expected to continue to gain as the positive momentum is expected to continue to boost home sales in 2018 owing to strong consumer confidence, favorable demographics, pent-up demand, job gains and income growth. Also, the sales shortfall resulting from the hurricanes should be recovered in 2018.Moreover, we are also encouraged by the company’s aggressive land acquisition strategy.  KB Home invests aggressively in land acquisition and development, primarily in high-end locations, which is critical for community count as well as top-line growth. The company invested $1.4 billion in land and development in fiscal 2016, significantly higher than $967.2 million in fiscal 2015. Inventories grew to $3.51 billion, with investments in land acquisition and development totaling $1.12 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2239,LEN,"Sales of previously owned homes decreased in December 2017, as low inventory is limiting the choice of prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated. Again, unseasonably cold weather also accounted for a bit of the downfall.December Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales slipped 3.6% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57 million units from a downwardly revised 5.78 million in November after three straight months of strong increases. Nonetheless, existing home sales, which account for about 90% of U.S. home sales, grew 1.1% on a year-over-year basis during the month.Also, December’s median sales price grew 5.8% from the comparable period a year ago to $246,800, marking the 70th straight month of year-over-year gains. For 2017, prices increased 5.8%, rising for the sixth straight year.Again, inventory continues to slip, leaving less homes for future sales. The supply of existing homes decreased 11.4% from November and 10.3% from the year-ago period. It has fallen year over year for 31 consecutive months. As such, it will take only 3.2 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR. This is also the lowest reading since the group began tracking the data in 1999.An Impressive 2017 for HomebuildingAlthough the December housing data were not impressive, the larger picture is overwhelming for 2017. Existing home sales concluded the year with 1.1% gain to 5.51 million units, the highest since 2006. Building permits increased 4.7% and housing starts increased 2.4% in 2017 from the 2016 figure. The industry advanced almost 69% in 2017, outperforming the broader market’s (S&P 500) growth of 19.7%.Moreover, January 2018 builders’ confidence reading remained in the 70s, signaling that housing demand should continue to grow this year.U.S. Housing Signaling a Positive 2018 Amid OddsAlthough inventory constraints have been consistently pulling the housing market down, robust demand is keeping the industry alive. This is primarily because of solid labor market that is near full employment.Other hurdles such as rising prices owing to the limited land availability are keeping the affordability in check. Again, homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment.Market pundits are a shade worried that rising mortgage rates and caps on the deduction for mortgage interest following a recent overhaul of the tax code is likely to slow demand this year. That said, the latest report from the Mortgage Bankers Association, released on Jan 24, showed applications for loans to buy a home surging last week to their highest level since April 2010. Hence, despite concerns of chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, that are restricting homebuilders to respond to the growing demand to some extent, the overall demand picture remains quite strong, courtesy of strong economic growth and low level of unemployment.Investing in the homebuilding industry might sound profitable right now, as it falls within the top 8% (20 out of 256 industries) of the Zacks Industry Rank, which hints at further growth.Stocks to Bet onWe have identified five homebuilding stocks based on a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B.

Additionally, this homebuilder outperformed the industry in each of the four-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.Moreover, earnings estimates have risen in the last few weeks, suggesting that sentiments on Century Communities are moving in the right direction.

The housing market has been going strong lately, courtesy of steady job growth and gradual economic recovery. What Makes Century Communities a Solid BetStellar Performance & Solid Growth Prospect: The company earned record levels of revenues, deliveries and backlog in its last reported quarter. Home sales revenues increased a record 51%, deliveries grew 37% to 968 homes, backlog (in value) increased 81% to $689.3 million. Overall, the company witnessed significant improvement across nearly all operating metrics in Q3.The company remains encouraged by the homebuilding momentum in both its legacy and new markets, which helped it in driving another quarter of meaningful year-over-year growth in net new contracts.Century Communities has attractive upside potential banking on management's impressive execution of its growth strategy, the benefits from recent acquisitions, and broader positive homebuilding momentum in the United States.The company’s 2018 earnings are expected to grow 72.3%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 26.9%. Century Communities’ revenues are expected to increase 29.2% in 2018 compared with the industry average growth of 10.1%.UCP Acquisition: In August 2017, Century Communities completed the acquisition of UCP, Inc. at an aggregate transaction value of approximately $359 million, expanding the company’s reach into 10 states.Again, in October 2017, Century Communities completed the bolt-on acquisition of the assets of Sundquist Homes, thereby further strengthening its presence and enhancing operating efficiencies in that market.The acquisition of UCP will help the company to reach in the states of California, Washington, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. The combined company will operate in 10 states, 17 markets and 111 communities, with revenues of approximately $1.5 billion and inventories of $1.3 billion (as of Jun 30, 2017). The company remains optimistic and believes that this addition solidifies its position as the 16th largest public homebuilder in the United States. This transaction is expected to be accretive to 2018 earnings per share due to economies of scale, operational efficiencies and cost synergies.Undervalued Compared to Peers: The company currently has a trailing 12-month Price-to-Earnings or P/E ratio of 13.9. This compares favorably with its industry’s trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 18.3.Moreover, Century Communities has a forward P/E ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.4, lower than the industry’s P/E ratio of 12.4.

2241,LEN,"The U.S. homebuilders are now more optimistic about their sales prospects as the recent homebuilder sentiment leaped forward. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released on Aug 15 rose to 68 this month, the highest since May. This reflects an increase of four points from the July reading of 64.Sales of new single-family homes declined 9.4% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 571,000. However, the reading for the first seven months of 2017 remained steady at an increase of 9.2% year over year.Homebuilding companies are depending on steady demand from buyers, borne out by the latest data on groundbreaking for homes. A strong labor market and a soft interest rate regime have ensured consistent gains for homebuilder stocks.Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) is one such company that continues to show strength in several areas and adding the stock to your portfolio should not be a disappointment. The company is engaged in homebuilding and financial services in the United States.With assets of more than $12.4 billion, Lennar is one of the best-positioned homebuilders to capitalize on the housing recovery, courtesy of the diverse revenue mix, steady top-line performance, above-average order growth and improving SG&A leverage.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has good prospects and should make value addition to your portfolio.Earnings & Revenues GrowthArguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels are often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) ahead for the company in question.While Lennar has put up a historical (three-five years) EPS growth rate of 11.6%, investors should really focus on the projected growth. Here, the company is looking to grow at a rate of 10.2%.Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and investments in technology. In this respect, Lennar plans to reduce SG&A expenses to the range of 9.1-9.3% in 2017. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, SG&A expenses improved to 9.7% in the first half of fiscal 2017, from 9.9% in the year-ago period, due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries.Propelling the earnings forward is the company’s solid revenue growth story. After a strong performance in 2014, 2015 and 2016, Lennar delivered outstanding operating results in the first half of 2017.Thanks to strong demand in housing, Lennar’s total revenue grew 18.1% year over year in the first sixth months of fiscal 2017 on the back of solid homebuilding revenues that increased 15.7%. These were primarily driven by a 14% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 2% rise in the average sales price of homes delivered. Lennar’s core homebuilding results remain consistent with the “slow and steady” housing recovery.Evidently, its projected sales growth for the current year is 15.4% better than the industry’s average of 8%.Estimate RevisionsOver the last 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year’s earnings has moved up 1.4%, reflecting six upward revisions against two downward revisions. Also, next year’s earnings estimates inched up 3.2% on the back of six upward revisions against one downward revision. Positive earnings estimate revision indicates analysts’ confidence in the stock and add to the optimism.Further, Lennar has beaten earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.55%.Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lennar Corporation QuoteSolid ROELennar’s trailing 12-month Return on Equity (ROE) is 12.6% compared with the industry average of 10.2%. This indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared with its peer group.Strategic Land InvestmentsLennar strategically focused on acquiring low-cost new home sites in well-positioned markets during the downturn, which placed it well to meet growing demand during the upturn, thus giving it a competitive edge over its peers facing land availability constraints.However, as the housing recovery gains momentum and competition for land assets intensifies, management has decided against purchasing low-margin land assets. Lennar has strategically shifted away from a land-heavy acquisition strategy to acquiring lands with a shorter two to three-year average life. Instead, it wants to focus on slower but more orderly and sustainable growth to improve cash flows and profitability.In February 2017, Lennar acquired WCI Communities, Inc. With a portfolio of high quality, low cost land and 51 communities, the integration is expected to produce strong gross margin going forward.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the industry are KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and NVR Inc.

2243,LEN,"The construction sector has seen a strong year so far on robust gains from home building investments and a rebounding U.S. economy. Spending on construction was up 4.1% year over year in the first 10 months of the year, per the latest report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Notably, U.S. construction spending rose 1.4% in October, marking the best gain in five months, with increases logged by all major categories of building.Is the rally here to stay or is it only for the short term? Let us see whether the bullish momentum can continue.Economy in Solid ShapeThe world’s largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% in the July-September quarter, marking the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and a nice pickup from the second quarter's 3.1%. As per the latest Goldman Sachs forecast, U.S. GDP growth is expected to come in at 2.5% in 2018, up from the 2.2% forecast for 2017 and 1.6% recorded in 2016.Economists are of the opinion that the rebound in the U.S. economy along with a further decline in unemployment (4.1% in November) will keep the momentum alive for the sector. The November figure marked the lowest since December 2000. The United States has added jobs for 86 straight months, the longest streak so far. Moreover, Americans are highly optimistic about the economy with consumer confidence climbing to the highest level in 17 years.Housing Industry Boom to ContinueThe dynamic performance of the construction sector has been majorly buoyed by strong homebuilding activities. Homebuilding spending has increased 6.6% so far this year. Also, there are signs of increased inclination of home purchases among millennials, a generation that had to some extent refrained from entering the market.Again, confidence among homebuilders rose in November to its highest reading in eight months to 70 and second-highest since the recession, according to the Housing Market Index by the National Association of Home Builders (""NAHB"") and Wells Fargo.The positive momentum is expected to continue in 2018, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs.Though the U.S. housing industry is gradually recovering from damages caused by the recent hurricanes, limited land availability, labor shortage and higher material costs, there is nothing to fret about. Also, despite the repeated hikes of the Federal Reserve’s interest rates, optimism surrounding the housing market remains largely unaffected.Public Construction Outlook PositiveOptimism surrounding the construction sector’s grew manifold post President Trump’s victory as one of his key priorities has been driving infrastructure investments..Though spending on government projects declined 3.4% year to date, it grew 3% in October, the biggest one-month gain in three years, with spending at the federal, state and local levels rising. Government project spend is expected to increase in 2018, with the Trump Administration’s $1-trillion infrastructure spend program yet to materialize.As per the study by Dodge Data & Analytics, public works construction is expected improve 3% in 2018, higher than the 1% growth in 2017. Highways and bridges projects are expected to get boosted as federal funding is rising owing to the FAST Act. Reconstruction efforts related to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are also anticipated.How is the Sector Placed?It is very evident from the above discussed factors that the positive momentum of the constructions sector is likely to continue in 2018.The improvement in the construction sector’s Zacks Rank is reflective of the trend. The Zacks construction sector rank jumped from 3 to 2 (out of 16 sectors) last week, reflecting 42 positive revisions versus 35 negative. Notably, a sector with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) stocks will have a better average than the rest.Also, the Zacks Construction sector registered EPS growth of 23.1% on a year-over-year basis, highest among the 16 sectors. It has advanced 21.9% so far this year, comparing favorably with 18.9% growth of the broader market (S&P 500). Hence, it’s wise to bet on a few construction stocks that are expected to cash in on this positive momentum.Choosing the Right StocksWe believe that investors can profit from extrapolating the current bullish trend. Henceforth, turning to the momentum strategy seems prudent at the moment. However, picking the right momentum stocks is quite a tricky business for even seasoned investors.Our research shows that stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential for the short term. The Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates the best time to buy a stock and take advantage of its momentum with a highest probability of success. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We have also taken into consideration a few more criteria to select the stocks. These include better returns than the industry this year and average daily volume of more than 20,000. Our research shows that stocks with this combination offer the best upside potential.Boise Cascade Company (BCC  -  Free Report) sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Momentum Score of A. Shares of the company have gained 24.3% as compared with its industry’s gain of 9.5%, year to date.It delivered positive surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 116.3%. Moreover, the company is witnessing upward estimate revisions — up 19.6% for 2017 and 4.5% for 2018 respectively — in the last 60 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects an EPS growth of 85.7% and sales growth of 12.9% in 2017. The expansion is expected to continue next year, with current estimates hinting at earnings growth of 7.2% and revenue growth of 6.3%. Again, the company’s EPS is projected to grow nearly 17.6% in the next three to five years.NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #1 and Momentum Score of A.

(LEN  -  Free Report) in a $9.3-billion deal. This combined business is expected to create one of the country’s largest homebuilder.Post completion in the first quarter of 2018, Lennar and CalAtlantic will control nearly 240,000 homesites nationwide. The combined company will cover approximately 50% of the U.S. population and is expected to generate roughly $250 million in annual cost savings, with about $75 million expected in fiscal 2018.

2245,LEN,"Lennar Corporation’s (LEN  -  Free Report) diversified line of home offerings for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers and positive housing market fundamental are the driving factors for this leading homebuilder in the United States.However, labor shortage along with rising land and labor costs pose a threat to the company’s margins.Last quarter, the company’s earnings and revenues surpassed expectations on for the seventh time in a row. Its third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the bottom line improved 5% from $1.01 reported a year ago.  Solid demand for homes, favorable job market and interest rates along with increased consumer confidence helped the homebuilder post higher numbers.Total revenues of $3.26 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 billion by 1.3%. The top line also grew 15% year over year as the homebuilding, financial services and multi-family segments performed significantly well.Key Growth DriversLennar is one of the well-positioned homebuilders to capitalize on the housing recovery driven by diverse revenue mix, steady top-line performance, above-average order growth and improving SG&A leverage.The company offers a diversified line of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers. Additionally, it regularly upgrades homes to cater to the changing consumer requirements. For example, it introduced NextGen homes, or a home within a home, to allow the homebuyers — who need to accommodate children and parents — to share the cost of their mortgage and other living expenses.Meanwhile, Lennar’s continued focus on digital marketing is driving traffic to its communities. Also, the company uses various technology initiatives to improve its operating model. In this regard, Lennar’s dynamic pricing tool seems to be quite successful.Furthermore, Lennar’s ancillary businesses like Rialto and Multi-Family provide diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities. Notably, Rialto is a significant source of valuable homebuilding deals and an important contributor to cash flow.These initiatives have helped Lennar to deliver stellar performances. Evidently, the company’s total revenues grew 17% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 on the back of a solid 28.3% rise in homebuilding revenues. The top line was primarily driven by a 13% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 3% rise in the average sales price of the homes delivered. In the meantime, Lennar’s core homebuilding results remain consistent with the slow and steady housing recovery.Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and investments in technology. In sync with this, it plans to reduce SG&A expenses in the range of 8.5-8.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The company maintained its 7% to 10% growth target and is focused on driving operating costs down, in order to drive bottom line and cash flow.Moreover, Lennar has agreed to take over CalAtlantic Group Inc.  in a deal worth $9.3 billion (including debt) announced on Oct 31. This, in turn, might make Lennar one of the country’s top three home builders among 24 of the top 30 U.S. markets. The combined entity will have a footprint touching approximately 50% of the U.S. population and is expected to generate meaningful cost savings. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.ConcernsRising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. While labor shortages are leading to higher wages, land prices are inflating due to limited availability. Going ahead, more inflation is anticipated that might dent homebuilders’ margins. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Lennar’s gross margin on home sales decreased 90 basis points year over year, primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home.So far this year, Lennar’s shares have gained 44.8% compared with 64.6% growth of the industry. Earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 have remained stable in the past 30 days.Nonetheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to outperform in the near term owing to the synergies arising out of the CalAtlantic buyout. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors may also consider stocks like NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report).NVR sports a Zacks Rank #1 and is likely to witness a rise of 42.5% in earnings for the current year.D.R. Horton, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, is expected to witness 17.4% earnings growth this year.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2246,LEN,"After two months of robust gains, housing starts and permits results were not impressive last December. Per the latest jointly released report from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, housing starts decreased 8.2% in December 2017 to 1.92 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate) from the prior month owing to a 11.8% drop in single-family housing starts. This also marks the highest drop since November 2016 owing to colder than normal temperatures in some parts of United States.Residential building permits, an indicator of upcoming construction activity, decreased 0.1% in December to an annualized rate of 1.3 million units from November. Single-family home permits increased 1.8%, while that for the construction of multi-family homes decreased 4.3%.Moreover, the confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped slightly in the first month of 2018 after reaching an 18-year high in December 2017, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ (NAHB) Housing Market Index.The January 2018 reading was down two points to 72 from the December level of 74. Notably, all three Housing Market Index (HMI) components slipped slightly. Current sales conditions decreased one point to 79. Buyer traffic decreased four points to 54 and sales prediction over the next six months slipped one point to 78.Is It Really a Concern?The latest disruption is not really a concern as it is more likely because of an extremely cold winter. The larger picture is still overwhelming with building permits increasing 4.7% in 2017 and housing starts rising 2.4% over the 2016 figure. Moreover, a builders confidence reading in the 70s range is considered confident enough. Therefore, it is not necessary to pay heed to the current decline in data.Investors can be fairly confident about the housing sector’s performance in 2018 on an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs.After the solid 3.1% economic growth in the July-September quarter, the world’s largest economy is expected to advance 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, per the latest Atlanta Fed’s real-time Q4 GDP growth estimate. This solid upbeat projection holds particularly true when one of the nation’s key economic drivers, i.e. construction activity, is strengthening. Also, a declining unemployment rate (4.1% in December 2017) is encouraging.Though the U.S. housing industry is gradually recovering from damages caused by the recent hurricanes, limited land availability, labor shortage and higher material costs, there is nothing to fret about. Also, despite a probability of mortgage rate hikes in 2018, optimism surrounding the housing market remains largely unaffected.How is the Sector Placed?The Zacks Homebuilding Industry has advanced 70.4% in the past year, comparing favorably with 24% growth of the broader market (S&P 500). Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 6% out of more than 250 industries) supports the growth potential of the stocks in this industry.  Moreover, this industry’s three-five year expected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 16.3% is better than the broader market’s 9.7%.Major homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), to name a few, are well poised on bullish fundamentals of the housing market.While KB Home, Lennar and D.R.

2247,LEN,"The upcoming construction sector earnings results are expected to benefit from economic growth, the labor market, higher demand, tighter inventories and rising home prices. These positive factors are reflected in the improving estimates picture for the sector ahead of the major earnings releases starting next week.  After the solid 3.1% economic growth in the in the July-September quarter, the world’s largest economy is expected to have advanced 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, per the latest Atlanta Fed’s real-time Q4 GDP growth estimate. This solid upbeat projection holds particularly true when one of the nation’s key economic drivers, i.e. construction activity, is gradually strengthening its footprint accompanied by a declining unemployment rate (4.1% in December 2017).Construction Sector at a GlanceOverall, 2017 was a great year for the construction sector. The dynamic performance of the sector has been majorly buoyed by strong homebuilding activities and a rebounding U.S. economy. Spending on construction was up 4.2% year over year in the first 11 months of 2017, per the latest U.S. Census Bureau report. Although spending on government projects declined 3.4% during the period, homebuilding spending increased 6.6%.The sector has seen a strong year primarily on the back of robust gains from homebuilding investments. Although challenges in the housing industry persist in the form of low supply levels/limited listings, adverse impact of hurricanes as well as rising prices, factors like strong consumer confidence, favorable demographics, pent-up demand, job gains and income growth are outweighing the headwinds facing the sector.The latest data from the National Association of Realtors reveals that existing home sales for the month of November increased 5.6% to 5.81 million units in November to hit an 11-year high. Existing home sales, which account for 90% of home sales in the United States, surged 3.8% year over year in November.Meanwhile, the confidence level among the nation's homebuilders ended 2017 on a high note as the housing market index (HMI) was at 74 in December. This marks the highest reading since 1999.Disruptions caused by the hurricanes and other natural disasters seemed to be somewhat short-lived as revealed from recent economic data reports. Again, builders seem to have shaken off worries related to the Republican tax plan, and believe that the business incentives in the plan are likely to offset the negatives.A close look at the recently released financial numbers of the nation’s major homebuilders reveal the positive picture of this earnings season. KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) ended fiscal 2017 on an impressive note based on solid housing fundamentals. The homebuilder surpassed expectations in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 on both top and bottom lines. Again, Lennar Corporation’s (LEN  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.29 per share fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50 by 14% and decreased 1.5% from the year-ago level of $1.31. Nonetheless, total revenues of $3.79 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.62 billion by 4.5%.Q4 ExpectationsMajority of the Zacks broad sectors (13 out of 16) are expected to be in the positive territory in the final quarter of 2017. For the construction sector, as far as estimates are concerned, the overall picture is indeed rosy in this earnings season. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the construction sector’s earnings are expected to increase 16.8% in the fourth quarter compared with 11.6% earnings growth witnessed in the third. Revenues too are expected to increase 10.5% (12.3% growth in Q3), while margins are expected at 0.4% (-0.1% in Q3).In spite of the inventory woes and higher land/labor costs, it is a profitable strategy to zero in on a handful of construction stocks that are poised to beat earnings this quarter. An earnings beat would also pave the way for stock price appreciation.Which Are the Right Picks?Picking the right stock for your portfolio could appear to be a daunting task given the wide range of companies in the construction space. An easy way is to look at stocks that have a solid Zacks Rank accompanied by a favorable Earnings ESP.  The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP usually hints at an earnings beat.

2248,LEN,"So far, we have seen Q2 results from only 15.4% of the construction companies in the S&P 500 cohort. Prominent construction companies like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report) and United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) kick off the earnings season with both its top and bottom lines beating estimates.Investor sentiment seems to be quite high at the start of the second-quarter reporting cycle, given the solid earnings outlook and favorable construction sector’s fundamentals. Per the latest Earnings Trends, 100% companies posted earnings as well as revenue beat. Although total earnings of these construction companies have decreased by a meager 0.7% so far, its revenues have increased 15.5%.Overall, construction companies seem to be on solid ground. The construction sector’s earnings are expected to increase 15.8% in Q2 compared with 9% in the earlier quarter. Revenues are also expected to improve 8.4% (6.8% growth in Q1).Positives such as an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence raise optimism about the sector’s performance in 2017. As such, demand for companies’ products should also increase, thereby driving revenues.Early next week, performance of other construction companies like Lennox International, Inc.

2249,LEN,"U.S. housing starts turned the corner in June, rebounding from a three month long slump. Ground was broken on new homes at the sharpest annual rate recorded over four months. Surely, Wednesday’s report on housing from the Department of Commerce will a long way toward restoring confidence in a sector that has had more than its fair share of troubles recently.Fresh questions had risen about the health of the homebuilding industry after a particularly dismal report on homebuilder sentiment was released on Tuesday. But the housing starts report indicates that demand on the buyer side remains high at a time when homebuilder stocks are surging. Picking up homebuilding stocks continues to remain a lucrative option at this time.June Rebound Ends 3-Month DeclineAccording to the Department of Commerce, housing starts increased by 8.3% from May to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.22 million in June. This represents a 2.1% annual increase, the highest recorded in four months. June’s housing starts were also considerably higher than the estimated level of 1.16 million. The increase experienced last month comes after three straight monthly declines. Additionally, May’s housing starts figure of 1.09 million, originally the lowest recorded in eight months, was revised upward to 1.12 million.Building permits also increased, by 7.4%, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.25 million. The forward looking metric also experienced a year-over-year increase of 5.1%, implying that housing activity is likely to remain strong in the near future. Meanwhile, single family starts increased by 6.3%, indicating that homebuilding companies were prioritizing homes built for sale over those intended for rentals.Construction of multifamily homes, which includes apartment buildings and townhouses, increased by 13.3%. This substantial increase represents a strong rebound after five consecutive months of declines. Additionally, housing starts experienced increases over three of the four geographical regions surveyed. This includes a 22% jump in the Midwest. Meanwhile, housing completions increased by 5.2% to the highest level witnessed since Nov 2016.Is Falling Homebuilder Confidence Really a Worry? The bullish housing starts report is particularly significant since it comes immediately after a substantial decline in homebuilder sentiment. In July, homebuilder sentiment declined from 67 to 64, its lowest level in eight months. The immediate trigger for the decline is the rising cost of construction materials, following the imposition of a steep tariff on Canadian lumber. Initially, homebuilders were hopeful that President Trump would deliver on promises to curtail regulations. However, the index remains well above 50, which means that improvement in the sector continues, but at a slower pace.But the industry is less hopeful of action on the policy front, since Trump’s promises continue to remain unfulfilled. Instead, homebuilders are depending on steady demand from buyers, borne out by the latest data on groundbreaking for homes. A strong labor market and a soft interest rate regime have ensured consistent gains for homebuilder stocks. For instance, LGI Homes, Inc. (LGIH  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) have gained 48.3% and 34.1% year to date. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB  -  Free Report) has increased by 15% over the same period.Our ChoicesA strong housing starts report has gone a long way in restoring investors’ confidence in the homebuilding sector.

2250,LEN,"Foreign investment in U.S. housing has surged 49% from April 2016 to March 2017, per the National Association of Realtors.The data is based on responses from 6,000 realtors for a survey conducted by the association annually.International buyers bought a record $153 billion worth of U.S. residential properties in the year-ended March 2017 compared with $102.6 billion in March 2016.

2251,LEN,"The Q2 earnings season is gathering steam with 15.4% of the construction companies having already released their numbers. And they’re unblemished with earnings as well as revenue beat ratio of 100%. Major homebuilders such as KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) have outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 26.92%, 16.67% and 17.74%, respectively.Investor sentiment is quite high at the start of the second-quarter reporting cycle given the solid earnings outlook and favorable homebuilding/housing industry fundamentals. The S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index has returned 14.6% year to date. The Zacks categorized Building-Residential/Commercial industry has gained almost 30% so far this year, faring a lot better than the broader market (S&P 500) that has returned 9.3%.The housing market stands tall courtesy of continued strong job growth. The 2017 outlook for homebuilding is quite compelling, given historically low mortgage rates, healthy demand, consistent job growth and solid homebuilders’ confidence. Although homebuilders’ confidence dipped slightly in June, it’s still above 50, which is encouraging. Moreover, mortgage rates are near historic lows even after the Fed’s recent interest rate hike. Through May 2017, the U.S. economy added jobs for the 80th straight month. The unemployment rate was 4.3% in May, the lowest since 2001.Solid Earnings OutlookOverall, homebuilding companies seem to be on solid ground. Notably, homebuilding companies are broadly grouped in the Construction sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).  Per the Zacks latest Earnings Trends report, the construction sector’s earnings are expected to increase 15.7% in Q2 compared with 9% in the earlier quarter. Revenues are also expected to improve 8.4% (6.8% growth in Q1). For 2017, earnings will probably rise 18.3% (against 7.6% in 2016) on 10.1% revenue growth (6.9% a year ago).Higher Demand Defying WeaknessesAccording to recently released existing home sales data by the National Association of Realtors, existing home sales increased 1.1% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.62 million units in May. Sales were 2.7% higher than the year-ago level, growing at the third-highest clip in the last one year. It is important to note here that existing home sales make up a large part of all the U.S. homebuilding activity relative to new home sales.Meanwhile, new home sales increased 2.9% month over month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 610,000 units in May, per the latest report released by the Commerce Department. April's sales pace was also revised sharply to 593,000 units from 569,000 units. Sales of new single-family houses in May 2017 were 8.9% higher year over year.A rise in mortgage rates is undeniably the most dampening factor for the homebuilding industry. A tight labor market, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are restricting homebuilders to respond to growing demand. Despite concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, optimism surrounding the housing market remains unruffled. The U.S. homebuilding industry is in good shape, and continues to be one of the pillars on which the economy rests.Although homebuilders acknowledge the rise in labor shortage and land/labor cost, they in general expect the housing market to continue to recover this year in tandem with steady economic growth.The case for investing in homebuilding stocks looks good in the light of the above arguments. So, it is a profitable strategy to zero in on a handful of homebuilders that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter. An earnings beat should help these stocks gain investor confidence, paving the way for strong price appreciation.Which Are the Right Picks?Picking the right stock for your portfolio could appear to be a daunting task given the wide range of companies in the construction space. An easy way is to look at stocks that have a solid Zacks Rank accompanied by a favorable Earnings ESP. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP usually hints at an earnings beat.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to pull a surprise in their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Winning StocksFor investors seeking to apply this strategy to their portfolio, we have highlighted four housing stocks that may stand out this season.Our first choice is Owens Corning (OC  -  Free Report), engaged in the business of composite and building materials systems. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 29.81%. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.02 a share.For the upcoming release, the company has an Earnings ESP of +10.78% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The company is set to report second-quarter results on Jul 26 before the opening bell.Secondly, Lennox International Inc.

2301,LEN,"Markets finished at record levels on Tuesday after banks and healthcare stocks rallied. Further, reports that Boeing had delivered a record number of airplanes in 2017 pushed the Dow into record territory. Both, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased for the sixth consecutive sessions. Meanwhile, a report from the National Federation of Independent Businesses showed that small-business optimism declined in December.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.4% to close at 25,385.80. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to close at 2,751.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,163.58, gaining 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased almost 6.3% to close at 10.12. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Gains for Boeing Push the Dow HigherShares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) surged on Tuesday following reports that the aero-giant delivered a record 763 commercial airplanes in 2017. This marks a fresh record for the airplane maker as it surpassed its earlier record in 2015 by one unit.The company also announced that it had booked orders for 912 commercial airplanes, which is its seventh highest annual total. This led to its highest ever order backlog, which rose to 5,864 airplanes by the end of 2017. Such a backlog is worth around seven years of production. Such events led to shares of Boeing gaining 2.7%, which contributed as much as 57 points to the Dow.The blue-chip index amassed 120.8 points on Tuesday to finish at a record 25,385.80. What also contributed to Dow’s gains was increase in the shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which gained 1.6% and added 15 points to the Dow. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) closed at a record level after surging 0.2%. Supporting gains for the index were shares of Matson, Inc. (MATX  -  Free Report) and J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report), which gained 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.S&P 500 and Nasdaq Post Record ClosesThe S&P 500 gained 3.6 points to close at a record for the sixth straight session. The marks its best start to a year since 1987. Of the 11 major sectors of the broad-market index, only five ended in the positive territory with healthcare and financials leading the advancers and real estate the laggards.However, losses from real estate were more than made up by gains from financial and healthcare stocks. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) and Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) gained 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively.Meanwhile, Nasdaq added 6.2 points to also close at a record for the sixth straight session — its highest since the period between 1992 and 1999. Gains for the tech-laden index were broad-based. Markets also gained traction due to optimism surrounding the strong market rally that kicked off 2018.Economic DataOn the economic data front, the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) reported that the index of small-business optimism tanked 2.6 points to 104.9 for the month of December. Such a decline comes right after the Republican Tax Bill was implemented.The decline can be owed to sluggishness and imbalance in the labor market which has impacted hiring in the United States. Moreover, the capex for December increased only marginally, which further dampened the small-business sentiment.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUnited Continental December Traffic Up, Q4 Guidance AlteredUnited Continental Holdings, Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary, United Airlines, reported dismal traffic numbers for December.

2302,LEN,"Primoris Heavy Civil, part of Primoris Services Corporation’s (PRIM  -  Free Report) Civil segment has won a new heavy civil contract worth $25 million from the Texas Department of Transportation. The project entails the construction of an elevated intersection over two diverging railroad tracks in the greater Houston area.  Primoris’ scope of work includes earthwork grading, retaining walls, construction of a 165,000 square foot multidirectional bridge, a storm drainage system, as well as demolition of the existing roadways and associated features. Work is scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2018 with completion planned in the third quarter of 2020. This project win comes following another deal by Primoris’ Civil segment. On Jan 4, Primoris announced that it had been awarded a heavy civil award valued at $19 million from the Texas Department of Transportation for a project located in Houston. This award was signed in the fourth quarter of 2017 and will consequently be included in the 2017 year-end backlog calculation. The award is for two and a half miles of new roadway, including earthwork grading, the construction of four bridges, a four lane concrete paved boulevard roadway with intersections, pipe and inlet storm drainage system, retaining walls, traffic signals, and roadway illumination. Work on the project is expected to start the first quarter of 2018 and slated to be completed in the third quarter of 2019. Primoris’ Civil segment operates primarily in the Southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and specializes in highway and bridge construction, airport runway and taxiway construction, demolition, heavy earthwork, soil stabilization, mass excavation, and drainage project. The segment accounted for 20% of the total revenues in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Primoris seems to be optimistic about bidding opportunities that are expected to continue increasing backlog. Further, the company is poised to benefit from its efforts to strengthen the sales teams, consequently leading to more consistent project wins.  In the past year, Primoris has outperformed the industry which it belongs to. The company’s shares have gained around 14.2%, compared with the industry’s growth of 10.4%. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Primoris carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the construction sector include Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report). All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Lennar has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.94%.

2303,LEN,"On a median year-over-year EPS growth rate basis, the earnings reports so far have been far more robust than just about anyone was expecting. It is still early with just 64 (12.8%) of the results in, but it looks like we could have a double-digit gain on this basis for the quarter. The firms that have already reported are showing a median increase of 10.4% over a year ago. That is certainly not something to become despondent over.
"
2304,LEN,"The median for the firms yet to report is almost exactly the same as for those that have already reported, at 10.5%. This is especially true since over one-fifth of the Financials have reported, and none of the Energy firms have done so. Positive surprises are leading disappointments by a very strong ratio of 3.75:1. Every sector but Materials (a 1:1 tie) has seen more positive than negative surprises.  That of course excludes those that have yet to have any firms report. The median surprise is also strong at 3.45%.
"
2305,LEN,"The sectors with very strong surprise pictures include Tech, where positive surprises are leading disappointments by 8:1. The median surprise matches that of the overall market at 3.45%. The year-over-year growth in the sector is a very robust 27.3%.
"
2306,LEN,"Health Care is also putting in a fine showing in the early going with no disappointments and four positive surprises, a robust median surprise of 5.8% and year-over-year EPS growth of 20.0%.
"
2307,LEN,"Consumer Staples are also doing well in the early going with a median surprise of 7.9% on six positive surprises and no disappointments. Growth is clocking in at 12.1%.
"
2308,LEN,"Even in the two ""bad"" sectors, Financials and Discretionary, things so far have not been as bad as many had feared. True that median EPS has been sharply negative for both sectors, down 27.9% in the case of the Financials and 10.6% for the Discretionary firms, but they were expected to do much worse. Positive surprises are outpacing disappointments by 2.6:1 with a 5.7% median surprise in the case of Financials, and by 2.7:1 with and 2.3% median surprise in the case of the Discretionary firms.
"
2309,LEN,"There are three sectors that have yet to have any firms report yet: Energy, Utilities and Telecom. It is worth noting that they hold gold, silver and bronze for the expectations of the firms yet to report. It seems very possible that when all is said and done the median EPS growth for the S&P 500 will be even higher than the robust 10.4% seen so far.
"
2310,LEN,"Keep in mind what the median measures. It is a gauge of what the ""normal"" firm will report in terms of EPS. It is not influenced significantly by extreme data points, and implicitly treats the results from Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) as being just as important as the results for Murphy Oil (MUR  -  Free Report), Manitowoc (MTW  -  Free Report) and Big Lots (BIG). Changes in shares outstanding, due to buybacks or new issuance also affect the results in this measure, while they do not when measuring total net income.

"
2312,LEN,"While the median EPS numbers so far are healthy, the total net income numbers are not. Thus far, the 64 firms that have reported have in total come in with total net income that is 19.5% below what they reported in the first quarter of 2007. However, the results are not uniformly bad, some sectors are bearing the brunt and others are weathering the storm nicely. Overall, 309 (61.8%) of the firms in the S&P 500 are expected to report higher net income than they did a year ago.
"
2313,LEN,"The Financials are off to a rocky start, with net income just a little bit more than half the levels of a year ago (-49.2%). Granted this is a big improvement over what those same firms reported for the fourth quarter, but it is still hard to spin it as good news. The total net income for the 20 Financial firms that have already reported is $10.7 billion, well below the $21 billion they reported a year ago, but a nice improvement from the $6.6 billion they reported in the fourth quarter.
"
2314,LEN,"The Consumer Discretionary sector has also been slammed, with total net income decline of 18.7%, this decline is roughly in line with the 19.2% decline they posted in the fourth quarter. Not surprisingly, the worst losses in the sector have been taken by the two homebuilders (KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report)) that have reported. However, two thirds of the firms in the sector that have reported earned less this year than a year ago, so its not just the homebuilders who are hurting.
"
2315,LEN,"The other sector that is showing a year-over-year decline in total net income is the Industrials. This can be entirely laid at the feet of the big miss at GE, which is the elephant of the sector, accounting for almost 20% of the total earnings of the sector last year. However, it appears that the miss had more to do with weakness in its financial unit that its industrial units.
"
2316,LEN,"Earnings in the rest of the economy have been very robust so far, with four of the seven sectors with firms reporting showing double-digit gains. Tech is in the lead with a 20.4% gain, followed by Staples with a 17.1% rise in total net income. Health Care and Materials follow with gains of 11.1% and 10.3%, respectively.
"
2317,LEN,"When those that are reported are combined with the expectations for those yet to report, overall the total net income for the S&P 500 is expected to decline by 2.0%. This equates to a decline in total net income of $4.6 billion for the quarter. This is roughly in line with the performance in the third quarter of 2007, and a vast improvement over the 22.6% decline in the fourth quarter.
"
2318,LEN,"The Energy sector is expected to be the biggest winner by a large margin, with total net income expected to rise by 34.3%. Not a shock given where oil prices are, but not exactly due to easy comps either. All told earnings in the Energy sector should be $9.7 billion higher than a year ago.
"
2319,LEN,"Even with the miss at GE, the Industrial sector is expected to have a good quarter overall. The firms yet to report are expected to show a total gain of 21.1%, which would lift the sector into second place in the overall growth standings with a gain of 15.5%. Much of the gain is expected to come from higher exports and from gains in currency translation.
"
2320,LEN,"Materials and Tech are also expected to post double-digit gains in net income when all is said and done. While the 11.8% gain expected from Tech is well below what the sector has shown so far, it is not awful in the context of a slowing economy. Here again strong operations overseas should more than offset domestic weakness.

"
2322,LEN,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
2323,LEN,"The revisions ratio remains very weak, with almost than twice as many estimates for 2008 earnings being cut as increased. However, we did see a nice improvement, with the ratio rising to 0.57 from 0.49 a week ago. Still a weak reading but it does appear that the analysts are reacting to the better than expected results posted so far. The overall pace of estimate revisions is starting to pick up. Over the last four weeks there have been 1,666 changes in estimates: 608 up and 1,058 down, up 15.7% from 1440: 473 up and 967 down last week. Look for the number to almost double over the next four or five weeks as the analysts react to the first quarter reports. Only three sectors, Energy, Consumer Staples and Materials are solidly in positive territory. Utilities remained roughly neutral. Health Care moved to the neutral area from negative last week. Five sectors saw more than two cuts for every increase, and three more than a 3:1 ratio.
"
2324,LEN,"Staples were in the top spot with a revisions ratio of 2.07 this week. This was largely due to strength at Conagra (CAG  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Walgreen (WAG).
"
2325,LEN,"In Energy, the general story is: Upstream good, downstream bad. The Exploration and Production firms such as Anadarko (APC), XTO Energy (XTO) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) were noteworthy for their strength. The independent refiners like Tesoro (TSO) and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) bucked the trend and were weak. As angry as people are about prices at the pump, this is strong evidence that it is the price of crude, not huge downstream (refining and marketing) profits that are the heart of the problem.
"
2326,LEN,"The Financial sector continues to get slammed with estimate cuts, currently running at more than three times as many as estimate increases. Banks, brokers and insurance companies were all slammed with cuts, and there seemed few places to hide.
"
2327,LEN,"However, the sector is not alone. In Tech more than three times as many estimates were chopped than increased. The weakness there is most noticeable among the Semiconductors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC) and Micron (MU).

"
2329,LEN,"The 2009 revisions story is similar to the 2008 story. The revisions ratio is identical at 0.54, down from 0.49 last week, and 0.50 two weeks ago. Very weak, but showing some signs of improvement. Analysts seem to be suspecting that the period of earnings weakness stemming from the soft economy could last quite a while.
"
2330,LEN,"The most strength comes from the commodity sensitive Energy and Materials sectors. The Staples sector also joined the party this week, mostly due to strength at GIS and WAG. Energy leads the parade this week with more than three increases for every cut. The strong firms were very similar to those for 2008, but the downstream firms were not as weak. The strength in the sector was very widespread.
"
2331,LEN,"The Telecom sector has awful revisions ratio of 0.09, or eleven cuts for each increase, but that is also partly a function of a very low number of revisions (24 total, 2 up and 22 down). However, every firm in the sector saw more estimate cuts than increases. The revisions picture for the Financial sector is no brighter for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.21. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front.
"
2332,LEN,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also starting to pick up. There were a total of 1,203 revisions: 422 up and 781 down. This is up 12.7% from 1,067 (349 up and 718 down) last week. As with the 2008 revisions, this number is likely to climb dramatically over the next few weeks. Keep in mind that the numbers for some of the individual sectors are still very light. However, the ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.76, somewhat stronger than the revisions ratio, but still very much in negative territory.

"
2334,LEN,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
2335,LEN,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
2336,LEN,"Despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market, accounting for a much larger slice of the earnings in each year than any other sector. Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.1% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 19.1% before rebounding to 21.7% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. Thus even though the sector is at a substantial discount on P/E basis to the overall market it is still the biggest total market cap sector, at 16.43%.
"
2337,LEN,"That may not last for long as the Tech sector is nipping at its heels at 16.03%.  Given the on going massive cuts in estimates, please take the P/E on the Financials with a bag of rock salt. The true earnings are likely to be far lower than current estimates now suggest.
"
2338,LEN,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 12.6x and based on 2009, only 9.5x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower. Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings, trading at 11.7x, and 11.7x based on 2009 expectations. If current forecasts come to pass the Financials well regain the title of the cheapest based on 2009 earnings. But keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the Financials.
"
2339,LEN,"While Energy accounts for only 13.8% of the total market cap of the S&P 500, it was responsible for 15.8% of 2007 earnings and is expected to be the source of 17.1% of 2008 earnings (falling to 15.6% in 2009). This is almost a mirror image of Tech which has a 16.0% weight in the index but was responsible for only 11.7% of 2007 earnings. However, Techs earnings share is expected to rise to 12.8% in 2008 and 12.9% in 2009.
"
2340,LEN,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 14.6x and 12.6x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 75% 2008 earnings and 25% 2009 earnings, that translates to a 7.1% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.78% ten year T-note. Even against the AA corporate bond yield of 5.95% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still imply that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.  The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

2344,LEN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Lennar has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.8. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Lennar’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Lennar has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Lennar stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Lennar has a P/S ratio of about 1.1. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, LEN is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Lennar currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Lennar a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Lennar might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F. This gives LEN a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging. The current quarter has seen no estimates to go higher in the past sixty days compared to seven lower, while the full year estimate has seen six up and two down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 18.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has gone lower by 6.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Lennar Corporation Price and Consensus Lennar Corporation Price and Consensus | Lennar Corporation QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineLennar is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 29% out of more than 250 industries) further strengthens its growth potential. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2346,LEN,"We expect Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 10, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.95%. This Miami-based homebuilder also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 9.10%.Notably, Lennar’s diversified line of home offerings for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers and positive housing market fundamental are positives for this leading homebuilder in the United States.In fact, the company has been reporting solid top-line numbers and the trend is expected to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well, owing to the strong demand for homes, favorable job market and impressive economic conditions (read more: Will Higher Housing Demand Drive Lennar's Q4 Revenues?). However, weather-related issues might impact the sales conversion to some extent. Going forward, Lennar anticipates the rebuilding effort to drive higher demand for new homes.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s Homebuilding segment revenues (comprising almost 88.5% of total revenues) of $3.2 billion are likely to increase 11.4% sequentially and 6.9% year over year. This improvement is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog.For the final quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expects deliveries to be in the range of 8,200-8,300 compared with 8,228 in the year-ago quarter and 7,598 in the preceding one.On the flip side, Lennar, like other renowned homebuilding companies, has been under pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins. While labor shortages are leading to higher wages, land prices are increasing due to limited availability.Lennar’s gross margin on home sales decreased 90 basis points or bps year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The decline was primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home. This trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter.For the fourth quarter, the company expects gross margin in the range of 22-22.25%. This reflects a decline of approximately 130-105 bps from the year-ago level of 23.3%. The downside might be largely due to higher input costs, besides less sales conversion owing to weather-related issues (read more: Will Higher Costs Weigh on Lennar's Q4 Gross Margin?).Nonetheless, Lennar’s diligent effort to improve its operating efficiency via digital marketing efforts, dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives are expected to offset the headwinds, thereby driving growth for this homebuilder. In this regard, the company is working hard to improve its SG&A expenses via operating leverage and investments in technology. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of home sales, are expected to be between 8.5% and 8.6% for the quarter compared with 8.7% a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.50, reflecting an increase of 11.9% year over year. Meanwhile, the same for revenues is pegged at $3.62 billion, implying a 7.3% increase.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.Lennar has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: Lennar has an Earnings ESP of +1.08%.Zacks Rank: Lennar carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lennar Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other companies in the Zacks Construction sector that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.37% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is slated to report quarterly results on Jan 10, 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.90% and a Zacks Rank #2.

2347,LEN,"Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 10, before market open. As discussed in an earlier article, Lennar has been exhibiting solid top-line performances and the trend is expected to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well, thanks to the strong demand for homes, favorable job market and impressive economic conditions (read more: Will Higher Housing Demand Drive Lennar's Q4 Revenues?).Let’s take a look at how the company's margin is shaping up for this earnings season.Unlike an impressive revenue performance, Lennar and a number of renowned homebuilders have been under pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins. On the one hand labor shortages are leading to higher wages and on the other hand land prices are inflating due to limited availability.Lennar’s gross margin on home sales decreased 90 basis points or bps year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home. This trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter.Even the company expects gross margin in the range of 22-22.25% for the fourth quarter. This reflects a decline of approximately 130-105 bps from the year-ago level of 23.3%. The downside will be largely due to higher input costs as well as less sales conversion due to weather-related issues.Lennar Corporation Gross Margin (TTM)  Lennar Corporation Gross Margin (TTM) | Lennar Corporation QuoteMeanwhile, Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and investments in technology. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of home sales, are expected to be between 8.5% and 8.6% for the quarter, compared with 8.7% a year ago. The company has been working on the SG&A front and was successful in meeting its target of achieving the lowest SG&A percentage in its history in 2016. The trend continued in the first nine months of 2017 too. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, SG&A expenses contracted to 9.5% in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, from 9.7% in the year-ago period due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries.Overall, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is expected to see lower gross margin in the fourth quarter, owing to higher construction costs. Nonetheless, Lennar’s diligent effort to improve its operating efficiency via digital marketing efforts, dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives are expected to offset the headwinds, thereby driving growth for this homebuilder.Lennar’s shares have gained 29% in the last six months, underperforming the 38.3% growth of its industry. That said, earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 have been trending upward, increasing 1.7% in the last seven days. This reflects analysts’ optimism about the stock’s prospect in the near term.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. (CPAC  -  Free Report) and NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Full-year 2018 earnings for Century Communities is likely to rise 66%, while that of Cementos Pacasmayo are expected to increase 41.9%.NVR is expected to witness 16.8% growth in 2018 earnings.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2348,LEN,"Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 10, before market open. Like other major homebuilding companies, Lennar has been reporting solid top-line numbers buoyed by strong demand for homes, favorable job market and impressive economic conditions.Miami-based homebuilder offers a diversified line of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers. Additionally, it regularly upgrades homes to cater to the changing consumer requirements.Lennar’s shares have gained 19.9% in the last three months compared with 24.8% growth of the industry.Let’s see how the company's top line is shaping up for this earnings season.The company’s total revenues increased 15% year over year in the last reported quarter. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, total revenues advanced 17% year over year on the back of a solid 28.3% rise in homebuilding revenues. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s Homebuilding segment revenues (comprising almost 88.5% of total revenues) of $3.2 billion are likely to increase 11.4% sequentially and 6.9% year over year. This is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog.The company’s order trend also remained solid, growing 10.7% in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017. The consensus estimate for new home orders of 6,533 homes reflects 0.8% year-over-year growth. However, new orders are likely to witness 14.2% decline sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter.The company expects deliveries to be in the range of 8,200-8,300 for the final quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with 8,228 in the year-ago quarter and 7,598 in the preceding one.The Financial Services segment is also performing well in tandem with its homebuilding operations and is innovating new products like its recently announced creative student loan program. However, the segment is likely to register significant decline in refinances, lack of resale inventory and the storm impact. The consensus estimate for the segment revenues of $204 million reflects 5.1% sequential decline. However, it is expected to grow 4.1% on a year-over-year basis.In the Rialto Investments segment, the investment and asset management platform continues to grow its asset base. In the Rialto Mortgage Finance or RMF side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable, which has helped it in maintaining its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS (commercial mortgage-backed securities) originators. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for segment revenues are pegged at $81 million compared with $58 million in the prior quarter and $81.5 million in the year-ago quarter.Lastly, Lennar Multifamily platform also continues to grow and the segment is expected to register $103 million in revenues, as per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This represents 11.7% year-over-year growth, while remaining unchanged sequentially.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $3.6 billion, reflecting sequential growth of 11%. Revenues of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company are likely to grow 7.2% year over year.

2349,LEN,"Recovering from the hurricanes, U.S. homebuilders’ confidence gained 4 points from the previous month in October, resulting in a confidence level of 68 — the highest since May 2017. Also, it improved from the year-ago figure of 63.The National Association of Home Builders or NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) includes builder perceptions of current single-family home sales, sales expectations for the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers. A reading above 50 is considered positive. Notably, all three HMI components gained in October.Though builders have recovered from uncertainties created by the hurricanes, labor shortage and higher material costs will continue to pose concerns. Builders need to be wary about the fact that shortage of skilled construction labor is expected to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive material costs higher, causing delays.It is important to note that the index dipped 3 points in September from August but still remained at a confident level of 64 points. Thus, though the homebuilding industry might face some bottlenecks in the short term as is evident from the lackluster home sales data for the July-August period, the overall picture is pretty compelling.Housing got off to a solid start this year and the trend is expected to continue through next year, courtesy of healthy demand, strong economic growth, historically low mortgage rates, escalating rent costs and easy availability of loans.The Zacks Homebuilding Industry has outperformed the broader market (S&P 500) so far this year despite dampeners. The industry has gained 41.1%, compared with the S&P 500 index’s 14.2% increase. Notably, the homebuilding industry ranks among the top 29% of all Zacks industries. Along with a strong past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that companies in this space are likely to benefit from favorable broader factors. Major homebuilders like Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report),Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), to name a few, are well poised on the bullish fundamentals of the housing market. Lennar, D.R. Horton and PulteGroup carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while KB Home and Toll Brothers carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2350,LEN,"We expect Miami-based homebuilder Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 3, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.67%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 11.55%.Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lennar Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Lennar is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components.Zacks ESP: Lennar has an Earnings ESP of +0.68%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lennar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Lennar’s favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to ConsiderIt is important to note that Lennar’s earnings per share in fiscal second quarter decreased 4.2% year over year. Expenses related to Lennar’s acquisition of WCI Communities, Inc. hurt its second-quarter earnings. Again, rising land and construction costs had a negative impact on its gross margin that declined 160 basis points (bps) year over year. Although gross margin improved 40 bps sequentially, the said factors are likely to create some pressure on the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings too. The company expects third-quarter gross margin to be in the range of 21.75-22% against 22.6% in the year-ago quarter.Lennar recently provided views regarding its fiscal third-quarter deliveries and new orders, post hurricanes, Harvey and Irma. The company said that the hurricanes affected its communities in Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina that represent 40% of Lennar’s annual homebuilding revenues. Hence, the natural disaster is expected to cause delay in home deliveries.Lennar said that it had 7,610 new orders and 7,598 deliveries for the third quarter that ended Aug 31. This represents an increase of 8% and 12%, respectively, year over year.Hurricane Harvey impacted about 120 new orders and deliveries during the quarter and is expected to impact about 130 deliveries in the fiscal fourth quarter. Lennar further added that Hurricane Irma could delay about 700 deliveries from the fourth quarter into fiscal 2018.Nonetheless, Lennar remains optimistic about fiscal 2018 and expects that the rebuilding effort will drive higher demand for new homes next year.Lennar is one of the best-positioned homebuilders to capitalize on the housing recovery, courtesy of its diverse revenue mix, steady top-line performance, above-average order growth and improving SG&A leverage. Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and investments in technology. Again, the company’s acquisition of WCI Communities in February is expected to contribute to its top line.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.01, reflecting a decrease of 0.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.23 billion, implying a 13.8% increase.Stocks to ConsiderYou could consider the following construction stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank for their upcoming releases.Thor Industries, Inc. (THO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.56% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is slated to report quarterly results on Sep 27, 2017.Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.29% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to report quarterly results on Oct 30, 2017.Owens Corning (OC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.54%.

2351,LEN,"U.S. housing data continued to tumble in August. Two devastating hurricanes, Harvey and Irma, along with ongoing higher labor and material costs have been hitting the industry hard. Also, inventory shortage has started taking its toll on sales’ pace.August Housing DataExisting home sales declined to a one-year low in August, per the latest report from National Association of Realtors or NAHB. Existing-home sales slipped 1.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million. This marks the fourth decline in five months, bringing the annual rate to the lowest level in 12 months. Purchases in Houston dropped 25% year over year and sales would have been flat excluding Harvey effect.Economists are of the opinion that the diminishing data reflects the inventory shortage prevailing in the U.S. real estate market. This has shot up average home prices nationwide. In fact, median sales price of existing homes rose 5.6% last month from a year earlier. Moreover, total housing inventory declined 6.5% year over year to 1.88 million, marking the 27th consecutive year-over-year decline. That’s just 4.5-month supply. Investors should note that it is more preferable to have about six months of supply for a healthy market.Further adding to the woes, housing starts came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million last month. This is 0.8% down from a revised July estimate of 1.19 million. Nevertheless, August construction starts were 1.4% higher year over year. Single-family starts were even stronger, growing 17.1% from a year earlier.Meanwhile, building permit, another economic indicator used to determine the health of the housing sector, increased sharply by 5.7% from the previous month with 1.3 million authorizations. Last month’s permit was also 8.3% above the August 2016 level of 1.2 million. According to Census Bureau data, the areas in Texas and Florida that were devastated by the storms accounted for about 13% of permits issued in the country last year.Investors should note that housing starts, permits and completions dropped 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.2%, respectively, in July. New U.S. single-family home sales also unexpectedly fell 9.4% in July, the lowest level since December 2016.Dipping Housing Data a Drag on Economic Growth in Q3?Earlier this month, September readings gauging builders' view on sales over the next six months slipped from August. Economists are of the opinion that shortage of skilled construction labor is expected to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive construction costs higher causing delays. The construction sector was already witnessing labor shortage, only to worsen post the hurricanes. Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) and others.That said, homebuilders' overall vision of the housing market remains positive. Strong job market, favorable demographics and low mortgage rates that make buying a home very affordable, should act as tailwinds. These positive factors are weighed down by the simple fact that there are just a few homes actually available to buy.The August housing data may have been weak due to Hurricane Harvey or Irma and the sales pace is expected to remain subdued through 2017 in the Houston area as well as in parts of Florida.Nonetheless, re-building efforts and the lost activity are expected to show up in 2018. As the hurricane-ravaged communities rebuild, activity could pick up, giving way to improving demand later this year and into next.Hence, this mixed report suggests that housing could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2352,LEN,"September is going to end with a focus on housing. KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) will both report and August existing home sales and August new home sales data will be released. Housing data junkies will even get quarterly results from Bed, Bath and Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report) and August construction spending numbers.
"
2353,LEN,"Will the data be able to sustain the post 50 basis point rate cut euphoria? It seems doubtful given that even if the numbers point to a temporary bottom, the number of adjustable rate mortgages resetting will continue to climb. In addition, property taxes in many municipalities have also risen, meaning that even if homeowners are given a break on the severity of the interest rate resets, there will still be many who can't afford their homes. In other words, the housing slump is far from over.
"
2354,LEN,"The major equity indexes are trading back near their 52-week highs. The Dow is literally just two relatively good days from setting a new record high. Whether the market has enough upward momentum to continue rising is difficult to say. Third-quarter profits are expected to be decent, though oil seems to be sticking above $80 per barrel and the dollar is in the toilet. On the other hand, every euro dollar of profit earned is worth about $1.40 when translated back into U.S. currency, something portfolio managers will be keeping in mind when putting some end-of-quarter dressing on their portfolios.

"
2364,LEN,"The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (""the Fed"") will hold a two-day meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The Committee's statement is expected to be released at about 2:15 p.m. (plus or minus five minutes) on Wednesday. The target for the federal funds rate should be left unchanged at 5.25%.
"
2365,LEN,"What could change is the language used in the statement. Core inflation is moving down towards the upper end of the Fed's perceived comfort range, though food and energy prices remain high. Resource utilization is basically unchanged from the last meeting. The adjustment in the housing sector is still ongoing. The economy appears to have picked up steam in the second quarter based on the ISM and Philadelphia Fed surveys. At the same time, a correction in the bond market has occurred, sending yields considerably higher. It seems likely that these two last factors will weigh on the committee's discussions and could cause a change in the statement's language. Obviously, any change in wording will be scrutinized by the financial markets.
"
2366,LEN,"The Fed's June meeting is not the only event on the economic calendar. May home sales data kicks off this week with existing home numbers due out on Monday and new home numbers due out on Tuesday. The Conference Board will publish its June consumer confidence survey on Tuesday. Wednesday features May durable goods orders. The final revision to first-quarter GDP data will be published on Thursday. Friday is packed with May personal spending and income, May construction spending, June Chicago PMI and the final June University of Michigan consumer confidence survey.
"
2367,LEN,"The emphasis on interest rate moves will remain amplified because of a relative lack of catalysts from the equity markets. The end of the fourth quarter could bring some window dressing from portfolio managers, but this should not have a significant impact on the overall weekly returns. The number of estimate revisions has been falling and while some companies could provide updated guidance, nothing more than a nominal increase in the overall number of estimate revisions is expected, at best.
"
2368,LEN,"The earnings calendar won't help much either. Only 45 companies are scheduled to report quarterly results (16 are S&P 500 members). Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) could have some influence on tech stocks, though the current trend in estimate revisions does not suggest either company is going to revise guidance upwards. The housing sector will also get additional focus with KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) reporting.
"
2369,LEN,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of June 25 - June 29Monsanto (MON) recently raised its full-year earnings guidance to between $1.75 and $1.80 per share, an increase of 15 cents per share. As part of this new guidance, the company expects fiscal third-quarter profits to be about $1.00 per share. All of the covering brokerage analysts promptly adjusted their forecasts, resulting in full-year and third-quarter consensus estimates of $1.81 and $1.00 per share, respectively. So, where is the room for the upside? MON has topped expectations during the past two quarters by an average of five cents per share, leading to the possibility that the company was a bit conservative with its guidance. Monsanto is scheduled to report on Thursday, June 28, before the start of trading.

2370,LEN,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of June 25 - June 29
"
2371,LEN,"The fact that earnings estimates have been falling for Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) should not come as a surprise given the housing slump. Fiscal second-quarter profit forecasts are down two cents from a month ago to eight cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bearish at four cents per share. What is notable, however, is that the full-year consensus earnings estimates for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 are declining - a sign that brokerage analysts do not expect optimistic guidance either. LEN has topped expectations once and missed expectations once during the past two quarters. Lennar is scheduled to report on Tuesday, June 26, before the start of trading.
"
2372,LEN,"Concerns about falling chip prices seem to be weighing on the quarterly forecasts for Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report). During the past 30 days, about one-third of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their projections by seven cents. The revisions have resulted in a new fiscal third-quarter consensus estimate of a loss for a loss of 20 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bearish and calls for a loss of 30 cents per share. The semiconductor company has missed twice over the past three quarters. Micron Technology is scheduled to report on Thursday, June 5.

2377,LEN,"After a busy week of new economic data — as well as speeches from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) — last week, this week we look toward September employment metrics. The first of these will come out ahead of the opening bell tomorrow with the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector jobs totals for last month, followed by Friday’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Expectations are for roughly 150-160K new jobs for the month, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4%.However, sometimes an earnings report from a particular company can illustrate the relative health of industries on a more macro-level, and this morning we see results from new home builder Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report). This company has now beaten earnings estimates for the seventh straight quarter, which is impressive. Other reads also point to a solid fiscal Q3 2017 (August), which include improved demand and higher price points along the way.Lennar is based in Miami, FL, which took an indirect hit from Hurricane Irma a month ago. However, we don’t see much negative impact in the company’s Q3 as a result; this will likely become more obvious in the company’s Q4 report (and possibly beyond). For a more extensive look at this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s earnings report, click here.Q3 earnings of $1.06 per share topped expectations by a nickel. Revenues in the quarter rose 15% year over year to $3.26 billion, ahead of the $3.22 billion in the Zacks consensus. A higher number than expected of new homes delivered was cited for the company’s outperformance.Lennar also saw an increase of 20 basis points on home sales gross margin, and financial services rose 12.3% year over year. Part of this came from very impressive multi-family home sales growth, up 26.7% from Q3 2016 to $103.4 million in the quarter. Further, expenses were ratcheted down a tad in Q3, with SG&A costs down 9.2% year over year.So what we see in microcosm here — and it will take reports from Lennar competitors such as D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report) and Beazer Homes (BZH  -  Free Report) in weeks to come to flesh out these narratives — that the new home market is showing signs of growth. They look modest, but the numbers are all pointed in the right direction. And as new homes are bought by families currently in rental units and/or at home with Mom and Dad, this opens up availability for more consumers to enter those rental units. Those in starter homes may more easily upgrade to their “dream homes,” helping accelerate the cycle. This is especially important as the baby boomer generation decides to downsize to smaller homes and assisted living facilities.The pre-market is up again across the board, following a new set of all-time closing highs for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500. Even the more volatile Russell 2000 Small-Cap looks strong. Find out more from Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras’ latest Profit from the Pros: October Off to a Great Start.

2379,LEN,"The Q3 earnings season is underway with major banks set to report this week. Earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 2.3% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues, as per the latest Earnings Trends.However, earnings growth is on track to be the lowest this year after double-digit growth in each of the first two quarters and with high single-digit expected earnings growth in the last quarter. This is especially true as twin attacks by hurricanes Harvey and Irma have taken toll on many industries such as insurance, energy, airlines and autos. Per Moody's Analytics, the two storms may lead to $150-$200 billion in damages (read: Hurricanes Impact on Earnings ETFs?).While earnings estimates for Q3 have declined from 6.3% at the start of the period, the magnitude of negative revision is lower than the recent quarters. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, seven are likely to be contributors to earnings growth, with energy leading the way. Like the last reporting cycle, the energy sector has the strongest growth projection of 122.3% for Q3, primarily reflecting easier comparisons. This is followed by earnings growth of 16.1% for conglomerates, 9.7% for technology, 8.7% for industrial products, and 8.3% for construction.Given this, we have highlighted one ETF and one stock from some of these sectors that could make great plays as the Q3 earnings season unfolds. Each of these ETFs and stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). For stocks, we have added the extra flavor of a positive Earnings ESP. This is because stocks with this combination have a 70% chance of beating estimates when their earnings are released, and a VGM Style Score of B or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.EnergyVanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH  -  Free Report): This fund tracks the MVIS U.S. Listed Oil Services 25 Index, which offers exposure to companies involved in oil services to the upstream oil sector, which include oil equipment, oil services or oil drilling.

2382,LEN,"Benchmarks closed near record highs on Monday following a rally in the financial and healthcare stocks. The Dow, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 index, all hit record highs. Moreover, President Trump’s new tax code has boosted broad based gains for the markets. Such enthusiasm in investors over-shadowed the mass shooting incident at Las Vegas on Sunday evening — described by Trump as an act of “pure evil.” Meanwhile, Fed Presidents Neel Kashkari and Rob Kaplan cautioned the Fed to wait until inflation rate touches the 2% level, before hiking interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,557.60, gaining 0.7%.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq advanced almost 21 points to close in the positive territory.Trump Criticizes the Shooting at Las VegasIn an address to the country from the White House, President Trump detested the mass shooting at Las Vegas on Sunday evening, terming it an “act of pure evil”. Trump also ordered that flags be flown at half-staff and expressed his gratitude to first responders for saving innocent lives.Late on Sunday evening, a gunman later identified as a 64 year old man named Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel on the crowd attending a country-music concert at Mandalay Bay Casino in Las Vegas. This incident has been described as the worst shooting incident in the history of the United States since the terror attacks of September 11, 2001.Gun stocks surged following such an incident.

This overshadowed the effect of the mass shooting incident at Las Vegas.Neel Kashkari Warned Fed not to Hike RatesOn Monday, the Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, cautioned the Fed not to be hasty in raising interest rates. He opined that Fed should wait until inflation reaches the targeted 2% level, before the rates are hiked. Kashkari happens to be one of the voting members of the Fed’s interest rate policy committee and had demurred Fed’s two rate hike this year, citing the same reason.Moreover, in a Q&A at the Fed’s El Paso branch, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan also commented that the Fed should not hurry in raising interest rates and instead wait for the inflation rates to go up.Economic Data Construction Spending surged 0.5% in the month of August, surpassing the consensus estimate of an increase of 0.2% for the period.

2383,LEN,"Miami, FL-based homebuilder Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) provided views regarding its fiscal third-quarter deliveries and new orders, post hurricanes, Harvey and Irma. The company said that the natural disaster is expected to cause delays in home deliveries. Lennar’s shares slipped 0.6% to $50.90 on Sep 14.The company said that the hurricanes affected its communities in Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina that represent 40% of Lennar’s annual homebuilding revenues.The company said it had 7,610 new orders and 7,598 deliveries for the third quarter ended Aug 31. This represents an increase of 8% and 12%, respectively, year over year.Hurricane Harvey impacted about 120 new orders and deliveries during the quarter, and is expected to impact about 130 deliveries in the fiscal fourth quarter. Lennar further added that Hurricane Irma could delay about 700 deliveries from the fourth quarter into fiscal 2018.Lennar CEO Stuart Miller said, ""Although we believe the storm damage to be mild, we are in the early stages of assessment"" and will update investors on Oct 3 during the company's third-quarter call.”Lennar Corporation Price  Lennar Corporation Price | Lennar Corporation QuoteMeanwhile, Atlanta-based homebuilder Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) recently reported that it also expects new home sales and closings to be lower in the quarter ending Sep 30 on a year-over-year basis due to the storm-related impacts.Nonetheless, Lennar remains optimistic for fiscal 2018 and expects that the rebuilding effort will drive higher demand for new homes next year.Lennar is one of the best positioned homebuilders to capitalize on the housing recovery driven by diverse revenue mix, steady top-line performance, above-average order growth and improving SG&A leverage.Lennar’s total revenue grew 18.1% year over year in the first sixth months of fiscal 2017, thanks to the solid homebuilding revenue that increased 15.7%. These were primarily driven by a 14% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 2% rise in the average sales price of homes delivered. Lennar’s core homebuilding results remain consistent with the slow and steady housing recovery.Although two back-to-back hurricanes have delayed Lennar's deliveries, we believe overall positive housing momentum is likely to help the company stay on solid ground in the future. This is reflected in the estimates revision trend.Over the last 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter’s earnings has moved down 20.9%, reflecting seven downward revisions. However, the company’s current year’s as well as next year’s earnings estimates inched up 1.4% and 3%, respectively. Positive earnings estimate revision indicates analysts’ confidence in the stock and add to the optimism to this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the industry are NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) and M/I Homes, Inc. (MHO  -  Free Report). While NVR sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), M/I Homes and Meritage Homes carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVR’s earnings are expected to grow 33.9% in 2017, while that of M/I Homes by 37.1%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2384,LEN,"Homebuilding and construction stocks and ETFs have been in focus in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

2385,LEN,"Sales of previously owned homes increased in October for the second straight month, marking the best performance since June. However, low inventory is limiting the choice of prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated.Shares of prominent homebuilders such as D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), escalated yesterday after the release.October Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales increased 2% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million units from 5.37 million in September. However, sales declined 0.9% from the year-ago level, marking the second consecutive year-over-year decline primarily due to shortage of supply. Moreover, the housing industry is yet to recover from the natural disaster that ravaged parts of Texas and Florida.Meanwhile, October’s median sales price grew 5.5% from the comparable period a year ago to $247,000, marking the 68th straight month of year-over-year gains.Again, inventory continues to slip, leaving less homes for future sales. The supply of existing homes decreased 3.2% from September and 10.4% from the year-ago period. It would take just 3.9 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR. This is also the lowest October reading since the group began tracking the data in 1999.Will the Momentum Continue?The U.S. housing industry is gradually recovering from damages caused by the recent hurricanes in the South. Again, limited land availability is driving prices higher. Apart from concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment. These are restricting homebuilders to respond to the growing demand.Besides, economists are of the opinion that a tax overhaul could add to the volatility in the market in the coming months. The measure would limit the mortgage-interest deduction on newly purchased homes at $500,000. This is quite a dramatic shift from the current cap of $1 million. The proposed capping of the mortgage-interest deduction could be damaging to pricier coastal markets that have been showing some strength in sales activity in recent times.Despite the above-mentioned woes, new residential construction in the United States increased more than expected in October 2017, reinstating strength in the housing industry. Per the latest jointly released report by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, constructions for new homes increased 13.7% in October 2017 to 1.29 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate) from the prior month. This also marks the biggest surge in 12 months as housing starts witnessed big gains in single-family homes and apartments.Again, confidence among homebuilders rose in November to its highest reading in eight months to 70 and second-highest since the recession (July 2005), according to the Housing Market Index by the National Association of Home Builders (""NAHB"") and Wells Fargo.Bottom LineThe latest positive housing data undoubtedly reassures the industry’s strength courtesy of solid economic growth amid supply shortages and the ongoing recovery from hurricanes in Florida and Texas. Consistent job growth along with seemingly high homebuilders’ confidence is adding to the momentum.Moreover, a good industry rank (Top 21% out of more than 256 industries) for homebuilding further supports the growth potential. In fact, in the last three months, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has widely outperformed the broader market (S&P 500), as you can see below:Major homebuilders such as KB Home, NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), TRI Pointe Group, Inc. (TPH  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers Inc. are well poised on the bullish fundamentals of the housing market.While, KB Home, NVR and TRI Pointe sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Toll Brothers carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2388,LEN,"Solid top-line performance and upward estimate revisions make NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) an attractive investment option. The company is engaged in the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings and has a solid business model to support its sales growth.Driven by such positives, analysts are optimistic about the potential of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. The following reasons substantiate the analysts’ support toward this stock.An OutperformerNVR has significantly outperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. While the stock has rallied 60.8%, the industry gained just 25.6% in the same time period. Also, the company has outperformed the broader S&P 500 Index gain of 9.1%.Earnings and Revenue GrowthNVR’s sales and earnings for the current year are expected to increase nearly 10% and 33.9%, respectively.Moreover, NVR has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 14.19%.In addition to the estimated trends, in the first half of 2017, the company reported earnings of $60.36 per share, reflecting 59.6% year-over-year growth. Total revenue (Homebuilding & Mortgage Banking fees) in the same period increased 11% year over year, driven by higher housing revenues and mortgage-banking fees.For all these reasons, and more, the company currently has a Growth Score of ‘A’ on our style score system that helps us to identify potential outperformers.Estimate RevisionsAnnual estimates for NVR have moved north over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. Over this period, estimates have increased 7.3% for 2017. Additionally, for 2018, estimates have moved up 4.9%.Return on Equity (ROE)NVR’s ROE of 37.4%, as compared with the industry average of 10.2%, reflects the company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds.Business ModelMoreover, the company’s robust performance is largely backed by its disciplined business model, focused on maximizing liquidity and minimizing risk. Unlike other homebuilders, NVR’s sole business is selling and building quality homes by typically acquiring finished building lots, without the risk of owning and developing land in a cyclical industry. The cash generated is used to expand its business while excess capital is returned to shareholders through share repurchase programs.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the industry are KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) and Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report).While KB Home sports a Zanks Rank #1, Beazer and Lennar carry a Zanks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.KB Home pulled off a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 12.47%.

2389,LEN,"All eyes are currently on the crucial two-day FOMC meeting slated to start today. The central bank is expected to hold rates steady and lay out plans to unwind its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. It will likely reduce bond holdings by a maximum of $50 billion per month, or $600 billion per year.Both the latest Bloomberg survey and Reuters’ poll reveal that the Fed will unveil the timing of its balance sheet unwinding in September and wait until December to raise interest rates again. As such, rate sensitive ETFs are in vogue (read: Fed to Tighten Policy: Bet on These ETFs).In the latest testimony, Fed Chair Janet Yellen stated that she is not in a rush to raise interest rates and will continue to follow a gradual rate hike plan given the lower inflationary pressure. U.S. consumer price remained flat in June against the expectation of a 0.2% increase, signaling doubts over the third rate hike this year. This represents year-over year growth of 1.6%, the smallest gain since October 2016, after a rise of 1.9% in May.  Per the central bank, interest rates are close to the neutral level – a level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity. The current target for the funds rate is 1-1.25% while inflation is around 1.4%, implying that the real rate is close to zero, according to CNBC (read: Dovish Yellen Testimony to Boost These ETFs).The Fed’s dovish view and dimming prospect of rates hike in the near term has pushed Treasury yields lower, which in turn is benefiting rate-sensitive and high-yield sectors such as utilities and real estates. Additionally, the ongoing turmoil in Washington and growing geopolitical concerns are making investors jittery, raising the appeal for these sectors. This is because these sectors act as a safe haven in times of market turbulence and concurrently offer higher returns due to their outsized yields.As a result, investors could make a near-term play on rate sensitive sectors in the basket form, as these will continue to trade smoothly if interest rates remain steady. Below we have highlighted some ETFs from these sectors that could be excellent plays ahead of the Fed’s decision:iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped ETF (REM  -  Free Report)This is the most popular mortgage REIT ETF with AUM of $1.4 billion and average daily volume of around 304,000 shares. It tracks the FTSE NAREIT All Mortgage Capped Index and holds 33 securities in its basket with large allocations to the top two firms – Annaly Capital (NLY  -  Free Report) and American Capital Agency (AGNC  -  Free Report) – that collectively make up for 26.6% share while other securities hold less than 7.4% share. The fund charges 48 bps a year as fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or ‘Hold’ rating with a Medium risk outlook.Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU  -  Free Report)With AUM of $7.6 billion, this fund provides exposure to a small basket of 30 securities by tracking the Utilities Select Sector Index. It is heavily concentrated on the top four holdings at 32.5% of assets. Electric utilities takes the top spot in terms of sectors at 62.1%, closely followed by multi utilities (33.1%). The product charges 14 bps in annual fees and sees a heavy volume of more than 12.5 million shares on average. XLU has a Zacks ETF Rank of 4 or ‘Sell’ rating with a Medium risk outlook.iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report)This fund provides a pure play to home construction stocks by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index. It holds a basket of 45 stocks with double-digit allocation going to the top two firms – DR Horton (DHI  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report). Other firms hold not more than 9.3% of assets. Homebuilding takes the top spot at 66.1%, followed by 14.9% in building products and 7.9% in home improvement retail. The product has amassed $1.7 billion in its asset base and trades in heavy volume of around 2.8 million shares a day on average. It charges 44 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 or ‘Strong Buy’ rating with a High risk outlook (read: Sector ETFs & Stocks to Tap Q2 Earnings Growth).First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX Fund (FXG  -  Free Report)This ETF provides exposure to 40 consumer staples stocks by following an AlphaDEX methodology and ranks stocks in the space by various growth and value factors, eliminating the bottom ranked 25%. It is moderately concentrated on various components with none holding more than 5.16% share. About 40.4% of the portfolio is allocated to food products followed by food & staples retailing (27.3%), personal products (11%) and beverages (10.9%). The fund has amassed $467.8 million in its asset base while sees good volume of 138,000 shares a day on average. Expense ratio comes in at 0.61%. The product has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 with a Medium risk outlook.Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the highest dividend yielding U.S. securities by tracking the INDXX SuperDividend U.S. Low Volatility Index. It has amassed $415.6 million in its asset base while trades in moderate volume of about 82,000 shares. The ETF charges 45 bps in fees per year from investors. Holding 51 securities in its basket, the product is widely diversified across each component as none of these holds more than 2.82% of assets. Further, utilities and real estate are the top two sectors accounting for 25% and 24%, respectively. The product has a high annual dividend yield of 6.23% and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 with a Medium risk outlook (read: Dividend ETFs Are Hot on Likely Dovish Fed Outlook).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2391,LEN,"Is housing hitting a bottom?
"
2392,LEN,"There's been a lot of talk in recent days that the housing bust may finally be about over. While no one is projecting a robust recovery in the housing market, there is hope that the worst of the slide may be behind us.
"
2393,LEN,"June new home sales rose 11% in May to 384,000 from 346,000, the largest monthly jump in 8 years.  However, it was still well below last year's 488,000 sales. 
"
2394,LEN,"New housing sales appear to be turning a corner. This is the good news. The bad news is that June's number was the lowest monthly sales total since 1982.
"
2395,LEN,"Of course, this upturn is taking place during the time of the year, the summer, when most home buyers are looking to buy (although the numbers are adjusted for seasonality.) The $8,000 first-time buyer tax credit also seems to be boosting sales.
"
2396,LEN,"It's not just new home sales which are perking up. The S&P 500/Case-Shiller home price index reported an increase in May of 0.5%, the first increase in over 2 years. 15 out of 20 of the largest metro areas also saw month over month price increases.Homebuilder Stocks Rise In Anticipation of Sunnier Days
"
2397,LEN,"The homebuilding stocks have been moving higher in July as the data has been better than expected and appears to indicate a turning point in the market.
"
2398,LEN,"The thinking is what better place is there to be invested than the homebuilders when housing starts to come out of the dark days?
"
2399,LEN,"Taking a look at the 6-month charts of some of the major homebuilders you can see the sharp move higher in the past 3 weeks. Ryland Group Inc. (RYL), a homebuilder which specializes in a more entry-level price point: Pulte Homes Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), the largest homebuilder in the United States:D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), the second largest homebuilder in the United States:Ryland Rains on the Parade
"
2400,LEN,"On July 29, Ryland reported second quarter results that implied that some aspects of the housing recovery may still be far off.
"
2401,LEN,"The company reported a much worse than expected loss of $1.70 per share compared to Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 97 cents.
"
2402,LEN,"While this was an improvement over the loss from a year ago, which was $5.70 per share, it was still the fourth straight miss in a row. Each of those earnings misses was massive, averaging a miss of 61.06% during that period.
"
2403,LEN,"Revenue fell 44.2% from a year ago while new orders declined 16.1%. Total closings were down 40.3% year over year.
"
2404,LEN,"If analysts are as optimistic as investors about the sector, they aren't showing it in their earnings estimates. 
"
2405,LEN,"Even before Ryland's disappointing quarterly report, analysts were already lowering estimates over the past 90 days for 2009.
"
2406,LEN,"The full-year Zacks Consensus Estimate had fallen by $1.30 to a loss of $4.24 per share with 1 analyst lowering in the last 30 days.
"
2407,LEN,"You can bet with the larger than expected second-quarter loss, analysts will be revising estimates down even further.Making Bets on the Sector
"
2408,LEN,"Competitors Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) and KB Homes (KBH  -  Free Report) both reported earnings previously and both beat on estimates even while reporting losses, so maybe Ryland is just an anomaly.
"
2409,LEN,"But analysts still appear bearish on KBH Homes whose full-year Zacks Consensus Estimate continued to move lower in the past 30 days even after it beat on June 26. 
"
2410,LEN,"Pulte and DR Horton are scheduled to report on Aug 3 and Aug 4, respectively. Because both companies are among the largest in the sector, investors will get a better gauge on the health of the housing market.
"
2411,LEN,"But once again, the analysts are bearish. Zacks Consensus Estimates have fallen in the past 30 days for the upcoming quarter on both companies. Ignore Estimate Revisions at Your Peril
"
2412,LEN,"With the sharp swing higher in all of these stocks over the past 3 weeks, investors should be cautious.
"
2413,LEN,"Currently, not a single homebuilder mentioned in this article has a Zacks Rank higher than a #3 (hold).
"
2414,LEN,"Eventually, the earnings estimates will be turning to the upside for the homebuilders even as the companies continue to see losses. Right now, however, the estimates are, for the most part, continuing to fall.
"
2415,LEN,"Given the recent hopeful data, the homebuilders seem tempting. But it's too early to say the coast is clear.Additional Investing Resources Available to Research Homebuilding StocksResearch Wizard  - This sophisticated tool will allow you to search for a detailed list of the homebuilders based on Zacks Rank, earnings history and other criteria.Zacks Custom Screener - This is the place to start to create your own screens.
"
2416,LEN,"We'll see another round of early second-quarter results this week. A total of 42 companies are scheduled to report, including 14 S&P 500 members. Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and  Monsanto (MON) will be among the mostly closely-watched reports.
"
2417,LEN,"The Fed will also grab traders' attention. A 2-day meeting is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. No change in interest rates is expected, but traders will be listening for an update on the Fed's debt purchase program. The statement should also allude to signs of improvement in economic conditions.
"
2418,LEN,"On Thursday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will again be in the spotlight. Bernanke will testify before a House committee about Bank of America's (BAC  -  Free Report) acquisition of Merrill Lynch.
"
2419,LEN,"Housing data headlines the economic calendar. The release of new and existing homes sales will be matched with results from KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report).
"
2420,LEN,"Tuesday: May existing home sales
"
2421,LEN,"            Wednesday: May durable goods orders, May new home sales, weekly crude inventories, Fed statement
"
2422,LEN,"            Thursday: Final Q1 GDP, weekly initial jobless claims
"
2423,LEN,"            Friday: May personal income and spending, June revised University of Michigan consumer confidence
"
2424,LEN,"The Treasury Department will auction a record $104 billion worth of bonds. The securities being sold are 2-, 5- and 7-year notes.
"
2425,LEN,"We haven't seen any end-of-quarter window dressing yet, though I still expect it to occur. Many money managers have been sitting on the sidelines - as is evident by the light volume - and are likely underperforming their benchmarks. This could cause them to move into some of the momentum stocks.
"
2426,LEN,"As far as the Fed meeting, I'm not expecting a big reaction, but it's hard to predict. Keep in mind that whatever happens on Wednesday afternoon could be reversed on Thursday.
"
2427,LEN,"Enjoy the summer weather.
"
2428,LEN,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises
"
2429,LEN,"Late last month, CKE Restaurants (CKR) said its operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, would be ""essentially flat"" with prior year levels. Though blended same-store sales were down, 2 of the covering analysts raised their forecasts after the announcement. The revisions pushed the consensus earnings estimate a penny higher to 24 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is even more bullish at 25 cents per share. The fast food chain has topped expectations during 2 out of the last 4 quarters. CKE Restaurants is scheduled to report on Thursday, Jun 25, before the start of trading.
"
2430,LEN,"Micron (MU  -  Free Report) might just turn the tide and surprise to the upside. Though the company has missed expectations by wide margins during the past 3 quarters, fiscal third-quarter forecasts have been trending up recently. The consensus estimate calls for a loss of 43 cents per share, a penny better than a month ago. The most accurate estimate suggests far more upside, projecting a loss of just 36 cents per share. MU is scheduled to report on Thursday, Jun 25, after the close of trading.
"
2431,LEN,"Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) has topped expectations during 8 out of the last 9 quarters. Ahead of the company's fiscal fourth-quarter report, 1 brokerage analyst raised his forecast. Though the revision was not significant enough to move the consensus earnings estimate from 43 cents per share, it did result in a slightly more bullish most accurate estimate of 44 cents. Oracle is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Jun 23, after the close of trading.
"
2432,LEN,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesKB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) has missed expectations during 7 out of the last 9 quarters and earnings estimates are pointing to another disappointment. One analyst lowered his forecast recently, widening the consensus projection to a loss of 67 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish and calls for a loss of 70 cents per share.
"
2433,LEN,"Guidance could also be troublesome as fiscal 2009 estimates have worsened by 16 cents over the last 30 days. The consensus now calls for a full-year loss of $2.50 per share. KB Home is scheduled to report on Friday, Jun 26, before the start of trading.

"
2454,LEN,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises
"
2455,LEN,"Last month, Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) cut its guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2009, which ends in February. Citing ""significant changes in the consumer environment,"" the company warned that same-store sales could be down 1% to 8%.
"
2456,LEN,"Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts cut their projections in response, lowering the fiscal third-quarter consensus estimate by 13 cents to 27 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 25 cents per share. Investors should also note that the electronic retailer's fiscal second-quarter results were 9 cents below expectations. Best Buy is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Dec 16, before the start of trading.
"
2457,LEN,"After nearly a perfect record of topping expectations, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) missed third-quarter estimates by 8 cents. The trend in earnings estimates suggests that the financial firm could disappoint investors again. During the past 30 days, 11 of the 16 covering brokerage analysts have cut their fiscal fourth-quarter estimates. The reductions caused the consensus estimate to plunge to a projected loss of $3.37 per share from a profit forecast of 84 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at a loss of $3.61 per share. Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Dec 16, before the start of trading.
