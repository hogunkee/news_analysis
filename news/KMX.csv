It was a beat for the unit for the first time in over a year, the analyst said.Ahead of its report Wednesday, CarMax's credit unit had generated some caution given the industry-wide increase in loan delinquencies and loss rates in the automotive sector.The unit's result ""should provide some comfort to investors that have feared a sharp spike in losses,"" Ciccarelli said.Shares of CarMax swung wildly Wednesday, before closing 0.8% higher at 59.74 on the stock market today.Ford shares reversed lower to 0.7%, Fiat Chrysler rose 1.3% while GM fell 0.8%.RELATED:Ford, Tesla Eye China Production As No. 1 Auto Market Grows InfluenceThis 'Tsunami' Is Set To Hit Auto Sales, Slamming Sector

23,KMX,"Investors don't seem fazed by the steady stream of reports about falling U.S. auto sales. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) are breaking out Thursday, a day after Ferrari (RACE) cleared a buy point. General Motors (GM) crossed an entry area intraday, with CarMax (KMX) also nearing a buy zone.XTesla (TSLA) dipped 1.85% on the stock market today. Tesla is still up more than 3% this week, but that's after tumbling more than 13% last week following weak Q2 deliveries and questions about Model 3 production. General Motors this month has retaken its title as the most valuable automaker by market cap.Despite the U.S. auto sales slowdown, most major automakers have seen average transaction prices rise this year as consumers' love affair with big-ticket SUVs and trucks continues. That bodes well for automakers' margins, said Efraim Levy, senior equity analyst at CFRA.""The sector has been undervalued for some time,"" he told IBD in a phone call. ""The declines were excessive, and there must be some rotation going on.""Levy also noted that profits for automakers are booming in America — GM topped earnings and revenue estimates in March, following a record year for profits in 2016. Plus, the outlook for global growth, led by China, looks strong. Ford (F) rose 1.1%, but is still near multiyear lows.Auto stocks look attractively priced, Levy added. Among them, he has strong buys on parts supplier Magna (MGA), which is in buy range, as well as Lear (LEA), which is also approaching a buy point.Fiat Chrysler topped an 11.75 buy point in a multiweek first-stage flat base, rising 4.1% to 11.93.New-vehicle sales at Fiat are down 6.7% year over year in 2017 through June, according to Kelley Blue Book.But some of Fiat's brands have a favorable outlook.""Global expansion of the Jeep, Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands richens the product mix and bolsters operating leverage,"" Morningstar senior equity analyst Richard Hilgert wrote May 31.Fiat Chrysler was punished in 2016 as investors fretted about lackluster management and high level of debt.

25,KMX,"A grim warning from Bank of America Merrill Lynch Friday of a ""swift and material downturn"" in U.S. auto sales slammed stocks of General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Lithia Motors (LAD) and their peers across the automotive industry.BofA Merrill Lynch sees auto vehicle sales falling to a 13 million unit annual rate by around 2021 as a ""tsunami"" of off-lease used cars hit prices and raw material costs potentially increase. For May, U.S. auto sales were estimated at an annualized pace of 16.7 million, the fifth straight month of year-over-year declines. Last year, a record 17.6 million autos sold in the U.S.Auto sales have slowed this year as a glut of used cars weighs on pricing; banks tighten lending standards as delinquencies and defaults pick up; and worries grow that current cars could soon be obsolete as new technologies disrupt the automotive industry. And automakers have relied heavily on leases to push the metal out the door, but an increasing number of late-model vehicles are hitting dealers.The bigger concern is that the auto sales downtrend could signal worsening consumer sentiment and spread contagion through the rest of the economy. Spending on cars, other vehicles and auto parts is big part of consumer outlays. The broader auto sector accounts for a huge share of U.S. manufacturing jobs, with a big drop in sales sure to lead to big layoffs by automakers and suppliers.Just last week, Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas cut his sales estimate for this year to 17.3 million from a prior view of 18.3 million. By 2019, he expects annual sales to fall to 15 million — matching the 2013 level — vs. earlier estimates of 19.2 million.On Friday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut small car dealer Lithia Motors to underperform while reducing price targets across the automotive landscape, from manufacturers such Ford Motor, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler to suppliers and retailers such as Delphi Automotive (DLPH), Lear (LEA), Sonic Automotive (SAH), Magna International (MGA), Group 1 Automotive (GPI) and CarMax (KMX).Shares of Lithia cratered 8.7% to close at 88.57 on the stock market today. Group 1 Automotive and Sonic Automotive lost 4.2% and 7.9%, respectively. Used-car dealer CarMax shed 1.4%. Among manufacturers, General Motors fell 0.9%, Ford dipped 0.2% and Fiat Chrysler lost 0.7%. Parts supplier Magna gave up 3.9% and Delphi eased 1%.Tesla (TSLA) lost 1% as the stock takes a breather from its climb to record highs earlier this week. The electric carmaker appears not to have been named among BofA's price-target cuts Friday.U.S. automakers also face sales pressure abroad as China starts to strictly limit new car production.RELATED:GM Triples Self-Driving Test Fleet But Look Who's On Its TailHow China Could Stall Tesla, GM, Ford Growth Plans In No. 1 Auto Market

26,KMX,"General Motors (GM) now expects U.S. vehicle sales in the low 17-million range this year, down from its prior estimate that demand would be about equal to last year's record 17.55 million.X Pricing has become ""very, very competitive,"" GM finance chief Chuck Stevens disclosed in a conference call with analysts Monday.General Motors only edged lower late Monday, along with Ford Motor (F), after both GM and Ford had solid gains in the regular session. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) was not active late after closing up slightly higher. The news doesn't come as a big shock.U.S. sales have declined vs. a year earlier in every month so far, often falling short of expectations.CarMax (KMX) last week topped earnings views, but the used-car superstore said vehicle prices fell 1.9% vs. a year earlier, accelerating from the prior quarter. That's despite CarMax citing a higher sales mix of SUV and pickups, which carry higher price tags.Blame a big increase in off-lease vehicles. Reliance on leases — as well as easier, longer auto loans — pulled forward demand for new cars but the reckoning may be coming due.A week earlier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it sees U.S. sales falling to 13 million by 2021 as a ""tsunami"" of off-lease used cars hit prices. That followed a bearish forecast from Morgan Stanley earlier in June.Concerns about used-car prices have hit rental car agencies Avis (CAR) and Hertz (HTZ), which are seeing the value of their fleets depreciate rapidly. Avis and Hertz surged Monday on news that Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) will partner with them. Alphabet's Waymo will have Avis manage its autonomous vehicle fleet, while Apple will let Hertz handle its small self-driving testing fleet.It's unclear what kind of financial gain Avis and Hertz can expect.Going forward, Apple and Alphabet and autonomous driving pose major challenges for traditional automakers. Apple and Alphabet may team up with established players, but even in that scenario it's unclear who would reap the profits.RELATED:CarMax Earnings Strong But Pricing Trends Offer Warning To GM, FordThis 'Tsunami' Is Set To Hit Auto Sales, Slamming SectorApple, Google Self-Driving Car Deals Boost Rental Car Leaders

36,KMX,"In the years to come, a lot more self-driving cars from Alphabet unit Waymo might be taking themselves to AutoNation (AN) for repairs.Under a multiyear agreement announced Thursday, the automotive retailer said it would offer long-term mechanical and cosmetic maintenance and repair services to Waymo's self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrid cars. AutoNation will serve other cars as Waymo expands its lineup.""While the financial impact of this is likely to be minimal in the near to medium term,"" that analyst, Brian Sponheimer from Gabelli, said in an interview, ""I think the signal that it sends is that there is very much a future for the dealers, and in particular larger dealer groups and other entities that can service large fleets, should the automotive world move to a shared-mobility future.""Shares of AutoNation, which also reported mixed third-quarter results Thursday, shot up 14.75% to 54.62 in the stock market today, blasting out past a 49.50 buy point. Shares hit their best levels since January 2016.IBD'S TAKE: As ride-sharing and autonomous-car technology emerge as new ways to get around, the car culture of years past is fading into history. Here's a look at why. The announcement is the latest acknowledgment that a shared-mobility future appears to be all but inevitable. It comes as dealership groups explore what autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing mean for them, while contending with slimmer sales and margins and more used cars on dealer lots.Google's Waymo reached a deal in June with rental-car giant Avis (CAR) to manage its self-driving fleet. Apple (AAPL) and Hertz (HTZ) forged a similar pact around the same time.Both Waymo and Apple have indicated that they will work on developing autonomous driving systems rather than actual self-driving cars.AutoNation's adjusted earnings per share fell 3% to $1.08, but that beat Zacks estimates for 84 cents. Revenue of $5.432 billion was down 2%, missing expectations for $5.574 billion. Sponheimer attributed the solid earnings to some solid sequential improvement and tighter inventory metrics.The company in 2015 said it would stop selling any vehicle that had been hit with a safety recall, a decision that threatened margins. But it began selling used vehicles that had been affected by recalls last year after the election.Used-car retailer CarMax (KMX) rose 2%.Alphabet rose a few cents. Apple climbed 0.7% ahead of its quarterly earnings after the closing bell. Both tech giants are still in buy range from breakouts last week.RELATED:Apple, Google Self-Driving Car Deals Boost Rental Car LeadersCarMax Jumps To 2-Year High, Past Buy Range, After Q2 Earnings BeatFerrari Raises Earnings, Revenue Views After Tesla's Big Flop

46,KMX,"XThe Nasdaq continued to hold the leadership baton in afternoon trading Wednesday, helped by another solid showing for biotech stocks as well as a couple of strong earnings reports from two high-profile software names.Among biotechs, Celgene (CELG) soared past a 127.74 buy point, rising more than 4% to 131.86. But after seven gains in the past eight sessions, the daily chart has a straight-up-off-the-bottom look to it, making Celgene's latest base a bit lopsided.The Nasdaq added 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 showed modest losses. Volume on both exchanges was tracking close to Tuesday's levels.West Texas Intermediate crude oil for July lost nearly 3% to $42.31 a barrel after U.S. government data showed a second straight weekly decline for crude inventories, along with a rise in domestic production.Wall Street cheered earnings reports from two well-run software names that have transitioned successfully to the cloud. Red Hat (RHT) soared 10% after reporting a 12% rise in quarterly profit and 19% increase in sales to $676.8 million. It's extended in price at this point, meaning it's too late to buy. Shares of Adobe Systems (ADBE) jumped 2% as adjusted earnings rose 44% to $1.02 share. Sales grew 27% to $1.77 billion.Another software name working toward a cloud-based model is Oracle (ORCL), which reports today after the close. Shares rose 1% to 46.26 ahead of the results as it works on a flat base with a 47.09 buy point.Elsewhere, RV-maker Winnebago Industries (WGO) broke out of a downtrend with conviction, rising 11%, after reporting better-than-expected earnings and its fourth straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Aggressive investors got an early entry into Winnebago on Wednesday even though the stock is still 17% off its high.CarMax (KMX), which operates used-car superstores in the U.S., reversed in spectacular fashion. Shares edged higher after rising 8% intraday. Headed into the report, CarMax was working on a cup-with-handle base with a 65.90 buy point, but it was a flawed pattern because of recent uncertain action around the 50-day moving average. Handle areas should always form comfortably above the 50-day line.In economic news, existing home sales for May came in slightly better than expected, but homebuilders didn't move much on the news. iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB), an exchange-traded fund, was mostly unchanged around 34. The ETF is getting support at the 50-day moving average after a breakout in January over a 29.36 buy point.RELATED:CarMax Beats Q1 Estimates But Drop In Prices May Hit GM, FordBoeing, Adobe, Red Hat Price Targets Hiked; Chevron DowngradedBiotech Stocks To Watch And Pharma Industry News

47,KMX,"XStocks opened higher and clung to narrow gains early Wednesday, as a string of positive earnings reports boosted early trade.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each fought to hold gains of less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq jumped 0.3%,with CA (CA), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Broadcom (AVGO) leading the Nasdaq 100.Intel (INTC) staked out the weak spot among Dow stocks, down 1.6% after Bank of America downgraded the stock to neutral, from buy. Nike (NKE) jumped 1.1%, the best early move among Dow industrials,Intel may also have felt some pressure from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which surged 8% after introducing a new line of high-power, low-cost processors aimed squarely at Intel's markets. The gain hoisted AMD shares 38% above an early May low, and well up the right side of a three-month cup base.FedEx (FDX) dipped 1% after reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Tuesday.Red Hat (RHT) spiked 9% as Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to buy, from hold, following strong first-quarter results reported late Tuesday. A 12% earnings gain and a 19% rise in revenue neatly cleared analysts' targets, and management's second-quarter revenue and earnings forecasts were also above expectations. The move sent the open-source software innovator to new highs in heavy trade, after clearing a long, sloppy consolidation in February.CA, the former Computer Associates, spiked 15% on news reports that privately held BMC Software was exploring financing options to acquire the provider of information technology management software. CA has market capitalization of roughly $13 billion. The gap up move sent shares above a 35.09 buy point in a six-month cup base.Adobe Systems jumped 3% in early trade, after reporting better-than-expected 44% gains in earnings and a 27% rise in revenue. The company also guided third-quarter sales and earnings to above consensus views. Adobe shares spiked to a new high, leaving them extended above a rebound from support at the stock's 10-week moving average.Winnebago (WGO) rolled up a 4% gain at the open, as a 75% surge in revenue and a 134% leap in gross profit apparently outweighed a miss on its earnings per share line for its fiscal third quarter. The strong-volume gain was enough to pierce resistance at the stock's 10-week line, starting it up the right side of a six-month correction.CarMax (KMX) vaulted 5% higher on better-than-forecast first-quarter results. The company said delays in federal income tax refunds shifted some sales from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, helping results.  The stock has climbed 35% in the past 12 months, climbing from a February 2016 low.Overseas, in Asia, markets dropped hard in Tokyo and Hong Kong with benchmark indexes down 0.5% on each exchange. In Shanghai, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5% after index provider MSCI voted to include 222 China-listed big cap A-share stocks in its emerging markets benchmark index.A shares are denominated in Chinese currency and were, until recently, restricted only to domestic investors.  Deutsche Banks X-Trackers Harvest CSI China A-Shares Fund (ASHR) rose 0.1% in premarket trade. Morgan Stanley's China A-Shares Fund (CAF) dipped 0.3%.Markets in Europe were under pressure, but off earlier lows in afternoon trade, with London's FTSE 100 down 0.4%, Frankfurt's DAX off 0.3% and the CAC-40 in Paris sliding 0.5%.The U.S. dollar flattened into narrowly mixed trade. Gold gained 0.5% to near $1,245 an ounce. Bonds inched higher, trimming the 10-year yield by one basis point to 2.15%.In oil prices, U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude reversed early losses to rise 0.2% to just below $44 a barrel as investors waited on the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventories report, due out at 10 a.m. ET.Existing home sales numbers for May are due out from the National Association of Realtors at 10 a.m. ET.RELATED:This Tech Stock Nears A Breakout On Speculation Of Amazon BuyoutBiotech Breakouts: Biogen Spinoff Bioverativ In Buy Zone

49,KMX,"XTesla (TSLA) pegged a fresh high Thursday even as a broad swathe of auto-related companies tumbled after a prominent auto analyst slashed his outlook for U.S. auto sales for the next four years.Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas cut his sales estimate for this year to 17.3 million from a prior view of 18.3 million. By 2019, he expects annual sales to fall to 15 million — matching the 2013 level — vs. earlier estimates of 19.2 million.""A stretched auto consumer, falling used prices, and technological obsolescence of current cars are ingredients for an unprecedented buyer's strike,"" he said in his Thursday research note.Jonas warned that used car prices could fall between 25% and 50% over the next four years, potentially hurting sales of new cars, while an industrywide shift toward electrified vehicles and self-driving technology will push used cars toward obsolescence starting in 2019.He cut his price targets on 15 companies, with automaker Ford Motor (F), auto supplier Adient (ADNT) and auto dealer Group 1 Automotive (GPI) earning steep cuts of 10% or more. Lear (LEA), a parts supplier for automotive OEMs, was downgraded to sell.But shares of top U.S. automakers pared or reversed losses. Ford closed up 0.3% on the stock market today, General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) lost 0.7%. Meanwhile, Tesla charged up 2.9% to a new high of 370.00 amid analyst upgrades as the Model 3 launch nears. Honda Motor (HMC) and Toyota (TM), however, finished near intraday lows, down 0.4% and 1.6%, respectively.Other stocks in the auto sector suffered worse losses. Lear dropped 3.9%, and Group 1 tanked 6.5%, leading a sell-off in auto retailers. Asbury Automotive (ABG) lost 4.3%, Sonic Automotive (SAH) 3.4%, Lithia Motors (LAD) 2.5%, Carmax (KMX) 2.7% and Penske Automotive (PAG) 1.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla sports an IBD Composite Rating of 90 out of a possible 99, based on fundamental and technical metrics. The relative strength line has reached new high ground, a bullish sign.U.S. automakers have been rocked this year by slumping demand after seven years of hot sales growth. A report last week put May auto sales at 16.7 million on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, virtually flat vs. the prior month and down almost 5% from record sales of 17.55 million in 2016.Honda has previously said it will sell vehicles capable of automated driving on freeways by 2020.RELATED:These 5 Auto Stocks Retake Key Support Line On U.S. Sales DataTesla Gets Price-Target Hike Despite Warning About Profits

51,KMX,"Used car retailer CarMax (KMX) reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped analyst estimates, but shares seesawed after the market open.The company also said that it continued to experience difficulties related to its subprime business, and the average price of used vehicles fell 1.6% during the quarter.CarMax's results come as concerns grow about stalling vehicle sales and an uptick in car-loan delinquencies and defaults. Used-car prices also have fallen as more leased vehicles get brought back to dealers, leaving them with more unoccupied automobiles.Ford (F) last month offered first-quarter profit guidance that was well below analysts' outlook, and said sinking used-car prices could hurt the industry more broadly.CarMax gained 2.4% to close at 58 on the stock market today. Ford ticked up 0.1% to 11.27. General Motors (GM) added 0.5% to 34.16.CarMax's earnings per share rose 14.1% to 81 cents, beating views for 79 cents. Sales increased 9.3% to $4.05 billion, above forecasts for $3.933 billion. Used-car sales rose 13.4%. Same-store sales rose 8.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Even as incentives rise and lending standards remain easy, U.S. auto sales fell last month to a two-year low. The company said it ""continued to experience a headwind"" related to its third-party ""Tier 3,"" or subprime, sales. That sales mix fell to 9.4% of used car sales, from 14.5% a year ago. Tier 3 sales, the company said, represented sales financed by third-party providers that CarMax pays a fee.CarMax said that ""credit tightening"" by those providers this year, fewer credit applications from lower-credit-quality borrowers and a delay in tax refund payments all contributed to the lower sales mix, the company said.RELATED:CarMax Misses On Sales, But Relies Less On Subprime DealsGeneral Motors Dives On Margins, Trump 'Uncertainty'; Tesla Tests Buy Point

Monro Muffler (MNRO) hit a November 2014 low.CarMax (KMX) slid 4%, piercing its 200-day moving average in heavy volume. An article in Barron's said rising defaults and delinquencies could hurt the car dealer's financing business, which accounts for 40% of operating income.

55,KMX,"A blowout private-payroll report from ADP and rebounding oil prices initially helped put the major U.S. stock indexes on pace for weekly gains. A strong start from the tech sector, led by Tesla (TSLA), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and its suppliers also helped send the Nasdaq to fresh record highs.But that all changed with the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting, as policymakers signaled a surprise tilt toward more monetary tightening. Signs of disarray in Washington, D.C., on the effort to overhaul taxes also weighed on markets. Official U.S. jobs data showing conflicting signals Friday failed to bolster the market, nor did a strong IPO from tech company Okta. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about flat  for the week, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq was off 0.6%.The Labor Department's March payroll report showed a gain of just 98,000 jobs, barely over half of what analysts expected, and January's and February's gains were revised lower. But the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5% as a separate survey found a robust jump in employment. Much of the weakness in payrolls was blamed on unseasonable weather. Underlying trends could be stronger. ADP's private-sector hiring report earlier in the week put March's jobs gain at 263,000. The overall direction of jobs, wages and inflation is seen putting pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy.RELATED:Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 14-15 meeting released Wednesday afternoon revealed that policymakers are ready to start shrinking the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.The move, which amounts to a tightening of monetary policy, would begin to reverse the accommodation from the Fed's unconventional asset-buying programs launched in late 2008 to combat the financial crisis.The revelation helped turn a solid stock market advance into a small loss. Some analysts suggested that the Fed's policy signal could mean an unexpected rate hike in September, following a widely expected one in June. That would allow the Fed to start reducing the size of its balance sheet in December by no longer reinvesting all of the principal returned when its bond holdings mature.Separately, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond regional Fed bank, abruptly resigned after admitting that he violated the Fed's confidentiality rules in 2012 by speaking with a financial analyst about policy deliberations.RELATED:Okta (OKTA) raised $187 million late Thursday, pricing 11 million shares at 17, the high end of its estimated range. The stock climbed 38% over its IPO price to close at 23.51 on the Nasdaq Friday. That price values the company at over $2 billion. Okta's Identity Cloud platform provides identity management services for businesses. The San Francisco-based company is the fourth new company worth more than $1 billion to come public this year, following the successful IPOs of MuleSoft (MULE) Presidio (PSDO) and Snap (SNAP).RELATED:Tesla stock soared to a record high, following its Sunday report on car deliveries that beat expectations. Tesla now has a higher market valuation than Ford (F), which sold off Monday on weak U.S. auto sales for March. CEO Elon Musk mocked Tesla short sellers in a Monday tweet. Tesla delivered just over 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter, above its target of 23,000-24,500 vehicles and above Wall Street estimates for about 24,200.RELATED:Panera Bread (PNRA) agreed to be bought by Luxembourg's JAB for $7.5 billion including debt, or $315 per share. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. JAB also owns Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Keurig Green Mountain and Peet's Coffee & Tea. It's the fourth major restaurant acquisition this year following Restaurant Brands' (QSR) purchase of Popeyes, Golden Gate Capital's buyout of Bob Evans Farms and Darden Restaurants (DRI) buying Cheddars. Other transactions could be on the horizon given analysts' forecasts for restaurant traffic to remain under pressure this year as consumers opt to save money and eat at home.RELATED:Google continued introducing remedies to quash an advertising crisis at YouTube that derailed a rally in parent Alphabet's (GOOGL) stock in mid-March. Google introduced a new system that lets outside firms verify ad quality standards on its video service. The advertising uproar began in Europe when major brands complained about ad placement next to videos that promoted hate, violence and racism. Analysts say some advertisers that have suspended ads on YouTube are seeking concessions from Google, aside from resolving the ad placement issue. YouTube, meanwhile, launched a $35 monthly TV streaming service in five U.S. markets — New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia.Meanwhile, Amazon's video business rolled ahead. It won rights to stream 10 National Football League games this fall — taking the ball from Twitter (TWTR), which held the same rights last year. Amazon is paying a big price for the privilege.

It means Merck still has some work to do to get approval for including cardiovascular outcomes data on the labels for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR. Merck said it is exploring its options. The stock lost ground early Friday but recouped most of the losses, closing down 0.2%.U.S. airstrikes on Syria lit up defense stocks Friday.

64,KMX,"Think you've got the post-election stock-market winners' sorted out? Well, have you considered consumer discretionary or companies likely to gain an edge as new tax rules are applied? Award-winner Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) sees stocks like CarMax (KMX), Charles Schwab (SCHW), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) doing well as a Trump administration ushers in corporate tax cuts and interest-rate hikes.Schwab and Fox also stand to benefit from demographic trends and the rising prospects of media-content winners.And despite issues weighing on Alphabet, Macauley expects the internet giant to nearly double earnings in the next five years.The $2.4 billion Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) is a Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner. To learn more about its managers' visions of likely stock-market leaders in the months and years ahead, IBD turned to Brian Macauley, one of the fund's three managers. Macauley, who is 42 years old, shared insights on those and other stocks he thinks will do well as corporate America adapts to life under new political leadership. He spoke from his office in Arlington, Va.IBD: Your fund's low turnover rate makes it look static. But the fund is flexible in other ways. Is that its real secret sauce?Macauley: Right, we don't manage to a style box or by market-capitalization size.This is a go-anywhere portfolio with an emphasis on finding long-term compounders — businesses with the competitive position, growth, and management to create outsized value over an extended period of time. We most often find business with these characteristics in the mid cap space, but sometimes small- or large-cap companies will fit our model.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders We try to build a portfolio with attractive expected returns and low risk of loss. We do not want artificial capitalization limitations or style boxes to constrain us.IBD: You recently told me your usual turnover rate is slightly higher. Why is that?Macauley: On average our turnover is about 15%. This past year is one of the lower years. The reason is that in general we've not had a lot of market volatility, so we haven't seen a lot of mispricing to take advantage of.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceIBD: Whether 4% or 15%, this fund differs from its Hennessy stablemates, which rebalance just once a year, right?Macauley: We buy and sell when it is appropriate in the marketplace. We have a very different approach from our stablemates.IBD: Your turnover rate is a fraction of the 66% pace for U.S diversified stock mutual funds on average, according to Morningstar Inc.Macauley: Right.IBD: Tell me more about the traits you seek in stocks.Macauley: We're looking for businesses with a wide competitive moat, durable competitive advantages that can earn outsized returns on capital even if competitors come into their market. We look for businesses that have a different mousetrap that can gain a lot of market share over time, or that have a secular tailwind that benefits them or their whole industry.We look for high quality management that thinks and acts like long-term owners. We look for a low risk of catastrophic outcome. We try to stay away from situations where there's rapidly changing technology or a fad or a fashion risk.And we try to meld growth with valuation. We will pay for quality, but we want to make sure we get in at a discount. Warren Buffett says that a lot of accounting vagaries obscure the true economics of a business. We try to look through vagaries and understand a business's true economics.IBD: I know this is unlikely, but has the fund done anything to take advantage of the Trump election?Macauley: We don't make directional bets based on individual economic influences. We had a number of REITs and yield-sensitive positions do poorly (amid election results), but those have been offset by strength in our more consumer discretionary and yield beneficiary names.Names that benefited were CarMax, Charles Schwab and Encore Capital Group (ECPG).CarMax is the largest used-car retailer in the U.S. It has a differentiated consumer proposition — it is a no-haggle-on-price dealer. And it offers a wide selection of late-model used cars, making them easy to use to purchase a car.IBD'S TAKE: To get a handle on whether no-haggle pricing helps car-sellers like CarMax, read this IBD report.They've grown to 170 stores and should be able to about double their store base as they march across the U.S. in the next 10 to 12 years.They get two benefits from the Trump election. One, if there are tax cuts, then consumers will have more discretionary dollars in their pockets. Second, they are a purely U.S. company that pays a high tax rate. To any extent that corporate tax rates change, they could see a cut.Schwab is a broker and custodian of investor assets, serving individuals, wealth planners and registered investment advisors. They benefit from brokers leaving wirehouses like (Bank of America (BAC)-owned) Merrill Lynch and becoming fee-only advisors. Schwab provides the enabling technology for advisors to do that. Also, as baby boomers retire and roll their 401(k) balances into IRAs and look for financial advice, Schwab is a solution for them.And Schwab holds a lot of cash from clients. They can lend that out and buy securities with it. As rates rise, they earn more from that.IBD'S TAKE: Schwab is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank/Bankers industry group due to key growth metrics. It has a top-notch IBD Composite Rating. Consulting IBD's Stock Checkup is a quick way to get a handle on the traits of a stock like this.Encore Capital Group purchases charged-off credit-card receivables. Encore is a specialist in trying to get people to pay what they owe on those credit-card debts. Regulatory burden has compressed this industry to essentially two competitors that control 90% of the industry. It's difficult for new players to come back in. And it takes a large operation to collect debt efficiently.A softer regulatory environment should allow the supply of debt to come to market more quickly.IBD: Does Alphabet's recent softness reflect investors' fear that a Trump presidency will bring trade wars and an economic slump?Macauley: Our thesis is that between growth in online advertising and improved monetization of mobile search and growth at YouTube, that Google (Alphabet) should nearly double their earnings over the next five years. From the current valuation, that's a reasonable opportunity given the high quality business we believe Google is.Their competitive moat is not technology so much as it is users' habits. So there's a low risk of Google being leapfrogged.The election has done three things: One, it has caused scrutiny of low corporate tax rates. We think Google's taxes are not so low, but there still could be some increased tax burden. Second, if there is a trade war, Google and other large technology companies are high-profile places that other countries can retaliate against. Finally, there is the obtuse risk that these technology companies were biased in their presentations of (political) information during the campaign. They may receive more scrutiny from the new administration because of that.IBD: What's driving accelerating earnings per share growth at American Woodmark (AMWD), a kitchen cabinet maker?Macauley: About half of their business is driven by new home construction, which is still climbing out of a depression. We have a long way to go to get to long-term historical norms, so that cyclical uplift is a tailwind.Another thing: during this housing recession they had net cash that they used to improve their service levels and gain market share.After partnering with Home Depot (HD), then Lowe's (LOW), then large home builders in the 1980s, in the last few years they finally had the bandwidth to service the small kitchen-bath market.And they've culled out a lot of lower margin customers in the last few years, filling their capacity with higher-profit customers. So they will have much higher operating margins going forward.And they benefit from the election. Some of their competitors import products. Woodmark pays a full tax rate, so if corporate taxes go down they benefit. And if people have more discretionary income due to tax cuts, they're more likely to buy a home or remodel.IBD: Marlin Business Services (MRLN), which provides leasing for small-ticket equipment leasing, has trended higher in recent weeks. Any election cause and effect?Macauley: They are simply very good at underwriting those leases. They work with people leasing copying machines, equipment for dentists' offices, restaurant equipment. Because of the regulatory environment, regular banks have pulled back from this space. Even where banks compete, it can take weeks to get a loan from banks, but just hours from Marlin. And Marlin is working to bring this to other (business areas). That provides a good forward outlook.IBD: Why do you like 21st Century Fox among media companies?Macauley: The media world is separating into winners and losers, and 21st Century Fox will be a winner. They have must-have content. And they are included in all important over-the-top solutions like Hulu, Google Unplugged, Dish Network (DISH).IBD: Does ""over-the-top"" mean independent from a cable provider?Macauley: Yes. All you need is an internet solution. It's a more efficient means of distribution. People who want to cut the cord with their cable provider are likely to end up with a noncable solution that includes Fox content. And over-the-top is attractive to advertisers because ads can be targeted and lower advertisers' cost per thousand of reaching viewers.In addition, Fox owns 30% of Hulu, which we think will be successful.IBD: Insurance seems staid. What's the appeal of Aon (AON)?Macauley: This is a company that should be relatively a-cyclical, with a low teens growth profile.They are one of only three providers with a global insurance footprint, so there aren't many other places you can go for global coverage. And with their size, they collect a tremendous amount of data. They create information solutions that are valuable to clients and insurance companies, which enables them to grow market share. And they are available at a fairly attractive price — about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: American Tower (AMT) pulled back after the election. Do you still like it?Macauley: The stock has come under pressure as almost all REITs have because interest rates have risen and there's some expectation they might continue to rise, which would make (some) REITs worth less.In addition, there's concern that the new administration would be more amenable to a merger between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS). Obama was strongly against the merger. If two large tenants merge, it would reduce revenue growth at American Tower for some period.Despite the risk, with its growth profile this is one of our four best ideas, which is why on one of our largest positions we (recently) could buy it cheaper than it was just days earlier.IBD: Why has O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) rallied in recent weeks?Macauley: O'Reilly is the best in their industry at getting parts to customers quickly. They've set up a distribution network that's more robust than anyone else's. And in this business, especially on the commercial side, a mechanic needs same-day parts so he can fix a car and return it to a customer in the afternoon. O'Reilly is in the best position to do that.They have 4,500 stores today. They'll have 6,500 or 7,000 stores in the U.S. over the next 10 years.They pay a full tax rate, so any tax cut should benefit them. As for possible new tariffs, they do import parts from Asia, but all of their competitors do as well. And any increase in tariffs will be passed on to their end customers.IBD: Mistras Group (MG) gapped down 13% on Oct. 7, a day after reporting a 4% decline in first-quarter EPS growth and a downward revision for the fiscal year. It has rallied since then. Do you still like the stock?Macauley: If you run an oil refinery, let's say, you deal with a very corrosive product. Mistras inspects plants to make sure it does not blow up. They are the leader in nondestructive testing for oil and gas and other infrastructure assets, like aerospace and bridges.Our thesis is that they can hold their market position and improve margins by applying some better-business practices being brought to them by the CFO they hired a few years ago. The business will be valuable to a private equity or strategic buyers. We think somebody else will own it after (current management) fixes the operations.IBD: Since you don't trade a lot, how do you spend your days?Macauley: We spend time monitoring businesses we own and industry developments. We have a watch list of 75 companies that represent our next-best ideas, and we always try to stay on top of that. It's a continual process of looking for ideas that are superior to what we already own.IBD: How do you and your co-managers divide portfolio responsibilities? Is each of you responsible for certain sectors, for example?Macauley: We're all equally responsible for names in the portfolio. Our voting on trades is one-third, one-third, one-third, majority rules. Day to day, we have a primary analyst in charge of each name. I'm the primary on CarMax, for example. My partners know my primary businesses well, but not in quite as much detail as I do.IBD: Financials are the fund's largest sector, with a 29% weighting as of Sept. 30. Why is that?Macauley: There is an important distinction for us. We're really invested in specialty companies. We do not tend to own traditional depository banks or commodity financials. Markel (MKL) is our largest. It's a specialty insurer. It's also our oldest holding. The records don't still exist, but I believe it's been in the fund since the fund opened in 1997.Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) (the fund owns A shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange) is an alternative asset manager. It invests in assets other than stocks and bonds. It owns office buildings, toll roads, retail real estate, hydroelectric plants, electrical transmission lines. They are infrastructure related assets.IBD: You had a 15% cash weighting as of Sept. 30, well above the industry average. Is that much cash normal?Macauley: We've averaged about 8% over the past seven years. We've had a lot of inflows. We're patient about deploying new capital.IBD: How long does it normally take you to build a full position in a stock?Macauley: Every situation is different. It may take two weeks on average.As a winner in the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards, it outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.

United Technologies led with a premarket gain of nearly 2%. The index's losses narrowed to less than 0.5%.Homebuilder Lennar muscled up more than 2% after its second-quarter earnings, and revenue topped consensus expectations by comfortable margins. Smaller peer KB Home (KBH) is scheduled to report earnings after today's close. Lennar's chart could be read as a long cup base with a 56.14 buy point. But a 32% climb between February and April set the stage for a shorter, shallow base, which offers possible buy points at 48.02 and 49.06.CarMax tumbled 3.5% at the open on a first-quarter report that stopped just shy of consensus projections.United Continental popped 5%. Management revised the airline's second-quarter passenger revenue guidance lower and announced a restructuring aimed at generating $3.1 billion in revenue and efficiency gains by 2018.American Science & Engineering (ASEI) spiked 14% on news that OSI Systems (OSIS) would acquire the maker of X-ray inspection systems in a deal valued at about $269 million.

74,KMX,"Automakers were among the worst-performing groups in the stock market today, reflecting global growth concerns, Brexit uncertainty and more trouble for diesel-powered cars. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and European automakers led the sell-off, while Tesla Motors (TSLA) managed to limit its losses. General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) sold off 2.5% Tuesday, even as crude prices tumbled nearly 5%. But oil is off on concerns that the global economy is slowing. That's hardly good news for General Motors, Ford and other automakers, especially after U.S. industrywide sales for June fell more than expected.But it was European automakers that suffered the most. Fiat Chrysler fell 9% to pennies above its lowest level set just after the U.S.-European entity returned to U.S. markets in late 2014. Volkswagen (VLKAY), Daimler (DDAIF) and BMW (BMWYY) skidded roughly 5%.U.K. and European auto sales may weaken as Britain's decision to leave the European Union hits economic growth. Meanwhile, London's new mayor said he'll crack down on the most-polluting cars. That's bad news for diesel-fueled vehicles -- championed by Volkswagen, Daimler and other European automakers -- that produce high levels of smog-creating emissions. Finally, European regulators are poised to impose price-fixing fines on heavy truck makers, including Daimler and Volvo, Bloomberg reported. Also, BMW, Daimler and VW offices were raided as part of a European steel price-fixing probe.Relative to most U.S. and European auto stocks, Tesla Motors was a winner, losing just 1.2% to 213.98, nearly at session highs after falling as low as 208. That's despite Tesla reporting weaker-than-expected Q2 deliveries and production, as well as cutting its full-year delivery forecasts.Update: Tesla shares fell about 1% in late trading, near 212, following a Detroit Free Press report that a Model X crashed and rolled over while in Autopilot mode. That followed last week's news that regulators are investigating after a fatal Model S ""Autopilot"" crash.U.S. auto dealers were also big losers, with CarMax (KMX) down 3.8% and AutoNation (AN) 4.4%, with smaller rivals suffering bigger losses.Many automakers' earnings have been stronger in recent quarters. But forecasts that sales will level off or decline have weighed on the stocks for several months. Almost every auto stock is in a long downtrend, making them ill-suited investments right now.

75,KMX,"AutoNation (AN) continues to see sales in the auto industry at a plateau, with high retail inventories, despite a 14% increase in manufacturer incentives.CEO Mike Jackson still sees 2016 sales topping 17 million light vehicles. Last year, sales grew 5.7% to 17.5 million.Despite flat sales, General Motors (GM) crushed Q1 forecasts Thursday, fueled by strong results in the U.S and China and an improved performance in Europe. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) is slated to report Tuesday, with Ford (F) results due out Thursday.AutoNation said it earned 90 cents a share in Q1, a 7% year-over-year decline. The largest U.S. car dealership chain recorded a 6-cent-per-share negative impact from hail-related expenses and a shift in stock option grants. Analysts had expected 93 cents a share.Revenue grew 3.5% to $5.12 billion during the quarter vs. consensus views for $5.29 billion. That follows sales of $5.34 billion in Q4, $5.35 billion in Q3 and $5.22 billion in Q2.In February, AutoNation completed the acquisition of 12 stores from Allen Samuels Auto Group.Domestically, segment income dipped 2%, while imports edged up 1%. Premium luxury segment income tumbled 12%.Shares closed up 3% in the stock market today, after falling as much as 5.3% earlier. GM shares eased 1.5%, Fiat Chrysler lost 2.2%, and Ford dipped 0.3%.Among other top dealership operators, Lithia Motors (LAD) shares rallied 3.8%, and Carmax (KMX) shares rose 1.5%.
"
76,KMX,"CarMax's (KMX) fourth-quarter sales and profit topped estimates compared to the same quarter a year earlier, as the number of cars sold and comparable-store sales each rose 4%. However, investors apparently were hoping for faster growth, and shares fell hard early Thursday.CarMax has struggled in recent quarters amid rising incentive costs and some leveling off from surging sales after the Great Recession. So have other national auto retail chains, such as AutoNation (AN), Asbury Automotive Group (ABG), Lithia Motors (LAD) and Penske Automotive Group (PAG). The group has a dismal 195 IBD group ranking, nearly last on IBD's 197 industries list.CarMax CEO Tom Folliard wrote in a statement: ""While we faced a somewhat more challenging sales environment in the second half of the year, we delivered solid revenue and EPS growth in both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year.""CarMax's net earnings fell 1.5% to $141 million in Q4, and earnings per share minus one-time items climbed 10.4% to 74 as sales increased 5.3% to $3.7 billion. Wall Street was expecting 71 cents EPS on $3.68 billion revenue. Average selling price per car in its flagship used car group rose 2.4% to $19,758.However, the company's ""Other"" category revenue slid 8.5% in the quarter, ""primarily reflecting our disposal of new car franchises earlier in the fiscal year."" Still, CarMax estimated its share of the 0-to-10 year-old used car market rose by about 1% last year, and it plans to open 13 to 16 new stores a year for the next two years.CarMax shares fell 7% in the stock market today. The auto dealer's stock price had risen about 29% prior to its Q4 earnings from a 41.25 low on Feb. 3. It was still trading above its 10-week average but dropped further below its 200-day line. AutoNation fell 2%, Asbury slid 4%, Lithia Motors lost 3.75% and Penske Automotive slid 3.9%.

Oil and gas stocks lagged too, as West Texas intermediate crude prices slipped 2.5% to below $37 a barrel.J.C. Penney (JCP), down 5% in busy trade, led department-store stocks lower. The stock triggered a sell signal as it gave up a double-digit gain from a 10.19 cup-base buy point. Shares are still up 51% this year.On the IBD 50, Michael Kors (KORS) fell 4% and was seeking support at its 50-day moving average. Volume was running about 15% lower than usual.Tesla Motors (TSLA) reversed from an early gain to a 2% loss, on track to halt a five-session win streak. Shares have rallied more than 80% from their early February low. The electric-car maker tweeted early Thursday that it's gotten more than 325,000 reservations for its Model 3 and said it will be upping production plans for the vehicle.CarMax (KMX) also reversed lower, tumbling nearly 6% in speedy volume. The stock has traded below its 200-day line since early August. The used-car seller reported that fiscal Q4 sales and profit topped views, but investors may have been looking for faster growth.The scant list of groups moving higher included gold miners, casino stocks and generic-drug makers.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) gapped up and soared 12% in fast trade to its highest level in nearly eight months. Telsey Group upgraded the casino operator to outperform from market perform and raised its price target to 112 from 67. Late Wednesday, Wynn announced plans for a $1.6 billion lake resort development in Las Vegas.In economic news, U.S. jobless claims declined to 267,000 last week, down from 276,000 in the prior week and well below forecasts for 272,000 claims.

"
155,KMX,"With the U.S. halfway to its best year for auto sales in a decade, it's no surprise that a number of car dealership stocks are enjoying strong financial returns and rising share prices.One of the top performers is Lithia Motors (LAD), which operates 130 car dealership stores in 14 states. In addition to selling new and used cars and replacement parts, the company provides vehicle maintenance, warranty, paint and repair services, as well as financing. It also sells service contracts, and vehicle protection and credit insurance products.Lithia has run off four straight quarters of 21%-or-better year-over-year sales growth. Earnings have risen at least 17% over the same period. Lithia stock touched a new high of 117.14 on June 24 and currently trades near 110.Auto Sales RiseLike other publicly traded car dealerships — including AutoNation (AN), Penske Automotive Group (PAG) and Asbury Automotive Group (ABG) — Lithia has benefited from a rebounding market for new car sales.""The overall market is back above 17 million units on an annualized basis, driven by sales deferred over the last five years,"" said Brian Sponheimer, analyst at Gabelli & Co. ""You're still seeing low (interest) rates, and you're also seeing high used car values.""Sales of pickup trucks also have rebounded, thanks partly to improving residential and commercial construction markets.""It's been a good market this year and we certainly expect it to be as good if not a little better next year,"" Sponheimer told IBD.Earlier this month, industry researcher Autodata reported that U.S. light-vehicle sales in June increased 3.9% from the prior year to 1.48 million units. It was the highest June sales figure since 2006.During the first half of 2015, sales improved by 4.4% year-over-year to 8.52 million units — the highest first-half sales results since 2005.The annualized sales rate adjusted for seasonal trends was 17.2 million cars and light trucks, Autodata reported. That was down from 17.8 million in May but up from 16.91 million units in June 2014, putting the industry on track for its best year in a decade.The strong sales volume was driven by demand for light trucks, crossovers and SUVs, analysts say. Part of that demand can be traced to low gas prices as well as easing credit standards.In a recent research report, RBC Capital Markets auto industry analyst Joseph Spak, citing data from TrueCar (TRUE), noted that the ""average transaction prices (ATPs) for the overall industry remained strong"" in June, rising 1% from a year earlier.Large, publicly traded dealership operators like Lithia have been able to take particular advantage of favorable industry trends because of their size, Sponheimer says.""Size gives them the ability to be acquisitive,"" he said. ""There are also some scale efficiencies that dealers like Lithia or AutoNation can generate, that come in the form of shared services and shared accounting.""On the acquisition front, Lithia is still integrating its October purchase of DCH Auto Group for around $360 million. That deal brought aboard 27 auto dealerships in Southern California, New Jersey and New York and nearly $2.3 billion in additional annualized revenue.Lithia executives declined to comment for this article. On a first-quarter conference call with analysts, CEO Bryan DeBoer said DCH integration efforts were ""solidly on track,"" and that ""the speed of our integration continues to surprise"" company management.""We remain excited by our organization's ability to share best practices to identify areas of opportunity,"" DeBoer said. ""Increasingly, we are working together as one team, aligned with the common mission with similar values built upon our teams and around our customers.""Coast-To-Coast CarsBefore the DCH acquisition, Lithia's business was ""tied heavily"" to domestic cars in Northwestern markets, analyst Sponheimer said. But that ""certainly changed"" with the DCH buy.""They have a coast-to-coast scope now, so they can be a little smarter about where they want to buy new dealerships and the types of dealerships they like,"" he said.You can expect Lithia to continue making acquisitions in coming quarters.""The acquisition market remains robust,"" DeBoer said on the conference call. ""We are actively evaluating acquisition candidates (and) remain confident in our ability to find accretive purchases to increase our portfolio and grow earnings.""In a research note, Morningstar analyst David Whiston said ""the industry continues to consolidate as older owners want to cash out, and Lithia has a target list of over 2,600 stores.""The DCH buyout helped Lithia grow year-over-year revenue by 75% during the 2014 fourth quarter and 66% during this year's first quarter — the biggest gains in years.The company logged Q1 earnings of $1.39 a share, up 35% from the prior year and well above consensus analyst projections for $1.22. Same-store revenue increased 11%. Lithia's new- and used-vehicle retail revenue and service also rose 11% on a same-store basis, while finance and insurance revenue increased 12%.Lithia is due to report second-quarter earnings on July 22. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS to rise 21% to $1.62 and revenue to increase 58% to about $1.9 billion. Full-year earnings are seen climbing 25% to $6.38 a share.One of the company's goals is to increase used vehicle sales, CEO DeBoer said on the conference call. ""We believe that the increased availability of used cars presents a continued opportunity for our stores to increase unit sales in the future. This remains a top priority for our teams in 2015 and beyond.""Lithia has an IBD Composite Rating of 97. It belongs to IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Automobile group, which ranks No. 85 out of 197 industries tracked. The biggest company in the group by market capitalization is CarMax (KMX).

1272,KMX,"The nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a faster pace than forecasted in the third quarter, indicating signs of resilience from consumers and businesses. The expansion dispelled qualms that hurricanes Harvey and Irma would hamper production levels.In fact, the economy recorded its best 6-month stretch of growth in 3 years, a sign that it might be recovering from the long spell of slow growth. An uptick in consumer spending and business investment in equipment boosted economic growth. Consumer outlays in particular improved on a steady job market and healthier household finances. Hence, it seems judicious to invest in areas where consumers have led the way.U.S. GDP Grows 3%, Storm Impact NullifiedThe U.S. economy expanded at a solid 3% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the third quarter of 2017, according to Commerce Department data. Such an expansion came on the heels of 3.1% growth in the second quarter. It also marks the first time of two consecutive quarters of 3% growth or more since mid-2014 for the economy.The economy shook off the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma were expected to impede growth in the July-September quarter. The hurricanes inflicted massive damage in Texas and Florida during August and September.Production at factories, offices and transportation centers were interrupted. Precisely, the storms disrupted fuel production in Texas and agricultural production in Florida. The U.S. economy, in fact, lost 33,000 jobs last month, marking the first month of decline in employment in seven years.Economy Gains on Solid Consumer SpendingNevertheless, the economy was boosted by solid consumer spending. The main engine of the economy grew at 2.4% over the quarter after a 3.3% gain in the second quarter. Such an uptick in household outlays is commendable since lower spending was anticipated owing to the storms.Meanwhile, consumers have stepped up purchases of durable goods including long lasting products like refrigerators. Spending on motor vehicles was driven by the need to replace damaged cars. Needless to say, a steady job market buoyed household optimism, while low borrowing costs will provide the wherewithal to sustain spending.A clearer view of last month’s labor market data, in fact, showed that keeping the effects of the hurricane aside, the U.S. employment scenario is continuing to tighten. The unemployment rate declined to 4.2% in September, the lowest since February 2001, while wages increased 0.5% to an average of $26.55 an hour, per the Labor Department. In fact, in the last 12 months, hourly pay increased 2.9%, up from 2.7% in the prior month and also in line with a post-recession high.Business Investments Ramp Up The first reading of the GDP also showed continued strength in business investment. Nonresidential investment, which includes outlays on equipment, structures and intellectual property increased at a 3.9% annual rate in the third quarter.Among other bright spots, business equipment investment climbed 8.6% for a fourth quarter of growth, the longest streak since 2014. However, residential investments and national defense spending, to name a few, saw declining investments in the said quarter.Overall, the economy continues to be in good shape and has expanded for nine straight quarters since the recession. Renowned economists also gave a positive view on the economy.Economist ViewsPaul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics – “The 3% growth rate will be welcomed by the White House and demonstrates that the hurricanes ended up having little lasting impact on the economy.”Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co – “The gain in equipment investment shows businesses may be getting confident about the expansion, both here in the U.S. and abroad”. He added that “consumers stepped down a little from the second quarter but their spending still expanded at a decent pace.”Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard – “If the point of looking at Q3 data is to confirm whether the Fed is on track for a series of quarterly 25bp increases in policy rates, consider the point was made.”5 Potential GainersAs consumers continue to increase their spending, big-ticket items like auto and auto parts stand to gain. In fact, other durable goods like appliances, furniture, jewelry, consumer electronics and sporting goods are also affected as spending plays a major role in determining their revenues. Durables have an extended product life and are not typically worn out within a short span of time.Significantly higher equipment spending also calls for investing in such a space. We have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid areas that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).CarMax, Inc (KMX  -  Free Report) operates as a retailer of used vehicles in the United States.

1279,KMX,"Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) has no recent plan to increase prices of imported vehicle lineups in China, including high-margin luxury Lincoln models, per Reuters. This decision directs that the company is going to absorb additional tariffs on U.S.-manufactured automobiles, beginning Jul 6.Earlier, in May, Ford and Lincoln reduced prices of imported models in China. The decision was taken after the Chinese government announced tariff cuts for automobiles, effective Jul 1. However, with Trump's tariff implementation on $34-billion Chinese imports, China recently announced an additional 25% levy on 545 American products that includes U.S.-produced vehicles.Ford’s decision is expected to hurt its profit margins, which is already witnessing sluggish sales in the largest automotive market, China. In the first half of 2018, the company’s sales declined 25% to 400,443 vehicles compared with the year-ago period. Per LMC Automotive, this marked the biggest first-half percentage decline in the country since 2001.Ford Motor Company Price and Consensus Ford Motor Company Price and Consensus | Ford Motor Company QuoteAt present, all the Lincoln models sold in China are imported from North America. In 2017, the brand sold 54,124 vehicles in the country, marking 66% rise from the prior year, which majorly consisted of upper-end Lincolns — Lincoln Continental sedan and Lincoln MKX crossover SUV.Price PerformanceYear to date, Ford’s stocks have underperformed the industry it belongs to.

1280,KMX,"The automotive industry mainly accommodates two types of companies – a handful of multinational auto giants and numerous retailers. While the first group is mainly engaged in the production, designing and manufacturing of various types of vehicles, the latter group deals with both new and used vehicles.Over the last few years, used car market has witnessed moderate growth. Despite the introduction of various models, intended to bridge the gap between luxury and budget cars, used car market has not been under any threat. However, in the later part of 2017, declining used car prices stemming from millions of leases nearing expiry date has been a concern for automakers who deal in used cars. In recent times, however, the demand for used cars has received a tremendous boost due to several factors. This has actually brightened the prospects of the auto companies which deal in used cars.Advantage–Price StabilityIn recent times, the demand for new vehicles has been badly hit due to several reasons. This decline is evident from February auto sales figures. Lower new vehicle sales witnessed by many automakers was a result of softening demand for vehicles by consumers following a lengthy boom phase. In fact, in February, strong sales of sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and crossovers could not match the slide in pickup truck sales and resulted in the decline in overall sales of new vehicles.A reversal in the automakers’ stance of offering higher discounts to buyers, a rise in interest rate and stringent credit conditions tamed consumer demand and led to the consequent decline in new vehicles sales. In addition to these, the lucratively priced, high-quality used vehicles inventory have prompted consumers to think over the alternatives to buying new cars. This resulted into higher demand for used vehicles and supported its prices through 2019. In fact, leading rating agency, Moody’s has projected that the used car and truck Consumer Price Index will suffer a year-over-year decline of 1.07% in 2019, whereas the decline was 3.63% in 2017. The rating agency further anticipates prices to stabilize in 2020.The Likely BeneficiariesThe rise in demand in used cars is likely to benefit companies such as Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (PAG  -  Free Report), CarMax, Inc. (KMX  -  Free Report), AutoNation, Inc. (AN  -  Free Report) and Sonic Automotive, Inc. (SAH  -  Free Report). All these companies witnessed moderate growth in revenues in their most recent quarters with CarMax posting the best figure of 11% year-over-year growth and AutoNation witnessing the lowest year-over-year revenue growth of 3.7%. Among the remaining two companies, Penske Automotive and Sonic Automotive witnessed revenue growth of 10.4% and 4.3%, respectively.Moreover, per a research report by Technavio, the increased use of dedicated online sites to sell used cars is having positive impact on the used car market. The presence of several online car sales sites has enabled buyers to pick out a used car through online sites.Currently, while Penske Automotive carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), CarMax, AutoNation and Sonic Automotive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), each. Moreover, Penske Automotive, CarMax, AutoNation and Sonic Automotive have an expected long-term growth rate of 7.9%, 14.8%, 8.5% and 3% respectively.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

Price and EPS Surprise | AutoZone, Inc. Quote A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of AutoZone beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are high. This is because, it has the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for AutoZone is +3.95%.

1286,KMX,"Restaurant chain, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 numbers on Sep 13, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.98%. In fact, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.63%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayCracker Barrel’s distinctiveness in the restaurants space lies in the fact that apart from serving food, its restaurant establishments also have old-country feel along with unique gift shops.However, after posting 11 consecutive quarters of positive comps, the company’s comps decreased in the fiscal third quarter. The decline was due to the challenging macro environment coupled with higher promotional activity despite marketing programs and additional advertising expenses. In fact, the same is expected to have continued into the to-be-reported quarter as well. For the fiscal year, the company now projects comparable store restaurant sales to be flat to up 0.5% compared with the previous guided range of 0.5% to 1%.Moreover, management notes that Cracker Barrel’s retail business has been under pressure, given the challenges faced by the retail industry, as a whole.Notably, though the company has grown its offerings to target a younger demographic and is focusing on new product assortments, management believes that the fiscal fourth quarter’s comparable retail sales are likely to remain under pressure. Comparable store retail sales are expected to decline roughly 3.5% for the fiscal year, which reflects the company's more cautious expectation for the fiscal fourth quarter.Meanwhile, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to affect traffic.Nevertheless, the company’s focus on improving guest experience, menu innovation, promotional offerings, excellent operations execution are expected to positively impact comps in the quarter.Furthermore, the return of Cracker Barrel’s widely popular Campfire Meals promotion in the fiscal fourth quarter is expected to drive incremental sales.The company expects earnings per share in the fiscal fourth quarter to be in the range of $2.10-$2.20. Additionally, management anticipates Cracker Barrel’s cost saving initiatives, commodity costs favorability and growth of its off-premise business to further drive the quarter’s results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Cracker Barrel this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1288,KMX,"Welcome to Episode #92 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by David Bartosiak, Editor of Zacks Momentum Trader and Home Run Investor as well as host of Zacks Live Trader on YouTube, and Eric Vizinas, Zacks Studio Manager, to discuss what is going on in the auto industry in 2017.Are You Buying a Car in 2017?Eric joins the discussion because he is actually in the market to buy a new car. But he’s had an interesting experience with the Chicago area auto dealerships. Let’s just say they’re very eager right now to make a sale. He explains.July auto sales in the United States weren’t great. Inventory remains a problem which is leading to work slowdowns and furloughs at factories while the dealers try and move the old merchandise.American demand has peaked around 17 million cars. Many experts expect it to remain between 16 and 17 million over the next few years. In other words, they don’t see a significant slowdown. It will be more like treading water.What does that kind of market mean for investors?The Auto Makers Are CheapThere’s no doubt that the auto manufacturers have cheap valuations.1.       General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) is trading with a forward P/E of just 5.8 and pays a dividend yielding 4.2%.2.       Ford (F  -  Free Report) has a forward P/E of 6.7 and is paying a dividend yielding a juicy 5.4%.Is this a buying opportunity in the auto makers?Are the Dealerships the Way to Go?The dealers are more diverse than the auto makers. They sell new and used cars as well as handle parts and services. That means they have various forms of revenue streams.Lithia Motors (LAD  -  Free Report), for example, had solid numbers in its parts and services division in the second quarter even as auto sales slowed. Parts and Service revenue was up 7.1% with its body shops seeing a gain of 10%.There are 3 other big auto dealers that also compete in the US, and globally, with exposure to Brazil and the United Kingdom.They’re all cheap, with forward P/Es under 13.Should investors be looking at the dealers right now?Look for Niche BusinessesIf you’re seriously considering investing in the auto stocks, Dave thinks going “niche” is the way to go.1.       CarMax (KMX  -  Free Report) specializes only in used cars. It’s expected to see double digit earnings growth this fiscal year.2.       Ferrari (RACE  -  Free Report) is trading with a forward P/E of 39 but it’s not like other car companies. Dave waxes poetically about what makes Ferrari different from the mass market auto makers. Shares have soared, however. But is it too late to get in?What else should you know about the auto stocks?Find out on this week’s podcast.Want to Learn How to Trade Options?Have you always wanted to trade stock options but are unsure where to begin or what to look for?Each week, Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak will bring you a detailed explanation of the trades “live” on YouTube.Watch him go through the trade as he answers your questions in real time.Become one of Dave’s minions.

1290,KMX,"CarMax Inc. (KMX  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 results, before the market opens on Jun 22. In the last reported quarter, the company recorded an earnings miss of 13.5%. In the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates twice while missing the other two, recording an average beat of 0.9%.In the past three months, shares of CarMax have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 15.8% compared with the industry’s increase of 11.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.CarMax, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CarMax, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CarMax, Inc. QuoteWhy is a Positive Surprise Likely?Our proven model shows that CarMax is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: CarMax has an Earnings ESP of +3.99% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.27, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22. A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CarMax currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?CarMax pursues an aggressive store expansion initiative. In recent times, the company opened stores in New Hampshire, Colorado, North Carolina, Texas, Florida and New Mexico etc. The store opened in New Hampshire was the first CarMax store in the state. Through these openings, the company is aiming to expand its footprint in new and existing locations, thereby driving its financials.Also, CarMax focuses more on the used-car market segment, which helps it to do better than its peers. Low prices and customer-friendly sales process in used-vehicle sales, helps the company to stay ahead among others.Moreover, the company’s stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for annual earnings being revised 1.2% upward over the last 30 days.However, significant cash outflows from operations and rising capital expenditure, due to aggressive store openings, are headwinds for the company.For the soon-to-be-released quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of wholesale vehicles is pegged at $591 million, with an anticipated vehicle sale of 106,546 units. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, actual sales came in at $527.2 million, with 99,226 vehicles sold. For used-vehicle retail, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is $4 billion, with projected unit sales of 202,084 vehicles. In the prior quarter, the company recorded net sales of $3.4 billion, with 170,572 units sold.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Other sales and revenues are $147 million, whereas the company recorded $128 million in the prior quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other stocks worth considering, with the right combination of elements to outpace earnings estimates this time around:CNH Industrial N.V.

(AAP  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on May 22.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 18.5%. Per the earnings record, the company beat estimates twice and missed twice in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.2%.In the last three months, shares of Advance Auto Parts have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock moved up 11.3% compared with the growth of 1.4% recorded by the industry during the period.Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Advance Auto Parts, Inc. QuoteLet’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Advance Auto Parts is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Advance Auto Parts has an Earnings ESP of +1.41% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98.

This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?The company’s business depends on the seasonality and weather conditions. Extremely hot or cold weather generally leads to increased sales as automotive parts stop working at accelerated rates. For first-quarter 2018, the company expects a rise in demand, driven by winter-related demand in key regions.The company is focusing to expand its footprint by opening new stores, widening its online presence and by strategic acquisitions. Further, it aims to reduce inventory costs while improving the availability of products to meet customer needs. In fourth-quarter 2017, Advance Auto Parts announced a strategic partnership with Interstate Batteries, a leading provider of batteries for professional installers. Under the collaboration, the company’s stores and online website will offer the complete lineup of Interstate Batteries.However, funding new stores, maintaining the old ones and investing to develop the supply chain might lead to increased capital expenditure for the company. For 2018, Advance Auto Parts anticipates capital expenditure to be $250 million compared with roughly $189 million in 2017.Other Stocks to ConsiderFew other auto stocks worth considering from the same space, comprising the right combination of elements to come up with earnings beat this time around:AutoZone, Inc.

1293,KMX,"Hurricane Harvey gave a severe jolt to a number of industries, including auto. It is being reportedly said that Harvey has destroyed more vehicles than any other previous natural calamity in the United States.Notably, Texas is the second-largest auto market in the United States, after California. The Houston metropolitan area is also the leading auto sales market in Texas and the entire Gulf Coast. Several dealerships had to be closed in the aftermath of the hurricane. The storm also damaged numerous trucks and cars parked in the dealership lots. According to automotive data firm, Black Book, as quoted in a usatoday.com article, Hurricane Harvey destroyed nearly one million vehicles along the Texas Gulf Coast. This has prompted some analysts to cut their August vehicles sales estimates.Detroit biggies, however, revealed that they were not impacted due to this natural calamity as these companies were not facing troubles in getting parts across the affected region. The area of Mexico south of the storm zone is a major center for auto parts manufacturing.Short-Run Ordeals of Auto RetailersIn the short run, however, companies with several dealerships and parts manufacturing units in the storm zone have been affected. AutoNation, Inc. (AN  -  Free Report), the largest automotive retailer in the United States, has 60 stores in Texas. The company had to shut down 17 stores in the aftermath of the storm and reopened them once the situation improved.Houston, TX-based Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (GPI  -  Free Report), which is engaged in selling new and used cars, light trucks, and vehicle parts, also had to shut down the dealerships, which were opened subsequently. The company minimized the damage by moving the inventory to higher ground.The situation of CarMax Inc. (KMX  -  Free Report), the biggest used vehicles retailer in the United States, has been no different. The company has plans of reopening its six stores in the Houston area soon.Future Too Holds Some Promise It is true that Harvey has temporarily affected the businesses of auto companies. However, the bright spot is that there is some hope of ameliorating the health of auto companies grappling with challenges.  It is expected that once the situation starts improving, there will be increased demand for new vehicles as chances of replacing old and damaged vehicles will escalate. Also, demand for auto parts is anticipated to increase going forward. This is extremely significant, as auto makers are fatigued with the high level of inventory and mulling of lowering down the reserve.Among the three companies discussed above, both Group 1 Automotive and CarMax carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while AutoNation has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked automobile stocks are Continental AG (CTTAY  -  Free Report), Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN  -  Free Report) and Ferrari N.V. (RACE  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1294,KMX,"Hurricane Harvey has caused massive devastation to Houston and the surrounding area since it made landfall last week, but the used car industry has already experienced some gains as the storm has left hundreds of thousands of cars submerged under water.    Floodwaters cover America’s fourth-largest city, with Harvey already the cause of what will likely amount to over $100 billion of damage. And just one day after President Donald Trump visited Texas, the tropical storm hit land once again on Wednesday. This time it hit southwestern Louisiana, as well the Houston area again.FEMA, along with countless other groups and individuals, are currently conducting rescue and recovery efforts and seeking to provide food, water, clothing, and housing for those affected by the storm. Almost 200,000 people have already asked FEMA directly for financial assistance.But the economies of Houston and southwestern Louisiana won’t be halted forever, and one of the first consumer facing industries that could experience a big boost is the used car market.Roughly half a million vehicles are possibly damaged beyond repair, according to Cox Automotive. Now, car retailers, especially used car dealers, are set to benefit.""It's supply and demand,"" chairman of the Houston Automobile Dealers Association, Steven Wolf said on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Wednesday. ""And obviously there's going to be a tremendous demand for vehicles. I think that you're going to see some price pressure on used cars.""Wolf also offered a vote of confidence in auto insurance companies. ""The insurance companies are going to step up and do the right thing and get these claims handled quickly.” He noted that companies will ""send more people down there to help with the claims.""All of this signals a potential windfall for car dealerships in the area, but also for online car sellers and rental car companies.Shares of used car giant CarMax (KMX  -  Free Report) jumped 3.82% on Wednesday, while online car dealer Auto Trader (AUTO  -  Free Report) climbed 2.49%. The relatively new, online-only used car dealer Carvana Co. (CVNA  -  Free Report) saw its stock price skyrocket 11.37%. AutoNation (AN  -  Free Report), a massive automotive retailer that sells both new and used vehicles mostly in the Sunbelt, shares gained 4.09%.Rental car industry powers Hertz (HTZ  -  Free Report) and Avis Budget Group (CAR  -  Free Report) shares popped by 6.55% and 4.78%, respectively. 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1317,KMX,"The Michaels Companies Inc. (MIK  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 14. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this operator of arts and crafts specialty retail stores will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.The company delivered negative earnings surprise of 1.7% in the last reported quarter. However, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 4.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 38 cents, indicating flat earnings from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $1.15 billion, down 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.The Michaels Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Michaels Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Michaels Companies, Inc. QuoteNonetheless, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the past month, reflecting positive sentiment on the stock ahead of first-quarter earnings. The company’s shares have increased 11.7% while stocks in the broader industry recorded growth of 8.8%.Factors at PlayMichaels Companies has a mixed surprise trend, with earnings beat in three of the last six quarters, while sales lagged estimates in four of the last six quarters. However, earnings and sales improved year over year in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, due to solid holiday period sales. Comparable store sales (comps) also improved, driven by higher average transaction value and increased foot traffic to Michaels' stores.Nonetheless, the results for fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 were followed by a modest view for fiscal 2018 and the fiscal first quarter. The company anticipates sales of $1,139-$1,150 million, with comps growth of flat to up 1%. Adjusted earnings per share are estimated to be 36-38 cents per share. The company expects fiscal 2018 to be a year to rebuild and remodel, positioning it for robust growth in 2019 and beyond. The company will continue to remodel stores to standard formats, link e-commerce with store networks by bringing in-house fulfillment of online orders and invest in enhanced data analysis to support retail operations.Following the progress made on these initiatives in fiscal 2017, the company expects to reinvest benefits from the tax reform into its business to drive sales and earnings growth. However, these efforts are likely to result in elevated operating expenses for fiscal 2018.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model conclusively shows that Michaels Companies is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

"
1319,KMX,"With the market and plenty of stocks hitting a rough patch over the last two weeks (although the market is doing a good job of trying to redeem itself so far this week), I've noticed that the pullback came on a noticeable increase in volume. 
"
1320,KMX,"I mention this because price typically follows volume.  
"
1321,KMX,"And if your stocks are falling on an increase in volume, that suggests selling, and maybe a set up for a larger correction.  
"
1322,KMX,"Moreover, if the subsequent up days are made on lower volume than the down days, that's additional foreshadowing that stocks might need to take a breather and find new 'lower' ground.  
"
1323,KMX,"And that's why I want to focus on stocks with increasing Price and Volume in this week's screen.  
"
1324,KMX,"Once again, price should follow volume.  
"
1325,KMX,"If a stock is rising on increasing volume, it can be a sign that new buyers are coming in and some short sellers may be giving up. 
"
1326,KMX,"But rising prices on decreasing volume suggests a lack of new buyers and waning underlying pressure. 
"
1327,KMX,"Just like a ball on top of a hose needs more and more water pressure to push it higher, the same is true to an extent in the markets.  
"
1328,KMX,"Once you let up on that water pressure, the ball will fall back down. And when buying demand eases up, so too will the market.  
"
1329,KMX,"So in this week's screen I'm searching for stocks with increasing volume over the last couple of weeks; not just a couple of days, but weeks.  
"
1330,KMX,"This helps me see true demand that seems to be building over time. There may be an occasional light day here and there, but in total, I want to see it growing week by week.  
"
1331,KMX,"And while there are plenty of stocks that fail to meet these criteria, there are lots of really great stocks that do.

1332,KMX,"The parameters to the screen I'm running this week are as follows: Price >= $5Volume (avg. 20 day) >= 100,000Zacks Rank less than or equal to 3Projected 12 month Growth Rate > 0Recent Week's Price > Price from 1 Week AgoPrice from 1 Week Ago > Price from 2 Weeks AgoWeekly Volume > Weekly Volume from 1 Week AgoWeekly Volume from 1 Week Ago > Weekly Volume from 2 Weeks Ago

"
1339,KMX,"Earnings estimates for GPI have gained sharply over the past 2 months. Furthermore, the company announced a solid third-quarter report in late October that included a positive EPS surprise.  
"
1340,KMX,"Group 1 Automotive is a leading operator and consolidator in the highly fragmented automotive retailing industry. The company owns dealership franchises from where it sells new and used cars and light trucks, while also providing maintenance and repair services, selling replacement parts and arranging vehicle financing, insurance and service contracts.

1342,KMX,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is at $1.75 per share, marking a more than 24% gain over the last 2 months from $1.41. There has also been a slight, 2-cent gain in this guidance over the last 30 days.

"
1345,KMX,"In late October, Group 1 Automotive announced adjusted EPS from continuing operations of 71 cents for the third quarter. The result inched past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. It was the fourth straight quarter of better-than-expected results. In fact, the company has amassed an average surprise of more than 200% in those 4 quarters (mostly because of a 700% beat in last year's fourth quarter).  
"
1346,KMX,"Total revenues declined to approximately $1.25 billion from $1.43 billion. The company sold 25,057 new vehicles during the quarter, and 4,874 were part of the CARS program.  
"

""The cost reductions and inventory controls we implemented in the first half of the year have positioned Group 1 to benefit from any improvement in new vehicle volumes, as demonstrated this quarter.""

1348,KMX,"Industry Rank Analysis 11-11-09
"
1349,KMX,"OK, Halloween is over, but some of the best-looking industries according to the Zacks Rank are those that not long ago were considered part of the living dead.
"
1350,KMX,"Case in point, is the top performing sector -- Auto-Truck-Tires. Out of 206 industries tracked, the sector has five of them, and the worst of the bunch, Foreign Autos, ranked tied for 89th with a composite score of 2.88. None of the groups were at the very top, but all were better than average.
"
1351,KMX,"The original equipment parts makers (although one could argue about the grouping of some of the names) scored best with a rank of 44 and a composite score of 2.62.  Three of the 28 firms in the industry, Fuel System Solutions (FSYS), Oshkosh Truck (OSK  -  Free Report) and Wabco Holdings (WBC  -  Free Report), hold the coveted Zacks #1 Rank, while an additional 10 have #2 ranks.
"
1352,KMX,"While not part of the sector, the Auto Dealers (which are included in Retail) are tied for the 48th spot with the Domestic Automakers, both with composite ranks of 2.67. Among the dealers, CarMax (KMX  -  Free Report), Group 1 Auto (GPI  -  Free Report) and Penske (PAG  -  Free Report) all hold #1 ranks, while Ford (F  -  Free Report) holds a #2 rank.
"
1353,KMX,"The Construction sector was also left for dead not that long ago, but it is tied for third place among the sectors. It is more of a mix by industry, but has some of the very strongest, including some very big surprises, including the Mobile Home/RV industry, which is tied for 3rd place in the rankings thanks to #1 ranks from Cavco (CVCO) and Thor (THO), both of which reported earnings that were more than twice as high as expected.
"
1354,KMX,"Who is the RV industry tied with? Two other building related areas: Lighting Fixtures, led by LSI Industries (LYTS  -  Free Report), and Paint, led by RPM International (RPM  -  Free Report).
"
1355,KMX,"So what does this say about the economy? Mostly good things. It says that the stimulus is working and helping out some of the most depressed sectors. Also that these sorts of durable goods-type firms are among the ones seeing the greatest productivity gains (productivity in durable goods rose at over 20% in the third quarter), and those gains are translating into gains at the bottom line.
"
1356,KMX,"Over the long term, I have some doubts about the sustainability of such a move, given the need for the consumer to tighten their belts and save more. However, the bar got set extremely low and it was an easy hurdle to clear. Easy money and low interest rates mean that not only were they able to survive, at least for the short term -- they look like they will be able to thrive.

1358,KMX,"The auto sector staged a comeback in March after sagging sales performance in February. A majority of automakers reported a rise in their March U.S. sales. A robust economy, product launches and fat discounts enabled auto players to witness a year-over-year rise in new vehicle sales. Even concerns over high interest rates and elevated gasoline prices could not deter Americans’ new-found liking for sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks, albeit at the cost of sedans and passenger cars.Per Autodata, auto industry sales rose 2.5% to 1,653,529 while new vehicle sales gained 6% in March. Moreover, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) was 17.5 million in comparison to 16.8 million, a year ago.Also, during the week, just prior to the March sales release, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) reportedly said that it will do away with the age-old monthly sales report in favor of quarterly reporting. The U.S. auto giant is of the opinion that 30 days is too short to absorb short-term volatility, therefore rendering the monthly figures exaggerated. It feels that the quarterly reporting system would better provide the correct picture of the health of the company as well as that of the industry.Also, the electric vehicles (EVs) maker, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) published its production figures for first-quarter 2018, which totaled 34,494 vehicles, up 40% sequentially. This happens to be the most productive quarter in the history of Tesla. Out of the total vehicles produced, 24,728 were Model S and Model X, and 9,766 were Model 3. The Model 3 output increased significantly on a sequential basis. However, the company missed its target of producing 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of first-quarter 2018. Actually, it produced 2020 Model 3 cars over the last seven days. Despite the production target miss, the first-quarter 2018 performance of Tesla looks encouraging.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Mar 29, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per Fox Business, Tesla has announced that it will voluntarily recall 123,000 of its luxury Model S sedans across the globe to fix the issue of faulty steering components.The Palo Alto, CA-based company stated that the recall includes Model S vehicles built before April 2016 and is devoid of any Model X or Model 3 versions. The company explained that it has detected “excessive corrosion” in the power steering bolts of the recalled vehicles. This glitch might result in reduced power steering.The EV maker will repair damages by replacing the specific bolts in the power steering component. The company has also intimated its plans to contact the affected customers directly for scheduling an appointment once the parts are available in their respective regions.However, the recent recall has further added to Tesla’s woes, which is already grappling with several challenges, particularly with respect to the production of Model 3 sedan, the low-cost EV targeting the mass market.

The U.S. auto giant is of the opinion that sales releases every month do not provide the true picture of the company’s intricate operations or the health of the auto industry, as it includes short-term fluctuations. However, per management, quarterly sales releases will give a better idea about the same.Abandoning monthly sales reports can be attributed to a number of factors. It has been witnessed that the effect of volatility does not smoothen adequately in the 30-day period. This has sometimes resulted in exaggerated monthly sales figures. According to the automaker, incentive campaigns, abnormal weather or product launches tilt monthly sales figures up or down.However, the company intends to provide investors and others a less volatile, longer-term metric to evaluate its performance. Replacing the monthly cycle with a quarterly one is likely to aid the company in this respect. This is echoed in the statement of Kurt McNeil, General Motors’ U.S. vice president for sales operations, “Thirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market.” McNeil further said, “Reporting sales quarterly better aligns with our business, and the quality of information will make it easier to see how the business is performing.” (Read more: General Motors to Drop Monthly Sales Report, Enticing Others)General Motors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"
1387,KMX,"Trends in earnings estimate revisions do not suggest any of the companies reporting will top expectations. This is partially due to the fact that several of the companies have lowered guidance.

"
1389,KMX,"Last month, Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) cut its guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2009, which ends in February. Citing ""significant changes in the consumer environment,"" the company warned that same-store sales could be down 1% to 8%.

1390,KMX,"Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts cut their projections in response, lowering the fiscal third-quarter consensus estimate by 13 cents to 27 cents per share.

"
1391,KMX,"After nearly a perfect record of topping expectations, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) missed third-quarter estimates by 8 cents.

During the past 30 days, 11 of the 16 covering brokerage analysts have cut their fiscal fourth-quarter estimates. The reductions caused the consensus estimate to plunge to a projected loss of $3.37 per share from a profit forecast of 84 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at a loss of $3.61 per share. Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Dec 16, before the start of trading.

"
1397,KMX,"1Some of the companies listed in the earnings calendar may not be in the Zacks Rank universe.
"
1398,KMX,"Key Points:
"
1399,KMX,"Consumers are spending, but they are looking for bargains
"
1400,KMX,"Cheaper gasoline prices are helping to boost store traffic at BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ)
"
1401,KMX,"Plunging trade-in values for SUVs are making it more difficult for consumers to afford new cars
"
1402,KMX,"Lackluster Retail Sales
"
1403,KMX,"Yesterday, the Department of Commerce said retail sales rose just 0.1%. Had stimulus checks not been distributed, there would have been a large decline instead.
"
1404,KMX,"Auto sales skidded 3.6% and furniture sales fell 1.4%. Electronics, building materials and restaurants also saw lower sales.
"
1405,KMX,"All other retail categories showed improvement, however. Not surprisingly, gas stations showed the biggest increase with a 4.6% rise in sales. Unfortunately, higher crude prices are not allowing the gains to translate into profits for the gas stations or the refiners that supply them.
"
1406,KMX,"Consumers Actively Seeking Discounts
"
1407,KMX,"Though the numbers show that consumers are continuing to spend, other data suggests Americans are being more selective about where they shop. This shift has benefited discount retailers, such as Family Dollar Stores (FDO).
"
1408,KMX,"Last week, FDO claimed that same-store stores sales surged 8% in June, well above its internal forecasts. CEO Howard Levine observed that the strength was broad-based and included improvement in both apparel and seasonal items.
"
1409,KMX,"FDO guided for fiscal-fourth quarter profits of 30 cents to 35 cents per share, when it reported fiscal-third quarter profits at the start of July. The guidance led all of the covering brokerage analysts to raise their quarterly forecasts by 3 cents to 32 cents per share.
"
1410,KMX,"Notably, the consensus earnings estimate for fiscal 2009 was revised higher as well. The average forecast now stands at $1.65, 7 cents higher than the consensus estimate of a month ago.
"
1411,KMX,"It's not just FDO that is doing well in the current environment. BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) and The TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) also reported a significant increase in June same-store sales.
"
1412,KMX,"Gas Prices Attracting Consumers
"
1413,KMX,"BJS enjoyed an 8.3% increase, excluding gasoline. Store traffic rose 6% and the size of the average transaction was approximately 2% higher. These metrics show that not only were more people coming to the store, but that they were spending more once they walked in the door.
"
1414,KMX,"It is worth noting that the impact of gasoline sales extends beyond just the numbers. Wholesale clubs typically are one of the cheapest places to fill up. Therefore, the store traffic numbers are likely receiving a boost from shoppers who are walking in simply because they drove over for the gas. Nonetheless, the increase in transaction size suggests that consumers are shopping when the price is right.
"
1415,KMX,"About one-fourth of the covering brokerage analysts have raised their 2008 profit projections on BJS. The revisions have pushed the consensus earnings estimate 2 cents higher to $2.14 per share.
"
1416,KMX,"Discounts Are Helping Too
"
1417,KMX,"TJX realized a 5% jump in same-store sales last month. CEO Carol Meyrowitz credited summer weather for helping demand, though if it was just the weather other retailers would have thrived as well. In other words, TJX's lower prices were probably the primary driver behind the better sales.
"
1418,KMX,"Meyrowitz believes the positive momentum for her company will continue throughout this month and raised her second-quarter profit guidance to between 44 cents and 45 cents per share. Subsequent revisions by many of the covering brokerage analysts caused the consensus estimate to reach 45 cents, up 4 cents from a week ago.
"
1419,KMX,"The average forecast for the full-year was also revised higher. The 2008 consensus earnings estimate of $2.24 is 2 cents higher than the average projection of a week ago.
"
1420,KMX,"FDO is a Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stock. BJS and TJX are Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks. All three are classified in Retail-Discount Variety. This group contains four other Zacks #2 Rank stocks: including Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report), Freds  and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report).
"
1421,KMX,"SUVs Sitting On Dealer Lots
"
1422,KMX,"Last month's 3.6% skid in auto sales reflected several factors. The sluggish economy has made consumers thriftier, which means lower demand for new cars. Tightened credit standards and falling home equity means financing a car purchase is more difficult for some buyers. Then, there is the cost of gas, which makes lower-priced, more fuel efficient vehicles attractive to a broader audience.
"
1423,KMX,"Demand for SUVs has plunged and that has caused reverberations for auto dealers. SUVs carry higher margins and therefore create more profits for dealers on a per vehicle basis. Slackened demand means lower profit.
"
1424,KMX,"The drop in demand has also caused SUV prices to plunge. Thomas J. Folliard, CEO of CarMax (KMX  -  Free Report) observed on his company's fiscal first-quarter conference call that ""the rapid depreciation across this large product segment has been unlike anything I've seen in my career"".

1425,KMX,"Falling prices for SUVs not only hurt car dealer margins, but they also directly impact sales. Many consumers faced with lower trade-in values and a slack economy have difficulties coming up with the additional cash required to buy a new car. In such instances, they are either forced to scale back their purchase plans or continue to drive their current vehicles.
"
1426,KMX,"Given these factors, it is not surprising to see brokerage analysts cutting full-year profit projections on multiple companies within Retail/Wholesale Auto/Truck. This group contains three Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stocks - Asbury Automotive Group (ABG  -  Free Report), Group 1 Auto (GPI  -  Free Report) and Sonic Automotive (SAH  -  Free Report) - and four Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stocks - KMX, Autonation (AN  -  Free Report), Penske Auto Group (PAG  -  Free Report) and Rush Enterprises (RUSHA  -  Free Report).

1429,KMX,"Several local news outlets are reporting that car dealers are experiencing a post-Cash for Clunkers Slump in sales. There is concern that the government's incentive program took sales away from the fall (and even 2010) by giving consumers reason to purchase new vehicles over the summer instead.
"
1430,KMX,"It is definitely taking sales away from September. Edmunds.com calculates that September sales are running at an 8.8 million unit pace. To put this number in perspective, Edmunds Senior Statistician Zhenwei Zhou said sales last September were 12.5 million. He also added ""it had been over 16 million for years"".
"
1431,KMX,"Whether this month's slump continues throughout the remainder of this year and into 2010 remains to be seen. Many carmakers are expected to introduce new incentive programs in addition to rolling out new models. Plus, two of the best-selling cars over the past several years - the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord - did not qualify for the Cash for Clunkers rebate. (Even my V6 Accord was too fuel efficient to qualify.)
"
1432,KMX,"Earnings Estimates for Dealers Are Mixed
"
1433,KMX,"The 2009 and 2010 Zacks Consensus Estimates for AutoNation (AN  -  Free Report) and Penske Automotive Group (PAG  -  Free Report) have been revised upward slightly over the past few weeks. These changes likely reflect the boost provided by the CARS program, however.
"
1434,KMX,"There has not been any change to forecasts for Asbury Automotive Group (ABG  -  Free Report). The 2009 Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sonic Automotive (SAH  -  Free Report) is falling, down 2 cents this month to 64 cents per share. (The 2010 Zacks Consensus Estimate is also lower.)  One analyst recently cut his full-year profit forecast on Group 1 Automotive (GPI  -  Free Report), though the revision did not affect the consensus forecast.
"
1435,KMX,"Revisions Are Favoring Used Car Dealers
"
1436,KMX,"Ironically, earnings estimate revisions are most bullish for used car dealers America's Car-Mart (CRMT  -  Free Report) and CarMax (KMX  -  Free Report).
"
1437,KMX,"All 4 covering brokerage analysts raised their fiscal 2010 profit forecasts on CRMT this month. The revisions pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 21 cents higher to $2.01 per share.
"
1438,KMX,"KMX reported fiscal second-quarter results yesterday. The company enjoyed an 8% increase in same store sales. Profits totaled 47 cents per share, a big improvement over last year's earnings of 6 cents per share, and far above the consensus estimate of 18 cents per share. In addition to seeing improved traffic patterns, the company benefited from higher used car valuations. KMX said that its used vehicle profit increased to $2,120 per unit from $1,870 per unit.
"
1439,KMX,"Keep An Eye On Used Car Inventories
"
1440,KMX,"Used car inventories are the other post-CARS wildcard. Used car prices had been on the rise this year as consumers found difficulty obtaining credit for new car loans or looked for cheaper alternatives. The Cash for Clunkers Program cut supply further by scrapping the trade-ins. Though some vehicles will end up back on dealer lots because they did not qualify for the rebate, many cars and trucks are now permanently off the road.
"
1441,KMX,"CarMax CEO Tom Folliard acknowledged on yesterday's conference call that used car supply is down, but he also stated that used car inventories are largely dependent on new car sales. If Cash for Clunkers truly did take sales away from the future then used car prices could stay elevated. This lack of supply could continue to drive up trade-in values, putting sustained pressure on new car margins, while providing used car dealers with further pricing power.

"
1453,KMX,"Though old adage of ""buy Rosh Hashanah, Sell Yom Kippur"" has not really worked in investors' favor, the bulls continue to remain in control. Therefore, it seems likely that we will hit Dow 10,000 this week. Investors should be aware, however, that this is a fear and greed market run by fast money.

1455,KMX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises
"
1456,KMX,"As I write this, shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report) are trading higher in response to raised fiscal second-quarter estimates from one brokerage analyst. The change has yet to be factored into the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which currently stands at 47 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is slightly higher at 48 cents per share. The home goods retailer has topped expectations for 2 consecutive quarters and could be a beneficiary of the rebound in housing. Bed, Bath & Beyond is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Sep 23, after the close of trading.
"
1457,KMX,"Though used cars did not qualify for the Cash for Clunkers rebates, optimism about CarMax's (KMX  -  Free Report) second-quarter results has been growing. During the past few weeks, 4 brokerage analysts have raised their profit projections. The revisions have pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 2 cents higher to 18 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is slightly more bullish at 19 cents per share. KMX beat expectations over the past 2 quarters after previously missing twice. CarMax is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 22, before the start of trading.
"
1458,KMX,"Though KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) is projected to have lost 68 cents per share, the actual fiscal third-quarter loss could be less than most analysts forecast. The most accurate estimate is far more bullish, calling for a loss of 61 cents per share, and the homebuilder has topped expectations for 2 consecutive quarters. KB Home is scheduled to report on Friday, Sep 25, before the start of trading.
"
1459,KMX,"Research in Motion (RIMM) has topped expectations for 3 consecutive quarters. Ahead of the company's fiscal second-quarter report, 3 analysts have raised their projections. The changes were not significant enough to move the Zacks Consensus Estimate from its current level of $1 per share, though the most accurate estimate is a penny higher, at $1.01 per share. Research in Motion is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 24, after the close of trading.
"
1460,KMX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesTexas Industries (TXI) has missed expectations during 3 out of the last 4 quarters. Shareholders should brace themselves for another disappointment with 3 of the 8 covering analysts cutting their fiscal first-quarter estimates within the past few weeks. The revisions have caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate to drop 7 cents to a projected loss of 5 cents per share. Texas Industries is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 24, before the start of trading.
