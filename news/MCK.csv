2,MCK,"Just when health care investors thought it was safe to dive back into retail pharmacy stocks, Amazon.com (AMZN) delivered a jolt on Thursday by buying PillPack, an online pharmacy that delivers prescriptions presorted by the dose. The move sent shares of CVS Health (CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbling. Drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (ABC), Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) also retreated, along with pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX).In April, Walmart (WMT) had reportedly been close to a deal to buy PillPack, nudging aside Amazon. Meanwhile, Amazon's feared shake-up of health care no longer looked quite so scary as the company shelved plans to deliver medical supplies.Now there will again be a focus on just how big of a threat Amazon represents to the prescription retail industry. Already, CVS has moved to same-day delivery in major markets and next-day delivery.

4,MCK,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. The decisions followed a year-long ""deep dive"" by new CEO John Flannery, a period over which GE stock crumbled in half. Analysts warned of another dividend cut, the second since both the payout and earnings outlook were sliced last year. GE stock rebounded after falling to multiyear lows.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles.

Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion. Several IPOs showed double-digit gains on the first day of trading. Among biotech new issues, Neuronetics (STIM) rallied 63% in its debut and Tricida (TCDA) rose 37%.

Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS.

Meanwhile KB Home (KBH) rose Friday after the builder scored a double beat late Thursday.Carnival (CCL) shares sank to their lowest level in more than a year after the cruise line pared its full-year EPS outlook from $4.20-$4.40 to $4.15-4.25. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents. The drugstore company also topped earnings views and guided modestly higher. Same-store sales fell though.

But Arista Networks (ANET) and LogMeIn (LOGM) fell Friday on guidance.Cisco Systems (CSCO) announced a $25 billion stock buyback, topped earnings forecasts, reported its first revenue gain in eight quarters and guided March quarter views higher. Aside from the new $25 billion buyback, Cisco plans to use some of the $67 billion in repatriated cash for a dividend hike. Cisco would have around $30 billion, including domestic cash on hand, for acquisitions. Cisco shares rose to a 17-year high.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersArista Networks handily beat Q4 earnings views with a 64% jump but revenue only edged estimates and its sales outlook for the March quarter and 2018 disappointed. Shares dived 19% Friday after a 200% run-up the past year. Management forecast a sequential revenue decline in the March quarter, with the mid-point of revenue guidance implying 37% growth to $459 million, just above estimates of $457 million. Analysts said Arista set the expectation for ""mid-20s"" revenue growth in 2018 which is below the Street's 27.5%. The guidance could reflect stiffer competition from Cisco.Shopify (SHOP) earned 15 cents a share in Q4, up from no profit a year earlier, vs. estimates of 5 cents. Revenue jumped 71% to $222.8 million, topping consensus estimates of $208 million. The e-commerce software firm forecast Q1 and 2018 revenue above expectations.

It said Facebook is still adding monthly users overall, but older age groups are mainly responsible for the increase. Facebook will lose 2 million users under 25 in the U.S. this year while Snapchat will add 1.9 million, eMarketer predicts. Facebook's Instagram will still add teens and young adults.Shares of China internet companies Weibo (WB) and parent Sina (SINA) both reported fourth-quarter results that largely topped estimates.

Internet search leader Baidu (BIDU) also jumped on a fourth-quarter report that topped views, thanks to upside from online video and news feed advertising.RELATED:These Top China Names Are Trying To Form BasesDiamondback Energy (FANG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reported Q4 results above Wall Street estimates and plan to boost production this year as the International Energy Agency said U.S. crude output will overtake Saudi Arabia ""soon"" and ""catch up to Russia by the end of the year."" The Energy Information Administration said domestic oil production edged up to 10.27 million barrels per day from 10.25 million the prior week. OPEC sees global demand growth increasing by 60,000 bpd to 1.59 million, but expects U.S. production growth to outpace demand growth.

Meanwhile IBM (IBM) warned Congress about overregulating digital currencies in case it has ""unintended consequences"" on blockchain technology.LogMeIn (LOGM) reported adjusted Q4 earnings that beat estimates while pro forma revenue topped views. For 2018, LogMeIn forecast profit of $5.48 a share, well above estimates of $4.90 a share but its March quarter and full-year revenue outlooks were a bit light. LogMeIn sold Xively, its Internet of Things business for web-connected devices, to Google for $50 million. LogMeIn completed a reverse merger with the GoToMeeting business of Citrix (CTXS) on Feb. 1, 2017. Shares, which had broken out earlier in the week, fell 8.5% on Friday, undercutting its buy point.Chipotle Mexican Grill said Brian Niccol, CEO of Taco Bell, would become the fast-casual chain's chief executive in March. Shares sprinted higher on hopes Niccol — known for helping bring hits like Nacho Fries and Doritos Locos Tacos to Taco Bell's menu — might revive Chipotle's sales and traffic following food-safety issues.Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands International (QSR) said Burger King turned out strong Q4 sales, and the company more than doubled its dividend.

16,MCK,"Social media has changed the way we socialize and interact with friends, dating apps have changed how we find love, and money sharing apps have changed the way we split bills at restaurants.But the way we work — by sending emails with Microsoft (MSFT) PowerPoint, Word or Excel attachments and waiting for responses — is stuck in the past.X Atlassian (TEAM) is looking to propel the office into the future with its project-management and collaborative software as more companies take advantage of cloud-based technology and remote work spaces.""Really, what Atlassian is doing is trying to address how a world might look post-Microsoft Office,"" said Rob Oliver, a senior research analyst at Baird. ""Their revolutionary product addresses this big problem — how to collaborate effectively in teams. It's no accident their stock ticker is TEAM.""Atlassian's Jira, the number one software tool for software developers, allows companies to plan, track and release their software by reporting real-time progress and issue tracking. The price point is low at around $7 per user in a medium size firm or just a $10 flat rate for teams up to 10 users and is popular with help desk and information technology specialists.The inexpensive price is a huge benefit in attracting users as Atlassian doesn't have an enterprise sales force. Instead it works with the ""land and expand"" model, according to Oliver. One user can easily download the software and get the rest of the team to follow, making the product viral at a company thanks to its user-friendly interface and flexibility, he says.Oliver says Atlassian is a very high margin company because most other software firms are spending nearly half their operating budget on sales and marketing.Atlassian has a market cap of $12.43 billion and 112,000 customers, ranging from online dating app Tinder to Domino's Pizza (DPZ) to the U.S. Defense Department.""The platform is very nimble and fits well into the new way people are developing products,"" Oliver said.Other Atlassian products include Confluence, a document collaboration service; Crucible, which uses peer review to find bugs in code; and HipChat, a company hosted group chat and video service. The company also hosts Atlassian Marketplace, which has over 3,500 applications built on Atlassian's offerings.Last year, the company bought Trello, which helps organize projects with visual boards, for $425 million. That marked its 18th, and largest, acquisition.The company has primarily focused its acquisitions under three silos, according to Robert Majek, a senior research associate at Raymond James. The first one is ""plan, track and support,"" the second is ""collaborative and chats"" like Trello and the third is ""code, build and ship.""IBD'S TAKE: Atlassian is part of the Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise group, which is ranked No. 91 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks and includes VMware (VMW) and Citrix Systems (CTXS). Atlassian is also 17th on the IBD 50 list. Shares have more than doubled in the last year, though they recently fell out of buy range with the market downturn.Atlassian was founded in Sydney in 2002 by Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar using credit card debt to fund development. The company went public in December 2015 and now the pair have a cult following in their native Australia. Farquhar recently bought the most expensive house in the entire country.""These guys have created a unique culture where they attract really great employees and retain them,"" Oliver said. ""The competition for developer talent is very high.""McKesson (MCK) Chief Financial Officer James Beer was appointed as new CFO starting this month and Majek said the change poses no risk to the company.Last month Atlassian reported fiscal second-quarter results that beat views but gave weak guidance for the third quarter.Oliver said the company was ""completely unique"" but that doesn't mean that other tech firms are going to stand by and let Atlassian dominate the market space and future of collaborative work.Microsoft revamped its offering, which it calls Teams, last year to integrate its Office 365 apps. IBM's (IBM) IBM Collaboration Solutions has its own collaboration products, and privately held Slack's messaging and file sharing service has more than 6 million daily users. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Docs offers collaborative online work options.As competition heats up and Atlassian grows, the company is becoming a more valuable property.""Atlassian could become an acquisition target down the road,"" Oliver said, as companies get an influx of cash from the Trump administration's corporate tax reform.But the company isn't free of downside risks. Cybersecurity is a risk for tech firms and last year some HipChat passwords were exposed during a data breach. However, Atlassian has a cybersecurity team in place to deal with issues and asks users to report any problems. It has a Security Hall of Fame listing people who disclosed vulnerabilities.Oliver said it's yet to be seen if Atlassian can fend off competition while continuing to sustain its growth, but he thinks they are ""very well positioned.""Majek said its biggest risk is one of the things that makes the company unique, its current sales structure as it grows further.Majek said Wall Street is expecting a deceleration in growth in sales to 38% in fiscal 2018, then to 28% in fiscal 2019 and 25% in 2020.""Companies with that model struggle to pass the billion-dollar mark in sales,"" he said. ""Either they will have to grow a lot slower or get a sales team.""Shares of the company were down 1.3% near 48 in afternoon trades Friday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Why 2018 Software M&A Is Likely To Pick Up, With SaaS Firms EyedStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

18,MCK,"Despite the sell-off in health stocks Tuesday, a joint venture by Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to wring out cost savings from the health care system appears very unlikely to impact industry earnings over the next couple of years, according to analysts.X Figuring out how to rein in health costs without the participation of big health care players looks like a near-impossible task, Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo said. ""We note that the cost to implement systems, adjudicate patient data, and partner with hospitals, doctors, pharmacies on a national basis is onerous.""Caliendo adds that the scale of the big three new partners wouldn't be big enough to squeeze discounts out of providers by steering patients their way, compared to the purchasing power of UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). ""The new company will have to align itself with all these other providers in some way to provide the best care for its employees,"" Caliendo concludes.In fact, Caliendo gave CVS a big vote of confidence earlier Tuesday, saying its planned combination with Aetna positions it to create savings for the government and private employers. Needham raised its rating on CVS to strong buy with a 100 target.Caliendo does think that ""profits in the industry, especially at the underwriting level, are excessive,"" and there are improvements to the current care delivery model that can be made. He sees that as a prime reason behind the CVS-Aetna deal.CVS is looking to shift more health care services to the lowest-cost location: its in-store clinics. That's a different take on UnitedHealth's playbook of expanding into urgent care and other outpatient locales to drive savings for customers.But no such path forward was evident in the announcement from Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire. The plan to establish an independent company ""is in its early planning stages,"" according to a statement by the trio.""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" acknowledged Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett.""Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation,"" said Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Yet it's unclear at this point who any of those talented experts will be.As Wall Street weighed the long-term nature of the effort and the dearth of substantive details, the initial shock wave that rippled across Wall Street subsided. Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer, sank 4.35% to 236.65 on the stock market today, after diving as much as 6.2% earlier. CVS Health, which is in the process of buying Aetna, pared losses to a 4.1% drop.Drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) were down 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Prescription benefit management firm Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.2%, but had tumbled 11.4% earlier. Both CVS and UnitedHealth also operate PBMs, which manage the prescription side of health insurance contracts.Pharmaceuticals and biotech stocks also lost ground, though the hit didn't look much worse than the broader market downdraft on Tuesday. Merck (MRK) shed 1.6%, Allergan (AGN) 1.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) 1.7% Pfizer (PFE) lost 3.1% despite topping earnings views and offering bullish guidance.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Insurers have been solid performers, ranked No. 43 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The knee-jerk reaction among investors is surely a reflection of the unsustainably high cost of health care in the U.S., and the fact that Amazon, which has been itching to disrupt the retail prescription business, is attached to the effort.Traditionally, the fear among health care investors has been that government — not the private sector — will impose cost controls to get a handle on runaway budget deficits, thinning out industry profits in the process. Medicare negotiating drug costs is one such fear, but industry experts say that the government is unlikely to produce much in the way of savings unless it is willing to deny patients access to certain drugs, which could create a political backlash.But Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire aren't the first big employers to join forces to attack health costs. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte noted on Tuesday that the Health Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 large self-insured employers that launched last year, also hopes to find savings and improve employee satisfaction, though it's working with CVS and UnitedHealth to achieve its aims. Initial reports indicated that alliance members expected to save a combined $600 million in prescription costs over three years.Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire say their initial focus will be on ""technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost."" The new corporate entity, they say, will be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""Just what form those technology solutions would take is far from clear. Caliendo supposes that ""Berkshire might bring some underwriting skills (although they've never underwritten healthcare) and AMZN might make pharmacy and medical procurement contributions and provide IT expertise.""Leerkink's Gupte says she's unclear whether Amazon wading deeper into solving the health care mess will accelerate its move into the supply chain of the prescription industry.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why Trump's State Of The Union Might Move Markets Up — Or DownStocks Fall As Market Shows 3 Signs It May Be Ready For A BreakGrubhub, Redhat Lead These Three IBD 50 Stocks In Buy RangeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

21,MCK,"CVS Health (CVS) will buy Aetna (AET) for about $67.5 billion, creating a health-care giant that will have a hand in everything from insurance to the corner drugstore.X CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, with $145 a share in cash and the rest in stock, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That's a 29% premium to Aetna's share price on Oct. 25, the day before the companies were reported to be in talks.The deal is among the biggest health-care mergers of the past decade, combining the largest U.S. drugstore chain with the third-biggest health insurer. CVS also manages drug-benefits plans for employers and insurers, a business that could help steer some of Aetna's 22 million customers into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription. The deal will give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.Including CVS's assumption of Aetna's debt, the deal will be valued at $78 billion. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said.In a joint interview, CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said combining the companies would help CVS expand a variety of retail medical services, from vision care to nutrition advice to audiology, making basic care more convenient and less costly for consumers. Aetna will be operated as a separate business unit, and any new services will be designed to appeal broadly to customers of other insurance companies as well, the executives said.The immediate financial benefits of the deal are projected to be relatively modest. The companies said they expect $750 million in synergies, and profit improvements in the low-to-mid single digits the second full year after the merger is completed. The companies are betting on longer-term profit from reshaping how their customers get care, by creating what the executives are calling ""10,000 new front doors for the health-care system'' at CVS's stores and clinics.""Think of these stores as a hub of a new way of accessing health-care services across America,'' Merlo said in the joint interview. ""We're bringing health care to where people live and work.''s into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription through CVS's drug plans. It will also give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.The deal will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. Barclays, Goldman Sachs. and Bank of America have committed to provide $49 billion of financing, the person said. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018 and create cost savings of about $750 million, said the person.After the deal closes, Aetna will operate as a separate unit run by members of the current management. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini will join the CVS board, along with two other Aetna directors.It comes as the health sector is looking over the horizon at Amazon.com (AMZN), and how the company could shake up the business of buying, distributing and selling drugs and medical products if it gets into health care. The retail industry has been battered by the online giant. Amazon hasn't revealed its plans.""One of the problems with the health-care system is it's so fragmented and there's so little coordination,"" said Steve Kraus, who invests in health firms at Bessemer Venture Partners. ""A better vertically integrated less-siloed system is a good thing in my mind.""It could also set off a new round of takeovers as CVS and Aetna's competitors look at the reshaped landscape. On Nov. 30, the CEO of Express Scripts (ESRX) said the pure-play pharmacy benefits manager would be open to a deal at the right price, though wasn't actively looking for one.""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview. He also mentioned the possibility of partnering with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement.Express Scripts is just one company in a universe of independent drug plans, insurers and supply-chain middlemen. WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Humana (HUM) and Centene (CNC) could become merger targets after the CVS-Aetna deal, according to Matthew Borsch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Drug distributors like Cardinal Health (CAH) or McKesson (MCK), and retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) could also face pressure to find partners.CVS, which operates about 9,700 retail stores and 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, has been moving beyond it drugstore roots for years. In 2007, it bought pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx — a business that made up almost half of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company's operating profit in the third quarter. In 2014, CVS stopped selling cigarettes and added ""Health"" to its name.""Aetna has emphasized its desire to move care closer to the consumer,"" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst at Jefferies, said on Oct. 26. ""CVS's capabilities, including Minute Clinic and the Coram home infusion business, could enable the health plan to improve health outcomes and reduce cost trend.""Consolidation is picking up among health-care suppliers and administrators, as insurers seek more control over how their consumers get care. But two proposed megamergers among insurers — including a deal between Aetna and Humana — were blocked this year on antitrust grounds, leading the companies to look beyond rival insurers to different types of health-care companies for potential deals.The CVS-Aetna deal antitrust prospects may depend on which U.S. regulator is tasked with reviewing it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. The Federal Trade Commission has been less critical of consolidation among companies in adjacent businesses, known as vertical consolidation. The Justice Department, on the other hand, last month sued to block the merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), a vertical deal.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said the DOJ effort to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal does raises concerns but a CVS-Aetna deal does have a path forward. Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug plan business, he said.The biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), is also the most diversified. United owns doctor clinics and an outpatient surgery chain, and also has a pharmacy-benefits management, called OptumRx, built on the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in 2015

22,MCK,"United Parcel Service (UPS) acquired a pharmacy license in Georgia in a move that could broaden its business into not only shipping but relabeling drugs, CNBC reported.XUPS confirmed the move, saying the license is tied to ""new and potential business engagements"" handled out of its Duluth, Ga., facility.It's not clear how strategically significant the move might be for UPS at a time when the company faces uncertainty as Amazon.com (AMZN), a major customer, tests its own final-mile delivery service, which could be a negative both for shipping rates and volume.Amazon also is mulling an incursion into the retail prescription-drug business, which also could entail a role in shipping drugs, challenging drug wholesalers like Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK).Investors didn't initially interpret the late-day UPS news as a threat to the drug wholesale group. Shares of UPS dipped 0.1% on the stock market today. Amazon climbed 1.5%, while McKesson gained 2.1% and Cardinal Health 2.2%.Amazon's footsteps already are prompting potential competitors to react, notably CVS Health (CVS), which is in discussions to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) and has announced plans to roll out next-day delivery in markets across the U.S., with same-day delivery in major markets like New York City.RELATED:Aetna Soars As CVS Health Deal Offer Could Top $70 BillionCVS Same-Day Delivery To Fight Amazon Is Tough Pill To SwallowOPEC, L.A.

23,MCK,"CVS Health (CVS) isn't taking the threat from Amazon.com (AMZN) lying down.XNews that the drugstore chain is reportedly in talks to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) for more than $200 per share hit just after reports that Amazon has obtained wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least a dozen states.Aetna shares vaulted 11.5% to close at 178.60 on the stock market today. CVS shares fell 2.9%, recovering somewhat after the Aetna news followed the Amazon report. Amazon shares changed little during regular trading but surged 7.8% late after reporting quarterly results that sailed past estimates.Meanwhile, news about Amazon's pharmacy licenses sent Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) down 3.2%, while a host of drug distributors also got whacked. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) lost 4.2%, McKesson (MCK) 5.2% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 3.4%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.CVS and Aetna, which serves 22 million members, already had close ties, with Aetna signing up the drugstore giant's Caremark unit as its pharmacy benefit management partner this spring.In June, Tarun Mehra of the Fuld & Co. consultancy wrote that CVS should buy Aetna: ""CVS has an impressive suite of assets already, but if it were to add a health plan to its portfolio, it would create a truly large-scale integrated platform across retail, PBM, MCO (managed care organization), and a distributor joint venture (with Cardinal Health, providing CVS with a strategic advantage over UnitedHealth Group (UNH)-OptumRx.""Yet in just a few months, the potential entry of Amazon has shaken up the $300 billion prescription-dispensing industry, and analysts are now speculating that UnitedHealth could partner with Amazon.

24,MCK,"Even though CVS Health (CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) have repeatedly thrown cold water on the idea that Amazon.com (AMZN) will take on the $300 billion prescription dispensing industry, the idea just won't die.XOn Thursday, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes seemed to up the ante on Amazon's rumored interest in the sector, saying he expects it to happen. According to a write up from TheFly.com, Wilkes sees Amazon either buying or partnering with a pharmacy benefit management company, which would help drive volume and navigate industry regulations.Wilkes has been working in and covering the health care services arena for a quarter century, so his perspective that Amazon is well positioned to disrupt the industry may carry weight with investors. He noted his concern that Amazon's entry could negative effect PBM industry earnings.The report about Amazon is likely a longer run concern for investors, so the pharmacy focus Thursday was on weak sales from Rite Aid (RAD), which cited ""a challenging reimbursement rate environment"" and new generics holding down prescription prices as it reported earnings.Amazon shares added 0.6%, heading back toward its 50-day moving average. Rite Aid shares tumbled 11% to 2.03, hitting a four-year low on the stock market today. CVS, which is both drugstore and PBM, slipped 0.3%, while Walgreens lost 0.8%. Walgreens this month won FTC approval to buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores after a long battle to buy all of its smaller rival fell apart due to regulatory objections.Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which operates the OptumRx pharmacy benefit management company, rose 0.8% but lagged behind the solid gains seen by other managed care players. Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest pure-play PBM, was 0.2% higher.The health care group suffering the most on Thursday were drug distributors. McKesson (MCK) fell 1.4%, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 1.75% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 1.7%.If Amazon were to enter the pharmaceutical industry, some industry watchers have speculated that it might cut out distributors and deal directly with drug manufacturers.IBD'S TAKE: IBD premium features are free through Oct. 8.

""In an environment where there's a migration to more value-based care, those clinical capabilities are going to continue to grow in importance.""Merlo said the ""highly regulated"" industry has high barriers to entry, and noted all the work required between pharmacists, payers and physicians. He added that patients put trust in their retail pharmacists, adding that mail-order pharmacy has declined in recent years.Some have speculated that Amazon could use Whole Foods locations as a place for in-store pharmacy pickups.RELATED:This $300 Billion Market Could Be Amazon's Next Casualty — Or NotRite Aid Stock Crashes On Same-Store DeclineStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

25,MCK,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) signaled openness to partnering with Amazon (AMZN), which is reportedly considering a push into the prescription-dispensing business, after beating Q3 earnings forecasts.XThe insurer's Optum business, a provider of health services, prescription benefit management and technology services, has been a growth driver and helps the company stand apart from the rest of the managed-care market.Asked about the potential for Amazon to enter the prescription-dispensing business, OptumRx unit CEO John Prince said that the company is ""willing to partner with anybody that drives value"" with the goal of meeting consumers ""how and where they want.""Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes wrote earlier in October that he sees a partnership with UnitedHealth as the most logical path forward for Amazon as it targets the prescription business.Shares of UnitedHealth jumped 5.5% to close at a record high of 203.89 on the stock market today, bouncing off support at their 50-day average and helping the Dow Jones industrial average climb toward 23,000. Amazon edged up 0.3%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) rose 0.7%, and drug distributor McKesson (MCK) dipped 0.1%. CVS Health (CVS), which also has a PHM unit, added 0.3%.UnitedHealth is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, behind Centene (CNC) and Cigna (CI), based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Centene rose 3.2% and Cigna 1.2% Tuesday, helped by a bipartisan deal to fund ObamaCare subsidies for insurers.IBD'S TAKE: Get ready for each earnings season day by reading IBD's daily Investing Action Plan, which highlights stocks that are in buy range or close to it. UnitedHealth's EPS surged 23% to $2.66, beating views for $2.57, as revenue climbed 8.7% to $50.322 billion, matching forecasts. Optum revenue rose 8.4% to $22.89 billion.The company raised its guidance for full-year earnings to about $10 per share vs. its prior range for $9.75-$9.90. Analysts had expected $9.87.Because the insurer has extricated itself from the ObamaCare exchanges and GOP efforts to target Medicaid have run into trouble, it's well positioned to deal with shifting political winds.In fact, UnitedHealth markets the type of short-term medical plans that Trump wants to make widely available as a less-costly alternative to ObamaCare plans.Management noted on the earnings call that they'll consult with the Trump administration as officials write rules governing short-term plans and other areas targeted by Trump's executive order last week.RELATED:Trump Executive Order Hits ObamaCare InsurersAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

The company pointed to late income tax returns for its lagging first-quarter performance.  The mood spilled over onto Nike (NKE), which dropped 1.4% — the worst early move on the Dow Jones industrial average.Markets will have an eye on oil prices, which were trading higher with West Texas Intermediate up 1.2% in early action — trading near the $50 per barrel mark ahead of the Baker Hughes (BHI) weekly rig count report, due out at 1 p.m. ET.James Bullard, President of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, said in an early speech Friday that the Fed's outlook for two more rate hikes this year may be too aggressive, given the recent economic data, and argued for a go-slow approach to future hikes. Bullard pointed to economic data that has been relatively weak since the Fed's meeting in March, saying ""U.S. inflation and inflation expectations have surprised to the downside in recent months. Labor market improvement has slowed.""Overseas, markets in Europe stepped off healthy gains in afternoon trade as they recovered from a sharp sell-off Thursday. London's FTSE 100 rose 0.3% and Paris' CAC-40 rallied 0.4%. Frankfurt's DAX posted a 0.2% gain.RELATED: Key Stocks As Trump Courts Saudi Cash: Investing Action Plan

32,MCK,"XDrug and medical supplies distributor Cardinal Health (CAH) said it would buy the medical supply units of Medtronic (MDT) for $6.1 billion, mostly with debt. Along with weaker earnings guidance, Cardinal shares plunged early Tuesday.Cardinal Health is acquiring Medtronic's patient care, deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency units, including brands used. Combined, the units generated about $2.4 billion in revenue in the last four reported quarters, Medtronic said. They include 23 product categories across multiple market settings, including brands, such as Curity, Kendall, Dover, Argyle and Kangaroo, which are used in nearly every U.S. hospital.""This well-established product line is complementary to our medical consumables business and fits naturally into our customer offering. For this reason, this product portfolio has been on our radar for many years,"" said Cardinal Health Chairman and CEO George Barrett.IBD'S TAKE: Cardinal Health shares had been rebounding since the presidential election as investors believed Donald Trump would be less aggressive on drug prices than Hillary Clinton, despite some of his statements. But the stock tumbled through its 50-day moving average after finding support there in 2017.But Cardinal now sees fiscal 2017 earnings per share at the low end of earlier guidance of $5.35 to $5.50. It expects the deal to be boost non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations by more than 21 cents in 2018, but still sees EPS that year to be flat to down in the mid-single digits.Cardinal Health will finance the acquisition with cash and $4.5 billion in new debt. Standard & Poor's and Fitch both put Cardinal's credit rating at risk of a downgrade, citing increased ""leverage.""Cardinal Health shares tumbled 11.5% to 72.39 on the stock market today, gapping below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Medtronic dipped 3 cents to 80.33. Among Cardinal's fellow drug distributors, McKesson (MCK) sank 4.6% and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 4.7%.In 2015, Cardinal Health paid about $2 billion for Cordis from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), adding a portfolio of devices, including catheters, filters and stents.Medtronic said the transaction will reduce 2018 EPS modestly. Medtronic will spend $1 billion of the $5.5 billion in net proceeds from the deal on share buybacks, with the rest going to cut debt.RELATED:Johnson & Johnson Earnings Top, But Drug Sales Are A Drag

33,MCK,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care? We think tonight's Berkshire Hathaway 13F will go a long way to attract sector interest.""RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticJPMorgan Sets Fresh High, Goldman Hits Highest Since 2007 On Yellen

34,MCK,"Shares of F5 Networks (FFIV), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Lam Research (LRCX), Mattel (MAT) and McKesson (MCK) fell late Wednesday on earnings reports.F5 is the leading maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs), electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers.Fiscal Q1 earnings rose 14% to $1.98 a share, topping forecasts by 4 cents. Sales climbed 5% to $516 million but missed views for $517 million. F5 gave Q2 guidance in line with Wall Street targets.Shares fell 4.6% to 139 in late trading.

F5 hit a record high of 148.34 on Dec. 21.Citrix is a leader in virtualization software to boost server performance. It's a software rival to F5's hardware.Citrix earned $1.61 a share on sales of $908 million. That topped consensus for EPS of $1.50 and revenue of $900.8 million.The company sees 2017 non-GAAP EPS of $4.60-$4.65 and revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion. Both are well below consensus for $5.60 EPS and sales of $3.55 billion, but it's not clear if the numbers are comparable. Citrix's guidance excludes GoToMeeting, which is merging with LogMeIn (LOGM).The company also hiked its buyback plan by $500 million.But shares fell 4.3% to 91.60 in late trading. Citrix rose 1.45% to 95.74 during the regular session, hitting its highest level since March 2000.Chip-equipment maker Lam Research earned $2.24 a share, beating views by 5 cents.

35,MCK,"CVS Health (CVS) sank to a more than two-year low Tuesday after the drugstore giant and pharmacy-benefit manager cut full-year and 2017 EPS guidance, saying it expected to lose more than 40 million retail prescriptions next year amid tougher competition.CVS Health cut its full-year 2016 EPS target to $5.77-$5.83 from $5.81-$5.89. Analysts had expected $5.85.In cutting 2016 guidance, company said that ""very recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter."" It added that ""slowing prescription growth"" and a ""soft seasonal business"" were also hurting.Those network changes, CVS said, had ""more significant implications"" for 2017, and the company said it expects retail operating profit growth to decrease. CVS sees 2017 EPS at $5.77-$5.93, far below analyst targets for $6.53.The forecast comes as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tries to lure pharmacy-benefit managers away from CVS with better prices. The landscape could become more difficult if Walgreens and Rite-Aid (RAD) merge.For this year's third quarter, earnings per share rose 28% to $1.64, topping views for $1.57. Revenue climbed 15.5% to $44.6 billion, missing estimates for $45.29 billion. Same-store sales increased 2.3%, with pharmacy same-store sales up 3.4%.CVS also announced a new $15 billion stock buyback program.Shares tumbled 11.8% to 73.53 on the stock market today. CVS hit 69.30 intraday, its lowest since early 2014. Walgreens Boots fell 1.7% to 80.09 while Rite Aid surged by 5.4% to 6.86.CVS has been investing in its specialty pharmacy business, to provide drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic conditions and spent $10.1 billion acquisition of Omnicare last year.But shares have suffered since May amid reimbursement rate pressures across the sector, weak earnings and guidance from drug distributor McKesson (MCK), and reports that the Justice Department will bring charges against makers of generic drugs for price collusion.Meanwhile, CVS hasn't been as invested in the front end of the business, unlike Walgreens, which has revamped its beauty offerings.IBD'S TAKE: The big drugstore chains sell beauty products, which have been a bright spot in an otherwise bleak retail landscape. Here's why e-commerce giant Amazon has had trouble breaking into that market.Last month, Walgreens reported fiscal Q4 earnings that topped but sales coming up a little light. The drugstore giant also extended its merger deadline with Rite Aid to allow more time to gain regulatory approval amid new doubts about whether the deal will pass muster.RELATED:Walgreens Boots Alliance Earnings Mixed; Rite Aid Deadline ExtendedCVS Earnings Beat On Specialty Pharma Bet; Guidance Raised

36,MCK,"Cardinal Health (CAH) on Monday lowered its full-year forecast due to smaller margins in its key pharmaceutical sector, but reported fiscal first-quarter profit that came in ahead of analyst estimates and restored some order to the drug wholesale sector.Shares of the Dublin, Ohio-based company rose 1.8% to 68.69 in the wake of a near double-digit sell-off on Friday, wrought by lower-than-expected earnings from rival McKesson (MCK). McKesson ended Friday's carnage down nearly 23%, and tried to mount a comeback Monday, rising 2.5% to 127.17.The third company in the drug-distribution power triumvirate, AmerisourceBergen (ABC), also got caught up in the sell-off swirl and lost more than 13% on Friday. On Monday, shares climbed 1.7% to 70.32. AmerisourceBergen plans to release earnings on Wednesday.""On the heels of McKesson's challenging 2Q last week, Cardinal's results were downright boring (thankfully),"" EvercoreISI analyst Ross Muken said in a note to clients, adding the parenthetical phrase. ""While pharma distribution missed our EBIT forecast and is expected to be weaker than originally anticipated in 2Q and for the FY, the magnitude of the cut is not as 'frightening.' ""Cardinal Health said quarterly income was $309 million. Adjusted earnings were $1.24 per share, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.21 per share.The prescription drug distributor posted revenue of $32.04 billion in the period, ahead of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks who expected $31.22 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Cardinal Health shares took a severe drubbing on Friday, gapping down drastically on competitive concerns expressed by rival drug distributor McKesson. Further, shares had been trending down since reaching an intraday high of 91.91 in April 2015. The bright side? Of the three major drug wholesalers, Cardinal's drop on Friday was the least drastic: just under 10%.Cardinal, however, lowered its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share, down from its previous guidance of $5.48 to $5.73. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected full-year EPS of $5.59, near the top end of Cardinal's new range.""The company states the segment is impacted by generic pharma pricing as the more significant factor unfavorably impacting the segment followed by reduced levels of branded price inflation, but is unclear on the competitive environment,"" Citi analyst Garen Sarafian said in a note to clients.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
"
37,MCK,"Shares of drug-distribution giant McKesson (MCK) went into free fall Friday morning, dragging its two main rivals with it, after it reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that were well short of analyst estimates and drastically lowered its full-year forecast.McKesson stock tumbled by nearly 29% at one point, and ended the day down 22.7% to end the session at 124.11. Its chief rivals in the drug distribution business, Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) both were down by double digits. Cardinal finished the day down 9.8% to 67.50 a share and AmerisourceBergen plunged 13% to 69.14.A note from Citi Research analyst Garen Sarafian said McKesson was blaming AmerisourceBergen for much of its troubles, saying AmerisourceBergen had made a move to shore up more business from independent pharmacies.""While we have no reason to refute (McKesson) management we respect, we find it extremely odd that peer raised through the ranks of the company's conservative culture for nearly a quarter-century would choose to compete so aggressively as to create such a large impact on (McKesson),"" Sarafian wrote.San Francisco-based McKesson said adjusted net income was $2.94 per share, while the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $3.05 per share. The prescription drug distributor posted revenue of $49.96 billion in the period, which also did not meet Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $51.43 billion.IBD'S TAKE: McKesson stock had long been reliable, climbing steadily to an intraday peak of 243.61 in May 2015, but has plunged since then. Friday's stock plummet puts it at half of its peak value. It now ranks third in IBD's medical and wholesale drug supplier group, with AmerisourceBergen now at the top.McKesson lowered its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $12.35 to $12.85 per share. Estimates from Thomson Reuters had called for earnings of $13.59 a share.With Friday's tumble McKesson shares have fallen nearly 40% since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased slightly more than 4%.McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen have a virtual stranglehold on the drug distribution market, collectively controlling well over 90%. McKesson is the biggest of the three, with annual revenue of more than $180 billion, putting it in the fifth spot on the Fortune 500 list. AmerisourceBergen is 12th with more than $135 billion and Cardinal is 21st at more than $102 billion.All three, however, exist on razor-thin margins that often are 1% or less. McKesson's $307 million in net income is 0.6% of its nearly $50 billion in revenue for the quarter.

38,MCK,"The main indexes were volatile Friday as Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) gave the Nasdaq some lift.The Nasdaq quickly erased a midday gain and was down 0.2%. Alphabet rose 1.5% in strong volume, adding some room above its 813.98 buy point.  The company beat Q3 estimates late Thursday. Facebook was up 2% in some of the most active trading in today's market. It climbed back above the 132.08 buy point of a week-old breakout.But Amazon.com (AMZN), another big component of the Nasdaq, acted as a drag.

The small-cap Russell 2000 was up 0.3%, however. Volume was lower compared with the same time Thursday.Ellie Mae (ELLI) surged 11% in heavy volume.

Late Thursday, the mortgage processing software company beat Q3 expectations and raised its full-year forecasts.Some medical stocks were routed as the sector continued to go through a bad earnings season.McKesson (MCK) was the single most heavily sold stock, with shares down 24% in volume about 1,820% times higher than normal. Its quarterly results missed estimates and the drug distributor sharply cut its full-year forecast amid pricing pressures. Peer Cardinal Health (CAH) plunged in sympathy, falling 11.5% to the lowest level since May 2014. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) plunged 13%.The damage spread beyond the drug distribution industry. Generic drugs, biotech, managed care and medical services were some health care industry groups down more than 1% and in the bottom rungs of Friday's performance table.AbbVie (ABBV) gapped down sharply in volume more than 4 1/2 times the average as earnings topped views but sales missed analyst targets.Novo Nordisk (NVO) gapped to the lowest level since November 2013, accelerating a price deterioration that started in August. The drugmaker missed sales estimates and cited declining sales and prices for insulin.RELATED:Q3 Bottom Line: Google A Cash Machine, Amazon A Free SpenderEllie Mae Has Inside Track To Help Mortgage Lenders Go Digital McKesson Drags Down Sector With Earnings Miss, Lower OutlookAbbVie Topples On Humira Miss; Sanofi, Novo Diverge On Insulin Panic

39,MCK,"Stocks were mixed Friday morning as investors digested the Commerce Department's positive read on third-quarter GDP growth and several big earnings reportsDow industrials remained slightly higher while the S&P 500 fell fractionally and the Nasdaq lost 0.1%.Big-boned earnings reports powered early action on the stock market today. One exception was Baker Hughes (BHI). The oilfield equipment and services heavyweight spiked 5.5% after news reports that General Electric (GE) was discussing a possible takeover of the Houston company. GE clarified that it was only discussing potential partnerships, not a takeover. GE shares ticked up more than 1%.Amazon.com (AMZN) dropped more than 4% after a 206% surge in third-quarter earnings stopped well short of views for a 359% gain. A 29% revenue increase met expectations. The midpoint of Amazon's fourth-quarter guidance was just below analysts' targets. Amazon ended Thursday in a buy range on a rebound from its 10-week moving average. The  stock gapped below its 10-week moving average, a break of support.Alphabet (GOOGL) rose more than 2%. Google's parent reported a 23% rise in earnings and a 20% revenue gain, both above expectations. The company also announced a $7 billion stock buyback initiative. The stock ended Thursday in a buy range above an 813.88 flat base buy point. It has had trouble getting lift above that level.Drug makers and drug-related stocks were swinging wildly.

Caught in the undertow, fellow drug distribution giants Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) also tumbled. AmerisourceBergen plunged 11% while Cardinal swooned 12%. The two companies report earnings next week.Cirrus Logic (CRUS) logged a near-10% advance to 56.88.

41,MCK,"The coming presidency of Donald Trump and the near-certain prospect he will try to unravel President Obama's Affordable Care Act sent shares of hospital stocks into cardiac arrest in Wednesday trading, while major insurers were mixed and drug wholesalers enjoyed a revival.Most of the nation's biggest hospital operators plunged by double digits, led by the likes of Tenet Healthcare (THC) and troubled Community Health Systems (CYH). Tenet stock lost a quarter of its value, dropping to 15.21. Community plummeted by 21.6% to 4.66.The nation's biggest hospital company, HCA Holdings (HCA), fell nearly 11% to 72.16, while LifePoint Health (LPNT) plunged 13.5% to 52.80. Universal Health Services' (UHS) drop was paltry by comparison, 6.9%, but still that gouged nearly $9 out of its shares, bringing it to 119.26.Hospitals are expected to take the brunt of an expected drop in federal health care funding. The demise of the ACA, commonly known as ObamaCare, could leave millions of Americans uninsured and unable to pay for hospitalization, thus cutting into the profits of major health care facilities' operators.Mizuho Securities analysts Sheryl Skolnick and Ann Hynes said in a note to clients that Trump's victory, along with Republicans managing to retain control of the House and Senate, does not bode well for health care companies.""(A) GOP Triple Play, the worst possible outcome for (health care) stocks, is a reality,"" the analysts said in a note to clients. ""We see extreme risk of ACA repeal-replace, loss of the Medicaid expansion, a primary driver of results for both hospitals and health plans, and reversal of the many value-based regulations that promote home health care.""Insurers, however, were beginning to cut ties with the ambitious health-coverage plan even before Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election, so the effect on them was mixed. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares were down fractionally to 141.90 while Aetna (AET) jumped 4.7% to 118.02. Anthem (ANTM) was down early but swung to a gain of 1.5% to close at 128.75. Cigna (CI) shares jumped 5.5% to 135.80.Humana (HUM) surged nearly 4% to 186 as it seems the carrier's Medicare-heavy business would be largely shielded from any ObamaCare repercussions.Drug wholesalers reveled in Trump's election as it appeared they — along with pharmaceutical companies — would bask in a more pressure-free environment now that Democrat Hillary Clinton has been dispatched. Clinton had vowed to combat exorbitant drug pricing.McKesson (MCK), which fell sharply late last month on a disappointing earnings report, recovered some of that in Wednesday trading. Shares surged 8.6% to close at 141.68. The rapture extended to its main rivals, as AmerisourceBergen (ABC) also jumped more than 9.5% to 75.61 and Cardinal Health (CAH) climbed nearly 6% tp 69.25.

50,MCK,"The clock ticked and ticked and then at 8:30 am on Friday – the gov't released the all important NFP (Non Farm Payroll) report……expectations were for +200k jobs to be created…in fact they told us that 215k job were created – that's better than the expectation – and the mkt sold off (initially…). But by mid morning – the sell off had ended and the buyers became a bit more aggressive (see the ISM report)……and by the end of the day – Wall St was throwing a party – the Dow +107 pts, the S&P surged by 13 pts – ending the day at 2072 and Nasdaq charged ahead by 45 pts to end the day at 4914. What had changed?Everyone was cheering the jobs report – or were they cheering for lower rates for longer? I mean a strong jobs report would argue for higher rates – and higher rates now would cause the mkt to back off (which is what we saw early on...) – but then a funny thing happened on the way to the forum……Unemployment crept back up to 5% - as more people looked for meaningful work….the spin doctors using this as a positive – saying that the mood has changed – and people who long ago fell off the rolls are now coming back into the work force – or are at least trying (because they are all of sudden encouraged..) And deep within the jobs report – we find the different job categories and how those categories were impacted and what do we see?Manufacturing LOST 30k jobs last month and the bulk of the new jobs were what? PART TIME RETAIL. Do you see the disconnect? Yes – those part time retail jobs ARE jobs…..but the frustration is that we are once again losing good paying jobs for low paying service sector jobs…..and now you ask why wages have remained stagnant for so long? Part time retail sales jobs pay MINIMUM wages – and nothing more - while high paying jobs that do pay more continue to disappear which then puts downward pressure on wages….. So why would anyone think that there is going to be upward pressure on wages at all? So then the theory goes that rates are not going anywhere - just as Janet discussed and BOOM! The buy algo's kick in and the sellers pull back and the mkt rallies.....The funny thing is that Stephen Stanley – Chief Economist at Amherst Pierpoint Securities had this to say:""Any company facing the consumer is probably feeling pretty good about things right now. Despite a choppy economic environment for the past year – employment has been absolutely rock solid"".Did he say 'Rock Solid'? May I ask – what world is this guy living in? Did he even read the report? We lose high paying jobs and replace them with low paying jobs…….and he defines that as 'Rock Solid'? Investors, economists and our very own Janet Yellen – Fed Chair – remain suspect…..in fact many are slashing their estimates for 1qtr growth and for CY (calendar year) 2016.......(see below)…this guy is making it look like a bowl of cherries......saying that part time job creation at minimum wage rates is SOLID JOB GROWTH...Well - fast forward - an hour and half later - and we got the ISM report....at 10 am the Institute of Supply Management reported that the ISM Manufacturing index showed a gain of 51.8 – vs. the exp of 50.5……so get ready – because here is the 'kick'… at 8:30 am - The gov't reports that we are losing manufacturing jobs while at 10 am the ISM reports that we are gaining manufacturing jobs! (Beware the ISM is NOT a gov't report) And the spin machine is hard at work! How exactly are they going to reconcile these two reports so that they make sense? What is the mkt to believe? How can one report suggest weakness, while the other one suggests strength? In the end the mkt believes that jobs, wages and growth remain suspect and that the FED will hold rates steady - so higher we go....Next up - ......1st qtr earnings are expected to be -9.3% followed by 2 qtr earnings down 3.6%...... Full year 2016 earnings are now expected to be +2.2% which is an 81% reduction from the July 2015 estimates of +12% for the full year.Now we know that the analysts always start high and then progressively revise lower - and get to a point that they have lowered the bar so low - it is almost impossible to miss.........but what does this really say about the state of the economy? And if earnings are due to be negative for 2 qtrs...what will they have to be in the second half of the year to end positive? Well estimates call for +3.4% in the 3 qtr and +9.4% in the 4th qtr.....Really? We are going to get this massive recovery during the second half of 2016?Be sure to get a front row seat during earnings season – when companies report on how they did….listen carefully to the number of companies that have or will announce layoffs – Goldman Sachs (GS), Credit Suisse (CS), JP Morgan Chase (JPM),  Bank Of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Blackrock (BLK), Boeing (BA), Peabody Energy (BTU), US Steel, McKesson (MCK) have all announced layoffs - never mind the energy companies that have gotten slaughtered...... while Lockheed Martin (LMT) announced a 'voluntary layoff program'…and let me remind you – none of these lost jobs is a minimum wage job, none of these jobs is part time and none of these jobs are coming back next qtr or the qtr after that…..Mr. Stanley – would you care to comment?With earnings only days away now….I suggest that you pay attention to the top line revenues and bottom line profits – if they miss on the top line yet beat on the bottom line – then that just means that they continue to CUT expenses (wink, wink!) to achieve these 'great' results….US futures are up again this morning - currently +5 . The dollar is a bit stronger and oil is retreating....now trading at $36.71/barrel.....which is giving this latest surge some oomph....The mkt does feel like it wants to test the 2100 level.....before it rests.....and with little or no resistance right now - it is entirely possible we do so before the start of earnings season.....Today 's eco data includes ISM NY, Factory orders - exp of -1.8%, ex trans of -0.5%. Durable goods of -2.8% , ex trans of -1%. ...Not sure - but to me - negative numbers do not suggest strength at all.....Would anyone care to comment?And yes they do....today we get 3 FED mouthpieces...Boston's Eric Rosengren at 10:15 and Dallas Pres - Kaplan and Minneapolis's Neel Khashari both after the bell.Now you will recall that Khaskari was Hank Paulson's right hand man during the crisis and the country rewarded him with the Minneapolis FED Pres position last year. He is now singing a very different tune than he did when he was in the treasury office.....so - expect a lot of chatter after his speech as analysts and strategists dissect it. Dallas's Kaplan is also new on the scene...appointed in September - so the community is still trying to figure out which side of the fence he is on..... appears to be more of a Hawk.....So here we go again......Janet says 'no' and the mouthpieces say 'yes'......expect more confusion and volatility as we move into earnings.Take Good Care

The two companies would join McKesson's Specialty Health division and are expected to add around 11 cents to adjusted EPS next year.""Collectively, these acquisitions will increase McKesson’s specialty pharmaceutical distribution scale, oncology-focused pharmacy offerings, solutions for manufacturers and payers, and scope of community-based oncology and practice management services available to providers and patients,"" McKesson said in a statement.Shares finished 0.45% higher in the stock market today.Vantage, which provides radiation and medical oncology, would bring more than 50 U.S. cancer centers under McKesson's umbrella, the drug distributor said.Biologics, an oncology pharmacy services company, ""will extend McKesson’s oncology expertise across the continuum of care for patients, allowing the company to engage its manufacturer partners in new ways and to enhance its value proposition to providers, patients and payers.""The acquisitions come after McKesson cut its 2016 earnings-per-share guidance last month partly due to weak generic-drug prices.Walgreens Boots Alliance's (WBA) planned purchase of Rite-Aid (RAD) could also threaten McKesson's distribution deal with the latter of those two drugstore chains.Walgreens rose 0.6%.

53,MCK,"McKesson (MCK) on Monday cut its fiscal 2016 earnings-per-share outlook and sees next year's EPS getting hit by 85 cents, citing weak generic-drug prices and ""recent customer consolidation.""The drug distributor's grim forecasts come after Rite Aid (RAD), with which McKesson has a distribution deal, agreed last year to be acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which has a distribution partnership with AmerisourceBergen (ABC). The merger cast into doubt McKesson's long relationship with Rite Aid.For the fiscal year ending March 31, McKesson now expects EPS of $12.60-$12.90, down from an earlier forecast of $12.50-$13.00, saying that its profits will be lower than expected during the second half of the year.

Cardinal Health (CAH), another distributor, fell around 5.5%.Walgreens ended essentially unchanged, while Rite Aid dipped 0.3%. CVS Health (CVS) rose 1.5%.McKesson's headwinds for 2017 also reflect the expiration of its contract with health services company Optum and ""the transition of its contracts with (elder-health company) Omnicare and Target (TGT)."" But McKesson expects its current partnership with Rite Aid to ""continue through the end of fiscal 2017.""The forecasts could signify a considerable misstep for the company, FBR analyst Steven Halper said in a note Monday.""Over the years, MCK has rarely had an operational hiccup such as this in its core pharma segment,"" he wrote. ""It remains to be seen if the issues are temporary or more structural in nature.""The company, which buys drugs, holds them and supplies them to drugstores, said that it was reviewing its administrative cost structure for the fourth quarter. Drug distributors' profits hinge on the difference between the prices that manufacturers charge them to buy the drugs and the prices that they can charge in selling the drugs to retailers.The EPS outlook for 2016 does not include any restructuring that the review may bring, the company said.McKesson reports third-quarter earnings on Jan. 27.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

116,MCK,"Beer pointed to solid generic-drug price increases in fiscal 2015, saying that higher prices were an ""increasingly important factor"" and that this positive trend ""will be the case again in 2016.""
"
117,MCK,"It's too soon to gauge if the current fiscal year will be as strong on that front as last year, he said. But generic prices are still expected to rise amid heightening demand for drugs to treat a wide array of ailments.
"
118,MCK,"On the branded drug front, Beer said, McKesson anticipates steady pricing and volume growth in the year ahead as several drugs, including some that treat hepatitis C with high cure rates, are increasingly prescribed.
"
119,MCK,"Strong prices and volume are both important for drug distributors, which buy medications from manufacturers, store them and then sell them to retail pharmacies and other outlets.
"
120,MCK,"The distributors profit on the spread between the wholesale price charged by the manufacturer and the retail price that pharmacies set in conjunction with insurers.
"
121,MCK,"Even if drug prices taper off, distributors can still generate solid profit margins by selling drugs and other products in high volume.
"
122,MCK,"The majority of McKesson's pharmaceutical distribution business is in North America, but it is pushing for growth internationally. Its 2014 buyout of German drug distributor Celesio helped McKesson grow its sales outside North America by 3% in its latest completed quarter.
"
123,MCK,"""We continue to view McKesson as one of the best-positioned companies in the pharma supply chain and believe generic drug purchasing, Celesio synergies, and capital deployment could drive upside"" to the stock, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill noted in a June research report.
"
124,MCK,"CFO Beer said at the May conference that more buyouts could be in the offing ""if we can find attractive opportunities at sensible prices.""
"
125,MCK,"In a June report, Barclays Capital analyst Eric Percher said that, based on his talks with McKesson management, ""M&A is a clear priority."" Percher suggested that McKesson is most likely to build off of the Celesio deal and make Europe its international priority.
"
126,MCK,"Similarly, Morningstar's Lekraj said that acquisitions — particularly international ones along the lines of Celesio — would give McKesson added ""global purchasing power"" and complement its U.S. distribution operation.

128,MCK,"Sam Pappas, CEO of Mystic Asset Management and a long-time health care industry investor, told IBD that as populations age in developed parts of the world, including Europe, demand for prescription drugs increases.
"
129,MCK,"This is particularly evident in the U.S. with the massive baby boomer generation, he said. That, coupled with more Americans now covered by health insurance in the wake of the ObamaCare rollout, means that more people will not only need medications, but more Americans will be able to afford them.
"
130,MCK,"""The need for health care, including medications, is only going to continue increasing,"" Pappas said.
"
131,MCK,"Roughly 75 million Americans belong to the baby boomer generation born between 1946 and 1964, according to U.S. Census data.
"
132,MCK,"As many of them have moved into retirement, Pappas says, they have shown a propensity to seek out medications early and often to treat ailments caused by aging. They do it to remain active, and it drives up overall demand for prescription drugs.
"
133,MCK,"All of that points to sales growth for prominent prescription-drug distributors such as McKesson, which Lekraj says ""should be one of the better beneficiaries of the trends in health care overall.""With seven straight quarters of double-digit sales growth and five straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth, prescription drug and medical supplies distributor McKesson is in its strongest financial run in years.The company should continue generating robust sales, thanks to a key retail partnership and favorable secular trends in health care, including increasing demand for medications from an aging baby boomer generation.McKesson (MCK), the biggest in a trio of major distributors that dominate the U.S. market, partners with pharmacy chain Rite Aid (RAD) to deliver drugs from manufacturers to consumers at retail outlets and medical centers.Last year the two companies announced a new five-year agreement designed to create drug purchasing and distribution efficiencies. Under that deal, which runs through March 2019, McKesson assumed responsibility for sourcing both branded and generic medications.Top-Line LiftThe agreement helped McKesson post its biggest revenue gain in years during fiscal 2015, which ended in March. The company logged a little more than $179 billion in revenue for the year, up 30% from fiscal 2014.McKesson, along with AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) — which partner with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS), respectively — control roughly fourth-fifths of the U.S. drug distribution market.The Rite Aid partnership provides McKesson massive scale and purchasing power, analysts say. This in turn gives it both sales volume and pricing advantages, enabling it to grow revenue and maintain favorable profit margins.""McKesson is one of the best-positioned firms in the health care industry,"" Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj told IBD. ""They've been a very good performer.""The company also has a partnership with Omnicare (OCR), which provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities. However, Bloomberg News has reported that Omnicare has attracted recent buyout interest from Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) and CVS Health, which could threaten the McKesson relationship.During its fiscal fourth quarter, McKesson's wholesale drug distribution business drove its sales to grow 19% from a year earlier to $44.9 billion. Excluding one-time items, its earnings from continuing operations climbed 15% to $2.94 a share.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 13% this fiscal year and another 15% in fiscal 2017.McKesson's stock price touched a high of 243.61 on May 19 and currently trades near 231. The stock is up more than 10% in 2015.A McKesson spokeswoman said that executives were not available to comment for this article. At a conference in May, Chief Financial Officer James Beer offered a bullish outlook on the fiscal year ahead.""We are calling for continued growth and strength right across the distribution solutions business,"" he said.Beer pointed to solid generic-drug price increases in fiscal 2015, saying that higher prices were an ""increasingly important factor"" and that this positive trend ""will be the case again in 2016.""It's too soon to gauge if the current fiscal year will be as strong on that front as last year, he said.

287,MCK,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 results before the market opens on Jul 18. Last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%. Moreover, Abbott delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 1.99%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayOver the past few quarters, Abbott has been riding high on a healthy growth within its Diabetes Care business. The company has been hogging the limelight for developments in the flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system — FreeStyle Libre System. Per a recent data, the number of Libre users now has reached over 650,000 across the globe, representing an unprecedented level of patient adoption in the industry. This has firmly boosted the company’s top line numbers in the recent quarters.This momentum should continue through the second quarter too, producing impressive results in the period. The company expects to see significant growth contributions from a line of recently launched products across the portfolio. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $460 million for Diabetes Care revenues indicates a surge of 36.9% from the year-ago quarter.In sync with the prior quarter, Abbott is anticipated to gain from strong performance by the Established Pharmaceuticals Division (“EPD”) business, which has been recording operational sales growth over the last few quarters. Management expects sales rise in high single-digit during the second quarter of 2018. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 billion for EPD revenues shows 12.9% increase from the year-earlier period.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteWe are also upbeat about the consistently sturdy Diagnostics business, courtesy of solid contributions from all sub-segments, namely Core Laboratories Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care. Moreover, synergies drawn from the Alere buyout in the form of revenues from Rapid Diagnostics, have been benefiting the company.Additionally, management estimates Rapid Diagnostics to contribute around $2 billion in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Core Laboratory Diagnostic revenues of $1.11 billion depicts an 8.8% gain from the comparable quarter last year.We encouragingly note that Nutrition is Abbott’s fastest-growing business owing to aging population, increasing rate of chronic diseases and the rise of the middle class in the emerging markets. Furthermore, Abbott’s pediatric nutrition business continues to be robust in the United States. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 billion for Nutrition revenues translates into a 6.6% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Favorable currency translation also had a positive impact of 4.2% on the company’s top line in the first-quarter 2018. We are also optimistic about management’s expectation from foreign exchange, which appears to aid results in the to-be-reported quarter, driving revenues by 3.5% in turn.Overall, second-quarter total revenues are projected at $7.26 billion, up 14.5% from the prior-year period.What the Model SuggestsPer the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Abbott has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 71 cents reflects 14.5% growth year over year.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering from the same space as these comprise the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around.ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.97% and is a #1 Ranked stock.

289,MCK,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 26, before the market opens.We expect the company to see steady growth on the back of its international ventures. While this can majorly drive second-quarter results, a raised guidance and strategic collaborations are other tailwinds.In the last reported quarter, Baxter posted adjusted earnings per share of 70 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.9% and improved from the year-ago quarter’s 58 cents.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.85 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 9.2%.

Price and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. QuoteStrong International Presence Likely to Drive ResultsBaxter has a strong presence in foreign markets which helps the company gain traction.In the last reported quarter, the company’s international sales accounted for an impressive 46.3% of total revenues.Baxter’s advanced surgery team recently launched TISSEEL Prima in Europe. Furthermore, in Japan, the company’s renal care team launched the KAGUYA peritoneal dialysis technology.In the last reported quarter, Baxter saw higher volumes of shipments of IV solutions from Mexico to the United States. The company looks forward to reallocating additional IV solutions from select South America manufacturing facilities. Per management, this will help revamp production processes at manufacturing facilities in both the United States and Puerto Rico.Other Factors at PlayRaised GuidanceBaxter has raised its guidance for 2018.The company expects sales growth of 5% at constant currency (cc). It projects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.85-$2.93 for the full year.

Notably, the company bought RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt.Though the buyout did not prove accretive in the last reported quarter, management expects the deal to be modestly rewarding in 2018.From the acquisition of Claris Injectables Limited, Baxter expects revenues worth $145 million in 2018.Lately, Baxter announced a partnership with International Society of Nephrology (ISN) to spread awareness on chronic kidney disease awareness and its therapy in emerging markets. This reflects Baxter’s focus on specializing in renal care.Cyclophosphamide CompetitionCyclophosphamide is part of Baxter's Hospital Products segment, which has been underperforming over the last five years. For 2018, Baxter expects U.S. cyclophosphamide sales of around $120 million, up from the previous guidance of $95 million. However, the guided figure is much lower than $185 million in 2017.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not predict an earnings beat for Baxter this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

290,MCK,"McKesson Corporation’s (MCK  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings are scheduled to release on Jul 26, before the market opens. While the quarterly results are likely to drive growth at the core Distribution Solutions segment, its strategic initiatives might boost the bottom line.However, McKesson’s performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 lacked luster, with adjusted earnings of $3.49 per share missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues came in at $51.63 billion, slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $51.64 billion but increased 4% at constant currency (cc).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues stands at $53 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.9%. The same for earnings is pegged at $2.78, mirroring a year-over-year improvement of 13%.Notably, McKesson has delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 5.2% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s delve deeper.McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McKesson Corporation QuoteDistribution Solutions to Drive RevenuesDistribution Solutionsis one of McKesson’s key segments, which is engaged in the distribution of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs along with other healthcare-related products.In the last reported quarter, the segment was the sole contributor to the company’s worldwide revenues. Total sales from the segment totaled $51.63 billion, up 5% at cc. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter revenues is pegged at $52.37 billion, reflecting a 1.9% rise from the prior-year quarter.Coming to the geographical analysis of Distribution Solutions, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues stands at $44.09 billion, up 2.5% from the year-ago quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, revenues from North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services summed $42.73 billion, up 5.1% from a year ago.Strong Player in the Distribution MarketMcKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. Despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation, the company’s distribution solutions segment has consistently performed well in fiscal 2018. We expect the trend to continue in the quarter to be reported as well.Notably, this Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses. It stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics driven by several patent expirations in the next few years, and an aging population.At the end of fiscal 2018, revenues at this unit grew significantly and contributed to the company’s total revenues. This upside was driven by increase in market share and strategic acquisitions.Upbeat View/GuidanceMcKesson declared preliminary results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in June. The company projects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.85-$2.95 in the quarter to be reported.Furthermore, the company reaffirmed its fiscal 2019 guidance. McKesson expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the $13.00-$13.80 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $13.33, which lies within the guidance. Per management, the fiscal 2019 outlook represents mid- to high-single digit percentage growth year over year, indicating stable market conditions.Free cash flow is expected at around $3 billion.

291,MCK,"Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2018 results are scheduled for release on Jul 24, after market close. The company’s acquisition-driven strategy is expected to boost growth by expanding product offerings across all segments.We expect the company to witness steady growth in sales from Orthopaedic Implant — one of its major revenue-generating components. While this is projected to drive second-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments, especially MedSurg, will help the company drive impressive results.Notably, in the last reported quarter, Stryker posted earnings of $1.68, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5%.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.32 billion, reflecting a rise of 10.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at $1.73, indicating a year-over-year increase of 13.1%.Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Stryker Corporation QuoteOrthopaedic Implant in FocusOrthopaedic Implant contributed 37.7% to net revenues in the last reported quarter. In the last reported quarter, revenues at the segment were up 5% organically. The upside can be attributed to a significant year-over-year increase in Mako robot installations. The coveted Mako platform also recorded strong performances in Japan, South Pacific and Canada. Globally, Stryker installed 28 Mako robots, of which 24 were in the United States.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orthopaedic Implant for the quarter to be reported is at $1.23 billion, reflecting a rise of 8.1% year over year.Other Factors at PlayMedSurg Unit to Drive GrowthMedSurg Equipment products include surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.In the last reported quarter, the segment accounted for 44.1% of the company’s net sales. Revenues in the segment grew 9.1% at constant currency (cc) to $1.43 billion.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MedSurg equipment revenues is pegged at $1.48 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.4%.Domestic & International RevenuesStryker is well balanced on its high domestic and international revenues.In the last reported quarter, domestic revenues accounted for a significant 71.3% of net sales. Meanwhile, international sales accounted for 28.6% of total revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stryker’s domestic sales is pinned at $2.39 billion, up 8.7% year over year. The same for international revenues stands at $920 million, up 13.4% year over year.AcquisitionsStryker completed the buyout of Entellus Medical for $662 million. Entellus is integrated within Stryker’s core Neurotechnology & Spine segment. This will enable physicians to conveniently perform a broad range of ENT procedures. However, the acquisition is expected be dilutive initially to Stryker’s 2018 adjusted earnings per share by approximately 4 cents. This is likely to affect the top line in the quarter to be reported. (Read More: Stryker Closes Entellus Buyout, Bolsters Neurotechnology Line)Stryker was lately in news for making an offer to take over Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report). However, no further terms of the deal have been revealed by Stryker.

292,MCK,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, McKesson has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.0. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, McKesson’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that McKesson has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for McKesson stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, McKesson has a P/S ratio of about 0.1. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, MCK is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, McKesson currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes McKesson a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for McKesson is just 1.3, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.8. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 4.8, which is far better than the industry average of 17.0. Clearly, MCK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though McKesson might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A. This gives MCK a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current fiscal quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen five upward and four downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2.5% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has inched lower by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus  McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus | McKesson Corporation QuoteThis somewhat negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.  Bottom LineMcKesson is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 21% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock.However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

293,MCK,"Putting an end to speculations, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has finally stepped into the high-potential pharmaceutical industry. In line with this, the online retail behemoth recently announced a definitive acquisition agreement with PillPack. Although the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, a few market experts estimate the value of the transaction at $1 billion.This news was heavily cheered by investors, sending Amazon’s share price 2.5% higher on the day of the announcement.Does Amazon’s Entry Spell Doom for Pharmacies?Although Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy business was well speculated, it still came as a shocker for industry bigwigs. Let’s take a closer look at the reactions of some of the behemoths.Amazon.com, Inc. Price  Amazon.com, Inc. Price | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBeginning with, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), which has been basking in the glory of being added as the youngest member to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, saw a 9.9% decline in stock price on the day of the buyout announcement. The company also saw a rating downgrade by a number of analysts.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteThe stocks of other big retailers like Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) also slipped around 11.1% and 6.1% on the same day.CVS Health Corporation Price  CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuotePer reports, three of these bigwigs collectively lost about $12.8 billion in market value on the day.Rite Aid Corporation Price  Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteMajor drug distributors like Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) also panicked, with stocks falling a respective 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.1%.How Rational is the Deal for Amazon?In an era where brick and mortar set ups are being challenged by online sellers, though Amazon’s entry into the prescription drug industry is welcome news for consumers, it is also fraught with challenges.Coming back to the buyout, PillPack is an online pharmacy that pre-sorts medications into different doses and handles both refills and renewals. It also holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states and has URAC and VIPPS accreditation. It is an in-network pharmacy with most pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) along with major Medicare Part D plans.Per an article on STAT, the integration of PillPack will help Amazon become a major player in the $370-billion drug business.Some analysts believe that with PillPack, which is working with Medicare plans, Amazon will be able to see an increase in its Amazon Prime membership of the rapidly-growing age group of 65 and above. There are high chances that 100 million Prime subscribers with Amazon will choose the company for their prescription drug needs.However, the deal has come with its own set of challenges. Per an article published on PYMNTS.com, PillPack sources products from AmerisourceBergen and Walgreens Boots. Further, per the same article,  there were rumors in the recent past about Walgreens Boots’ plans to buy AmerisourceBergen, which might pit Walgreens Boots against Amazon in the space.PillPack’s in-network membership with Express Scripts is also subject to renewal at the end of July. It is being speculated that if Amazon appears to be a formidable threat to the PBMs they might start refraining from renewing the in-network memberships in future (per an article published on PYMNTS.com). With regard to this, Amazon had to let go of its 40% stake in Drugstore.com as PBMs denied to include Drugstore.com in their networks. This  eventually resulted in Drugstore.com exiting the prescription business (per an article published on AXIOS).How Bad is the News for Pharmaceutical Giants? ""You've got to keep reinventing. You'll have new competitors. You'll have new customers all around you.""Nothing could more aptly sum up this situation than this remark by Ginni Rometty, IBM CEO. The incumbent players in the drugstore industry don’t seem to be in a mood to give up and lose their turf. To counter competition, CVS Health, Walgreens Boots and others have started to add more digital and customer-friendly programs. These companies have incorporated mail order pharmacy models to their stores with same day/one day to two days delivery programs.Further, CVS Health’s deal with United States’ third-largest health insurance company, Aetna, will fortify its position in the industry.In a bid to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs, Walgreens Boots has tied up with Express Scripts and has announced plans to expand existing group purchasing efforts. Per reports, Walgreens Boots is also collaborating with a number of healthcare businesses, including health insurers like Humana and UnitedHealth Group.The company is also partnering with lab testing provider Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings to expand the range of health services at its stores.Further, some analysts believe those preferring cash payments are expected to opt more for Amazon’s pharmacy services. The percentage of this population is quite nominal. Moreover, patients with the need for immediate drugs will approach stores over waiting for online delivery.Considering these factors, major analysts believe there is enough scope left for these behemoths to maintain a competitive edge in the space.Summing UpAmazon’s entry has definitely created an upheaval in the prescription drug industry with major players struggling to keep afloat. However, in business, bankable human resource and strong financial position matter the most. And Amazon has an adequate amount of of both. So, the following quote from Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, Reuters suitably sums up the current scenario — “Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space.”Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Recently, the company has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Medical Specialities Distributors for $800 million. The deal is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2019. Management expects the deal to expand the company’s manufacturer value proposition in specialty capabilities.However, the company distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price fluctuations. The Distribution Solutions segment had experienced weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends, which continue to persist. Continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs, significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches can have a material adverse impact on McKesson’s prospects.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMcKesson has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has an expected earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the current quarter.

301,MCK,"Patterson Companies, Inc.’s (PDCO  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results are expected to release on May 24, before the market opens. While results are likely to show a decline in the core Dental segment, growth across other segments is likely to make up to some extent.The third quarter of fiscal 2018 was a dismal one, with adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share declining 25.9% year over year. Moreover, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents. Patterson recorded revenues of $1.375 billion, which also fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.382 billion.

Price and EPS Surprise  Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Patterson Companies, Inc. QuoteDental Segment in FocusIn the last reported quarter, this segment accounted for 42% of total sales. Revenues in the segment came in at $577.9 million in the quarter, down 8.1% at constant currency (cc). Revenues were marred by changes in sales force, disruptions from enterprise resource planning implementation and the expansion of the company’s digital equipment portfolio.Moreover, for the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $574 million, which shows a decline of 5.4% on a year-over-year basis.Dental Consumables accounted for 22% of the total revenues in the last reported quarter.

The ongoing ERP transition has proven to be disruptive to performance and is likely to pose challenges in the days ahead. In the last reported quarter, ERP issues have dented margins, leading to gross margin contraction of 200 basis points (bps).Moreover, the Dental segment’s sales were affected by the company’s expanding digital equipment portfolio. Per management, the company’s working capital continues to be impacted negatively by the implementation of the ERP system.The company is also grappling with certain legislative issues. We believe these headwinds will mar Patterson’s results in the quarter to be reported.Animal Health SegmentPer management, though Patterson’s core Animal Health segment faced product mix-related challenges in the last reported quarter, it represented 58% of total sales. Furthermore, sales rose 4.2% at cc on a year-over-year basis to $794.9 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $847 million, up 6.5% sequentially.

302,MCK,"President Donald Trump on Friday unveiled his plans of lowering drug prices, in keeping with promises he made in the run-up to the Presidential elections. Pharmaceutical companies and the broader industry had been anticipating that Trump would come down heavily on them, as he had long criticized drugmakers of “getting away with murder” by charging way too much for their products. However, these fears were dispelled as Trump’s proposal will actually not directly hamper the profitability of drug companies. Instead, the reforms are aimed at increasing competition for medicines, cutting list prices and reducing patients’ out-of-pocket costs. This pleasant surprise gave stocks of pharmaceutical companies a boost.Long-Standing CommittmentLowering drug prices was one of Trump’s presidential campaign promises. He had committed to take on the big drug companies, which was also supported by Trump’s Democrat opponent Hillary Clinton. Since then, Trump has time and again criticized drug manufactures and pharmaceutical companies for charging too much for their products. This had kept the pharmaceutical companies reeling under pressure for quite some time, as they had feared that Trump’s pharma plan could hurt their profits. The broader pharma sector SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals (XPH) has declined 6.3% year to date. And the industry had feared further losses, apprehending harsh measures from Trump on Friday.Raising Competition on the AnvilThe twist in the tale came when Trump stressed on increasing competition for medicines. This was one of the highpoints of his speech on Friday. Framing his plan as the “most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people” and describing it as “American Patients First,” he laid out a policy that intends to increase pharmaceutical competition and the power of negotiations while lowering patients’ out-of-pocket costs. Trump’s policy also aims at creating incentives to lower list prices of prescription drugs. The reforms certainly are a ray of hope for American patients for whom the rising cost of healthcare is a nagging concern. The American Patients First plan will have both immediate actions as well as future opportunities for both lowering out-of-pocket costs faced by patients and reducing drug prices. Interestingly, Trump refrained from raising direct Medicare price negotiations on Friday, although this was one of his agendas during his presidential campaign.Pharma Stocks Rally on Trump’s ReformsClearly, Trump’s American Patients First plan doesn’t seem to be a threat to pharmaceutical companies and their profits. In fact, it is very much in line with the financial interest of drugmakers and health insurers and will no way hamper their profits. These fears, which had often resulted in shares of pharma companies taking a hit in the last few months, finally saw them bouncing back on Friday. Although the sector declined initially on Friday, stocks started rallying by the time Trump had finished his speech. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) increased 6.2%. Also, shares of CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) were up3.2%, 2.8%,1.3% and 0.3%, respectively. Merck & Co has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump Spares DrugmakersThe biggest reason behind this rally is that Trump’s plan actually doesn’t hurt U.S. pharmaceutical companies at all. In fact, the administration keeps in place, and in a few cases, extends the role of drug middlemen, who have been often been blamed for spiking drug costs. Trump’s plan calls for drug companies to display prices in ads and restrict “gag clauses” for pharmacists. This proposal comes because some pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) have contracts that donot allow pharmacists from letting patients know if a drug on the cash counter would be cheaper than if it was purchased usingtheir insurance.However, Trump’splan gives the companies new powers in Medicare Part D, the U.S. program under which seniors get drug coverage. This would allow Medicare to change the list of covered drugs midyear in order to push back against price hikes of some generic drugsthat donot actually have so much competition. This led to shares of healthcare service companies like McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) rising 2%, 1.8%, 1.4% and 1%, respectively.Summing UpTrump’s American Patients First, which comes with a set of reforms, had sparked fears among pharmaceutical companies for quite some time. However, the fears seem to have subsided somewhat, as the new plan doesn’t hurt drugmakers and their profits. This saw investors’ confidence finally getting reinstated and pharma and biotech stocks rallying.   5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

303,MCK,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, McKesson has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.9. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, McKesson’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having fallen over the past few months. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 18.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that McKesson has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 11.2, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for McKesson stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, McKesson has a P/S ratio of about 0.1. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, MCK is almost in line with the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, McKesson currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes McKesson a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for McKesson is 1.4, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.8. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.0, which is far better than the industry average of 12.4. Clearly, MCK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though McKesson might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C. This gives MCK a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current fiscal quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen nine upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2.5% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has risen by 3.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus  McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus | McKesson Corporation QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineMcKesson is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among the bottom 17%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, its industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Price and Consensus  Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. Price and Consensus | Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. Quote Segmental AnalysisSoftware Delivery, Support and Maintenance RevenuesThis segment comprises software, hardware, subscription, other transactions, support and maintenance revenues. Revenues in the segment increased 17.1% to $328.7 million year over year.Client Services RevenuesThis segment takes care of recurring managed services and other project-based client services. Client service revenues were up 30.3% on a year-over-year basis to $188.6 million.Recurring & Non-Recurring BaseRecurring RevenuesRecurring revenues cover subscriptions, recurring transactions, support and maintenance and recurring managed services.

Margins contracted 20 basis points (bps). However, management at Allscripts estimates gross margins to improve in 2018 on the back of the synergies from the recent Enterprise Information Solutions acquisition.Software gross margin, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 50 bps on a year-over-year basis.Client service margin in the fourth quarter came in at 16.7% of net revenues, compared to 14.8% in the same period last year.Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter totaled $186 million, up 27% year over year, thanks to the acquisition of the Enterprise Information Solutions business from McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report).Selling, general & administrative expenses increased 15% to $114 million and research and development expenses rose 50% to $105 million on a year-over-year basis.2018 OutlookFor 2018, Allscripts expects adjusted revenues of in the range of $2.15 billion and $2.25 billion, up 17% to 22% on a year-over-year basis.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings for 2018 is currently pinned at 77 cents per share.                             Bottom LineAllscripts’ solid outlook for 2018 instills investor optimism. Further, the recently-completed acquisition of Practice Fusion, a cloud-based electronic health record, aimed primarily at small, independent physician practices, is likely to drive the company’s inorganic growth. This transaction gave Allscripts the largest US market share in outpatient settings.Further, the company has entered into an agreement to divest its One Content business to Hyland Software.The company’s solid growth in U.S. Core Solutions and Services holds promise at the moment. Allscripts Sunrise electronic health record platform and Revenue Cycle Management Services are likely to drive the company’s top line in the quarters to come.However, the company’s continued reliance on mergers and acquisition activities poses substantial integration risks. Intensifying competition is a major dampener. The company’s products have a long sales-cycle, which involves intensive decision-making at different managerial levels. Allscripts also expects a modest increase in operating expenses to support business growth over the long haul.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAllscripts has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

309,MCK,"With the second-quarter earnings season gaining momentum, the broader picture no longer looks as bright as it was expected to be. Putting together all the 128 S&P 500 members’ released results as of Jul 25, constituting 36% of the index’s total membership, we note that earnings growth pace is less than the last quarter. However, it is more or less in line with the trailing four-quarter average earnings growth and exceeds the trailing 12-quarter average.Per the latest second-quarter scorecard, total earnings increased 7% year over year on 4.2% higher revenues. While earnings beat ratio remains at 77.3%, revenue beat ratio is at 70.3%. (For more information, please consult our Zacks Earnings Analysis).What’s in Store for the Medical Space?Investors are concerned about the healthcare space, a sector that has been seen through a lot of struggle during the past half year, thanks to the political power change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle.While yesterday, it was finally President Donald Trump’s win with the Republican healthcare bill passing one more barrier by a very narrow margin, investors are however not much optimistic about this development. Per a Vox article today, in its effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, “President Donald Trump continues to make bold promises about what that bill would do — promises that all available analysis suggests the bill will not keep”.While there are still chances that the Senate will amend the latest bill, its extent still remains unclear. Accordingly, uncertainty within the medical space is towering high. Investors are currently adopting a wait-and-see policy about this space.Let’s sneak a peek into the performance of five major Medical – Products companies within the broader Medical space expected on Jul 27.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report): We are upbeat about Align Technology’s execution of strategic initiatives like international expansion, which ensured Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. In this context, the company strengthened its foothold internationally by acquiring the Invisalign distributors in the highly lucrative Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region as well as Brazil in February. This is likely to drive the company’s results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Align is expected to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +2.74%. We note that, while a positive Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP.

Quote Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): We believe, this medical device major’s second-quarter performance will be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. On the other hand, the company’s downbeat interventional cardiology business may get some sort of a boost with the company’s $435 million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA.Boston Scientific is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

Cerner announced that it has been chosen by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to develop an electronic health record (EHR) system. Department of Veterans Affairs will use the same system the company is developing for the U.S. Department of Defense, which began its operation at its first site in February. This system will facilitate the exchange of data between military care facilities and civilian health providers, where current and former service members receive care.This leading healthcare information technology (HCIT) company is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes.

Notably, this indicates a rise of 6.5%-9.4% on a year-over-year basis. We believe that the growing adoption of MAKO robots will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market. Additionally, Stryker is well poised on the acquisitions of both Sage and Physio-Control in the past.The company also expects to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell.

Also, in the last four quarters, McKesson earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate at an average of 3.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that McKesson is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  McKesson has an Earnings ESP of +2.15% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.85 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $2.79. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: McKesson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of McKesson’s Zacks Rank #3 and +2.15% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market.

The company’s distribution solutions segment performed favorably in fiscal 2017 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. Also, McKesson expects earnings per share in the range of $11.75 to $12.45 for fiscal 2018. Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to increase mid-single digits year over year. Keeping in mind the last quarter performance and promising guidance, we expect a similar trend in the yet-to-be reported quarter.McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McKesson Corporation QuoteFurthermore, McKesson is likely to benefit from the acquisition of CoverMyMeds LLC in the quarter to be reported. In this regard, we note that the acquisition was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.In the international segment, management expects percentage revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in 2018.  Per management, international business is likely to be impacted by additional U.K. reimbursement cuts although the incremental cuts that will impact fiscal 2018 are significantly smaller than those in fiscal 2017.However, continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs, significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches might have an adverse impact on McKesson. Also, a competitive landscape adds to the woes.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

311,MCK,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 earnings performance before the opening bell on Jul 24.Last reported quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the metric outperformed the consensus mark in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.41%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn a positive note, Quest Diagnostics seems well-aligned with its growth agenda to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Per its new long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017), revenue increase for the period 2017-2020 is expected to be 3-5% with 1-2% growth projected from acquisitions. Earnings for the period are anticipated to rise faster than the top line in the mid-to-high single digit range.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteThe company estimates revenue growth for the period 2017-2020 at 3-5%.  Per the company, its increasing number of partnerships with other health care leaders and strategic acquisitions is creating promising opportunities for the top and bottom-line growth while improving the patient experience and reducing the overall cost of care.In first-quarter 2018, the company satisfied all five elements of the above-mentioned growth agenda and strongly expects to continue with the momentum going forward.Going by the first element of the growth strategy to inch up 1-2% through strategically accretive acquisitions, the company achieved this upside for the fifth consecutive year in 2017.In this regard, the recent buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service MedXM should fortify Quest Diagnostics’ mobile provider capabilities and population health management solutions for health plans. This transaction should further garner favorable results in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Accounting for the second element of the growth strategy — to expand relationships with hospital health systems — in April, Quest Diagnostics along with four other leading health care organizations, namely– Humana, MultiPlan and UnitedHealth Group’s Optum and UnitedHealthcare launched a pilot program applying blockchain technology to improve data quality and reduce administrative costs associated with changes to health care provider demographic data.In March, the company entered into a professional lab services agreement with an integrated healthcare delivery system in New England.Considering the third element of the company’s growth strategy that offers the broadest access to diagnostic innovation, key growth drivers in the second quarter were prescription drug monitoring, QuantiFERON and non-invasive prenatal screening. We are also optimistic about the company’s successful execution of its strategy to build an esoteric testing business as well as boost profitability.About the fourth element of the growth strategy, which is to act as the provider of choice for consumers, the company’s relationship with Walmart has already started to add value with higher patient traffic and this positivity is expected to soon find reflections in its second-quarter earnings performance. The Walmart locations are helping Quest Diagnostics expand into different markets and the company expects to open many more locations throughout the ongoing year.The fifth element of Quest Diagnostics’ growth strategy is to support population health within analytics and extended care services. According to the company, the inclusion of MedXM is allowing it to close gaps between patients and healthcare professionals.We expect these active growth drivers to replicate the company’s success story in its upcoming quarterly results. Also, the performance is likely to drive the same primary metrics like the preceding quarter.We strongly believe all these recent developments to have significantly contributed to the company’s top line in the second quarter.The company expects 2018 revenues in the range of $7.7-$7.77 billion (annualized growth of 4-5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $7.68 billion, slightly below the company’s projected band. Excluding the impact of special items, amortization expense and ETB (excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation), adjusted EPS for the full year is projected to be $6.50-$6.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.61 falls within this guided range.On the flip side, after a persistently dull phasefor several quarters in the company’s revenue per requisition performance, the last three quarters saw a slim rebound. However, it still remains to be seen if this upside is here to stay or not.The company’s two Professional Lab Services engagements — WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) — also carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.Further, we should take into consideration the unrelenting headwind of unit price, which was moderately down in less than 100 basis points. Excluding the effect of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), the company expects unit price headwinds in 2018 to remain below 100 basis points with PAMA adding an extra headwind of approximately 50 basis points to it. This should also get highlighted in the impending quarterly results.Overall, we believe that dearth of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives will continuously dent the company’s volumes (measured by the number of requisitions) till the economy recovers.What Our Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +1.33%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this to-be-reported quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.97% and a Zacks Rank of 1.

312,MCK,"Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT  -  Free Report) Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business has been recording operational sales growth in the last few quarters. We expect this strength to further get reflected in second-quarter 2018 results, scheduled for release on Jul 18.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q2 performance is likely to pan out.Key CatalystsThe EPD business majorly focuses on the emerging markets wherein key areas include India, Russia, China and numerous regions in Latin America as well as Brazil alongside other countries. Sales in the key emerging markets increased 6.8% organically, driven by double-digit growth in India, China and Brazil in the last reported quarter.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuotePer the company, key emerging markets represent the most attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbott's branded generics product portfolio. Management believes that these markets will continue to offer immense opportunities with favorable demographics.  Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $903 million for EPD revenues from the key emerging markets indicates a 13.1% rise from the year-ago quarter’s tally.Favorable currency translation also left a positive impact of 3.1% on EPD revenues in the first quarter of 2018. Moreover, it is encouraging to note that management expects foreign exchange to continue acting as a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter.However, management seems concerned about the decelerating revenue growth rate of EPD in Russia due to a temporary disruption in distribution channel dynamics based on certain distributors’ consolidations. Per the company, this should continue through the second quarter too.Also, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports, has raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move might affect their sales performance in China in the near term.Overall, we are upbeat about management’s anticipation of double-digit organic growth in EPD sales during the second quarter. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPD revenues of $1.15 billion shows a 12.9% increase from the prior-year period.In EPD, Abbott’s consistent focus on enhancing local capabilities and expanding product portfolio within core therapeutic areas is aimed at specifically addressing local market needs. These efforts from the company also continue to consolidate its leadership position in the EPD markets. Abbott’s sale of developed market businesses along with acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia has contributed to its EPD business.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here are a few medical stocks worth considering from the same space as these comprise the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:ResMed Inc.

314,MCK,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is gaining momentum with 133 S&P 500 participants having already released financial numbers as of Jan 26. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the reporting cycle was off to an encouraging start with above-average proportion of companies edging past the top and bottom-line expectations.Total earnings for these members have improved 11.6% on 6% increase in revenues.With results of roughly 121 members slated to be announced this week, per the Zacks data, estimates for the period are gradually trending upward across the board for nine of the 16 Zacks sectors. The Medical as one in the bracket, is expected to witness a 2.1% earnings rise in the fourth quarter on 2% revenue growth projection.What’s in Store for Medical Device Industry?The medical device space within the broader Medical sector somewhat displays a mixed bag of sorts. As part of the tax overhaul, corporate tax rates have been slashed down to 21% from the previous 35%, thus lending a huge relief to the MedTech mammoths.However, ahead of the industry’s fourth-quarter earnings release, a section of analysts expect this new tax law to negatively impact the industry due to a possible cut in overall Medicare spending, if certain criteria are not fulfilled by a specific date. The Congressional Budget Office apprehends that in absence of any alternative to meet the fiscal deficit from the huge tax reduction, automatic cut backs worth $136 billion including $25 billion in Medicare cuts from the mandatory budget of spending in 2018, could be triggered.Amid tax reform related concerns, the news of Congress delaying the medical device tax for another two years came as a huge boost to industry players and investors. This 2.3% tax was earlier delayed by Congress in 2015 for a couple of years. The deferral will once again largely propel R&D activities within this space.Let’s take a sneak peek at the performance of five major medical device companies, waiting to report earnings on Feb 1.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): We are optimistic about the company’s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology, led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams, globally. More specifically, The WATCHMAN platform is expected to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientific’s multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth.The company has a positive Earnings ESP of +1.07% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While a favorable Zacks ESP indicates a likely positive surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  (Read More: Will WATCHMAN Boost Boston Scientific's Q4 Earnings?)Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteBaxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report): In the fourth quarter of 2017, Baxter International is anticipated to gain from strong Hospital Products, driven by solid sales in the U.S. Fluid Systems business as well as robust demand for injectable pharmaceuticals. Within the Hospital Products segment, we expect Fluid Systems to maintain the momentum, evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $634 million for the to-be-reported quarter, which reflects a 3.3% improvement from the year-ago period.Banking on solid prospects, our quantitative model also shows a beat for the company, given the combination of a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.28%.

Also McKesson Specialty Health unit is likely to drive the company’s top line in the same time frame. The unit is likely to benefit from the closing of the intraFUSION acquisition and the recent BDI Pharma buyout.We are unable to conclude whether McKesson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of -0.66%. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

315,MCK,"The latest Earnings Preview depicts a bullish run in the ongoing reporting cycle. Till Oct 20, 87 S&P 500 members (24.7% of the total market cap) reported their numbers. Total earnings for these members have gone up 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues.However, investors are concerned about the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) that saw a lot of struggle during the first nine months of the year, thanks to the political change and the ongoing policy-restructuring related battle.The ensuing lack of visibility has roiled the favorable trend that this sector maintained in the trailing few quarters. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate stands at a mere 2.2% on a 4.8% revenue-growth projection. In comparison, the second-quarter earnings growth was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.What’s in Store for the Medical Product Space?While twists and turns continue to unfold at Capitol Hill, the scenario within the Medical - Products space, an important part of the medical device subcategory within the broader Medical sector, is getting gloomier. The latest executive order released by the Republicans points to a shrinking customer base, indicating a cut in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices. This may lead to major supply/demand disequilibrium within this space.However, major medical device players have been pinning hopes on the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though its elimination is far from reality.Considering these tax issues, investors interested in the Medical Product space eagerly await earnings reports of MedTech bigwigs throughout this week. Let’s take a look at the major Medical products stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Oct 26:Per our quantitative model, when stocks with a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) are combined with a positive Earnings ESP, then chances of beating estimates are always high.

The company while gaining a fair share in a few cardiovascular segments and DES (Drug Eluting Stent), continues to build momentum worldwide.However, ahead of this earnings release, the quarter’s IC business is likely to be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. While the downbeat IC business tangled under product recall issue will possibly gain some boost from the company’s recent $435 million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, a full recovery may take time. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter IC revenues is currently pegged at $580 million, lower than the sequentially last quarter’s reported number of $603 million.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 0.84% in the trailing four quarters.

(RMD  -  Free Report): This renowned worldwide provider of generators, masks and related accessories for the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is expected to gain in its first-quarter fiscal 2018 from strong performances on the domestic and international fronts. The company’s revenues in the domestic domain were driven by solid growth in devices as well as low double-digit software sales growth in the previous quarter. Internationally, the company’s receipt of French reimbursement approval for telemonitoring buoys optimism.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for domestic revenues (including the contributions from Brightree) of $334 million reflects an increase of 10.9% from the year-ago quarter.

(ALGN  -  Free Report): We are upbeat about Align Technology’s strategic initiatives like international expansion, ensuring Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. Also, the last quarter’s huge increase in international teen cases by 40.5% year over year encourages the investors. This figure reflects a rise in demand. In the quarter to be reported, the company reached a new benchmark of 1 million teen patients who had adopted the Invisalign treatment.Management also anticipates consistent growth in the Asia-Pacific region.

While this could primarily drive third-quarter earnings, an expected improvement in revenues at all other segments should also help the company generate solid results this season.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for systems sales stands at $337 million for the third quarter. This reflects a rally of almost 12% from the year-ago quarter. Growth across acute and ambulatory EHR plus sales of Population Health and Revenue Cycle solutions and services hold promise for Cerner.Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cerner Corporation Quote Last quarter, management at Cerner announced that the company expects 3-4% growth within the Support, Maintenance & Services segment for the remaining year.

317,MCK,"McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), one of the largest healthcare service providers, is scheduled to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 26.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $2.46 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81. Also, in the last four quarters, McKesson's earnings missed the same at an average of 0.46%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that McKesson is likely to beat on earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: McKesson has an Earnings ESP of +0.72% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.80, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $2.78. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: McKesson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of McKesson’s Zacks Rank #3 and ESP of +2.15% makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McKesson Corporation QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. Management expects to gain from a gradually stabilizing generic and branded market. The company’s distribution solutions segment performed favorably in recent times despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. Also, McKesson projects earnings per share in the range of $11.80-$12.50 for fiscal 2018. Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to increase in mid-single digits year over year. Considering the company’s performance in the last quarter and promising guidance, we expect a similar trend in the yet-to-be reported quarter as well. Furthermore, McKesson is likely to benefit from the recent acquisition of CoverMyMeds LLC.In the international segment, management expects percentage revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in 2018. Per management, international business is likely to be impacted by additional U.K. reimbursement cuts although the incremental cuts that will impact fiscal 2018 are significantly smaller than those in fiscal 2017.However, continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs, significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches might have an adverse impact on McKesson. Also, a competitive landscape adds to the woes.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:INC Research Holdings, Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +2.02% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Medpace Holdings Inc (MEDP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.47% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.Henry Schein, Inc (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.23% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

318,MCK,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, McKessonhas a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.49. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, McKesson’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that McKesson has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for McKesson stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, McKesson has a P/S ratio of about 0.2. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, MCK is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, McKesson currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes McKesson a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for McKesson is just 1.6, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2.2x. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate.What About the Stock Overall?Though McKesson might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B. This gives MCK a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been favorable. The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has seen five up and three down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched upper by 0.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus  McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus | McKesson Corporation QuoteNotably, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineMcKesson is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 29% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

The unit is likely to benefit from the closing of the intraFUSION acquisition and the recent BDI Pharma buyout.The company expects to witness solid performance in its Canadian business in the third quarter. Last quarter, McKesson Canada closed the Uniprix banner acquisition and strengthened independent pharmacies. Per management, Uniprix integration activities are progressing well.Further, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business continues to make progress on the CoverMyMeds integration.Coming to the Technology Solutions segment, the company divested its Enterprise Information Solutions or EIS business, recently. This marks another important step in the strategic shift to realign the company’s business focus on Distribution Solutions, following the creation of Change Healthcare earlier this year.McKesson’s strong guidance for fiscal 2018 looks encouraging. The upside is expected to be driven by market growth, acquisitions and divestitures. McKesson expects GAAP earnings per share in the range of $4.80-$6.90 for the fiscal year ending Mar 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings for the same are expected in the range of $11.80-$12.50.Recently, McKesson announced that it has entered into an agreement to buy RxCrossroads from CVS Health for $735 million.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #1.

321,MCK,"Shares of CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) rose 2.64% in the last trading session to close at $75.13, following the company’s announcement of a promising 2018 earnings outlook.Per management, banking on solid growth in scripts and claims, increasing purchasing power due to the Red Oak venture, and rising net benefits from the company's reorganization initiative, CVS Health expects to witness net revenue growth in the range of 0.75-2.5% for full-year 2018. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $192.07 billion, which signifies growth of 4.4% year over year.Segment Wise OutlookCVS Health has also been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that the company is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share in 2018 and beyond. Notably, it has been expanding partnerships with PBMs and health plans, and increasing participation as a preferred pharmacy in a larger number of Medicare Part D networks. Thus, for 2018, the company projects revenue growth in the range of 2.5-4% in this space, led by growth of 6-7% in the same store script. Moreover, CVS Health estimates same store sales to vary in the range of 2-3.5%.CVS Health expects to witness revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% in the Pharmacy Services segment with growth of roughly 8%. However, management of rebates for Aetna’s Medicare Part D business, a projected rise in generic specialty introductions, prevalent pricing pressures and decreased levels of brand inflation are expected to adversely impact this segment in 2018.2018 Operating Profit ForecastThis leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care expects adjusted consolidated operating profit growth in the band of 1-4% in 2018. Notably, the company expects to record low-single digit adjusted operating profit growth in Retail/ Long Term Care (LTC) segment, along with a low- to mid-single digit growth in the Pharmacy Services business.However, the operating profit growth in 2018 might be adversely impacted by around 125 basis points (bps) due to the costs associated with the following two deals inked by the company of late —To begin with, the company’s divestiture of the provider of tailored services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers — RxCrossroads — to McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) for a cash deal valued around $735 million. Secondly, the company recently inked a five-year agreement with Anthem, Inc. to provide services, including claims processing and prescription fulfillment to support IngenioRx, a new PBM. Notably, the agreement will be implemented on Jan 1, 2020, and will run through Dec 31, 2024.However, this guidance assumes the company’s major Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) acquisition deal to close at the end of 2018 instead of the second half, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. Thus, all the takeover-related expenses will not be included in the company's adjusted figures.Notably, during the announcement of this $69-billion deal, the company projected $750 million of near-term synergies, with low- to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post closure of the transaction. Many view the merger as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gains and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation Quote Benefits from the Latest U.S. Tax ReformThe latest U.S. tax legislation, which slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, is anticipated to benefit the company with an effective tax rate of 27% and an increased cash flow of around $1.2 billion in 2018.Revised Outlook for Q4CVS Health now expects to report a mid-teens Pharmacy Services segment's adjusted operating profit growth rate in fourth-quarter 2017 and around 4% for full-year 2017, largely due to weaker margin performance in the PBM client and retail network claims administration process. However, the company still expects fourth-quarter operating loss from its Retail/LTC segment to be at the lower end of the previously-provided range of 1.0% to 3.5%. Also, the company estimates adjusted EPS and consolidated operating profit growth at the low end of the previously-provided ranges of $1.88-$1.92 and 5.75-8%, respectively.Zacks Rank and Key PickCVS Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

RxCrossroads is a provider of tailored services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers. The transaction is valued at $735 million and has been entirely funded by cash on hand.RxCrossroads will become part of McKesson's Specialty Health business. McKesson expects this transaction to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share by approximately 20 cents within the third year following the close of the transaction.

Recently, McKesson divested Enterprise Information segment recently for approximately $185 million in cash, which indicates the company’s focus on core strength. Notably, the Enterprise Information Solutions portfolio included a robust set of clinical and financial solutions supporting full scope of care delivery processes including Paragon (EHR solution); STAR and HealthQuest (Revenue Cycle solutions); Lab Analytics and Blood Bank; and OneContent (Content Management solutions). The company also signed an agreement to acquire privately-owned company CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion.However, McKesson’s pharmaceutical distribution business, which contributes almost 99% to the company’s top line, is witnessing sluggish growth since the last few quarters due to weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. Distribution Solutions faces stiff competition in terms of price and service from various full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large-payer organizations.Price PerformanceOver the last three months, McKesson has been trading below the industry.

Adjusted earnings for the same period are expected in the range of $11.80-$12.50 per diluted share.On the flipside, pricing pressure in the independent retail pharmacy channel is a headwind. McKesson entered fiscal 2018 with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid-single digits and its first quarter slightly surpassed expectations.McKesson has been witnessing increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes.

325,MCK,"NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Irvine, CA-based Quality Systems, Inc. (QSII  -  Free Report), recently completed the acquisition of EagleDream Health Inc. for roughly $26 million in cash.EagleDream Health is a cloud-based analytics that optimizes understanding across clinical, financial and administrative data to enhanced practice performance.Following the acquisition, NextGen Healthcare will gain facilities to provide enriching care experience and accelerate patient engagement for ambulatory clinics and health systems. Management further expects to achieve per capita cost efficiency as well as enhanced work-life balance for clinicians and staff.Interestingly, the company has been in on an acquisition spree for long.

326,MCK,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on San Francisco, CA-based McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), a health care services and information technology company.  McKesson posted disappointing results in first-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The quarter saw strong performance by the Distribution Solutions segment. The segment is expected to keep up its performance in fiscal 2018 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. To boost growth, the company recently acquired CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion.Coming to guidance, the Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to witness robust growth on a year-over-year basis. The upside is expected to be driven by market growth and acquisitions.McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share of $7.10-$9.00 for the fiscal ending Mar 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings for the same period are expected in the range of $11.80-$12.50 per diluted share.On the flipside, pricing pressure in the independent retail pharmacy channel is a headwind. McKesson entered fiscal 2018 with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid-single digits and its first quarter slightly surpassed expectations.McKesson has been witnessing increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes. The company continues to see a competitive market for selling generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S. However, McKesson expects to overcome the independent pharmacy sell-side pricing impact by the end of second-quarter fiscal 2018.Furthermore, cutthroat competition in the niche markets, currency headwinds and reimbursement issues remain challenges.Stock Performance and Estimate Revision TrendOver the last three months, McKesson has been trading above the broader industry. The company has gained 5.1%, comparing favorably with the broader industry’s return of just 4%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500’s return of only 4.6% over the same time frame.The estimate revision trend for McKesson has been unfavorable at the moment. For the current quarter, six analysts moved south compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, magnitude of full-year estimates fell 4.8% to $2.76 over the same time frame.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Masimo Corporation (MASI  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report).Notably, Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while IDEXX Laboratories and Masimo Corporation have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Edwards Lifesciences has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.2%. Notably, the stock has returned 2.7% over the last three months.Masimo yielded a strong return of 26.6% year to date. The stock has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 11.1%.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 19.8%. Additionally, the stock represents an impressive one-year return of 39.6%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

327,MCK,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on Chesterbrook, PA-based AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) – one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies. The company focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcome. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AmerisourceBergen had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one month, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the share price movement reveals that AmerisourceBergen’s shares has lost 13.9%, comparing unfavorably with the 5.4% decline of the broader industry.The unfavorable performance was led by pricing pressure in the generic drug space and lackluster guidance for the full year. AmerisourceBergen expects fiscal 2017 revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, significantly lower than the previous 6.5% to 8% band. The company expects brand drug inflation in the range of 7% to 9%.AmerisourceBergen took over PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings for $2.58 billion back in 2015. We believe that the temporary slowdown in PharMEDium growth will mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the coming quarters. Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's QA and QC (quality assurance and quality control) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends AmerisourceBergen a competitive advantage over the long haul, this might result in a bottom-line headwind for the business in fiscal 2017.Lackluster performance in the hepatitis C revenue segment is another concern. In this regard, AmerisourceBergen witnessed a significant negative revenue impact from the declining sales at the segment in the second quarter. Revenues improved only 4% to $37.1 billion in the quarter, which might have been around 5.5% without the adverse impact of the hepatitis C segment.Cutthroat competition in the niche space is an added concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company’s primary competitors include Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report) and McKesson (MCK  -  Free Report) along with national generic and regional distributors.The generic industry is facing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges. The company also faces competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors and packaging and health care technology companies.A better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Align Technology has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 26.6%. The stock has added roughly 24.6% over the last three months.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump Policies                                                                                                            If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

Adjusted revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $424.2 million. Without the adjustments, Allscripts reported revenues of $426.1 million, which also outpaced our estimates.The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Quarter DetailsKey Highlights: Solid growth in U.S. Core Solutions and Services, fueled by Sunrise electronic health record (EHR) platform and Allscripts Revenue Cycle Management Services buoyed optimism in the second quarter. Furthermore, increased demand for CareInMotion solution in the health plan market and multiple global clients across the U.K. and the Asia-Pacific region drove revenues. Allscripts’ cloud-based precision medicine platform 2bPrecise announced a technology license agreement and collaboration with Mayo Clinic in the quarter.Bookings: Bookings in the second quarter were $407 million (highest till date), up 12% on a year-over-year basis. 50% of net bookings emerged from software delivery unit, while the remaining were related to client services.Solid growth in bookings was fueled by double-digit growth in the Payer and Life Sciences business.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. QuoteMargin DetailsAs a percentage of revenues, Allscripts registered adjusted gross margin of 48% in the second quarter compared with 48.1% in the year-ago quarter. Margins contracted 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Software gross margin, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 260 bps on a year-over-year basis. However, Client service margins in the second quarter increased almost 410 bps to 18% of revenues, compared to 13.9% for the same period last year. Margin expansion was on the back of gains in efficiencies and scale within the company’s managed services business.Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter totaled $141 million, reflecting a 6% year-over-year increase.GuidanceFor full-year 2017, the company expects revenues between $1.79 billion and $1.82 billion, up from the previously issued range of $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion.  Adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow in the band of 10% to 15%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the band of $345 million and $365 million.For 2018 to 2020, Allscripts raised its adjusted revenue growth guidance. The company expects adjusted revenue growth in the band of 9% to 11%, up from the previously issued range of 6% to 8%. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase in the band of 17%--20%, up from the previously issued range of 12%--15%.Most importantly, Allscripts announced the acquisition of the hospital and health system business of McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), which is estimated to close early in the fourth quarter of 2017. The deal is worth $185 million in cash.Our TakeAllscripts exited the second quarter on a favorable note, wherein adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues beat the same. A solid guidance for full-year 2017 and a strong long-term outlook are the key highlights of the moment. Allscripts announced plans to takeover the hospital and health system business of McKesson Corporation, which is expected to close by the fourth quarter. Allscripts’ continued reliance on mergers and acquisition activities poses substantial integration risks. Furthermore, intensifying competition is a major dampener. The company’s products have a long sales cycle which involves intensive decision-making at different managerial levels. Adding to the woes, the company expects a modest increase in operating expense during the second half of the year to support business growth.Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) and Abiomed Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report).Notably, Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Abiomed has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
