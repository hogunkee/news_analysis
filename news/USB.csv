But Amazon quietly recently launched a ""$10 & Under With Free Shipping"" category.…

5,USB,"The Trump tax cuts were met with bleak poll numbers and high skepticism among Americans about their tilt in favor of corporations and the highest-income groups. Yet barely two weeks after passage, roughly 1 million workers have been awarded bonuses that companies attribute to the GOP tax legislation, according to a running list by Americans for Tax Reform, and a few million more are in line to get small cuts in their utility bills.X Still others will benefit from bigger corporate matches for 401(k) accounts, as well as a new $15 minimum wage adopted by at least 20 banks, including Wells Fargo (WFC), U.S. Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial Services (PNC), in the wake of tax cuts.Among the biggest announcements have been $1,000 bonus awards by American Airlines (AAL) (127,000 employees); AT&T (T) (200,000); Bank of America (BAC) (145,000); Comcast (CMCSA) (100,000); Southwest Airlines (LUV) (55,000); and U.S. Bancorp (60,000). The generosity of those announcements was undercut somewhat by reports that AT&T and Comcast were in the midst of layoffs.Meanwhile, a number of electric utilities have announced plans to cut power bills, sharing their tax-cut windfall. Customers of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) subsidiary Pacificorp and Exelon (EXC) subsidiaries Pepco, Baltimore Gas & Electric, and Commonwealth Edison stand to benefit.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Even before the tax cuts begin to show up in paychecks in February, take-home pay has been surging at a rate that's almost unmatched since recession hit in 2007, the exception being a spurt that coincided with 2017's bonus season that runs through the end of March.Over the past 10 weeks, federal withheld employment and income taxes have surged 7.4% from the same period a year ago, an IBD analysis of Daily Treasury Statements finds. That's far faster than the roughly 5% growth in tax receipts implied by 2.5% average wage gains and the roughly 2% growth trend in aggregate hours worked in the economy, so bonuses and other incentive pay likely explain the surge to a large extent.The big political question is whether such displays of corporate generosity begin to shift sentiment about the Republicans' legislative achievement and improve GOP prospects in the midterm elections. From an economic standpoint, the question is how fast will the economy grow in 2018 and how much growth will result from this instant gratification from tax cuts.Most economists have fairly moderate expectations for growth this year, with JPMorgan Chase's economics team seeing 2.5% GDP growth in 2018, thanks to a 0.3-percentage-point lift from tax cuts. But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that he thinks ""4% economic growth this year is possible.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 each added 0.4%.But after Tuesday's losses, with the market due for a breather and as federal lawmakers wrestled to fashion a spending extension to keep the government operating after a Friday night budget deadline, wary investors were also watching for weak spots in Wednesday's early gains.Apple's (AAPL) decline further below its buy point, General Electric's (GE) continued weakness and Goldman Sachs' (GS) early loss following its fourth-quarter report raised red flags against the opening gains.

It advanced 7% from an early September bounce off the line to its Dec. 4 intraday high. SPLV was featured in this ETF column, which was published Sept. 27.The fund, which launched in May 2011, has gathered $7.5 billion in assets. It tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, which comprises the 100 least volatile S&P 500 stocks over the past 12 months. The index also has the ability to respond dynamically to market conditions.

Its average annual returns of 10.2% and 13.6% over the past three and five years also slightly trail the benchmark index, which returned a respective 12.7% and 15.7%.Generally, SPLV tends to perform better if the stock market declines and low-volatility stocks fall less than growth stocks. It carries a 0.25% expense ratio.Thursday's pick, Robo Global Robotics & Automation (ROBO), hit a new high but remains in a buy zone from a 42.69 flat-base entry.

Goldman Sachs, which flirted with a buy zone at the start of November, has pulled back.Meanwhile, superregional bank US Bancorp (USB) has tumbled nearly 5% since Monday's close, undercutting a buy point, its 50-day line and its 200-day line in turn.Bank groups dominated the worst-performing industries this week.The Senate's version of a tax-cut bill would delay a corporate tax cut to 2019, according to widespread reports ahead of the legislation's expected release Thursday. That news sent the S&P 500 index and other major averages sharply lower, though they closed well off session lows.Democrats' big Tuesday election wins in Virginia and New Jersey raise the prospect that the House of Representatives could be in play in next year's midterm elections. More Democrats mean more objections to Republicans' plans to implement the kind of deregulation bank investors have been waiting for since President Trump took office.""If we are right and Virginia signals increased chances that control of the House flips, then investors need to start thinking about Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) as the next chairman of the House Financial Services Committee,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Gardner said, according to MarketWatch. ""While we doubt that Waters could implement an anti-bank, anti-financials agenda,"" he continued, ""the financial sector would no longer have a wind at its back from Congress and we think the headline risk for the industry would increase significantly.""IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,550 on Wednesday, up 1,650 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator on Aug. 22 to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Meanwhile, the yield curve, which gauges the difference between return rates, or yields, on short-term and long-term government debt reached its flattest point in a decade this week.A widening spread between long- and short-term maturities reflect optimism about the economic, as investors demand a higher yield to offset the inflation that comes from a stronger economy, while borrowers bet they can generate solid returns with the funds. A flattening curve, in turn, can reflect more pessimism.The 10-year Treasury yield, which shot up in late 2016 (especially after Trump's election raised expectations of tax cuts and other reforms), has been flat in 2017, actually down a few basis points from the end of last year. The short end has risen, as the Federal Reserve slowly raises rates, with another hike expected in December.The yields on different Treasuries affect the value of an assortment of credit products that banks issue to customers. It also puts pressure on banks' traditional model of borrowing short and lending long.That may be why regional banks have fallen harder this week than global financial titans with heavy Wall Street businesses, such as JPMorgan and Citigroup.Bank stocks have had periods when they have outperformed the broader market. But in 2017 and for the past several years, JPMorgan and other banks' relative strength lines have largely moved in sync with the S&P 500 index. One, bank stocks are a big share of the S&P 500, so their moves are going to have a noticeable impact on the benchmark index. Second, banks' profits improve with the economy, so it's hard to have a radically different performance than Corporate America overall.RELATED:Here's How Rivals Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Are DivergingJPMorgan Sees Nothing To Spark Trading As Wall St. Waits On Tax ReformBanks And Financial Stock NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

12,USB,"Wireless-communications chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) sank Tuesday on a report that customer Apple (AAPL) plans to stop using its chips.XMeanwhile, industry peer Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) jumped after posting better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results.Qualcomm fell sharply on a report by the Wall Street Journal that Apple is designing iPhones and iPads for next year that would jettison the chipmaker's components. Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a legal fight over patent royalty rates and terms.Apple would use modem chips from Intel (INTC) and possibly MediaTek to replace Qualcomm chips in its devices, the report said. Apple already is using a mix of Qualcomm and Intel modem chips in its iPhone 7 series and iPhone 8 series handsets.Sources told the Journal that Qualcomm has withheld software critical to testing its chips in iPhone and iPad prototypes, forcing Apple to consider alternatives.Qualcomm stock lost 6.7% to close at 51.01 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes seven chip industry players, including Analog Devices and Microchip Technology.Meanwhile, IDT stock jumped 7.3% to finish regular trading at 31.07. Earlier in the session, IDT hit a 15-year high of 32.34.Late Monday, Integrated Device Technology reported adjusted earnings per share of 35 cents, up 3% year over year, on sales of $204.4 million, up 11%, in its fiscal second quarter ended Oct. 1. Analysts expected 34 cents and $201.1 million.For the current quarter, IDT expects to earn 41 cents a share on sales of $215 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling 40 cents and $212 million.IDT received a stock-rating upgrade and at least five price-target hikes from Wall Street firms post-earnings. Summit Redstone Partners upgraded IDT stock to buy from hold.Brokerage firms Craig Hallum and Needham were the most bullish of the group, with each raising their price target on IDT to 36.San Jose, Calif.-based IDT makes products for radio frequency, timing, wireless power transfer, serial switching, interface and sensing systems.Elsewhere in the chip sector, Barclays lowered its rating and price target on Cypress Semiconductor (CY).Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis cut his rating on Cypress to equal weight, or neutral, from overweight and reduced his price target to 17 from 18. Cypress stock was down 2.7%, near 15.90, on Tuesday.Curtis said he downgraded Cypress because most of the catalysts for the stock have ""played out,"" such as Apple adopting USB-C technology.RELATED:Nvidia Gets Price-Target Hike, Broadcom Breaks Out, Intel UpgradedIntel, 3 Other Chip Stocks Jump On September-Quarter Earnings

15,USB,"In its recently released 2017 Environmental Responsibility Policy, U.S. Bancorp (USB) emphatically declared, apparently for the first time in this report, that it does not provide project financing for oil or natural gas pipelines. Additionally, the bank noted that its relationships with clients in the pipeline business would be subject to ""enhanced due diligence.""As a private company, the bank is certainly entitled to make its own business judgments. And presumably, it feels that this policy is in the best interests of its shareholders and is environmentally friendly. But I wonder if the advocates for such a position, the decision-makers at the bank, and those who have applauded the bank's action, realize the counterproductive implications of this blanket approach.For decades, politicians have bemoaned the crumbling state of American infrastructure. Even today, in our hyperpartisan political environment, infrastructure is one of the few issues that seems to unite Democrats and Republicans. And this bipartisan recognition doesn't just apply to the most visible projects — roads, bridges and airports, but also to the less visible ones like energy pipelines and transmission lines.In 2015, the Obama Administration's Energy Department published its first Quadrennial Energy Review (QER). The report summarized that while the U.S. had become the world's largest supplier of oil and natural gas, the country's energy infrastructure was antiquated and crumbling.It noted that close to 50% of the nation's natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines, for instance, were built in the 1950s and 1960s, and that the need for natural gas interstate pipeline investment would range between $2.6 billion and $3.5 billion per year between 2015 and 2030, depending on the overall level of natural gas demand.The White House has also emphasized the need to focus on infrastructure development. Besides greenlighting the Keystone and Dakota Access pipeline projects, the Trump administration has also acted to expedite and encourage other energy infrastructure.This May, a bipartisan group of senators sponsored a bill to establish an infrastructure-financing authority to help states leverage private funds to modernize their transportation and energy infrastructure.Finally, we have seen a bipartisan push among lawmakers and outside groups to appoint new commissioners and ensure a functioning Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is the entity responsible for approving infrastructure projects.Policymakers and analysts from across the political spectrum are in favor of encouraging new and improved energy infrastructure for several reasons.First, new pipelines are an essential component of the shale revolution in the U.S., allowing abundant natural gas to flow into the marketplace. The newly tapped natural gas resources have been the prime reason that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have fallen more in the U.S. than in any other country since 2006. U.S. GHG emissions from the electric utility sector have declined to the lowest level since 1988. They have also created countless jobs and other economic activity.Second, oil pipelines offer a better environmental alternative than other forms of transportation. Without pipelines, we not only lack the means to transport fuel in a safe and environmentally conscious manner, but we shift the burden to other forms of infrastructure like road and rail, putting additional strain on an already overburdened system.According to research conducted by the Manhattan Institute, sourcing data from the Transportation Department's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, pipeline transportation results in significantly fewer safety incidents than other alternatives. Hazardous liquid and natural gas pipelines record 0.58 and 0.89 incidents per billion ton-miles, respectively, compared to rail transportation at 2.08 incidents and road at 19.95 incidents.Third, pipelines lower energy prices. It costs significantly less to transport oil and gas by pipeline, and those savings get passed through to American consumers.A few years ago, the Congressional Research Service noted that rail transport for North Dakota crude oil was costing about $5 to $10 more than transportation by pipeline. In a recent study, ICF International focused on three natural gas pipeline projects in different regions and concluded that ""these projects are projected to result in substantial savings associated with lower gas supply costs … as well as greater savings to the broader group of energy consumers in the markets served by the pipelines."" ICF estimated total savings could reach over $3 billion.Many activists believe that we don't need any of these projects because we don't need fossil fuels. But the reality is much different. Fossil fuels have provided more than 80% of America's energy consumption for over 100 years.According to EIA, petroleum consumption has increased in each of the last four years; natural gas consumption has increased in nine of the last 10 years. Even as the share of renewables continues to grow, there will be an ongoing need to modernize and build new infrastructure.There is room to have a productive discussion about the best way to incorporate advanced safety and environmental protections into new, economically viable projects.But it is certainly not helpful, nor does it demonstrate leadership, to highlight a blanket opposition to pipelines and other energy projects as a purported badge of honor — especially by a bank that provides credit card services to many of the government agencies that are charged with modernizing our country's energy infrastructure.

16,USB,"Western Digital (WDC) shares fell Wednesday following news that Toshiba will sell a prized chip unit to a rival group led by Bain Capital and Korea-based SK Hynix.XThe deal, announced by Toshiba late Tuesday, is a blow to Western Digital, which spent months negotiating and wrangling with Toshiba to acquire the specialized unit that makes memory chips.The Bain Capital group reportedly bid $19 billion for the business, above the reported bid of $18.2 billion by the Western Digital group, which included private equity firm KKR. Apple (AAPL) is said to be involved with the Bain Capital group.Western Digital stock fell 3.4% to close at 85.74 on the stock market today.Toshiba said it entered a memorandum of understanding with the Bain group and hopes to enter a final decision by the end of this month. Two Japanese newspapers had previously reported that Western Digital won the bidding.The Toshiba unit makes a popular computer memory chip known as Nand flash, which is used in a wide variety of consumer electronics and in chip-based data storage systems. Western Digital acquired a stake in the business, resulting from its $15.8 billion SanDisk acquisition.Toshiba is under heavy pressure to sell the chip unit, in order to cover massive losses from its nuclear division and avoid having its stock delisted from Japan's stock exchanges.Western Digital has worked to acquire the Toshiba unit to fortify its strong and growing presence in the memory-chip market — chips that are used broadly in smartphones, memory cards, USB drives, solid-state drives, digital cameras and other devices. In addition to being a competitive force in chips, Western Digital is also the world's largest manufacturer of disk drives, competing against Seagate Technology (STX)Western Digital has fought legal battles against Toshiba to prevent any deal that did not have its consent, in order to preserve intellectual property and prevent the chip unit from falling into the hands of competitors. That includes Broadcom (AVGO), which reportedly bid on the unit. Broadcom is a leading manufacturer of chips used in wireless and broadband communication.IBD'S TAKE: Western Digital holds a strong IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99. There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research and find top stocks, but when you're looking to get a broader idea on top tech stocks, IBD's Tech Leaders feature is worth reviewing.The Bain Capital/SK Hynix group had previously been selected by Toshiba as the winning bidder. That deal collapsed under heavy legal pressure by Western Digital.Western Digital implied it might continue legal action, in a statement issued late Tuesday.""It is surprising that Toshiba would continue to pursue a transaction with a consortium led by Korea-based SK Hynix and Bain Capital Japan without SanDisk's consent,"" Western Digital said in a prepared statement. ""The language in the relevant joint venture agreements is unambiguous, and multiple courts have ruled in favor of protecting SanDisk's contractual rights. We remain confident in our ability to protect our joint venture interests and consent rights.""It said ""arbitration requests"" are on file and continue to move forward in the ICC International Court of Arbitration.The other group bidding for the unit is a consortium led by manufacturing giant Foxconn that includes Apple.RELATED:Toshiba Agrees To Talk With Western Digital Over Disputed Chip DealWestern Digital Seeks To Block Toshiba Chip Sale Via Arbitration

17,USB,"A lengthy and contentious battle may soon come to a close, as a second Japanese newspaper has reported that a group led by Western Digital (WDC) won the bidding for a Toshiba memory-chip unit, for about $18.2 billion.A win by Western Digital would fortify its strong and growing presence in the memory-chip market — chips that are used broadly in smartphones, memory cards, USB drives, solid-state drives, digital cameras and other devices. In addition to being a competitive force in chips, Western Digital is also the world's largest manufacturer of disk drives, competing against Seagate Technology (STX).Toshiba denied the report on Tuesday by Japan media group Nikkan Kogyo that said Western Digital won the bidding process. Reuters is reporting that Toshiba now favors a group led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital Japan to buy its prized semiconductor business, after failing to bridge key gaps with Western Digital.Western Digital shares were up 1.6% to 88.78 in the stock market today.Toshiba is under heavy pressure to sell the chip unit, in order to cover massive losses from its nuclear division and avoid having its stock delisted from Japan's stock exchanges. Toshiba also denied an earlier report from Asahi Shimbun, a widely respected newspaper in Japan, that also said Western Digital had won the bidding process. Western Digital has not commented on the reports.Western Digital gained a stake in the Toshiba unit as a result of its $15.8 billion SanDisk acquisition. Western Digital has fought legal battles against Toshiba to prevent any deal that did not have its consent, in order to preserve intellectual property, among other reasons.IBD'S TAKE: Western Digital holds a strong IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of a possible 99, and recently moved above its 50-day moving average, which can be a positive sign.

18,USB,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average pared overnight losses Friday morning with Hurricane Irma bearing down on Florida. The U.S. dollar fell for a seventh straight session as Treasury yields neared the key 2% level.XS&P 500 and Dow futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were flat against fair value. The major market averages are trading modestly below all-time highs and slightly above their 50-day moving averages. The euro rose to its highest levels vs. the greenback in nearly three years while the Japanese yen set a 10-year highs. Gold futures continued to advance. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to a 10-month low of2.03% after a sharp drop on Thursday.Not coincidentally, bank stocks were big losers on Thursday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) undercut a buy point, the SPDR Financial (XLF) bank ETF, fell below its 200-day line and industry leader Citigroup (C) dropped below its 50-day line. Morgan Stanley (MS) knifed below its 200-day moving avergage while Wells Fargo (WFC) and several superregional bank stocks hit 2017 lows.The current retreat is just one reason to steer clear of bank stocks. Hopes for tax cuts and other Trump agenda items continue to fade. Interest rates and yield spreads have steadily declined. And over the long term, bank stocks have not outperformed. The case for avoiding bank stocks was clear at the end of May; the evidence is even stronger today.Bank stocks briefly outperformed in late 2016, especially following President Trump's election win. But since early 2017 most banks began to follow the market, with clear underperformance in recent weeks, with several signals along the way.Bank stocks rallied after Election Day in part on hopes for sweeping tax cuts, which would lower their own IRS checks as well as bolster economic growth and interest rates, and accelerate Federal Reserve rate hikes. But the odds and timing of a tax hike have steadily declined, with Goldman Sachs now predicting that the odds of tax reform are down to 40%. On the positive front, the Trump administration is still making moves to ease crisis-era financial regulations, potentially freeing up capital for lending and buybacks.With the Trump agenda stalling, Treasury yields have been sliding for weeks. The 10-year Treasury yield fell sharply on Thursday to fresh 2017 lows, in part due to euro gains on European Central Bank hints of tapering asset purchases. The yield is at its lowest levels since Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election. Meanwhile, the spread between short-term and long-term yields has been falling sharply. That's bad news for banks, whose traditional profit model is borrowing short and lending long. It's also not a great sign for the economy when the yield curve flattens out.Bank stocks can be solid investments over certain periods, including right after the election. But they haven't tended to outperform the S&P 500 index significantly over time. Citigroup has been the best-performing U.S. bank stock in 2017, but its Relative Strength line is back about where it was at the start of the year. That means that Citi is trading even with the S&P 500 index. Looking further back, JPMorgan has been one of the better financials, but its shares haven't been long-term outperformers.Investors might be better off buying a broad index fund or ETF, which often will have financials as big holdings, to provide similar performance without the sector or single-stock risk.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Hold Serve, But Banks Face Break PointFour Reasons You Should Withdraw From Bank StocksThese 5 Dow Titans Are Near Buys In Bullish BasesTrump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman SachsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksBanks And Financial Stock News

24,USB,"Wall Street analysts on Wednesday gave price-target increases to chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), while upgrading Cypress Semiconductor (CY) to the equivalent of a buy rating.Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated his buy rating on graphics-chip maker Nvidia and raised his price target to 170 from 145. Nvidia is in the IBD 50.XNvidia was up 0.3%, near 147, in morning trading on the stock market today. Nvidia broke out of a 13-week consolidation period with a buy point of 121.02 on May 10. It hit a record high of 168.50 on June 9.""While Nvidia stock has had a nice rebound year-to-date, we believe there are incremental tailwinds into second-half 2017,"" Rakesh said in a note to clients.The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is starting to see traction for its DGX-1 supercomputer, launched in May, with leading players in artificial intelligence adopting the system, he said.Nvidia also is getting a boost from cryptocurrency mining trends that are driving graphics processor unit sales. Plus, Nvidia is winning new business from automakers and auto-parts suppliers for self-driving car technology.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland maintained his positive rating on IDT stock, but increased his price target to 33 from 30.IDT was up 2.9%, near 25, in early trading Wednesday.The San Jose, Calif.-based company is likely to benefit from the ramp of Intel's (INTC) new Purley server chip platform, Rolland said.""The transition to the Purley platform presents one of the most significant product-driven opportunities in the company's history, and one that is grossly underestimated by the market,"" Rolland said in a note to clients.

25,USB,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among the nation's biggest banks that got the OK from the Federal Reserve to hike shareholder returns, the second round of the central bank's annual stress tests showed Wednesday.X All 34 banks tested were cleared to do so, but the Fed had reservations about Capital One (COF), which got a conditional pass. The credit card company and American Express (AXP) had to adjust their plans to pass muster.After the test results, banks started announcing richer payouts:The Fed said that it is requiring Capital One to ""to address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices."" Capital One has until Dec. 28 to resubmit its capital plan.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying the Fed did not object to its capital plan, but the bank did not provide specific figures for shareholder returns.""We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in the statement.Other lenders delivering more capital to shareholders:Shares of JPMorgan rallied 2% late after closing up 2% at 89.82 on the stock market today, breaking out past an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base. Bank of America rose 1.4% late after finishing up 2.6% at 23.88, resurfacing above its 50-day average and approaching a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley rose 1.3% late adding to its 0.2% gain to 44.32, still below a 46.08 entry. Citigroup surged 2.3% late, after rising 1.5% earlier. Wells Fargo added 1.4% to its 2.2% gain at the close, while Goldman Sachs edged up 1.2% late, on top of its 1.3% regular-session uptick.IBD'S TAKE: The stress-test results could give bank stocks a jolt after they've been idling in recent months in anticipation of tax reform and regulatory cuts from President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures and determines how much lenders can pay out to shareholders. Banks will likely begin announcing their dividend and buyback plans shortly after the Fed releases the CCAR results.The results come after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a bold vote of confidence for banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the kind seen in 2008 is unlikely ""in our lifetime.""""I think the public can see the capital positions of the major banks are very much stronger this year,"" Yellen said at a conference in London, noting that regulators are more proactive in detecting threats to financial stability than they were a decade ago.The Fed's confidence in the financial system could mean banks may see some relief in the future from the crisis-era measures designed to ensure stability — or at the very least, they may not face tougher rules. But this year's test results are based on economic scenarios the Fed outlined in February.The CCAR test also contains a quantitative portion as well as a qualitative portion, which looks at a bank's internal quality controls. Twenty-one smaller banks this year, however, were exempted from the qualitative part of the CCAR test.The Fed said Wednesday that most of the 13 banks subject to the qualitative portion this year ""have continued to strengthen their capital planning practices since last year."" But it also said that some banks, despite improvements, ""continue to have areas of weaknesses that fall short of meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.""Citigroup in 2014 failed the qualitative portion, and in recent years Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs received ""conditional passes"" and had to resubmit their capital plans. But banks have largely gotten used to the stress tests since they were first instituted in the wake of the financial crisis.They could become easier as the Trump administration looks to shred big parts of Dodd-Frank financial regulations and fill open positions at the Fed and regulatory agencies.The Fed over the years has tried to balance banks' demands for more testing transparency and its efforts to make the tests matter. The Fed worries that giving banks too much information would make the tests too easy to pass.Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, also floated the idea of requiring fewer banks to take the tests.""We believe that future stress tests will also become easier, and the possibility of banks being exempted from the process or not having qualitative reviews for all banks remains open and possible,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note dated Friday.RELATED:Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

26,USB,"Citigroup (C) shares broke out on Thursday, with global and regional banks also trying to reclaim key support levels.The gains came as the House was set Thursday to pass a rollback of Dodd-Frank financial reform measures and as former FBI Director James Comey offered no additional bombshells during his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Early Thursday, the European Central Bank dropped a pledge to ease policy if necessary.The 10-year Treasury yield edged up 1 basis point to 2.19% following modest gains on Wednesday. Shares of Citigroup rallied 2.15% to 63.21, clearing a 62.63 buy point from a flat base. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) climbed 1.2%, nearing its 50-day line as it grinds through a double-bottom base. Bank of America (BAC), up 1.6%, was also close to that key test of investor support. Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 1.9% as it makes its way through a consolidation. Goldman Sachs (GS) added 1.4%, also heading toward its 50-day line.Smaller banks saw steeper gains. Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI) climbed 3.4%, Umpqua Holdings (UMPQ) popped 5%, and East West Bancorp (EWBC) surged 3.8% to 56.43, closing in on a 57.34 entry. Among superregionals, Comerica (CMA) rose 2.8% and US Bancorp (USB) added 1.3%, both retaking their 50-day lines.After a long postelection sprint, bank stocks began leveling off in March amid concerns the Trump administration's agenda of tax and regulatory reform was stalling.Bank stocks, and markets more broadly, have also been pressured amid the escalating drama over the government's investigations into Russia's meddling in the U.S. November election and the Trump camp's potential ties to Russia.Comey, whom Trump fired last month as he was seeking more resources for the FBI's own investigation into Russian interference, has been a central figure in that drama.In his prepared remarks released on Wednesday, he appeared to relieve markets, as they largely confirmed what had already been reported.On Thursday, Comey didn't drop any new revelations. But he suggested some damaging details might be revealed in a closed-door session and ratcheted up the rhetoric, saying the Trump administration had tried to ""defame"" him and the FBI with ""lies"" and that Trump's ""shifting explanations"" over his firing had made him more concerned.He also said no other person he had worked for while in government had asked him for ""loyalty"" in the way Trump had, and that he began documenting a January meeting with Trump out of concern Trump might lie about it.But he was mum on the details contained in the dossier compiled by former intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and whether Trump's remarks to him amounted to obstruction of justice.Meanwhile, the GOP-led House approved legislation to roll back many Dodd-Frank provisions. But getting 60 votes in the Senate will be a huge hurdle, so it's unclear how much investors were buying banks based on the House vote.RELATED:JPMorgan, BofA Hit On Latest Bad News For BanksAs JPMorgan, BofA Struggle, This Regional Bank Tries To Move Up

27,USB,"Recent device analysis by Chipworks points to several semiconductor winners, Susquehanna Financial Group said in a report Wednesday.Those winners include Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM); Texas Instruments (TXN); ON Semiconductor (ON); and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), which is being purchased by Qualcomm (QCOM), Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report.Maxim gained significant market share in audio amplifiers in the first half of the year, helped by contract wins at Huawei, the giant Chinese tech firm. It also is being used in Samsung's flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone, Susquehanna said.Texas Instruments has been gaining power-management chip content in Chinese smartphones. It also won business in security cameras, game consoles, solid-state drives, routers and set-top boxes, the investment bank said.ON Semi has gained in power-management chips in PCs, handsets and other devices as well as in rapid-charge components in handsets. Plus, ON Semi is benefiting from the growth of devices with USB Type-C connections, Susquehanna said.NXP has been dominating the near-field communications chip market. It captured about 80% of NFC sockets in the first half of 2017, Susquehanna said.Ambarella (AMBA) stock dived below its 50-day moving average, a key support level, in bearish fashion on Wednesday after the maker of video-processing chips gave disappointing sales guidance for the current quarter late Tuesday.Ambarella reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, but offered weak revenue guidance for its fiscal Q2.The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned 39 cents a share excluding items, up 15% year over year, on sales of $64.1 million, up 12%, in the quarter ended April 30. Analysts expected 36 cents and $63.5 million.For the current quarter ending July 31, Ambarella expects revenue of $69 million to $72 million, below Wall Street's consensus estimate of $72.35 million. The midpoint of its guidance would be an increase of 8% year over year.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now features nine chip-industry players including Nvidia and Microchip Technology.Most of the revenue shortfall in fiscal Q2 is related to weakness in its drone camera business.Ambarella is working to diversify its business from action cameras and drone cameras for customers like GoPro (GPRO) and DJI and into more internet-enabled security cameras, law-enforcement cameras and automotive cameras.Ambarella stock was down 10.25% to 53.60 on the stock market today. The stock peaked at 129.19 in July 2015 when GoPro wearable action cameras were a hot item.Investment bank Stifel reiterated its buy rating on Ambarella stock, but trimmed its price target to 64 from 65 on Wednesday.Needham maintained its hold rating on Ambarella on Wednesday.""Despite a weaker outlook for drones, the rest of Ambarella's business is performing strongly,"" Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said in a report. ""The company saw strong revenue growth in IP security cameras, both in professional and home monitoring, body-worn police cameras, and auto (equipment manufacturer) video recorders. … Additionally, Ambarella is seeing strong initial traction for 360-degree cameras and virtual-reality solutions, but notes it is still too early to forecast the size of this opportunity.""RELATED:This IBD 50 Chip Stock Just Notched A Record High, Here's Why

29,USB,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 smartphone hasn't been announced yet, but analysts are already picking winners and losers among component suppliers for the rumored device.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang on Friday predicted that Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Dialog Semiconductor, Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Qorvo (QRVO) would be content-gainers in Apple's next-generation handset.Component-share losers in the iPhone 8 likely will include Analog Devices (ADI), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qualcomm (QCOM), he said.Cypress could gain a USB type-C driver in the handset, Zhang said. Maxim likely has a design win for the power-management chip for the OLED display, he said. Qorvo will gain content, but at a lower gross margin, he said.Qualcomm is likely to be a loser as Apple shifts more to Intel (INTC) wireless chips. Apple and Qualcomm are engaged in a nasty legal battle over wireless-patent royalties and terms.Cirrus Logic is expected to lose power amplifier share to Maxim, Zhang said. And Analog Devices lost the Force Touch component business to a competitor for the OLED iPhone.Apple is expected to introduce the iPhone 8 in September, along with iPhone 7S handsets, which are upgraded versions of the current iPhone 7 devices. The iPhone 8 is likely to be in very short supply initially because of production snags that Apple's contract manufacturers have experienced. Component suppliers have had trouble integrating the fingerprint security sensor into the OLED display, analysts say.The iPhone 8 is expected to be Apple's biggest smartphone redesign since the iPhone 6, which came out in September 2014. The iPhone 8 is rumored to feature a 5.8-inch borderless OLED screen, glass-sandwich design, wireless charging and augmented-reality capability. Apple is expected to replace the physical home button with a virtual on-screen button, which will allow for a larger display.Many Wall Street analysts expect the iPhone 8 — Apple's 11th-generation handset and 10th-anniversary smartphone — to kick off a ""supercycle"" of upgrade purchases among iPhone users.Earlier this month, Pacific Crest Securities identified chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) as three companies likely to benefit from the release of the iPhone 8.Audio-chip maker Cirrus Logic has the highest exposure to Apple of the three companies spotlighted by Pacific Crest. Cirrus gets about 75% of its revenue from Apple.Broadcom is best positioned to make content gains in the iPhone 8 with its radio-frequency, Wi-Fi and wireless-charging chips, Pacific Crest said. Broadcom gets 15% to 20% of its revenue from Apple.Skyworks also is seen making content gains in the new iPhone, Pacific Crest said. Skyworks gets about 40% of its revenue from Apple.On Wednesday, investment bank Cowen said Apple's contract manufacturers might not reach mass production of the iPhone 8 until late October or early November, three months later than usual for the annual iPhone update.

30,USB,"Stumbles by President Trump and the GOP Congress are so far producing a more uncertain climate for business expansion than expected, leading companies to delay plans for deploying cash reserves.A new survey of corporate finance officers finds that businesses continued to hoard cash in the first quarter, despite their plans to the contrary. A net 15% of businesses grew their cash reserves, just one point lower than a year ago, despite expectations that a net 7% would put their cash to work, the quarterly report from the Association for Financial Professionals found.Still, the survey hints that while investment plans may have been curtailed or sidelined, and confidence may have been dented a bit, there's still a good deal of optimism about the Trump administration delivering on its economic promises. In the current quarter, a net 3% of firms expect to reduce cash levels.The survey largely reflects what JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Comerica (CMA) and other banks have said in recent weeks during earnings calls.Asked about a slowdown in commercial and industrial loans in the first quarter, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake acknowledged that ""sequentially things are a bit quieter,"" while adding that the category was up 8% vs. a year ago. CEO Jamie Dimon noted that lending to middle-market companies ""was slow, but it was OK.""Ultimately, though, the banking giant, whose shares are listed on the Dow Jones industrial average, still expects that Trump's pro-growth policies will bear fruit. ""We'll see that translate into loan growth,"" Lake said. ""Whether that's in the second half of this year, we'll see.""Earlier this year, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had hailed Trump for reviving businesses' ""animal spirits."" But that doesn't seem to have translated into actual spending.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market was rocking and rolling on Monday in celebration of market-friendly weekend election results in France. But will it be enough to renew the market's uptrend? As of now, IBD classifies the uptrend as being ""under pressure,"" a signal that investors should take extra caution when they buy stocks and be quick to cut losses. Read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend.Comerica noted a 44% increase in its loan pipeline, ""reflective of the improving economy and anticipated changes coming out of Washington.""""There is definitely a lot more optimism than we saw in the third quarter or fourth quarter of last year, even though some of that may have waned a little bit,"" said Comerica President Curtis Farmer, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.While some clients may not follow through on those loan commitments, he said, ""you have to assume a fair amount of the real book based on the sort of historical trends with our clients and the conversations that we've had.""But US Bancorp (USB) noted last week that large companies are putting off big loans to wait for more clarity on taxes, regulations, infrastructure and trade.RELATED:Trump Surprises Sink Fed Expectations And Bank Stocks Why Trump's 'Wonderful' ObamaCare Plan Casts Doubt On 'Massive' Tax Cut 
"
31,USB,"President Trump's hint this month of a breakup of big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hit their stocks hard — for maybe 30 minutes. Then the stocks recovered and finished higher for the day.Little wonder. Financial deregulation looks like it's one of the few Trumponomics planks that investors can count on. Despite all the headlines, chaining off commercial banks from investment banking is probably a nonstarter now in Congress. But Trump has the will — and the political wherewithal — to bust up heavy regulations clamped on banks after the financial crisis.Capital requirements, stress-test thresholds, fee limits and trading curbs are some of the weights that Trump likely will lighten. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also likely will lose much of its budget and authority. These changes could boost bank profits, shareholder returns and M&A activity, as well as boost lending to businesses and consumers that accelerates economic growth.Hope for such deregulation is the reason shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Wells Fargo and other banks large and small shot higher after Donald Trump's election.The stakes are huge: The excess capital that banks hold to comply with stress tests is estimated at well over $100 billion. They could return much of that money to shareholders via buybacks and dividends with the right reforms, such as reducing how many banks face Federal Reserve stress tests. If capital requirements are cut, excess capital could rise as high as $218 billion, Goldman Sachs analysts say.Regional banks also seek regulatory relief. Current rules imposed in the last eight years may discourage them from expanding beyond $10 billion in assets, where they'd face an additional regulator in the CFPB, more compliance and training requirements, and stress tests. Even small community banks face significant burdens, and they appear to have Trump's ear. Complaints include new mortgage-disclosure rules, caps on fees and heightened loan standards.Many local banks say they face unnecessary limits on whom they lend to and the products they offer. Their concerns are reflected in the declining number of banks. Only a few banks have been created since the financial crisis, suggesting that compliance costs and other red tape are too high and stifling new competition.""If I were the CEO of a small or community bank, an asset manager or an insurance company, I would be ecstatic"" over prospects for deregulation, said Douglas Elliott, a partner in Oliver Wyman's financial services consulting practice. ""There's virtually no downside.""For the largest banks, the regulatory outlook is ""more mixed,"" amid some high-level GOP support for Glass-Steagall and raising capital standards, but ""still overall a positive,"" Elliott said.Aligning oneself with big banks is still politically risky. The Republican Party platform molded by the populist Trump campaign endorsed reviving Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that split commercial and investment banking until its repeal in the late 1990s.But Trump's support for the idea was never strong or clear.In a Bloomberg News interview on May 1, Trump was asked if he wanted to break up the big banks. He made no commitment. Some people ""want to go back to the old system, right?"" he said. ""So we're going to look at that.""Those are hardly fighting words. And the reality is that even a tough fight would have a slim chance of winning in Congress, says KBW Washington analyst Brian Gardner. He figures Republicans opposed to Glass-Steagall would demand big concessions, such as killing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Democrats would reject that.By contrast, Trump clearly is serious about rolling back some Dodd-Frank provisions. The law is ""going to be very, very seriously changed so the banks can go back to loaning money,"" he told Bloomberg. Speaking to community bankers that same day, he blasted the law as being ""out of control,"" and ""not only for community banks — for banks, period.""Trump's diagnosis sounds a lot like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's. In an April letter to shareholders, Dimon argued that big U.S. banks should be freed from post-crisis capital requirements that exceed Basel international rules. That would unlock $15 billion of equity capital at JPMorgan and support nearly $190 billion of loans, he wrote.Eliminating the capital surcharge for the eight biggest U.S. banks could boost earnings by 4.6%, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods have estimated.Part of the bank rally after Trump's surprise election was relief that more onerous regulations wouldn't come into being. Not only has the Federal Reserve's regulatory regime been fairly strict for the eight globally systemically important banks, constraining their dividends and buybacks, but it was set to get even tougher if Hillary Clinton had become president, notes Elliott.On tap was ""a significant increase in capital requirements"" for megabanks under a policy outlined in September by Daniel Tarullo, who headed the Fed's committee on bank supervision and regulation. Tarullo turned in his resignation in February in the wake of Trump's victory.""People are policy,"" said RBC Capital banking analyst Gerard Cassidy, and Trump's election is bringing ""an incredible amount of turnover.""Trump's people, Cassidy told IBD, are likely to be ""pro-bank people, pro-business people, which would inevitably lead to more sound, common-sensical"" regulations. ""We do expect to see more returns of excess capital this year and next year, even if the legislation is not changed,"" he said.A House panel on Thursday voted on party lines for legislation that would roll back much of Dodd-Frank. The legislation could clear the full House, but the Senate would be a much higher hurdle.Policy analysts see two legislative ideas with enough support to get to Trump's desk. Elliott expects Republicans to ax the CFPB's budget. Supporters say the CFPB is a long-needed watchdog, citing September's $100 million fine on Wells Fargo for employees illegally opening 2 million deposit and credit-card accounts for unknowing customers. But its crackdown on payday lending has reduced access to small, short-term loans, while its 1,659-page rules on prepaid debit cards could choke off a popular product.As the CFPB shrinks and loses authority in the Trump era, ""restrictions on banking fees will slacken for all banks, which should help boost earnings,"" Oppenheimer Funds portfolio manager Benjamin Ram and research analyst Christopher Mashia wrote in a March analysis.Meanwhile, solid bipartisan support exists for raising the asset threshold by which banks become subject to the Fed's annual stress test, Elliott says. The level could rise from $50 billion to ""between $150 billion and $500 billion,"" he says.In his outgoing speech April 4, Tarullo agreed that the $50 billion threshold was ""set too low,"" adding that Dodd-Frank's risk-based capital requirements are ""unduly complicated"" for small banks.While Tarullo is gone, his endorsement could help pave the way for freeing community banks from Dodd-Frank's additional safety and soundness provisions for ensuring that their risk controls and financial conditions are adequate. There also is broad support for raising the $10 billion asset floor that triggers additional compliance and oversight, including a requirement for banks to conduct their own stress tests.Many superregional banks would be happy to do their own stress tests. In the Fed's stress tests, the agency provides little transparency about how it determines whether capital is sufficient, spurring banks to be ultraconservative in setting dividends to avoid surprises. No bank wants to be in the position of Zions Bancorp (ZION), when it was the only one to fail the Fed's stress test in 2014.Raising the Fed stress-test asset threshold likely would spark consolidation, creating cost-saving opportunities without triggering a special regulatory headache.If Congress raised the Fed stress-test threshold to $250 billion, 21 more financial institutions would be exempt. They include KeyCorp (KEY), American Express (AXP), BB&T (BBT) and SunTrust Banks (STI). Some 13 banks would still face strict scrutiny, with a few superregionals such PNC Financial (PNC) and US Bancorp (USB) still grouped with the globally systemically important banking giants.Prospects for regulatory relief and higher net-interest margins helped vault superregional and regional banks to the top of IBD's 197 industry-group rankings after the election. They held five of the top 10 positions in mid-February. The money-center bank group, including seven of the eight ""systemically important"" U.S. banks, got as high as No. 15. Since then, most bank stocks have fallen below their 50-day moving averages as interest rates have fallen and doubts have grown about Trumponomics, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The big question facing Trump's financial regulators will be whether the pendulum has swung too far toward safety and soundness at the expense of access to credit and economic growth.Under the Fed's stress test, which assumes a severe recession comparable to the crisis that began in 2007, systemically important banks are seen losing a combined $195 billion. But that's less than 10% of their capital of $2.2 trillion.""It's clear that banks can use more of their capital to finance the economy without sacrificing safety and soundness,"" Dimon wrote. ""Had they been less afraid of potential CCAR stress losses (the Fed's capital review process), banks probably would have been more aggressive in making some small business loans, lower rated middle market loans and near-prime mortgages.""Dimon says JPMorgan has turned away $200 billion in deposits from large clients because of new rules requiring that ""capital in many cases must be held on these short-term, virtually riskless activities.""While the biggest banks may not get regulatory relief as quickly as smaller banks, KBW estimates that the giants' earnings could rise 13.5% if ultrasafe assets such as Treasuries and deposits at the Fed are excluded from the leverage ratio, or capital as a percentage of assets.Tarullo's final speech also targeted Dodd-Frank's much-criticized Volcker Rule aimed at barring banks from trading for their own accounts, while still allowing them to act as market makers. He called the rule ""too complicated."" He said it was affecting market making, ""particularly for some less liquid issues.""An outright legislative Volcker Rule repeal could lift big-bank earnings by 4.2%, Goldman has estimated. The chances of that appear negligible, though Trump regulators likely will try to ease compliance.RELATED:Markets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: GoldmanBreakout Watch: Top Financial Stock Jumps Back Into Buy ZoneMorgan Stanley Beats Estimates As Fixed-Income Revenue DoublesGoldman Sacked: Wall Street Giant Blames Politics For Trading Woes

Rival Visa (V), which reported quarterly earnings in late April, edged up 1.4%, also extended from a breakout point.Mastercard faces elevated costs due to global growth and more spending on digital initiatives, such as its Masterpass digital wallet, Zacks said in an earnings preview last week. Greater incentives and rebates, as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange environment, could also weigh, Zacks said.But expansion of the card industry stands to help Mastercard and others. Visa, on its earnings release, cited ""robust growth"" in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions.Both companies have also rushed to capitalize on the growing interest in mobile payments, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.Visa, for instance, has a partnership with IBM (IBM) unit Watson intended to facilitate transactions on connected devices. Mastercard, management noted on its fourth-quarter earnings call, has debuted an AI bot that has functions ""similar to human interaction"" and enables purchases through Facebook (FB) Messenger and other messaging services.Following Visa's acquisition of Visa Europe, Mastercard said at a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods conference in February that it ""does not expect its trajectory of market share gains to change (in the region) and has not seen any let-up in the last 6-7 months,"" the investment firm said.Meanwhile, credit-card companies have had to find more ways to attract a wealthier consumer. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has  drawn the interest of millennials via its high-end Chase Sapphire Reserve, which is on Visa's payments infrastructure. That prompted American Express (AXP) to pile on more perks for its Platinum Card holders.U.S. Bank (USB) is touting its new Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite Card to compete for well-to-do professionals.RELATED:PayPal Beats Views, Sets New $5 Billion Buyback; Stock JumpsEBay, American Express, Qualcomm, CSX Move On Late Earnings

34,USB,"U.S. stocks advanced moderately in late morning trade Monday as volume picked up.The Nasdaq added 0.3%, the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was ahead by 0.6%. Volume was running higher in the stock market today, although early volume figures can often change.EpiPen maker Mylan (MYL) initially rose about 3%, but reversed to trade modestly lower. The Netherlands-based company has attracted bad publicity because of price increases that have boosted a two-pack of the EpiPen device to a $600 list price. On Monday, the company announced that it would offer a generic version of its allergic-treatment product at half the current price.The flap has brought negative publicity to Mylan and more awareness of EpiPen's cheaper rivals. AdrenaClick, for example, offers a less expensive product, and some doctors have pointed out that a syringe and bottle of the non-patent epinephrine can be bought for about $10. EpiPen's patents are related to its delivery device.Meanwhile, blue chip stocks were mostly higher. On the Dow, financial stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) rose about 1%.Talk of an interest rate hike has been lifting bank stocks.

36,USB,"For almost a century Radio Shack served electronics enthusiasts as an inexpensive way to buy the goods and parts they needed, from camera accessories and headphone jacks to battery testers and spare power cords for your iPhone.When the company went bankrupt last year, the reaction was shock mingled with a sense of nostalgic sorrow. The media offered all kinds of answers to the mystery of what or who killed Radio Shack, from a bad business model and poor management at the top, to competition from internet suppliers who also killed Circuit City and almost did the same to Best Buy.But in this case the real online perpetrator may be China, a serial predator who's been claiming more victims than just Radio Shack. Even worse, Congress and our own U.S. Postal Service seem to be holding the murder weapon.To get to the bottom of this mystery, we need to remember that Radio Shack's most loyal customers were buyers of small electronics parts for DIY projects -- whether they bought them in the store or from Radio Shack's website.Clue: That's the same line of business that China e-commerce specializes in, with dozens of websites for small cheap goods -- including electronics.Now, everyone loves healthy competition. But Chinese e-commerce companies get a special break, thanks to the USPS and the global cartel that oversees all international shipping by government post, the Universal Postal Union -- a United Nations agency.The UPU sets international postal rates from country to country, i.e. what a country's postal service charges to deliver a package within that country. That rate is based that nation's state of economic development. Category 3 country Gabon, for example, gets a bigger price break on the postage for the packages it ships to Norway, than Norway gets shipping to Gabon -- or to the United States, another Category 1 country. For reasons that defy logic, China, the world's second-biggest economy, also sits in Category 3, alongside Botswana and Cuba -- and Gabon.This means someone in China can send a package across the Pacific to the U.S. and have the USPS deliver anywhere in the 48 states, often for less than an American has to pay to send the same package within the U.S. How did this affect Radio Shack? A quick comparison of its online catalog with those of its Chinese competitors provides fresh evidence of what's happening -- and not just to Radio Shack.For example, a standard multimeter for measuring electric voltage sells from Radio Shack for $24.99. Go to Deal Extreme, a Chinese e-commerce company, and you can buy virtually the same multimeter for $15.82. Throw in Deal Extreme's free shipping (since the terminal dues it pays are so low) versus the $5.95 Radio Shack has to tack on, and a multimeter from Deal Extreme costs you just $15.82, while Radio Shack charges $30.94 -- more than double.Of course, that lower price does reflect cheaper manufacturing costs in China. But take the example of a USB flash drive that sells for $11.99 on the Radio Shack website and almost the identical drive for only a dollar more ($12.99) at another Chinese website, DinoDirect. Yet thanks again to free shipping, DinDirect can sell its flash drive to a U.S. customer at $12.99, while U.S. shipping costs drive Radio Shack's price up to $17.94.The skewing of the e-commerce playing field doesn't stop there. Take a soldering iron for electronics that actually costs less from Radio Shack than from the Chinese website DHGate: $14.99 versus $17.53.   The discriminating customer, however, soon notices that with DHGate's free shipping he will only pay $17.53 getting his device from China, instead of the $20.94 he'd have to pay Radio Shack when shipping inside the U.S. is added in.Now, the Radio Shack customer doesn't always pay shipping. For orders over $30 shipping is free, as well as for orders over 2 kilograms. But Radio Shack's business model for staying in business depended on those 2-kg-or-less orders, the staple of their DYI electronics geek customer base. Those customers easily used their iPads to find websites that delivered the same for less. Thanks to the UPU's convoluted rules, many if not all of those websites originate in China.So did the UPU really kill Radio Shack? Certainly the circumstantial evidence suggests that allowing China to ship packages virtually for free within the U.S. gives its e-commerce customers an unfair advantage that goes far beyond Radio Shack to America's entire online retail industry. Even Amazon, with its massive economies of scale, has raised its voice against this postal malpractice. Smaller businesses that make a living on eBay are even more vulnerable.Leveling the e-commerce playing field has to start with reform of the UPU's outdated rules and its skewed pricing system for international postal shipping. The UPU meets every four years to set prices -- the next meeting is in Istanbul in late September. Reform should start by moving China up out of Category 3 to Category 2 or even 1, where it really belongs.Then Congress needs to stop the USPS subsidizing Chinese e-commerce through misguided policies like ePacket, set up in 2010 to offer additional services to Chinese companies shipping small packages to the U.S. That's dealt a devastating blow to U.S. eBay vendors -- and since ePacket was extended in 2015 to Alibaba, the biggest of China's e-commerce predators, future victims won't just be eBay vendors. (The USPS, by the way, loses more than a dollar on every incoming ePacket shipment.)Who killed Radio Shack isn't a mystery at all. The real mystery is, when are the USPS, Congress and a new administration going to start pushing back on China's predatory e-commerce practices -- and the U.N. rules that support and subsidize it?

37,USB,"LAS VEGAS -- If the giant robot at the Malwarebytes booth and arcade game at WatchGuard weren't sufficient clues, maybe a Cylance speaker using Morpheus, from ""The Matrix,"" as a prop was: Black Hat USA 2016 in Las Vegas was the ultimate hacker-nerd mecca -- but with a serious focus of dealing with topics such as cyberwarfare, ransomware and IoT security.Black Hat's most recent iteration this month drew more than 15,000 cybersecurity-minded professionals to Las Vegas, topping last year's event by at least 4,000. Neon was seemingly the color du jour, in theme with the Strip's bright lights.The future of cybersecurity, experts say, is just as resplendent. Hackers are leveraging the Internet of Things to push new ransomware attacks. The Ukraine-Russia conflict is setting the model for modern cyberwarfare. Apple (AAPL) and Android are engaged in a donnybrook for mobile security dominance.All that along with the Terminators -- a nickname for drones capable of hacking and surveying industrial infrastructure complexes used by speaker Jeff Melrose, principal technologist for industrial automation company Yokogawa US.To keep pace, the cybersecurity industry can't fall back on old tricks, says Intel (INTC) Security CTO Steve Grobman. There's no ""silver bullet"" technology, and threat intelligence is faulty by design. It's all about innovation -- just ask the men who hacked a 2014 Jeep Cherokee ... again.""Nothing is perfect,"" Grobman told IBD. ""Attackers in the wild are using new methods, new techniques. And because of that, there's an inherent lag in addressing them (threats). Recognizing that cycle is important."" Benefiting from it is an absolute certainty.Your vehicle's infotainment center lights up with a message as you barrel down the freeway at 75 mph. ""Going somewhere? Too bad, we've blocked your system and brakes,"" the message taunts. ""To continue your journey and decrypt the system, give us a call.""Ransomware, malicious software designed to hold data hostage until a sum of money is paid, can be deadly. In February, hackers paralyzed Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles with a $3.6 million Bitcoin ransom on the facility's servers. Officials ultimately paid the equivalent of $17,000 in Bitcoin.Ransomware has yet to roil the consumer world, but some billions of Internet of Things devices slated to come online by 2020 offer a drool-worthy opening, Intel's Grobman says.""What if you couldn't drive your car for two months until you could get an appointment at the dealer, or pay $200 in ransomware?"" he posited. ""There's not yet ransomware on vehicles, but Intel Security's Advanced Threat Research team is trying to figure out the next generation of attacks.""TripWire researcher Craig Young breaks financially-motivated malware into three segments: ransomware, blackmail and extortion. Blackmailers will threaten to unveil some nebulous crime unless a victim pays up, extortioners prey on businesses with threats of crashing their operations unless a ransom is paid.Whatever the flavor, hackers are relying on statistics, says Nathan Shuchami, head of threat prevention for Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP). If only 10% of ransomware attacks reap financial rewards, that's a big success, he told IBD.""Most visible attacks are by cybercriminals using ransomware,"" he said. ""Attempts to hack banks and retailers represent the majority of these threats. ... These guys are interested in the easiest way to be successful.""They're generating billions in ransom. It's a simple effect because it's not targeted.""Cyberterrorists are just as likely to attack the IoT infrastructure as banks and retailers, he says. Flicking on and off the connected lights in a home might not spur much terror, but felling the entire Internet-linked vehicular world? That would be catastrophic.Uber Advanced Technologies Center researchers Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller proved in 2015, in a Black Hat presentation, that attacks on vehicles are viable. This year, they upped the ante from ""parlor tricks"" to cutting power steering, locking the parking brake and pulling the steering wheel of a 2014 Jeep Cherokee into a right-hand skid.Each of those attacks relied on a plugged-in USB device and, unlike their 2015 antics, were performed at speeds greater than 5 mph. But, Miller told the 2016 Black Hat audience, those vulnerabilities could have easily been exploited remotely.""The Jeep vulnerability was discovered by ethical researchers,"" Grobman said. ""But imagine if that exploit was done by a cybercriminal where all those Jeeps were impacted with ransomware. ... What happens as the same criminal business model starts moving into the consumer end?""Everyday citizens are already under attack in Ukraine, where Russian forces have occupied portions of the country since 2014, says Kenneth Geers, a senior research scientist for security firm Comodo. Geers is based in Ukraine and lives blocks from where Belarusian journalist Pavel Sheremet was killed in a car bombing.The death toll in Ukraine has rocketed into the thousands amid a conflict pitting pro-Westerners interested in deepening ties with the European Union and pro-separatists in the east aligned with Russia.The conflict is the bloodiest Europe has seen in decades. It's also quickly becoming an archetype for modern cyberwarfare, Geers told a Black Hat audience. The North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) last month officially recognized cyberspace as a military domain.So, even though Ukraine isn't a NATO member, it's already setting the stage for cyberwarfare in the 21st century. Geers says both sides are armed with ""weapons on mass disruption."" That seemed the case in 2014, when a virus crippled Ukraine's Central Election Commission ahead of the presidential election.Last December, hackers attacked a Ukrainian power plant, plunging 230,000 into darkness amid the harsh winter. The attack was a simple and highly effective spear-phishing venture that let hackers gain deeper access. Both countries also have hacked smart billboards with their own propaganda.But attribution is tricky, Geers said. Using a country's specific cyberattack M.O. -- technology, language and political motivations -- it's fairly simply to mimic an attacker, Intel's Grobman said. Retribution against an innocent, falsely accused third-party country could be ruinous.""It's difficult in cyberspace because everything is so evasive,"" Geers said. ""Can you get solid attribution? Can you get to the person at the keyboard? Absolutely. But you might need law enforcement and Russia is now finding out you can crowdsource an attack.""There ought to be limits to government power in cyberspace, Geers argues. ""There are plenty of governments that would take advantage of it in a heartbeat,"" he said. For that reason, the U.S. and its allies need to outline peacetime cyberinitiatives, he says.Does that include peacetime hacking? After all, cyberwarfare is reality, and the invisible battleground has real implications in the physical one that could mean the difference between a felled and an optional weapon, Geers says.Hackers, he says, also could ""turn out the lights"" to confuse leaders, or exploit holes in critical applications.""Then,"" he said, ""it might be a very long day on the battlefield.""

"
90,USB,"It's (almost) summer. Time for school graduations, and let's not forget dad on Father's Day.
"
91,USB,"Dads and grads love getting tech gifts, so here are a couple ideas we recently tested:
"
92,USB," Party time means music, and probably loud. If your grad's (or dad's) current speaker system is starting to sound a little wimpy, it may be time for Ulimate Ears Megaboom Bluetooth speaker. At $299.99, the Logitech (LOGI) product is available in a multitude of colors, the Megaboom has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that provides up to 20 hours of music and 360-degree sound. And it's LOUD, cranking out up to 90 decibels, which is about as loud as it gets before damage to your hearing begins to set in. It sounds great, and it's waterproof, so if it gets knocked into the pool, the party doesn't stop.
"
93,USB," Summer is also a great time to catch up on reading. Similar to streaming music services, Magzter Gold provides all-you-can-read issues of over 2,500 different magazines, with more being offered weekly. The Gold subscription, which lets dad or grad read numerous magazines, is only $9.99 a month. And there's no contract, dad or grad can cancel if they decide they'd rather watch YouTube.
"
94,USB," If someone you know is getting a new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 for Father's Day or graduation, why not give them a new $89.99 LifeProof Nuud case to keep it safe? The case is fully submersible up to 6.6 feet and is water-tested before it's packed, so the phone encased in it can withstand being dropped, or even dunked, into a pool. It comes in several colors and color combinations and has available belt clips and other mounts, so your grad or dad can clip it onto their bike or car dashboard.
"
95,USB," How smart does a smartwatch have to be? The new Apple Watch does a multitude of things, but not everyone wants that much technology on their wrist. The Martian Notifier smartwatch not only costs a lot less, at $129, but is a great-looking analog watch that pairs with your smartphone to notify you of calls and texts from a large number of apps that have selectable vibration patterns. A tap on the watch's display screen dismisses the notification. With a variety of colored bands, you can select just the combination that suits your recipient.
"
96,USB," Nothing says road trip like summer graduation. Before you let your graduates start theirs, gift them with the Cyntur JumperPack mini. At $99.99, it's somewhat more expensive than a set of jumper cables. But this compact portable battery doesn't require that someone stop and help out your graduate if they need a jump-start. In addition to the jumper cables that are packed with the book-size unit, there is also a 2.1-amp USB port, so your grads can top off their tablet or smartphone to call for roadside service if needed. Just charge it up with the included AC charger before they leave, and the JumperPack Mini will hold its charge for a year.
"
97,USB," Can a suitcase be a tech gift? Sure, if it's the new 22-inch Carry On With Integrated Suiter by Genius Pack. Besides an optional smartphone/tablet on-the-go charger, the Carry On has a checklist and separate compartments for toiletries and other must-haves for a summer trip. And if your dad or grad gets a bit overambitious with their packing, a zipper lets the bag expand an additional 2 inches. There's also a one-way air valve that lets the bag compress in depth by an inch or two, like those vacuum storage bags you see in the department stores. There's even an integrated suit carrier so your dad or grad will look good when they get to their destination. Finally, a separate compartment, accessible from the outside, stores worn clothing so it doesn't soil the clean clothes still packed in the luggage. The $218 Carry On has compartments for a water bottle, and even an optional mini-umbrella.
"
98,USB," A cool tech toy makes a great gift for grads of any age. Darkside Ollie, from Sphero.com, is a $129.99 can-shaped robot with interchangeable tires on each end that is controlled by a smartphone or tablet app from as far away as 100 feet. It comes with a USB cable to charge it and several sets of tires for different surfaces. Darkside Ollie glows in different colors, and there are smartphone and tablet apps that let your grad program the small robot. Darkside Ollie can go as fast as 14 mph, which lets it do tricks like jumps, flips and drifts. And if you gift a pair, you can have Darkside Ollie races.It's (almost) summer.

"
102,USB,"Does Mom have no luck with growing flowers and herbs? The $69 Miracle-Gro AeroGarden 3SL, from AeroGrow International, can turn her Thumb of Doom into a Green Thumb.
"
103,USB,"The AeroGarden is a hydroponic grow tank — it uses nutrient-enriched water instead of soil as the growing medium. An integrated grow light provides illumination at just the right color for maximum growth. The 3SL accommodates three seed pods, and our test unit had the Gourmet Herb pod.
"
104,USB,"There are also pods for flowers, peppers and other vegetables. The AeroGarden's water pump makes a slight noise, like that of an aquarium, and the grow light is on for 16 hours a day, so it needs to be placed where it won't annoy the family.
"
105,USB,"And in a few months, and with almost no care, Mom can have fresh basil, dill and parsley.
"
106,USB," AM/FM radios are passe nowadays. Thousands of specialized music and talk stations are on the Internet — and the $179 Grace Digital Mondo Internet Radio can receive them all.
"
107,USB,"It connects to the Web through your network and Wi-Fi and features a 3.5-inch color LCD screen that presents station information and time of day.
"
108,USB,"The Mondo can store five presets, and Mom can wake up to salsa or zydeco in the morning instead of just a beep or buzz.
"
109,USB," Moms need that first cup of coffee or tea in the morning to bravely face the day. Keurig's (GMCR) K-Cup coffee machines have become enormously popular over the past few years. But the new 2.0 model will work only with Keurig-licensed K-cups, leaving out a panoply of great coffee.
"
110,USB,"The $140 iCoffee Opus Coffee Brewer, from Remington Designs, promises to let you brew a better cup of coffee using a patented SpinBrew technology.
"
111,USB,"It also lets you use any K-cup coffee pod, as well pods that use RealCup or OneCup technology.
"
112,USB,"Our taste buds weren't sophisticated enough to make a value judgment on which machine made better coffee, but we liked the Opus' 75-ounce water reservoir and the rotary dial that lets you easily select cup sizes up to 12 ounces.
"
113,USB,"And while Keurig does license a large selection of coffee and vendors, you simply can't use plenty of terrific coffee in the new Keurig 2.0 brewers without resorting to a work-around to disable the 2.0 sensing system.
"
114,USB," Most moms would probably not be very excited getting an appliance as a Mother's Day present. But the Neato Robotics Botvac 85 might be an exception.
"
115,USB,"While a number of robotic vacuum cleaners are on the market, the Botvac does things differently.
"
116,USB,"Rather than wander around in a random pattern, the Botvac scans and maps the room and computes the most efficient path to take while avoiding furniture and other obstacles. And magnetic strips keep the Botvac in the area Mom wants cleaned.
"
117,USB,"Different models are available priced from $479 to the $599 Botvac 85 we tested, with the different models providing more or fewer brushes and filters.
"
118,USB," Is Mom into crafts like scrapbooking and card making? If so, Provo Craft and Novelty's Cricut Explore Air crafting cutter will let her produce more complex and decorative creations.
"
119,USB,"With a dual head that can hold a cutting blade and a marker, the Explore Air can cut a wide variety of materials, including card stock, vinyl and leather, and with an optional blade, foam board and even light metal. Mom can create cards, decorations and stencils to create projects limited only by her imagination. A free design application for the Apple (AAPL) iPad or PC is available for downloading, as are numerous projects.
"
120,USB,"Mom can even make 3D projects using Autodesk (ADSK) 123Design, and hundreds of project how-tos are downloadable so she can put the Cricut Explore Air to immediate use.
"
121,USB," On those days when Mom absolutely must get up early, Electrohome's $35 USB Alarm Clock can do the job admirably. It has AM and FM radios as well as a conventional buzzer, dual alarms so that Dad can wake up at a different time, and blue LED numbers that can be adjusted to one of four brightness settings.

123,USB,"Production of Apple's (AAPL) rumored big-screen iPad has been pushed back until September, dashing hopes for a new device near term to reinvigorate the company's lackluster tablet sales.
"
124,USB,"The 12.9-inch tablet, dubbed the iPad Pro, has been delayed because of issues with the supply of a new type of display panel, according to media reports. Apple was expected to begin production of the iPad Pro this quarter, Bloomberg reported. Current iPads have screen sizes of 7.9 and 9.7 inches.
"
125,USB,"The larger-screen iPad will be targeted at the enterprise market. Apple and IBM (IBM) forged a partnership last July to create business apps for the iPad and to sell tablets to corporate customers. They delivered the first wave of business apps in December.
"
126,USB,"Apple is thinking about adding USB 3.0 and other ports to the iPad Pro to satisfy enterprise users, the Wall Street Journal reported. Current iPads only have Apple's proprietary Lightning port for charging and accessories.
"
127,USB,"An industry-standard USB 3.0 port would allow iPad Pro users to transfer data to and from other devices and provide new back-up capabilities.
"
128,USB,"Apple also is considering adding ports to connect a keyboard and mouse, the Journal said. Other media reports have speculated that the iPad Pro could use a stylus pen for more accurate digital inking, drawing and other applications.
"
129,USB,"The iPad Pro will use Oxide LCD display technology, DigiTimes reported. The new displays are faster and more power-efficient than the screens used on current iPads. Sharp would be the main supplier of the Oxide LCD screens, DigiTimes said.

Current iPads have screen sizes of 7.9 and 9.7 inches.The larger-screen iPad will be targeted at the enterprise market. Apple and IBM (IBM) forged a partnership last July to create business apps for the iPad and to sell tablets to corporate customers. They delivered the first wave of business apps in December.Apple is thinking about adding USB 3.0 and other ports to the iPad Pro to satisfy enterprise users, the Wall Street Journal reported. Current iPads only have Apple's proprietary Lightning port for charging and accessories.An industry-standard USB 3.0 port would allow iPad Pro users to transfer data to and from other devices and provide new back-up capabilities.Apple also is considering adding ports to connect a keyboard and mouse, the Journal said. Other media reports have speculated that the iPad Pro could use a stylus pen for more accurate digital inking, drawing and other applications.The iPad Pro will use Oxide LCD display technology, DigiTimes reported. The new displays are faster and more power-efficient than the screens used on current iPads. Sharp would be the main supplier of the Oxide LCD screens, DigiTimes said.Apple stock was down 1.5% in afternoon trading, near 126, on the stock market today.RELATED:Apple losing tablet share to Lenovo, 'white box' vendorsApple could quadruple its total addressable market by 2020

"
138,USB,"Outdoor living rooms, spa-like baths, retractable glass walls, home-management tech systems — and pet suites. These home amenities aren't just the province of the top 1%.
"
139,USB,"They're among the most popular features homebuyers and renovators want in a home these days, regardless of their budgets, according to builders, designers and remodelers.
"
140,USB,"""Residential trends usually start in the luxury market and trickle down to the rest of the market,"" said Jeffrey Lake, national director of architecture for Irvine, Calif.-based Standard Pacific Homes (SPF).
"
141,USB,"To help determine how buyers use their homes and what features they want the most, Standard Pacific conducts ""livability"" studies with many buyers who have been in their new home six months to a year, interviewing them in person or online.
"
142,USB,"A Real Pet Project
"
143,USB,"One result of those interviews led the company to new options for buyers: pet suites. Ranging from 50 square feet to 170 square feet, they feature low shower stalls with handheld faucets for ""puppy washes."" They boast ample storage for toys, leashes and outfits, and the larger suites feature washers and dryers.
"
144,USB,"""It's been getting rave reviews,"" Lake said. ""It's an option we're offering in a huge number of our communities.""
"
145,USB,"A more common desire, and one that mirrors a huge nationwide trend, is for outdoor living rooms that extend the indoor spaces. Like some other builders, Standard Pacific integrates flooring, installs movable glass walls to eliminate visual barriers and often puts in outdoor fireplaces, flat-screen TVs and refrigerators.
"
146,USB,"""It's more than a covered patio,"" Lake said.
"
147,USB,"Standard Pacific also extends outdoor living spaces in master suites, where models are furnished with resort-style beds or chaises.
"
148,USB,"What Baby Boomers Want
"
149,USB,"Near the top of the want list for all types of buyers are spa-like baths, home designers and builders say.
"
150,USB,"""The baby boom generation has been traveling their entire lives and staying in four-star hotels. They know what a spa bath looks like and they want to have it in their homes,"" said Timothy McCarthy, managing director of Traditions of America, a developer of active-adult housing communities in Pennsylvania.
"
151,USB,"Traditions of America's designers help buyers customize their homes, which average between $300,000 and $400,000. But some buyers spend up to $300,000 more to customize them, McCarthy says.
"
152,USB,"""They don't want to buy an off-the-shelf model. People are investing in their homes. This is their last, best home and they want to enjoy it,"" he said.
"
153,USB,"Millennials may lack the budgets of older buyers, but don't appear to want to skimp on design.
"
154,USB,"""Millennials today would rather have a smaller space but nicer features and options,"" said Joe Duffus, CEO of interior design and merchandising firm Builders Designs, which works with homebuilders and developers.
"
155,USB,"Millennials, he says, are ""the most design-savvy buying group ever.""
"
156,USB,"Automation Nation
"
157,USB,"They are also probably the most tech-savvy homebuyer. Homes catering to first-time buyers will get a little smaller but home technology will become increasingly prevalent, according to panelists at the International Builders Show held in Las Vegas earlier this year.
"
158,USB,"Home automation systems for all age groups are ""hugely popular,"" Duffus says. Various systems allow occupants to program and remotely control temperature, lighting, security and more.
"
159,USB,"""I don't know any builder that is not using a programmable thermostat right now, even for first-time buyers,"" Duffus said.
"
160,USB,"Some popular automated thermostat systems used by builders are by Nest and Honeywell (HON), he says.
"
161,USB,"Kitchens and baths are the two most popular remodeling jobs by far, according to a survey by the National Association of Home Builders. The reason cited: a desire for better or newer amenities.
"
162,USB,"In bathrooms, jetted tubs are out. Soaking tubs placed away from walls are in. So are large walk-in showers with frameless doors and multiple shower heads.
"
163,USB,"""For those who can't afford both, they will settle on a larger shower,"" said Robert Criner, chairman of the NAHB Remodelers and president of Criner Remodeling in Newport News, Va.
"
164,USB,"In kitchens, said Criner, ""everybody wants islands."" And they're bigger than ever. The average island in a Standard Pacific home runs 5 feet by 9 feet, but some are 15-16 feet long. And sometimes two are put back-to-back or side-by-side to make them doubly large.
"
165,USB,"Homeowners also want base cabinets with rollout trays and drawers for nesting bowls and pots and pans, Criner says. Also popular in kitchens are hidden walk-in pantries, coffee bars and home-management areas for stowing and handling mail, recipes and other papers.
"
166,USB,"Criner integrates USB ports in kitchen outlets in all his remodeling projects so that occupants can charge their mobile phones and tablets. He often puts them in islands.
"
167,USB,"LED lighting is popular in both kitchens and baths. ""People like the energy efficiency of them and they last much longer,"" Criner said.
"
168,USB,"""White is probably the No. 1 trend in the kitchen and bathroom,"" but gray tones are becoming popular, too, says Duffus.
"
169,USB,"Other hot trends in homes, he says, are quartz countertops, distressed or textured wide-planked hardwood floors and ceramic tile made to look like wood.
"
170,USB,"Caesarstone (CSTE), based in Israel, is one fast-growing supplier of quartz countertops. Mohawk Industries (MHK) has the flooring market covered.
"
171,USB,"""This is kind of a shock to people, but chrome is coming back in a big way,"" Duffus said, in bathroom and kitchen fixtures such as faucets and shower heads. Manufacturers have ""amped up the design.""
"
172,USB,"Among the biggest design trends in remodeling projects winning prizes in the NAHB's 2015 ""Best in American Living Awards"" are white-on-white kitchens (cabinets, countertops and back splashes), doubled kitchen islands and sculptural stand-alone bathtubs.
"
173,USB,"Homes With Good Energy
"
174,USB,"Energy efficiency was a big theme in another recent survey conducted by the NAHB. Among the 10 features homebuilders said they are most likely to include in a typical new home this year were low-emissivity windows to reflect sunlight and heat, Energy Star appliances and windows, and programmable thermostats.
"
175,USB,"Beyond energy efficiency, buyers increasingly want to live in ""healthy"" homes, says Sarah Barnard, an interior designer in Santa Monica, Calif. ""They're interested in nontoxic materials and clean-air quality achieved in the baseline construction of either a new build or remodel,"" she said.
"
176,USB,"Healthy living trumps environmental sustainability these days, she says. ""The distance the item has to travel to get to the job site is less important than the inherent materials.""
"
177,USB,"Healthier materials include water-based paints and adhesives that don't throw off gases, natural fibers such as wool carpets vs. synthetics and natural stones.
"
178,USB,"Features routinely built into homes may get more advanced if builders start adopting the kind of innovations featured in the aspirational ""New American Home"" of 2015, a high-concept dwelling built by Blue Heron in conjunction with the International Builders Show.

"
186,USB,"This year, the Fed examined 31 banks, each with assets exceeding $50 billion. All 31 banks passed DFAST last week, which means they met the Fed's minimum capital requirements. It was the first time they all passed since the test's 2009 inception.

189,USB,"This is the first year Citigroup will be able to boost its dividend since the financial crisis.

232,USB,"Tesla Motors' sales will look a whole lot better in its third quarter report Nov. 5 than investors may have thought Monday, if the electric-car maker delivers on its CEO's late-night Twitter tweets.Tesla Motors' (TSLA) stock jumped 9.5% to 242.77 on the stock market today after falling nearly 6% Monday on an unconfirmed report that the company's sales have declined.""Article in @WSJ re Tesla sales is incorrect. September was a record high WW and up 65% year-over-year in North America,"" Musk tweeted from his @ElonMusk Twitter (TWTR) account very late Monday night. ""Also, lease price improvement is due to US Bank deal. It is *not* a discount. Revenue to Tesla is unchanged.""The Wall Street Journal said on Monday, in a report updated just before the stock market close, that with its Model S sales declining in its home market, Tesla was launching incentives that cut the monthly lease price for the sedan in an attempt to convince potential customers that buying one would be a safe financial bet.The report heavily cited data from industry data-tracker WardsAuto.The WSJ's Detroit bureau chief, John Stoll, who co-authored the article with Mike Ramsey, shot back on Twitter Tuesday that: ""On tesla ... @elonmusk practicing savvy PR or not reading article. WSJ article doesn't focus on September sales or WW — US YTD.""The article had said, citing WardsAuto data, that through September Tesla had sold 10,335 sedans in its home market, down 26% vs. the same period a year earlier. The article further noted that with Tesla aiming to sell 35,000 cars in 2014, it would need to sell about 17,500 in the U.S. and ""at its current sales pace, the automaker will miss that target by a wide margin.""California-based Tesla has a waiting list for its cars. As it tries to ramp up deliveries abroad in newly opened markets such as Europe and China, the company has been making allocation decisions about what geographies should get a batch of vehicles and when.Discussing China demand, Musk said on Tesla's fourth-quarter 2013 conference call in February, ""It seems unlikely that we'll be able to satisfy demand in China this year.""On the same call, he said, ""Something we try to do is try to balance customer wait times because, for example, like last quarter, we actually did quite a few European deliveries because customers in Europe have been waiting for a really long time to receive their car. ... We're slowing down U.S. deliveries and trying to make people as happy as possible, given the production constraints.""Model S demand wavered around the time of a few reports of fires earlier this year, but the wavering appeared to be temporary.Production of the crossover SUV Model X is planned for 2015, and Musk termed demand for it ""very high"" on the Q1 call. So if there is any abatement of demand for the Model S sedan in the U.S., it could be both linked to anticipation of the Model X here and obscured by Tesla's decision-making on where to allocate deliveries around the world to address demand abroad.On the leasing part of the Twitter tussle, Musk had said Saturday in a Tesla blog post that US Bancorp (USB) had begun offering leasing for Tesla car buyers in the U.S.""This will lower monthly lease payments by as much as 25% on a new Model S,"" he said in the post, noting that the bank ""has a much lower cost of capital than us.""The Tesla website now shows the cost of leasing a Model S with the baseline 60 kilowatt-hour battery at a minimum of $777 a month for the $71,070 car before government alternative-energy incentives, with $6,477 due at signing.In other recent Tesla news, Toyota (TM) said Friday that it has sold some shares, according to a Reuters report, which noted that Toyota had invested $50 million in the California startup before its 2010 initial public offering. It also noted that Daimler had recently sold its remaining 4% stake in Tesla.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter: @IBD_DHowell.

Prices range from $399 to more than $549.The sub-$400 price point is key for Microsoft as it tries to turn its Surface business into a more serious challenger to other computer hardware makers.

The software giant kicked off its consumer hardware push in 2012 with the launch of the Surface RT.

239,USB,"""Back To The Future"" foresaw an era of video phone calls and personal drones. Now another prediction from the movie series could soon become part of daily life: smart clothing that can self-adjust to its wearer's needs.While an auto-drying jacket like Marty McFly's is some way off, smart clothes are already here. They can heat up, cool down, change color or even size themselves. In fact, the U.S. team at the Winter Olympics in South Korea wore self-heating jackets made by Ralph Lauren (RL).Companies ranging from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are developing smart clothing technology. As apparel makers hunt for tech know-how and tech nerds look for some fashion sense, the clothing trend is stitching together unlikely partners — and could reshape the apparel industry.A partnership between Alphabet's Google and Levi Strauss could be a sign of things to come. They have brought to market the $350 Commuter X, a denim jacket that lets the user control a phone through the use of gestures alone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe coming years will see a variety of ""really wacky partnerships"" between fashion companies and tech specialists, said International Data Corp. analyst Ramon Llamas.""The first time you saw Google and Levi's you probably said to yourself, 'How did this happen?' "" he said in an interview. ""But over time it came to make sense and was a natural fit.""In addition to self-adjusting clothes, smart clothing includes internet-connected clothing. Juniper Research estimated last month that connected clothing is the fastest-growing segment of the wearable technology sector.For now, smartwatches like the Apple (AAPL) watch and activity trackers like the Fitbit (FIT) dominate the overall wearables market. Juniper sees shipments of those devices hitting 137 million this year, with compound annual growth over the next two years projected at 31% for smartwatches and 6% for activity trackers.Meanwhile, Juniper sees 102% compound annual growth in connected clothing, estimating it will be a $1 billion industry in 2020 with 7 million shipments. Just two years later, they will more than quadruple to 30 million shipments.Smart clothes also differ from today's wearables in that they will have longer ranges and more accuracy. They also won't be limited to a small touch point at the wrist.Developers are trying to keep smart clothes practical too. Google and Levi's Commuter X jacket is machine washable and can go in a tumble dryer. But a ""snap tag"" that contains tiny electronics and a battery must first come off.Google is developing a system that weaves technology into the very fabric of clothing as part of its Project Jacquard. Project leader Ivan Poupyrev says Google isn't planning to make its own apparel and instead aims to ""empower existing apparel makers.""Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton believes successful synergies between tech and apparel companies will be a key to success. That will help the smart clothes market be worth several billion dollars in the next few years, he estimates.""I think we are going to see a lot of partnerships like that, and that's what is going to push the market forward,"" he said. ""This combination of design and technology is a really important part of the story.""Perhaps the most famous example of self-adjusting smart clothing on the market is Nike's HyperAdapt shoes, which boast ""Back To The Future""-inspired self-tying laces. Stars such as tennis champion Serena Williams and soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo promoted the first edition. Initially priced at $720, the highly coveted shoes are being sold on the secondhand market for more than $2,000 per pair.A second version is in the works that will offer upgraded technology at more accessible prices. Nike's vice president for design and special projects, Tinker Hatfield, says the HyperAdapt 2.0 will be a performance basketball sneaker.""We don't really know when it's going to hit the market or be in the NBA, but it will be there for sure,"" he said last September.Microsoft has also explored the technological applications. Researchers previously unveiled a prototype smart scarf that users can heat up using a smartphone app.South Korean electronics giant Samsung has a myriad of offerings, including a golf shirt that can warn wearers of the weather conditions and a solar-powered bag that can charge cellphones.Meanwhile, Under Armour has brought to market shoes that track a runner's data through GPS. Shoes from the Under Armour Hovr line start at $110 and go as high as $140. The company also sells ""athletic recovery sleepwear,"" pajamas that beam infrared radiation onto the wearer's body to boost recovery.And Ralph Lauren looks to use the Winter Olympics publicity as a springboard to launch new smart clothes with smaller battery packs and controls linked to a mobile app. They could arrive on the market as early as this winter.If Ralph Lauren's self-heating jacket is any indication, the new offerings will feature crisscrossing partnerships. The Olympic jacket's conductive ink came from DowDuPont (DWDP). Precision printing company Butler Technologies applied the ink. Apparel maker 99Degrees attached the heating system to the lining. Design and engineering firm Key Tech made the battery pack. Principled Design's ConnexI/O e-textile connector interface linked the battery to the jacket. And Better Team USA made the jackets.That approach can be seen in New York-based Loomia, which started four years ago and makes flexible circuitry that can emit heat and/or light, as well as sense and track data.It has worked with companies such as Google, Singapore-based circuit maker Flex (FLEX), British retailer TopShop and apparel maker VF Corp. A key part of Loomia's business plan is that it is not manufacturing individual pieces of clothing. Instead, it is providing products to commercial partners, such as apparel makers, on a mass scale.Designer Julianna Bass collaborated with Loomia to develop a color-changing textile used in two dresses for her Spring/Summer18 collection. They were showcased on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week.Loomia has also solved one of the great challenges for the technology: creating e-textiles that are machine washable. While the details are secret intellectual property, Loomia's breakthrough comes from the way its textile circuitry is patterned and the fact the fabric itself is a circuit. The custom insulation adds further protection.Over the next year, heated jackets and boots with Loomia's technology will be coming to market. The materials are also seen as being useful for furniture.""There was a three-year process finding the core technology in our lab, finding domestic partners who would be willing to try these processes to scale in the production of these textile circuits, and working through growing pains with our suppliers and manufacturers,"" Loomia CEO Janett Liriano said. ""Now we're at the point where we are getting to market and selling these textile circuits B2B (business-to-business) to brands to integrate into their products.""For mass adoption to occur, consumers will have to overcome a few anxieties. For one, battery-powered clothes, like phones, will carry the risk of exploding. But given the ubiquity of smartphones, wearables, and other personal gadgets, consumers have shown they can live with that risk.Also, smart clothing will not be cheap. Ralph Lauren's self-heating jackets first went on sale for $2,500 and were later auctioned on eBay for $6,000. But consider that wildly successful Canada Goose (GOOS) sells parkas that aren't self-adjusting or laced with circuitry for $1,000.Google's Poupyrev believes smart clothing technology trends make ""ubiquitous connectivity"" an attractive feature for consumers, who might see connected clothing as a practical investment. And Loup's Clinton thinks that a decade from now smart apparel products will be ""almost the standard.""""Over the next few years it will be more experimental, getting consumers comfortable with the idea of having smart apparel,"" Clinton said. ""There's always a bridge where you have to integrate the consumer into the new world. But I think once people see the benefits of the clothes, the demand for them will be pretty significant.""A spokeswoman for Julianna Bass said their color-changing clothes were well received at New York Fashion Week. Demand is expected to grow going forward.""Color-changing offers the ability to extend the life of a garment and allows more flexible identifications,"" said Carolyn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the fashion house.But even before smart clothes catch on with consumers, the path to mass adoption may begin with industry.In the next five years, sectors like health care, pro sports, the military and emergency services like firefighting will adopt intelligent clothes, predicts scientist Pekka Tuomaala. He leads the Smart Clothes 2.0 project at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The scientist adds that companies have signaled particular interest in self-heating features.""We human beings tend to be lazy,"" he said. ""If our clothing would be able to help us we would most likely use such products and services.""IDC's Llamas also sees heavy industry putting connected clothes to use. For example, supervisors will be able to track the heart rate of workers and know if a break is necessary.The military is another obvious candidate for such technology. British defense giant BAE Systems has developed an alternative use for e-textiles. Its Broadsword Spine is a power and data network built into clothes using conductive fabrics instead of wires and cables.The technology allows electronic devices to be plugged straight into a vest, jacket or belt. Custom-built connectors hook directly into power and data sources via a USB port. It saves an estimated 40% of weight, a major benefit for infantrymen already loaded down with gear.Circling back to the world of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, Clinton believes the future is bright for smart clothes. He says future inventors will use both the science and the fiction of the past to inspire smart clothing designs.""I think a lot of our movies in the past got the future pretty right. Even with 'Back To The Future,' Nike released self-tying sneakers so that became a reality,"" Clinton said. ""In lots of ways fiction and entertainment inspire entrepreneurs to create the products they think are really cool when they see movies as kids.""As the next generation thinks about what they can build on top of these products, innovation will just compound.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

The Russell 2000 was down 0.1% in the early going.Fed minutes due out this afternoon provide a centerpiece to the economic news on the stock market today. Oil prices were attracting early attention, as the May contract for West Texas Intermediate oil swung up more than 1% to above $51 a barrel — its first move back above $51 since a steep sell-off on March 8. The U.S. Energy Information Administration releases its weekly oil inventories report at 10:30 a.m. ET.JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) rose less than 1% on the Dow industrials. Apple (AAPL) dipped 0.1%, dropping on unconfirmed reports that the company would delay release of its new iPhone until October or November.Panera Bread (PNRA) rolled up 13.5% after agreeing to a $7.5 billion takeover by privately held JAB.

242,USB,"Cypress Semiconductor (CY) received several price-target hikes to its stock Wednesday in the wake of its annual analyst day, while leading chipmaker Intel (INTC) earned cautious but optimistic reviews for its technology and manufacturing event.Cypress got price-target hikes from at least three Wall Street firms: Craig Hallum, Needham and Pacific Crest Securities, following Tuesday's analyst day.Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill reiterated his buy rating on Cypress and raised his price target to 18 from 14.Cypress shares fell 0.3% to 32.14 by the closing bell on the stock market today. Cypress hit a 2-year intraday high of 14.98 on Tuesday before reversing lower.Gill sees ""continued upside on higher earnings power"" for the San Jose, Calif.-based chipmaker. Cypress makes microcontrollers and chips for wireless connectivity, memory, power management, universal serial bus and other applications.""CY's earnings growth trajectory is the fastest in our coverage universe,"" he said in a report.Cypress stands to benefit if Apple (AAPL) and Samsung adopt USB-C ports to their upcoming smartphones, Gill said.Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh maintained his overweight rating on Cypress and upped his price target to 17 from 14.""We left Cypress' analyst day incrementally more constructive on the company's long-term growth prospects in auto, IoT (internet of things) and USB,"" he said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: Cypress Semiconductor stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, meaning it has outperformed 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

243,USB,"The rally in regional banks has moderated, but two ETFs that track the industry are using that pause to refresh their charts.The charts of SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT) look like twins, the way they've behaved so similarly. Both have pulled back from highs reached at the start of March and are testing the 50-day moving average.With a bit more of a bounce, both exchange traded funds will be in buy areas. At the moment, the support at the 50-day line is not convincing enough. Watch for shares of both to climb at least one more point, and preferably in above-average volume.No chart reader would dispute that both ETFs were in need of a break. They shot up starting in mid-November on a combination of rising interest rates and President Trump's election. Trump and Republicans are trying to ease banking regulations, and higher rates are widening interest margins for banks.While SPDR Regional Banking has 100 stocks, iShares Regional Banks has about half as many.Still, the two portfolios are similar in terms of the largest holdings. PNC Financial Services (PNC), SunTrust Bank (STI), M&T Bank (MTB), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), Regions Financial (RF), Citizens Financial (CFG) and BB&T (BBT) are top-10 holdings in both funds.The two differ in that iShares Regional Banks has a big stake in U.S. Bancorp (USB) (more than 16% of the portfolio) while the superregional bank doesn't even make the SPDR Regional Banking portfolio.The holdings of SPDR Regional Banking are more spread out, with no single stock accounting for more than 4% of the total weighting.With the Federal Reserve expected to increase interest rates by a quarter-point two more times this year, the fundamental backdrop for regional banks is generally favorable. Higher rates tend to widen the margin between interest earned on loans vs. interest paid on deposits.LPL Financial, for example, had this to say: ""Steepening yield curve, deregulation, expanded credit access, strong fourth quarter 2016 earnings, and positive revisions are all supportive.""But Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, saw an economic warning sign in the banking sector. ""In the U.S., bank loan growth has slowed significantly since Q4 and the Atlanta Fed's GDP nowcast is only indicating 1.2% U.S. growth for the current quarter, compared to over 2.5% as recently as early February."" The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

244,USB,"U.S. stock indexes stumbled Monday afternoon, with a step down in volume being the only consolation.The Nasdaq lost 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on both major exchanges vs. the same time Friday.Price losses in declining volume are generally considered less threatening than those in accelerating turnover.Initial public offering Snap (SNAP) fell 7% in its third session on the NYSE. Several analysts began coverage of the stock with a sell rating.Snap, an internet stock, lost 32 cents a share in 2015 and then lost 44 cents in 2016. The Street expects Snap to again lose 44 cents a share in 2017 and then lose 26 cents in 2018.While Snap also has failed to post a profit in any of the past eight quarters, revenue soared 890%, 1,255%, 666% and 406% in the past four quarters.The FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — were, with one exception, making routine moves in below-average volume. The exception was Netflix. The internet TV network rose about 1% in volume about 35% above normal.Those four stocks together make up about 14% of the Nasdaq's weighting. Toss in Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) and the figure rises to 25.7%. Apple fell 0.4% in volume 20% below average. Microsoft edged up 0.5% in trade 40% below average.The market-leading bank sector showed similar action. PowerShares KBW Bank (KBWB) exchange-traded fund gapped down 1.2%, but volume was about 80% below average. The ETF reflects the Nasdaq KBW Bank Index. The largest weightings in the ETF are Wells Fargo (WFC), which was down about 1% in volume 40% slower than usual; Citigroup (C), off about 1% in trade 33% below average; and U.S. Bancorp (USB) down more than 0.5% in volume 15% behind its usual pace.In the Big Cap 20, which has six bank stocks, five of the bank stocks were down in below-average volume.

For more information on Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Apple has two primary reasons for keeping its Lightning connector: sustain royalties from the iOS accessories ecosystem, and hardware size considerations, Kuo said. A USB-C port is larger than a Lightning port.Apple will source new components from Texas Instruments (TXN) and Cypress Semiconductor (CY) to enable the faster charging, Kuo said.The iPhone 8 is expected to be a major redesign, timed with the 10th-anniversary of the first iPhone release. It is expected to feature a borderless OLED display, glass-sandwich design, no physical home button, 3D sensing for augmented reality and facial recognition for secure log-in. Apple also is expected to release upgraded versions of its current-generation handsets that will be called the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus.Apple stock ended trading up 0.8% to 139.76 on the stock market today.

248,USB,"Scandal: An internationally accredited information-technology asset-management firm says the IRS has some explaining to do as our patience is taxed with tales of even more convenient computer crashes.Private-sector organizations as vast as the Internal Revenue Service typically have redundancy built into their information technology systems, as secure record keeping is the key to managing their businesses and staying in business. Such records, if nothing else, are often required to be kept by law, and often by the IRS itself.As we have noted, Lois Lerner's lost emails from the critical period when the IRS was serving as a political arm of the Obama administration and targeting Tea Party and other conservative groups suggest by themselves a conspiracy to obstruct justice as well as being a violation of the Federal Records Act, which requires paper copies of such critical emails to be printed and stored just in case of computer problems.This conspiracy to obstruct justice is further suggested by some Lerner emails that she and the Obama administration wished had been lost — especially one sent by Lerner to a Maria Hooke.""I had a question today about OCS,"" Lerner stated in the email. ""I was cautioning folks about email, how we have had several occasions where Congress has asked for emails and there has been an electronic search for responsive emails — so we need to be cautious about what we say in emails.""OCS is the IRS' Office Communications Server, a form of online chat system that circumvents email.When she learned that OCS messages were not set to automatically save, Lerner wrote, ""Perfect.""Clearly Lerner had a keen interest in keeping her communications from Congress and the American people.Lerner's hard drive allegedly crashed, which cannot be verified because her hard drive has since been destroyed and/or recycled. That questionable hard-drive direction came just 10 days after House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, the Republican from Michigan, first wrote a letter asking if the IRS was targeting nonprofit groups.Now we learn, as reported by the Daily Caller, that IRS Deputy Associate Chief Counsel Thomas Kane said in transcribed congressional testimony that more IRS officials experienced computer crashes, bringing the total to ""less than 20,"" also saying the agency does not know if these additional lost emails may be backed up somewhere.On Monday, the International Association of Information Technology Asset Managers, which deals with such technical questions regarding computer hardware and record retention on a regular basis and which has reacted with the same incredulity as the rest of us, released a list of six basic questions the IRS needs to answer.1. First, what happened to the IRS' IT asset managers who seemingly vanished during this critical period? IAITAM , which runs the only worldwide certification program for IT asset managers, says its records show that at least three IRS IT asset managers were moved out of their positions at the time of the May 2013 inspector general's report that detailed the agency's targeting practices. What can they tell us?2. The hard drives in question are federal property and cannot be destroyed or recycled without proper documentation. ""Proper IT asset management requires clear proof and records of destruction when drives are wiped or destroyed,"" notes IAITAM President and founder Barbara Rembiesa. Where are these records?3. IAITAM asks if the drives were destroyed by an outside IT asset destruction unit, a not-unusual practice among federal agencies. If so, it adds an entire second layer of documentation of the destruction of these assets, including who approved it.4. What are the IRS' specific policies and procedures on document retention when hard drives are damaged or destroyed? In most large private-sector organizations, hard drives and computers are just not tossed in the dumpster or dropped off at the local recycling center until recovery of the lost data is assured.5. What is the disaster recovery policy at the IRS, an agency responsible for our most sensitive tax information, particularly in light of its statistically implausible number of hard drive crashes?6. Where are Lerner's emails from her BlackBerry device and what is on the enterprise server? Some have even suggested Lerner may have off-loaded her emails to what is known as a USB flash drive and still has them in her possession, another federal offense.The IRS is counting on the general public's relative ignorance of computer technology to believe its smoke-and-mirror cover-up.But in the age of the iPad and iPhone, even a child knows that something does not compute here.

250,USB,"The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady on Wednesday, as expected, as it waits for clearer evidence that rising economic confidence will fuel an upturn in growth.The Fed, which was unanimous in its decision, noted that ""business fixed investment has remained soft"" although ""measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late.""""The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate,"" the Fed said in a statement.Treasury yields trimmed their gains and stocks wobbled up and down after the Fed signaled no rush to hike, meaning it's unlikely the next hike will come at the mid-March meeting. Apple (AAPL) pushed the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite slightly higher. Apple itself rose more than 7% following its strong holiday quarter earnings late Tuesday. The S&P 500, fractionally lower before the Fed announcement, closed slightly higher.Investors had been on guard for more hawkish signals after strong economic reports on Wednesday morning. The Institute for Supply Management Index rose 1.3 points last month to 56, the fastest pace since November 2014 and well above the 50 neutral level. Meanwhile, payroll firm ADP estimated that U.S. companies added 246,000 jobs in January, much stronger than the 168,000 that Wall Street expected.Those reports outweighed news that General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) saw sales fall in January after a big December. GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler shares fell slightly on the stock market today.Signs of faster growth and prospects for higher interest rates, good for banks' net interest margins, helped lift bank stocks in Wednesday trading. Bank of America (BAC) rose 1.1%, while U.S. Bancorp (USB) advanced 0.7% to an all-time high.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's agenda faces a large degree of uncertainty. If the WTO found the border tax backed by House Republicans — and increasingly by the White House — to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis.Fed policymakers caught markets off-guard in December when a number of them built President Trump's planned fiscal stimulus into their hawkish forecast for three rate hikes in 2017. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that it's not clear the economy needs stimulus to reach full employment.But after a tumultuous first week and a half of his presidency, Fed policymakers are likely done trying to predict what Trump will do and how his policies will affect the economy. Now the Fed, like investors, is in wait-and-see mode to watch what can get through Congress, when it will affect the real economy, and whether Trump's immigration and trade policies curb or offset the force of his pro-growth moves.For now, markets still expect just two rate hikes in 2017, coming in June and December. After the Fed's announcement, markets were pricing in just 17.7% odds that the next hike will come on March 15.RELATED:U.S. Manufacturing Gears Up As 'America First' Trump Takes Office Ford, GM, Fiat Chrysler U.S. Sales Decline In January

253,USB,"Tech stocks were under some pressure in early trade Wednesday, as stock futures steered toward a positive start.Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average were 0.3% above fair value though IBM (IBM) dragged on early action. S&P 500 futures nosed up 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures scratched out a 0.4% gain.Along with IBM, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Lam Research (LRCX), railroad CSX (CSX) and United Airlines (UAL) were among the leading names active in early trading.Medical and tech stocks had powered the market Tuesday, as the major indexes seized powerful gains in rising trade. Netflix (NFLX), Goldman Sachs (GS) and UnitedHealth (UNH) posted first-quarter results that all carried elements of upside surprise. Investors sent more stocks to news highs than any session in the past five weeks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all climbed above their 50-day moving averages in Tuesday's session. That technical line had presented a possible barrier to the market's week-old uptrend. The test through the remainder of the week is whether the benchmark indexes are able to maintain that new level of support.Among the top tech stocks in early motion, Intuitive Surgical bolted 5.4% higher. The maker of the da Vinci robotic surgical system reported a 25% EPS gain and an 18% rise in revenue for its first quarter late Tuesday. The number of surgical systems shipped soared 39% during the quarter, with procedures performed using the da Vinci system rising 15%.Intuitive's shares rose 4.7% in regular trade Tuesday, the stock's best session since January. Shares are more than two months into a new base, closing Tuesday less than 4% below the potential buy point at 452.10.Lam Research tumbled 6.6% in late action, despite a largely positive fiscal third-quarter report. The chip equipment leader's earnings swept up 71%; revenue jumped 34%. Both were above consensus targets. Q4 guidance also surpassed expectations. Lam is the first chip-sector name to report results during a season in which investors are feeling flighty about chip stocks in general.Lam shares surged 4.3% in Tuesday's regular trade. The stock has been consolidating for nearly six weeks.United climbed 3% in premarket trade. Its first-quarter revenue and earnings squeaked past analysts targets. Second-quarter guidance was positive. The company's quarterly conference call is set for 10:30 a.m. ET today.  United shares are consolidating, but have a long way to go before reaching a valid buy point.On the Dow, IBM dived 4.8% after Tuesday's close. The legacy tech brand posted stronger-than-expected Q1 results, and reported a second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in more than four years. Full-year earnings guidance was just shy of consensus views, however. The stock has had little success in attempts to climb out of a 13-month consolidation.IBD 50 issue Interactive Brokers (IBKR) edged up 1.5% in premarket trade. The Greenwich, Conn.-based online broker reported larger-than-forecasts sales and earnings gains after Tuesday's close.  The stock closed Tuesday in a buy range, above a 74.21 buy point in a flat base.Morgan Stanley (MS), ASML Holding (ASML) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) are among the names reporting results early Wednesday.Wednesday's session also offers a simple calendar of economic releases. Homebuilding stocks aren't likely to see much reaction to weekly mortgage applications data, due out from the Mortgage Bankers Association before the open. Later in the morning, energy stocks and oil prices, now hovering near three-year highs, may respond to weekly oil inventories news from the Energy Information Administration.

254,USB,"U.S. stock indexes broke through resistance at the 50-day line Tuesday in a bullish move that also delivered the most new highs in five weeks. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Apple (AAPL) signaled what is wrong and right with the market.The Nasdaq galloped ahead 1.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average popped 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively.Small caps kept to the chase, as the Russell 2000 added 1.1% in another bullish showing.Volume picked up in the afternoon and stayed up. The Nasdaq and NYSE both showed modestly higher volume compared with Monday, based on preliminary data.New highs provide an important indicator, and lately the totals have been discouraging. But on Tuesday, the count rose to the most in five weeks, according to preliminary data. This would be another sign that the market uptrend is real.Bullishness, though, isn't shared everywhere. The banks have had trouble getting credit for any earnings report.Goldman Sachs became the latest big bank to report strong quarterly results and then shrug off the performance. Goldman's earnings came in well above estimates. But the stock reversed to a 1.8% loss in heavy volume.Dallas-based Comerica (CMA) reported a 51% increase in earnings, above the consensus estimate. The narrow beat earned a slap in the face as the superregional stock fell 3.5%.The banks recently have shown that the most dangerous thing for them is to beat earnings estimates.Besides topping earnings expectations by about 25%, Goldman boosted its dividend by 5 cents to 80 cents a share.Other big banks did just fine Tuesday. Bank of New York Mellon (BK) rose 0.4%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was flat. Bank of America (BAC) added 0.4%.Why the trouble among banks and their earnings beats? Uncertainty surrounds the proposed changes to the Dodd-Frank law. Banks don't like the Dodd-Frank regulations, but the Republicans have not been able to unite on a plan to either repeal or amend the law.The selling in bank stocks could be profit-taking, given the run-ups many banks enjoyed in 2017.Meanwhile, Apple is showing that no news can be good news. Apple rose 1.4% as it notched its ninth gain in 11 sessions. This was accomplished without an earnings report.Apple will report quarterly results May 1 after the close. The stock is only 3% off its high, forming a base with a 183.60 buy point.Analysts expect Apple's quarterly earnings to jump 29% to $2.70 a share. A 29% gain would be Apple's best in 10 quarters.The 50-day line had been a problem since mid- to late March for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. The indexes broke above the 50-day line Tuesday morning and closed above the line with no trouble along the way.A close above the line helps validate the market's uptrend.If the 50-day line has been converted from resistance into support, the next resistance area would be at the 7500 price level for the Nasdaq and the 2800 area for the S&P 500.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The move followed the U.S. decision Monday to ban U.S. firms from selling parts to Chinese phone maker ZTE Corp. for seven years.The U.S. Commerce Department said ZTE violated an agreement when it shipped U.S. goods to Iran.Cloud security provider Qualys (QLYS) broke out of a flat base in heavy volume. The stock surged 5.7% to clear a 79.50 buy point in a flat base. The pattern, though, is a late-stage one.Chemical products maker Celanese (CE) gapped up about 4%. The stock broke above a 109.35 buy point in a double-bottom base. A double-bottom base is shaped like the letter W. The middle peak is the buy point.Meanwhile, the FANG stocks were up without exception midday Tuesday. Facebook (FB) added 2%, Amazon.com (AMZN) rose about 4%, Netfix (NFLX) jumped 9%, and Alphabet (GOOGL) picked up 3%.Netflix's gain came after reporting results and strong subscriber growth late Monday.Some stocks made new highs, but strong volume was missing. For example, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) rose 2% to clear a 236.10 buy point in a base-on-base pattern. Without strong volume, there's no sign that funds are driving the move.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's best performers were mostly tech-oriented groups. The biggest losers included tobacco, meat and soap — the defensive areas.Companies reporting earnings Wednesday include banks Morgan Stanley (MS) and U.S. Bancorp (USB), aluminum maker Alcoa (AA) and blue-chip American Express (AXP).The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report for March will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, according to Econoday.RELATED:Goldman Sachs Crushes ExpectationsBreakouts Ahead?

255,USB,"Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are growing their private label brands at a quick clip, but new research shows that Amazon's (AMZN) number of house brands has skyrocketed in the last year alone.XAccording to research firm L2 Gartner, 66 of Amazon's 80 private label brands came to life between March of 2017 and 2018, a real ramp-up from prior years.By contrast, the e-commerce behemoth introduced its first three exclusive brands in 2009, followed by a period of quiet until 2014, when it rolled out 11 more labels over the next two years.AmazonBasics and Amazon Elements are two of the company's most successful private labels, as items such as batteries, USB cables and baby wipes sell well.But analysts expect apparel to be a major growth category for the company this year.""Legacy brands and retailers should expect to see more private label brands from Amazon in the near future,"" warned L2 researchers.Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel estimated in December that Amazon was ""already one of, if not the, largest apparel retailers,"" and should see double-digit growth in the category, partly driven by its own brands. And Euromonitor data says Amazon beats Walmart's (WMT) online sales of clothes and shoes five-fold.In fact, most of Amazon's new exclusive brands are things you can wear: L2 says 86% of the company's private labels fall under the clothes, shoes and jewelry category.""Like AmazonBasics in Electronics Accessories, it will likely take years before Amazon private label brands become true leaders in these categories,"" said L2 researchers. ""Amazon's aggressive launch strategy shows the retailer is willing to let many private brands fail in order to develop its next AmazonBasics.""In a separate report, One Click Retail said that it expects Amazon's next private label expansions to be in pet carriers, diapers and patio heaters. Researchers there said that it's ""clear that private brand expansion is a major priority for Amazon.""Walmart and Target have been assertive in rolling out their own in-house brands. Walmart's city-dweller brand Jet.com has a brand aimed at the ""metro millennial lifestyle,"" while Target's kids line, Cat & Jack, had an outstanding $2 billion first year on the market. Target is in the midst of introducing a dozen or so new private labels to its stores and online marketplace.Amazon shares closed up 1.3% on the stock market today, Target jumped 3.35%, Walmart added 0.5% and Macy's surged 3.8%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: How Private Labels Could Be Amazon, Target's Next Cash CowRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry NewsApple (AAPL) Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart AnalysisBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

On Wednesday, SanDisk stock hit an all-time high of 108.77.SanDisk said its Q2 earnings rose 16% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $1.41 a share excluding items. Sales rose 11% to $1.63 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $1.39 and $1.6 billion.The Milpitas, Calif.-based company reported an adjusted gross profit margin of 48% in Q2, up from 47% in the year-earlier quarter but down from 51% in Q1. SanDisk forecast a Q3 gross margin of 47% to 49%.""A higher mix of custom embedded products (sales to Apple) led to slightly lower gross margin than expected,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Monika Garg said in a research note Wednesday. ""SanDisk is guiding to relatively flat margins for Q3, also due to a higher mix of custom embedded solutions in Q3.""SanDisk makes internal flash memory chips for smartphones, tablets and other devices, as well as USB drives and memory cards for digital cameras.RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman said SanDisk's commitment to Apple (AAPL) is prudent, given the upside potential in unit sales. The relationship with Apple also supports a more stable business model in the long term, Freedman said in a research note Thursday.SanDisk's guidance was affected by its contract with Apple, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini said in a note Thursday.""We attribute this to the strategic decision by SanDisk management to accommodate a key customer, Apple, with significant volume of embedded and client (solid-state drive) products,"" Hosseini said. ""We remind investors this same customer helped SanDisk outperform in Q1, and now as a number of new products ramp, including embedded mobile, it is holding SanDisk back from margin expansion.""SanDisk forecast Q3 sales of $1.68 billion to $1.73 billion compared with the analyst target of $1.74 billion. The midpoint of its Q3 sales guidance, $1.7 billion, would translate to a 5% increase.SanDisk is starting to benefit from a shift in its sales toward solid-state drives for servers and personal computers. SSDs are beginning to replace mechanical hard-disk drives for data storage.""SanDisk's model transition to enterprise SSDs is in the initial stages and should lead to margin expansion,"" Garg said.Enterprise solid-state drives carry gross margins of more than 65%, said Garg, who added that enterprise SSDs could be an $8 billion market by 2016.SanDisk should do better than rival flash-memory chipmakers because it has offerings that cover all enterprise SSD segments, she said.In June, SanDisk announced plans to buy Fusion-io (FIO), a developer of flash-based hardware and software for enterprise data centers, for $1.1 billion. The acquisition would give SanDisk key customers, better enterprise vertical integration and a path toward higher gross profit margins. The deal is expected to close in Q3.Several analysts adjusted their price targets on SanDisk stock.Susquehanna's Hosseini has a positive rating on SanDisk and increased his price target to 120 from 110.RBC's Freedman rates SanDisk as outperform, but trimmed his target to 118 from 120.Pacific Crest's Garg also rates SanDisk as outperform, but cut her price target to 116 from 123.

317,USB,"A few days ago and for a few hours last night, it looked as if a Donald Trump victory was perhaps the only thing standing in the way of a Federal Reserve rate hike in December.Some economists had even suggested Janet Yellen would have to resign if Trump won, after he attacked her for running a Fed that acted ""more political than Secretary Clinton.""Now, in the light of day, as markets process the likely direction of a Trump presidency, the Fed's green light is back.After tumbling overnight, the 10-year Treasury yield surged above 2%, hitting their highest levels since January. Stocks are rallying solidly in late-afternoon trading, easing concerns that markets won't be able to handle higher rates. The odds of a Fed hike next month, which briefly dipped below 50% overnight, are back to 71.5%.Plus, Trump will be able to nominate two members to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He's warned that ultralow rates are fomenting bubbles, suggesting that he might pick more hawkish policymakers.Shares of U.S. Bancorp (USB), which saw its shares rise to a 52-week high on Tuesday when Hillary Clinton looked like a winner, surged 3.8% to an all-time high on Wednesday despite the altered political reality. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) advanced 5.7% to the top of a 12-month base.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) hit an all-time high, closing up 4.6%. PNC Financial Services (PNC) rose 4.8% to its own record high.IBD'S TAKE: Markets may stay volatile as investors figure out what a Donald Trump presidency means, but don't lose sight of the big picture. For a primer on how to know if the market is ripe for gains and it's a favorable time to establish new positions, visit IBD University. Then read The Big Picture each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend.Now, investors seems to believe, banks can enjoy not only the higher interest-rate environment that will help net-interest margins, but they'll also benefit from a lighter regulatory touch under Trump.What happened to change the mood so suddenly? Credit Trump's gracious speech early Wednesday morning, says Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research.""Trump's speech helped to calm down markets"" because it lacked the aggressiveness that defined his campaign, Bandholz said.Still, Bandholz notes, everything Trump says is now under the microscope. New talk of tariffs, the market's biggest fear, could upset the new equilibrium.During the campaign, Trump threatened to walk away from Nafta unless Mexico renegotiates the agreement under favorable terms for the U.S., and he pledged that his administration would slap the currency manipulator label on China, paving the way for punitive tariffs.Uncertainty about he'll make good on his campaign pledges will likely increase the volatility of the market, Bandholz says. But for now, wage growth has picked up, inflation is rising, albeit from a low base, and there's little chance the data will shift before the Fed makes its next interest-rate decision on December 14.As for Yellen, she has dismissed any charge that the Fed held off on raising rates this year to help Hillary Clinton.""We do not discuss politics at our meetings, and we do not take politics into account in our decisions,"" Yellen said at a post-meeting press conference in September.If she believes in the importance of the Fed's independence, she's unlikely to take the fall because of some rough campaign words.The surge in Treasury yields on Wednesday comes after Trump signaled that his top priority is to get the economy humming — ""we will double our growth"" — via infrastructure spending and tax cuts.Fitch Ratings warned on Wednesday that Trump's agenda could be negative for U.S. creditworthiness since it could potentially put upward pressure on already-rising deficits and debt levels.Yet Bandholz sees little risk that Trump's big infrastructure splurge will lead the U.S. economy to overheat, forcing the Fed to move quickly. He notes that any package will either require Democratic support in the Senate or, if done through reconciliation to get around a filibuster, would have to be revenue neutral.RELATED:The Fed Isn't Ruled By Politics — But Here's Why It Soon Might BeAfter Initial Fall, Stocks May Rally On Trump Victory, Agenda

320,USB,"Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and other financials are pulling back on the stock market today. But is the bank rally over? A quick look at their charts show that financial stocks are doing just fine, holding onto the vast majority of last week's huge advances.Consolidating gains is natural and healthy. Most of the banking stocks are well extended, but sideways action could present new buy opportunities down the road.Bank of America fell 2% to 19.75. Baird downgraded BofA and a few other financials Tuesday, BofA's second analyst cut of the week.""We think the bank rally post-election has largely discounted potential benefits from rising interest rates, lower tax rates, and more aggressive capital return. We believe investors should book gains and wait for more evidence that the structural improvement in macro trends and regulations will materialize,"" said Baird analyst David George in a report.But Wednesday's loss follows a fractional gain Tuesday and a 15% spike last week. Bank of America had already cleared a 16.34 buy point ahead of the election, as rising long-term bond yields and rising odds of a Federal Reserve rate hike buoyed bank stocks. Donald Trump's election win and the prospect of growth-and-inflation-boosting tax-and-infrastructure plans just hit turbo on the sector's solid advance.Shares are at their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.Check out the weekly chart:RELATED:Bank Of America Downgraded AgainIBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks aren't the only Trump rally group to pause.

Wells Fargo also fell modestly Tuesday, but after hitting a 2016 best on Monday. Wells Fargo shot up 16% last week, retaking its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Wells Fargo shares tumbled in September on news of a fraudulent accounts scandal, so the bank didn't break out like its peers. But it could consolidate at current levels, perhaps form a handle, and present a potential buy point.Here's Wells' weekly chart:Goldman Sachs pulled back 2.3% to 206.26, snapping a seven-day winning streak.

322,USB,"Riding a spike in Treasury yields, bank stocks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) rose to their highest levels in years, continuing their gains since Donald Trump's unexpected election last week.JPMorgan jumped 3.7% in the stock market today, after hitting a record high last week. Bank of America rose 5.6% to levels not seen since 2008. Citigroup (C) advanced 3.5%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) gained 2.2%.Goldman Sachs (GS) was up 2.6%, while Morgan Stanley (MS) added 2.2%. U.S. Bancorp (USB) rose 1.7%, KeyCorp (KEY) 2.8% and PNC Financial Services (PNC) 2%.Home Bancorp (HOMB), Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and East West Bancorp (EWBC) are among the many other banking stocks extending powerful gains.Those stocks are all well past buy range, but could still maintain strength and present buying opportunities in the event of a correction.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes leapt 10 basis points to 2.25%, continuing huge gains since last week. SPDR Financial (XLF) an ETF whose investments include a variety of financial stocks, rose 1.8%.IBD'S TAKE: Ever since President-elect Trump last vowed to improve the nation's infrastructure, investors have renewed their focus on the stocks that could benefit. Here's a broader look at what stocks could drive a potential bull market in the Trump era.The rising yields come as investors anticipate stronger growth and higher inflation due to Trump's plans for tax cuts a wave of new public infrastructure spending. Markets are also betting that the Federal Reserve will raise rates next month, with perhaps more tightening in 2017.Short-end Treasury yields also have risen sharply since the election and in recent weeks, but not nearly as much as the long end. That means banks, which borrow short and lend long, should see higher profitability.Banks could also benefit from fewer regulations under a Trump administration.RELATED:Profit Recession Over, Here Comes The Best Earnings Growth Since 2014Banks ETFs Rise To Build On Trump Windfall, At Best Level Since 2008JPMorgan Hits Record As Banks Extend Gains; CEO Dimon At Treasury?U.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

329,USB,"We know that you feel bad with your student leaving for college. Giving your loved one a nice tech gift will make everybody feel a bit better about the separation. Here are some ideas:
"
330,USB," If your student plays guitar, it makes sense that he or she would want to take it to school. But a high-quality guitar can cost hundreds of dollars or more. And a dorm room exposes that valuable item to theft or damage.So consider the $90 California Classic guitar from Blucora (BCOR)-owned Monoprice, a company better known for its low-cost electronics and cables.Our review unit, a Stratocaster-style model, has three pickups, and is nicely finished with smooth frets and a very playable string height. It even comes with a light gig bag for carrying the guitar around.With the right amp settings it sounds really good, and was a pleasure to play. At this price, your student can drag the California Classic to the beach or elsewhere without being afraid it will get damaged, lost or stolen. Unless they are asleep, darkness isn't students' best friend. A good flashlight is a useful and thoughtful back-to-school gift. You don't have to spend as much as the $120 Bayco NightStick NSR-9940XL we tested. But if you do shell out the big bucks, your student will have a rechargeable flashlight that can throw a bright beam of light almost the length of a football field.The tough metal NSR-9940XL also has a separate spotlight (useful if an emergency light is needed), a magnetic base and several power levels, including a strobe that serves as an emergency beacon. Bayco has less expensive (and less bright) models if you think the NSR-9940XL is overkill. Keeping track of chargers and cables for smartphones and tablets is a chore. The STM Cable Wrap provides an attractive roll-up case to store all of these items in a single place. The $25 soft case has a zippered interior pocket for loose items, and is available at select stores and online. If you're sending your student back to school with a new computer, or even a new laptop, a new monitor is great to add to your gift list. It doesn't have to be expensive, but even in a crowded dorm room a large display will be appreciated, especially when your student is staring at the screen for hours.Acer's K242HL bid is reasonably priced at about $140. For that price, your student gets a display with a 24-inch diagonal, 1920 x 1080 (full HD) resolution, and three connection ports: VGA, DVI, and the HDMI port found on most of the current laptops and PCs and even some tablets.The widescreen 16:1 aspect ratio correctly displays most of today's movies and videos, and with the large screen (and setting a larger font size), work on a word processor or spreadsheet document causes less eyestrain. And when your student has finished for the day with his or her studies, the K242HL bid is nice for watching a YouTube video or playing a game. One thing about dorm rooms is certain: There will never be enough electric outlets. A power strip is one solution. A better solution is the $39 Panamax Power360, from Nortek (NTK).The Power360 plugs into a standard AC outlet and provides six surge-protected outlets (three on the front, three more underneath the device) as well as two USB charging ports, one on each side of the extended outlet. An LED indicator on the front shows voltage, protection status and that the AC outlet the device is plugged into is correctly wired. If your student is in an engineering or arts program, there's no better gift than a 3D printer. The Ultimaker 2 Go is somewhat expensive at $1,450, but it's one of the best 3D printers we've tested.The 2 Go is the smallest and least expensive model in the Ultimaker series, with a 4.72 x 4.72 x 4.53 inch build volume, and is designed to use inexpensive biodegradable PLA plastic filament. The printer itself is compact, measuring at about 10 x 10 x 11.5 inches, so it should fit even in a crowded dorm room.We found it very easy to set the printer up, and the display on the front of the printer walked us through the necessary steps.The front panel of the printer has a slot for an SD Card (supplied), which has several test prints on it.Ultimaker also provides a download link to its Cura software, which lets students create their own designs or modify ones that they've found online at sites such as Thingiverse or Youmagine.Cura is easy to use and it's popular even among users of other vendors' 3D printers.The Ultimaker 2 Go uses PLA filament that is available from the vendor or from many sources on the Web, so there's no worrying about proprietary and expensive cartridges.

Greece and the EU strike an 11th hour deal! The Opera is over….or is it?(Who is kidding who? It's never over.)This morning global investors are waking up to the headlines:""Tsipras Capitulates to Creditor's Demands to Keep Greece in the Euro""""Greece and Eurozone Thrash out Rescue Deal""""Agreekment! Overnight Talks Result in Aid-for-Reform Deal""This is like a sequel to the 1994 comedy - ""Dumb and Dumber"" Only this one stars Alexis Tsipras and the whole Greek Parliament...I mean have you ever seen anything so breathtakingly stupid? Alexis Tsipras was elected on the platform of ""Screw the European Union"" - Remember - he was the one that claimed that he would not accept one more ounce of austerity, or cuts, or tax increases (not that anyone in Greece pays taxes - so what difference does that make?)Following months of ranting and raving against Germany and the Troika (IMF, ECB and EU) - He rejected plan after plan then forced a referendum vote in his country, campaigned for his citizens to vote 'NO' - and when they 'overwhelmingly agreed' that last week's deal was a bad one - he then sold them down the river! He made such a dramatic reversal that it's almost laughable.....and to make it more ridiculous - the latest 'final offer' is far worse than ones he had turned down! We now have a new word that is sure to light up the Twitter sphere - ""Gridiot"".Paul Krugman - an American Economist and Professor of Economic and Int'l Affairs at Princeton University - summed it up this way:""This goes beyond harsh into pure vindictiveness, complete destruction of national sovereignty, and no hope of relief. It is, presumably, meant to be an offer Greece can't accept; but even so, it's a grotesque betrayal of everything the European project was supposed to stand for.""Global markets, now all relieved (at least for today), have moved into positive territory. Beginning in Asia - markets there sensing relief on the Greek front caused investors and traders to review recent market action. Add in some positive economic data across the region and it was Risk On. China - which has been the focus of late - reported trade figures showing that exports rose 2.8%, substantially beating the expectation of +0.2%.....on a side note - Gov't officials tried to temper the mood saying that 'exports are likely to face relatively big pressure in the coming months'. (Because - How long can they keep up this façade?)China ended the day up 2.4% extending Friday's gain of better than 6%. Clearly the market has been boosted by the recent 'reforms' instituted by Beijing….Brokerages were told in 'no uncertain terms' on Sunday to use real names and national identification numbers on all trades - Imagine that - no more imaginary brokerage accounts! Who would have thought of using real names? Over the weekend - Xinhua - the state owned news outlet - reported that some brokerage houses were 'suspected of manipulating futures prices and other malicious practices. Like I said last week - China is not a free market and while the measures recently imposed have caused the markets to rally - what happens once they are removed? Are foreign investors really feeling any better? Not so much….In Japan - money poured into the Yen - as the safe haven trade. Equities also moved higher as investors got the 'all clear' sign on a Greek deal while the GPIF (Gov't Pension Investment Fund) released performance figures showing a 12% return in the 12 months ended March 31st. Shoji Hirakawa, Chief equity strategist at Oksan Securities, did say that the fund looks like they still have another 4 or 5 trillion Yen left to put to work in the Japanese stock market - Ah…Hello??? 5 Trillion more Yen going into stocks....Anyone want to stand in front of that train?In Europe this morning - as you can imagine - markets there are on a tear….FTSE + 0.61%, CAC 40 + 1.78%, DAX +1.32%, EUROSTOXX +1.64%, SPAIN +1.25% and ITALY +1.26%. Good for today - but if Tsipras can't deliver - then expect it to all fall apart mid-week. Even if he does deliver - and that is a big ""IF"" - will he be able to hold onto his position as PM? Relief- sure.....Greece now has 72 hours to vote in the reforms. There is already trouble brewing in Parliament - you can imagine the rage among those that supported Tsipras in his efforts and now feel like he turned his back on them.German Chancellor Merkel had this to say: ""Trust has to be rebuilt, the Greek authorities have to take on responsibility for what they agreed to, It now hinges on step-by-step implementation of what we agreed.""And that agreement is for more spending cuts, pension cuts, and tax increases - everything that the country voted against.....Are you beginning to see the Dumb and Dumber reference?U.S. futures are soaring - currently up 14 points - at this rate we will be banging our heads on S&P 500 2100 before lunch. There are no economic reports for today but later in the week we get a slew of data points - Retail Sales, PPI, Empire State Manufacturing, Industrial Prod, and Capacity Utilization......We are now well into earnings season...Tomorrow starts the beauty pageant....JPMorgan (JPM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Wells Fargo (WFC) - later in the week - we get US Bancorp (USB), Bank of America (BAC), CSX (CSX), Yum Brands (YUM) to name just a few.....The focus now will turn to the earnings and future guidance.....The Greek-think is a bit exhausting....but will remain simmering on the back burner.Look for the S&P 500 to test both the 100 and 50 DMA's (2095 & 2099).

366,USB,"Stock indexes sagged in afternoon trading Wednesday as volume stayed in a below-average mode.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5% while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.6%, with the Dow approaching its 50-day line. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.Below-average turnover has been the trend for some time now. The S&P 500 appears headed for its 23rd consecutive day of below-average volume. The Nasdaq looked to be on track for its 18th session in a row of below-average volume. Seasonality alone doesn't explain it: Last year, there were plenty of above-average days on both major exchanges.One sector that hasn't had too much trouble lately attracting respectable upside volume is the banks. Wells Fargo (WFC) gained 6% over the past five weeks, while the Nasdaq rose 1% in the same period and the S&P 500 has been flat. (Five weeks is the time period IBD uses to define current action in the Market Pulse.)IBD splits the bank sector into seven industry groups. In the past five weeks, the best bank groups have been super regional banks, up 5%; money centers, up 5%; and west-southwest banks, up 4%. The biggest stocks by market cap in those groups are U.S. Bancorp (USB), super regional; Wells Fargo, money centers; and First Republic Bank (FRC), west-southwest.The banks are riding the conviction that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year, thereby improving net interest margins. Individual investors looking for exposure in the bank sector should study the fundamentals and charts to time an entry properly. There's no guarantee that banks are primed to lead. Previous pops proved to be either head fakes or short-lived advances.In the growth space, Mercadolibre (MELI) outperformed, rising 2%. It's been showing tight action after soaring nearly 14% in early August on strong earnings.Blue chips were mostly down intraday. Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) led the losers with declines of more than 1%. West Texas intermediate crude oil fell more than 3% to just under $45 a barrel. U.S. government data showed an unexpected buildup in U.S. oil and distillate stockpiles.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, losers led winners by a roughly 8-3 ratio.RELATED:Big Bank Stocks Are Leading, But Only This One Is A Buy Now

368,USB,"LAS VEGAS -- America's heartland is rich with truck drivers willing to tow a 2014 Jeep Cherokee out of a ditch, which is lucky for Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, who recently found themselves sidelined in a cornfield after hacking their SUV ... again.Miller and Valasek, researchers at the Uber Advanced Technologies Center, returned Thursday to the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas, expanding on research that allowed them to perform ""parlor tricks"" on a Jeep Cherokee in 2015. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), which makes Jeeps, has since patched the vulnerabilities Miller and Valasek helped expose at a Black Hat conference a year ago.In 2015, those parlor tricks amounted to fiddling, remotely, with the turn signals, speedometer, horn, lights, locks and windshield wipers. This year, the duo tapped into the Jeep's computer via a $30 USB device plugged into the vehicle.From there, they turned off the Jeep's power steering, locked the parking brake and -- most terrifying -- jerked the steering wheel into a sudden right-hand skid. And make no mistake, Miller says, each of those attacks could have been performed remotely.Like all modern vehicles, the 2014 Jeep Cherokee is ruled by a series of electronic control modules, they explained. Every system, including the steering wheel, emergency brake, infotainment system and cruise control, has an ECU (electronic control unit) receiving messages from the Jeep's computer.By gaining access to one ECU, Miller and Valasek were able to reach others. In 2015, though, they were limited to attacks when the car was traveling below 5 mph and, sometimes, in reverse. That's because the Jeep doesn't allow diagnostic messages to be sent while moving at high speeds.This year, Miller and Valasek found a loophole. By injecting their own code in a timely fashion, they could mimic the computer and fool the ECUs controlling power steering, brakes and the steering wheel into thinking the Jeep's messaging was a mistake.""I made sure to time the messages so my messages would always show up right before the counter messages from the car,"" Valasek said. ""So when the car's messaging shows up, the ECU says, 'I already saw this one, I can ignore it.'""So the Jeep may be traveling 60 mph, but Miller and Valasek can fool the computer into believing it's stopped. From there, they can launch their own diagnostic messaging. In 2015, they could only cut and engage the brakes, and control steering at sub 5 mph. They couldn't touch acceleration.In 2016, only cutting power to the brakes was limited to below 5 mph.Miller and Valasek estimate a mere handful of people are capable of this type of attack, which took nine hours of brute force -- and nearly an entire tank of gas -- to pull off. But their goal was to get ahead of the curve. And now they're hanging up their helmets. (Just kidding, they didn't wear helmets, they quipped.)""It's not like someone is going to make all the cars suddenly stop,"" Valasek said in a post-lecture press conference with the media Thursday. ""But we can't just ignore (the possibility).""

And in the case of Kindle and Fire products, they help draw customers and drive the sales of other products at Amazon.com.But aside from Kindle and Fire, Amazon's been low-key in marketing lower-end branded products, and some shoppers likely are not even aware they exist.Amazon's tactic is often a private-label strategy, where Amazon contracts with outside manufacturers to provide products sold under the Amazon brand.The company's private labels include Pinzon, which launched in 2005 and sells bed and bath products and house furnishings under the ""by Amazon"" brand. Seattle chef Tom Douglas sells a line of kitchen utensils under Pinzon. Pinzon is the surname of the Spanish explorer who discovered the Amazon River.Denali, started in 2006, sells tools and accessories; Pike Street launched in 2005 and sells bed and bath products. Strathwood sells outdoor furnishings and lighting, and began its sales in 2004.In 2009, Amazon kicked off a private-label electronics brand called AmazonBasics. The products include USB and A/V cables, ethernet cables and DVD discs.GVA Research principal David Garrity says that Amazon offers its own branded products to keep rivals with similar offerings in check. ""It's something that Amazon needs to match from a competitive standpoint,"" Garrity said.

398,USB,"As the number of car loans and subprime borrowers increases, so has the number of borrowers falling behind on their payments, Experian Automotive said.Although remaining near historic lows, the 60-day loan delinquency rate rose to 0.62% of borrowers from 0.58% a year earlier, representing an $859 million increase in delinquent loan balances. The 30-day delinquency rate grew to 2.39% from 2.38%, translating to a $2.8 billion increase.""The rosy glow of perfect payment performance in the automotive space is beginning to tarnish,"" Melinda Zabritski, senior director of automotive finance for Experian Automotive, said in a statement.""We're starting to see a slight uptick in the number of consumers struggling to make their automotive payments on time; however, we have to keep in mind that these percentages are still extremely low.""The rate of car repossessions rose more than 70% to 0.62% compared with Q2 '13.The number of subprime and deep subprime borrowers — people with credit scores lower than 620 — saw their volumes grow 5.3% and 12.7%, respectively.Southern states dominate the parts of the U.S. with the highest delinquency rates, with Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama being at or near the top on the list. The District of Columbia falls into that category as well.States with the lowest car loan delinquency rates include Alaska, Oregon, Utah and Iowa.Outstanding auto loan balances hit an all-time high of $839.1 billion in Q2, reflecting the trend of the car-buying public finding a welcome audience in banks and car companies since the recession ended five years ago. Q2's total of auto loan balances is 11.7% from a year ago.All lender types experienced growth in loan volume compared with a year earlier, Experian said. Banks saw auto loans grow $31 billion, credit unions by $25 billion, finance companies by $24 billion and captive finance companies by $9 billion.Some of the major players who have emerged in the auto loan market in recent years include banks such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Capital One (COF), US Bancorp (USB) and Bank of America (BAC) as well as the financing wings of Ford Motor Co.

402,USB,"Stocks closed mixed yesterday...spending all day just 'kissing' 2100 on the index - unable to muster up the strength to push thru..... Weak earnings - think technology, weak macro data - think housing starts and building permits, and a weaker dollar - helped the commodity sector - think OIL, which kept the indexes in check......Nasdaq ended the day lower while the Dow and S&P managed to squeak out small gains....Now poor earnings worked both ways - right....Goldman Sachs (GS) net income FELL 60% as demand across the spectrum of business lines tanked....YET investors/traders took that stock UP 2.2% or $3.60/sh..........while Big Blue - think IBM (IBM) - reported its worst qtr in 14 yrs and investors/traders kicked her to the gutter taking 8 pts or 5.5% out of her .........It was the NON -tech stocks that managed to gain ground despite all of these big revenue misses and drops in income......The more the data screams of difficult times and recession, the more desperate the Fed becomes and the clearer it becomes that rates will remain right here. Yesterday saw the dollar move lower which helped to send oil up over $1 once again above the $40 line....while Gold surged by $19/oz to close at $1253/oz - well above support at $1238.....Earnings are a disaster yet - who is paying attention? Factset reminds us that 1Q earnings are due to decline by 8.5%.....while 2Q earnings will be lower by 2.4%...but remember - I said yesterday that the mkt is a discounting mechanism...so it has already priced in this negative data and is looking out 4 - 6 months.....and in that time frame Fact set tells us that we will be in the midst of a turnaround! Look for earnings growth to skyrocket to +3.9% in the 3Q and 9% by Christmas......Will we see any adjustment to those far out numbers - the way we saw a complete turn in 1Q numbers...remember in early January - forecasts for 1Q earnings were positive.....only to be 'adjusted' well into negative territory in a short 3 weeks..... Are the headwinds that caused that adjustment no longer present? Doubtful.....What about GDP? - Well that's a bit absurd as well......early consensus forecasts called for growth of 2.5% this yr of which the 1Q was originally forecasted at +1.9%..........the Atlanta Fed GDPNow model is suggesting a scant +0.4% for 1Q after a slew of disappointing macro data points. - some are even wondering if this qtr will turn slightly negative........yet the mkt marches higher - Why? think lower rates for longer - as the FED struggles with what to do..........in the end - it would not surprise me to see total annual growth in the 1% - 1.5% range (which would be considered a WIN) ...Remember - the consumer is exhausted, retail sales are slowing and wages - real avg weekly earnings are stagnant - there has been NO meaningful uptick at all.....Business inventories keep rising as sales slow...so expect to see those ""One Day Sales - Everything 50% Off!"" on an almost daily basis.....I mean how many times in one month does Macy's throw a 'Private Sale'?(Private means belonging to one person or group - which usually causes everyone to want to be 'in that group' - because of the cache of being 'private'......do you see where this is going?)US non financial debt rose 3 x faster than GDP last year....(Non Financial debt is considered - the total of household debt, business debt, federal, state and local gov't debt) .....Doesn't sound good to me.....Dr. Lacy Hunt of Hoisington Investment Management tells us that""Total debt … increased by $1.968 trillion last year. This is $1.4 trillion more than the gain in nominal GDP. The ratio of total debt-to-GDP closed the year at 370%, well above the 250–300% level at which academic studies suggest debt begins to slow economic activity.""As we digest this data - we find that big US corporations continue to default on their debt.....USA today reported that""so far this year, 46 companies have defaulted on their debt, the highest level since 2009, Five companies have defaulted this week!""And DC keeps telling us 'Don't worry - It's all good'........I would beg to differ.....the economy is not growing and until we take real drastic steps - think structural reforms- we will be stuck in this quagmire..........and a whole generation of millenial's want to elect Bernie Sanders? REALLY? Does the country OWE them something? Remember the words of President John F Kennedy -""Ask not what YOUR country can do for you, Ask what YOU can do for your country""And the latest macro data? Yes folks - even as the Dow teases with 18,000, March's housing starts FELL out of bed.....falling 8.8% - single family fell 9.2% and multi-family units dropped 7.9%. And housing permits? Not much better......here in the Northeast permits declined 17.9%, Midwest down 3.1%, South down 3.2% and the West down 15.4%.***NEWS FLASH - Building permits are a leading economic indicator, so the March data is a warning sign about future building activity - just sayin.....Here in NY yesterday - voters laid it out.....Trump and Clinton notch up the win.....taking them one step closer to the nomination.....California!

405,USB,"Facebook (FB) lost its first game in the virtual reality field, as its Oculus VR unit announced that a shortage of parts will delay some shipments of its high-tech Rift headsets.The Rift goggles began shipping to more than 20 countries and regions one week ago. Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe acknowledged the delay in a tweet: “First set of Rifts are going out slower than we originally estimated, so we're giving free shipping for all preorders, including international.”Facebook stock fell 3% to 112.55 in the stock market today, though it was not clear if the market action was related to the shipment delays. Facebook has said Oculus will not be material to its bottom line this year.Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Sandler said in a research note Monday that Facebook's first-quarter results ""may come in light,” in what he described as a “potential growth reset.” Sandler maintained a buy rating on Facebook with a 145 price target.Oculus did not say how many Rift shipments were delayed or when the problem might be fixed. It said buyers hit with the delay will receive an update by April 12.Preorders for the $599 Oculus Rift headsets began in January. Facebook has not said how many orders it's received. So far, 30 games are available for the Rift, with more than 100 games expected by year-end. Game prices range from $9.99 to $59.99. Facebook sees Oculus Rift as a game changer, starting with games but soon extending to other areas such as sports events, as users put on the Rift goggles for deep-seated immersion.A dismantling of the Rift by iFixit showed the Oculus contained chips from STMicroelectronics (STM), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Cypress Semiconductor (CY).STMicroelectronics supplied the Rift with an ARM (ARMH)-based microcontroller. Cypress supplies a hub controller, which allows for multiple USB-connected devices to be plugged in at once. Texas Instruments is supplying an LED driver, which controls for image brightness and grayscale.STMicroelectronics rose 0.5%.

407,USB,"Wall Street banks have declared war on Silicon Valley mobile payments platforms, arming to do battle in the peer-to-peer mobile payments business.As the likes of Square (SQ), Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) have charged into the uncharted waters of peer-to-peer payments, Wall Street banks have spent five years stitching together an alliance among JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) and others, according to a press release from Early Warning.Early Warning is a real-time payments and authentication firm that will manage clearXchange, a technology that lets bank customers make quick -- near-instant -- transactions. It now generally takes one to three days to transfer money between banks. Banks had been slow to innovate after the financial crisis, but now ""what we are doing now is delivering payments in real time, which is what our customers have asked for,"" Mary Harman, managing director for payments at Bank of America, said in an interview with Reuters.The banks are starting to use clearXchange to allow customers to transfer money almost instantly to friends and family. Peer-to-peer payments have been popular among millennials for splitting dinner bills, cab fare and paying rent.Achieving a critical mass fast is important for the banks using clearXchange. The so-called network effects -- the value unlocked from having a large customer base -- were critical to PayPal's early success in online payments, for example.PayPal was early to the peer-to-peer market and snapped up the popular Venmo app as a part of its $800 million Braintree acquisition in 2013. Braintree had acquired Venmo in 2012. Last year, Venmo moved $7.5 billion between people, and in January alone it handled $1 billion, PayPal told Reuters.As of Wednesday, only customers at U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America will be able to send money via mobile devices with the clearXchange platform. JPMorgan and Capital One Financial (COF) told Reuters they plan to plug in to the platform ""later this year.""Citigroup (C) is among banks that have not joined the alliance, Reuters said.PayPal stock was up a fraction, near 38, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The company is an IBD Leaderboard stock. Shares are just below an early entry at 38.62. A conventional buy point lies at 42.65.Square stock was down a fraction Wednesday afternoon, as the company was set to report its Q4 earnings after the close. Investors are likely going to focus on Square Capital, the company's financial services arm, as an area of growth.Square's peer-to-peer payments app Square Cash recently added a feature that let customers store money in it, much like a PayPal account already does.Facebook built its peer-to-peer payments play within its Messenger app, and it did so in-house. The company has said Messenger has more than 800 million customers. Facebook stock was up 1% Wednesday afternoon, near 107.

408,USB,"Apple (AAPL) unveiled a new 4-inch iPhone, a smaller iPad Pro and cut the Apple Watch base price at its spring product launch event Monday that contained few surprises and no ""one more thing."" Apple shares were virtually unchanged.As expected, Apple announced a new 4-inch smartphone called the iPhone SE. Last year, Apple sold over 30 million 4-inch iPhones, so it remains an important market segment for the company. Many people simply prefer a compact smartphone, Apple said. The new handset will replace the iPhone 5S, which was released in September 2013. The new smartphone includes upgraded components including an A9 processor, 12-megapixel camera and NFC technology to enable Apple Pay.The iPhone SE will start at $399 for a 16-gigabyte model. A 64-GB model will cost $499. Apple will begin taking orders Thursday and the handset will ship March 31. It will be available in more than 100 countries by the end of May.Apple also launched a smaller iPad Pro tablet, as expected. The new 9.7-inch iPad Pro joins the 12.9-inch original, which was launched last fall.Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said the company is making a smaller iPad Pro because it wants to serve the largest segment of the tablet market. Apple has sold over 200 million iPads with a 9.7-inch display to date, he said. Schiller also believes the new iPad Pro will appeal to Microsoft Windows PC users.The iPad Pro also supports new accessories including a smaller Smart Keyboard and the Apple Pencil. Other accessories include a USB camera adapter and SD card reader that plug into the Lightning port.""It is the ultimate PC replacement for all those old PCs in the world,"" Schiller said.The iPad Pro starts at $599 for a 32-GB model. Pre-orders begin Thursday and it will go on sale March 31.Apple also cut the entry price for the Apple Watch to $299 from $349. It also announced several new watch bands for the Apple Watch, including a new woven nylon band as well as new sport and metal bands. About a third of Apple Watch wearers regularly change their bands, CEO Tim Cook said.Wall Street analysts had said the new products were unlikely to move the needle for the company, predicting no big surprises.As the company’s “Let us loop you in” event started at 10 a.m. Pacific time (1 p.m. Eastern) in Cupertino, Calif., Apple stock was up slightly. The stock reversed lower for modest losses during the event. They closed  down 1 cent to 105.91.Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the event by reinforcing the company’s argument that the federal government has overstepped its legal bounds by demanding Apple hack its iPhone security. Apple and the Justice Department are set to square off in a federal court on Tuesday in a criminal case where the FBI wants Apple to develop software to bypass its password security measures.""We need to protect your data and your privacy,"" Cook said. ""This is an issue that affects all of us and we will not shrink from this responsibility.""Cook also announced that the company had reached a major milestone: more than 1 billion Apple devices are now in use worldwide.Apple executives also announced advancements with its HealthKit and ResearchKit projects and launched CareKit, a framework to build apps that allow patients to take better care of themselves.

409,USB,"CareKit will be available in April.What do the new iPhone SE and iPad Pro look like? See here:  
"
410,USB,"Apple (AAPL) took aim at old rival Microsoft (MSFT) on Monday as it unveiled a new tablet computer that it believes can be a replacement for millions of older Windows notebook PCs still in use.Most headlines from the spring product launch event focused on the long-awaited new 4-inch iPhone SE. Apple also trotted out new software for iPhones and iPads (iOS 9.3), and new Apple Watch bands. The tech titan cut the starting price for its smartwatch to $299 from $349 as well.Apple investors were not excited by the no-surprise event. Shares flatlined, closing down 1 cent at 105.91 on the stock market today.But Apple sees a big opportunity with its new 9.7-inch display iPad Pro, joining the 12.9-inch model released last fall. Like its big brother, the smaller iPad Pro supports accessories like the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil. The addition of plug-in accessories like USB and SD card adapters make it even more of a PC replacement, Apple executives said.Apple began its media event Monday with a short video listing all of the company's major products throughout its history. Apple will celebrate its 40th anniversary on April 1. So it's fitting that Apple is taking on Microsoft, its chief rival from the early days of the PC, as it launched its latest iPad.Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, gave two reasons why Apple is coming out with a smaller iPad Pro.First, it will be a compelling upgrade to many people with older iPads, he said. To date, Apple has sold over 200 million iPads with a 9.7-inch display. That size device is optimal for portability and usability, he said.“There’s a second group of people we’d love to reach with this new iPad Pro: Windows users!,” Schiller said, prompting chuckles from attendees at the event. “The majority of people who come to an iPad Pro are coming from a Windows PC, a desktop or a notebook.”Many Windows PC users have not had a good reason to replace their old computers, he said.“There are over 600 million PCs in use today that are over five years old. This is really sad,"" Schiller said. ""These people could really benefit from an iPad Pro. And when they see the features, performance and capabilities of a product like the iPad Pro designed for our modern digital lifestyle, well, many of them will find it is their ultimate PC replacement.”Microsoft is going after the same notebook PC replacement market with its Surface tablet-notebook convertibles. Microsoft’s flagship Surface Pro 4 starts at $899, but has a 12.3-inch display and at least 128 GB of data storage. Microsoft stock rose 0.7% to 53.86.The new iPad Pro has a 64-bit A9X chip that rivals the performance of most portable PCs, Apple said. It also has a four-speaker audio system, a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 5-megapixel FaceTime camera. It also boasts all-day battery life and support for the latest wireless cellular bands for fast connectivity.The iPad Pro starts at $599 for a 32-GB model. Pre-orders begin Thursday and it will go on sale March 31. The Smart Keyboard costs $149.“We believe that iPad is the perfect expression of the future of personal computing,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said. ""We took a giant step in this direction last fall with the introduction of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. And since then, many people are telling us that the iPad Pro has become their primary computing device.”After introducing the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, Cook said, ""It’s time for you to replace that PC laptop.""Also going on sale March 31 is the iPhone SE. The new 4-inch smartphone will replace the two-year-old iPhone 5S. It includes upgraded components including an A9 processor, 12-megapixel camera and NFC technology to enable Apple Pay. The iPhone SE will start at $399 for a 16-gigabyte model.The biggest surprises at the Apple product event involved pricing, including the Apple Watch price cut and “very attractive starting price” for the iPhone SE, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a report.The iPhone SE starting price is $50 less than the iPhone 5S it replaces, White said.“We believe this attractive price point for the iPhone SE could help Apple in developing countries, including the iPhone’s expansion in India and in Tier 3-5 cities (80-90% of China’s households) in China,” he wrote.S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino called the pricing of the iPhone SE “aggressive” and said it could help the company better penetrate emerging markets and attract more Android smartphone users.Most analysts had expected a price of about $500 for the iPhone SE, FBR analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report. The iPhone SE “provides a more inexpensive migration choice for cost-conscious customers,” Rolland said.

411,USB,"Shares of big banks all fell in response to the Federal Reserve slashing projections for future interest rate hikes, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) all finished lower Wednesday.In December, the central bank raised a key interest rate to 0.25%-0.5%, the first increase since 2006, and Fed officials such as Chair Janet Yellen talked about four rate hikes this year. On Wednesday, not only did the Fed pass on another rate hike, but implied just two quarter-point hikes to the federal funds rate this year.Markets still only see 1 rate hike in 2016, with the timing pushed back from June to September.The muted expectations are the result of a struggling global economy, a battered energy sector and stock market turmoil to start the year. Though the markets generally cheered the news, banks did not. JPMorgan shares fell 0.5% to 58.92 on the stock market today. Wells Fargo and Citigroup each tumbled 0.9%, Bank of America fell 1.9%,  U.S. Bancorp (USB) 0.6% and Goldman 1%.Bank of America fell back below its 50-day moving average after retaking that line last Friday. But JPMorgan, Wells, Citi and U.S. Bancorp held above that support level. Goldman found resistance just below the  50-day line.The lower-for-longer interest rate environment has cut into banks' net interest margins, a key measure of their profitability. It gauges the difference between what banks earn from interest paid to them from loans versus the interest banks pay out to depositors. The longer interest rates remain low, the more net interest margins get squeezed and the less profitable banks become.Coupled with squeezed margins is the lousy start to the year for banks' trading revenue. JPMorgan forecast a 20% drop in trading revenue in Q1. Citigroup said its trading revenue will drop 25% this quarter.Adding to the bad news are the nonperforming loans to energy companies, hurt badly by the collapse of crude oil prices since June 2014. JPMorgan boosted its Q1 energy loan loss reserves to $1.5 billion while Wells Fargo set aside $1.2 billion for potential losses in its energy loan portfolio. Morgan Stanley says 40% of its hefty energy loan portfolio are junk rated.Layoffs at Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley (MS) have hurt too. 
"
412,USB,"It seems like Bob Seger was being prophetic when he sang the opening lyric of ""Old Time Rock and Roll"": “Just take those old records off the shelf.”Vinyl records are making a comeback. The old “8 records for a penny” Columbia House Record Club and its parent companies have gone through bankruptcy, but the newest owner has plans to relaunch a record service, as hinted at by the ""coming soon"" on the columbiahouserecordclub.com website.  (Competing record subscription services cost about $30 a record, so don't expect “8 records for a penny.”)With two subscription-record services operating and plenty of vinyl records available in used-record shops and online, now might be a good time to re-evaluate you audio equipment.We put together a list of some reasonably-priced audio setups that would let you pull those old records off your shelf:1) If you’re going to play records, you need a turntable. The one we chose is the Audio Technica AT-LP60 USB, which sells for about $95. This model has a built-in phono preamp so you can use it with an amplifier or receiver that doesn’t have an input for a turntable. It comes with several adapter cords, so it can also be used with just a set of powered speakers. It also has a USB output, so you can plug it into your PC or laptop and record your records with the included Audacity software.The turntable is belt driven and has controls for speed (33 1/3 or 45 RPM), record size (7 or 12 inches) and on/off. There’s also a lever to raise and lower the tonearm so it can positioned over the record.2) If you’re using the turntable with a pair of unpowered speakers, you’ll need an amplifier or receiver (which contains a radio tuner). For our setup, we chose a $120 Griffin Technology Twenty Digital Audio Amplifier.This stereo amp has inputs for an optical connect used with devices like a game console or Apple’s (AAPL) Apple TV, and a 3.5 mm adapter so you can use your turntable. It puts out 20 watts per channel, and has an output jack to add a subwoofer for even better low-end sound.It has Bluetooth, so you can pair the amplifier with your smartphone or tablet and play the music stored on those devices.3) With the turntable and amplifier, you’re going to need a nice pair of speakers. Monoprice, owned by Blucora (BCOR), has a stylish pair of two-way bookshelf speakers for just under $100. “Two-way” is audio-speak for saying there are two speakers inside of each cabinet. Each brushed finished black speaker measures 9.9-by-6.1-by-10.5 inches and weighs a hefty 8.5 pounds. With a 5.25-inch woofer and a 1-inch tweeter, these easy-to-hook-up speakers sound even better than they look. No speaker wire, which is needed to connect the speakers with the amplifier/receiver, was included with our review speakers, so figure on ordering some.4) If you want to do without the amplifier completely, consider the $249 Grace Digital Bluetooth speakers. One of the speakers has a built-in amplifier that powers both speakers with 18 watts each. These bookshelf speakers are a bit smaller than the ones from Monoprice, measuring 8.5-by-4.6-by-7.5 inches, but at 8.6 pounds they weigh a tad more. Inside each speaker cabinet are a large magnet 3.5-inch woofer and a 1-inch tweeter. The controls are positioned at the top of the left speaker and include volume and audio source.The input is 3.5 mm jack, and while the Grace Digital speakers include an adapter, it’s the wrong one for the Audio Technica turntable. The adapter included with the turntable, however, worked just fine. The speakers have another advantage -- built-in Bluetooth, so you can sync up your smartphone or tablet and play music stored on those devices as well as play records. Connect one speaker to the other (speaker wire is included), plug in the turntable or sync your mobile device, and you’re good to go.5) Last but not least, if all you want to do is listen to your old records without fussing with components, we tested an updated record player -- the Archer Turntable Home Stereo System from Canada-based Electrohome. For about $100, this small-suitcase-sized phonograph has a good quality turntable, stereo speakers, a USB plug so you can connect it to your PC and make MP3s to listen to your “records” on the go, and an AUX input so you can plug in a smartphone or tablet to listen through the Archer’s stereo speakers.While the turntable and speakers aren’t quite the same quality as the components we tested, the whole system, ready to use out of the box, costs less than just the Audio Technica turntable. For a hundred bucks, you’re up and listening in minutes. Not a bad deal.

413,USB,"Exposure to energy in Wells Fargo (WFC) and an underwhelming global banking performance for Citigroup (C) factored in as they, along with U.S. Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings Friday.
"
414,USB,"Wells Fargo said it earned $1.03 a share for the quarter, up 1% from a year earlier and beating by a penny the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 0.7% to $21.6 billion, missing estimates of $21.8 billion. Full-year EPS was $4.15 a share, up 1.2% from 2014's total and matched views. Full-year revenue rose 2% to $86.1 billion, missing views of $86.5 billion.
"
415,USB,"As of Dec. 31, total assets rose 6% to $1.8 trillion compared with a year earlier. Total loans rose 6.3% to $916.6 billion. Total consumer loans grew 2.7% to $460 billion. Commercial loans grew 10% to $456.6 billion.
"
416,USB,"Wells' net interest margin, the difference between what banks earn in loans vs. what they pay out to depositors, slipped to 2.92% from the third quarter's 2.96% and 3.04% a year earlier. The Federal Reserve's decision to boost interest rates by 0.25% last month — the first interest rate hike since 2006 — is seen as helping boost banks' profitability. But the brutal start to the year for stocks, weak global growth and underwhelming inflation numbers could mean that further hikes could be delayed.
"
417,USB,"The sagging energy sector also weighed on Wells Fargo to some degree. The San Francisco-based bank reported $831 million in credit losses in the fourth quarter, up 18.2% from the quarter before, primarily due to $90 million in higher oil and gas portfolio losses as well as seasonal increases in non-real estate consumer portfolios. Costs decreased 2% to $12.4 billion from $12.65 billion, reflecting savings on employee benefits and commissions.
"
418,USB,"Shares tumbled 4.2% to 48.51 on the stock market today. Wells Fargo's IBD Composite Rating is 64 out of 99, meaning it is outperforming 64% of other publicly traded companies. It is trading well below its 50-day moving average, and that fell below its 200-day line back in September.
"
419,USB,"Meanwhile, Citigroup reported quarterly earnings of $1.06 a share, also beating views by a penny. The New York-based bank earned 6 cents a share in the year-ago quarter because of legal expenses. Revenue rose 4% to $18.6 billion, beating estimates of $17.9 billion. Full-year EPS was $5.35 a share, missing views by 9 cents, but during the year the bank earned $17.2 billion, its biggest profit in nearly a decade. For all of 2014, Citigroup earned $2.20 a share. Full-year revenue fell 1.5% to $76.1 billion, but beat estimates of $75.6 billion.
"
420,USB,"Allowance for loan losses was $12.6 billion at the end of the quarter, or 2.1% of total loans. A year earlier, that total was $16 billion, or $2.5% of total loans. Citi set aside $250 million to cover losses to its energy portfolio.
"
421,USB,"Operating expenses fell 23% to $11.1 billion, driven by lower legal costs. Loans fell 4% to $618 billion while deposits rose 1% to $908 billion. Net interest margins slipped to 2.92% compared with 2.94% in the third quarter.
"
422,USB,"Profit at Citi Holdings, Citigroup's ""bad bank"" that has housed the company's sour assets since the 2008-09 financial crisis, soared to $704 million from $87 million a year earlier, thanks in part to the sale of OneMain Financial Group, Citi's subprime lending unit. Net income at Citi's global banking unit fell 20% to $1.3 billion and income from its institutional clients group dropped 18% to $1.4 billion.
"
423,USB,"Citi has sought to become leaner and meaner since the financial crisis. It has sold off a number of its overseas assets in order to slim down. Total assets as of Dec. 31 were $1.7 trillion, putting it behind Wells Fargo in that department.
"
424,USB,"Citi's shares sank 6.5% to 42.43, well below its 50-day line, which fell below its 200-day moving average in October. Its IBD Composite Rating is 48.
"
425,USB,"Elsewhere, U.S. Bancorp earned 80 cents a share for the quarter, up 1.3% and beating views by a penny. Revenue fell 0.2% to $5.2 billion, beating estimates of $5.1 billion. Full-year EPS was $3.16, up 2.6% from the previous year, matching views. Full-year revenue rose 2.5% to $20.1 billion, missing views of $20.2 billion.
"
426,USB,"The Minneapolis-based bank earned $294 million in fees from credit and debit cards, up 8.1% and helping to offset declines in mortgage banking and investment product revenue.
"
427,USB,"Net interest margin rose to 3.06% compared with the third quarter's 3.04%, but fell from Q4 2014's 3.14%. Average total loans grew 4.2% from a year earlier to $256.7 billion while total deposits grew 6.9% to $294.5 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2015, total assets were $421.9 billion, up 4.8%.

Full-year revenue was $15.2 billion, a 1% decline, but ahead of estimates of $15.1 billion.
"
431,USB,"The Pittsburgh-based bank's net interest margin was 2.7%, down from 2.89% a year earlier, but an improvement over the third quarter's 2.67%.

The Netgear (NTGR) Arlo is a home monitoring video system that uses small, wireless cameras.Prices start at $179 for a system with a single camera, though Arlo systems with up to five high-definition cameras are available. Your gift recipient can start with the base system and add additional cameras as needed.Arlo is easy to set up. It includes a base station that plugs into an ethernet router or switch, magnetic mounts and hardware, and a start guide.Arlo stores video in the Internet cloud; a free account holds seven days' worth. Longer storage times are available for monthly fees that range up to $14.99 a month for 60 days of recording from as many as 15 cameras. For the do-it-yourselfers on your list, Bondic is the perfect gift. While it's not glue, it's great for sticking things together and performing repairs on plastic and other materials.Like the stuff your dentist uses, Bondic is a thick gel; it cures into a solid when exposed to ultraviolet light. Squeeze Bondic onto the surfaces to be repaired or glued, then shine the included tiny UV light on the gel for at least four seconds. It turns the gel into a durable solid.Bondic kits, available at http://notaglue.com/, start at $22 and include a pen-like gel dispenser. Speakers are a great way to listen to music, but most people don't have a lot of room for traditional wired models.The compact (2 x 7.4 x 4.3 inches), 2.2-pound Roar 2, from Singapore-based Creative, provides up to eight hours of great-sounding music from its three internal speakers.

467,USB,"Spending trends on U.S. credit cards slowed in the third quarter from the prior quarter, while U.S. debit-card spending on the biggest cards picked up.Credit card spending growth for Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), Discover (DFS) and American Express (AXP) networks fell 30 basis points from Q2 to 8.4%, which analyst Robert Napoli of William Blair attributed to a 27% decline in fuel prices and soft retail sales.Meanwhile, combined debit spending volume rose 190 basis points from the prior quarter to a 5.5% gain, even with a 10.8% decline at Discover, which lost a sizable partner.Still, credit quality trends at card issuers, which include American Express and many of the largest banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), are impressive, Napoli says, with record-low charge-offs and generally stable though slightly increasing delinquency rates. Visa and MasterCard do not issue credit.""We believe credit quality could remain much better than average for the industry as a whole until at least 2017,"" Napoli said.American Express had the industry's lowest delinquency rate at 1%, followed by JPMorgan Chase at 1.38%, Citigroup at 1.54%, Discover at 1.65% and Bank of America at 1.71% — all below the industry's weighted average of 2.17%.Credit-card loan growth picked up slightly in the the quarter, with U.S. Bank (USB), American Express and Capital One Financial (COF) reporting positive and accelerating portfolio growth, especially compared to relatively weaker trends at Discover, Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup.""Credit standards are being slightly loosened, credit lines are being increased, the economic and employment environment is improving and the consumer leverage ratios seem to be forming a bottom,"" Napoli noted.Shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Citigroup all rose 2%-3% near the market close, also buoyed by hawkish Fed minutes. Visa, MasterCard and American Express rose about 1%-2%.

471,USB,"Four financial stocks are making a case that they've hit a bottom, but how convincing a case is it? U.S. Bancorp (USB), PNC Financial (PNC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Northern Trust (NTRS) haven't rallied much after the market's mini flash crash in the week that ended Aug. 28. But they haven't gone down much, either. Despite weak Accumulation/Distribution Ratings, all four are trading tightly, moving sideways and holding above their Aug. 24 lows, leaving some to believe that the selling has run its course.IBD tracks three of them in its Banks-Super Regional industry group. Wells Fargo is a member of the Banks-Money Center group.Interest rates will start heading higher at some point, which should help profitability at banks, thanks to higher net interest margin — the difference between interest income and the amount of interest paid out to lenders.U.S. Bancorp pays a quarterly dividend of 25.5 cents a share, giving it an annualized dividend yield of around 2.5%. At an investor conference in mid-September, the company said that it would have to resort to cost-cutting initiatives if rates don't start rising soon.PNC Financial pays a quarterly dividend of 51 cents a share, giving it a yield of around 2.3%. As more and more consumers embrace mobile and the Internet for banking, PNC is redesigning many of its branches with financial consultants rather than tellers, who typically help with more mundane tasks.Wells Fargo's quarterly dividend of 37.5 cents a share gives it a yield of 2.9%. At the end of the second quarter, it was one of Warren Buffett's largest holdings.Northern Trust's dividend of 36 cents a share results in a yield of 2.1%. In terms of overall fundamentals, Northern Trust is the standout among the four. The company shows five straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth. Sales growth has accelerated for three straight quarters.

475,USB,"This time of year offers plenty of opportunities to give tech gifts. With Father's Day ahead and graduations on tap, here are some gift ideas that might make the grade. With summer near, it's time to hit the beach. And if you're with lots of friends, you'll want to take your music with you. Nyne's $129 TT speaker packs a high sound volume for its size and can do so for 10 hours on a single battery charge.The TT can connect to a phone, tablet or laptop via Bluetooth as well as NFC (near-field communication) — a feature that lets you connect some new phones to the speaker wirelessly, simply by tapping the phone on the TT's speaker case. It comes with a 3.5-millimeter audio cord that lets you connect the TT to the headphone jacks of most devices. At two pounds and 10 by 2 by 6 inches with a carry case, the TT is easy to take to the beach, a party or anywhere else. Just don't blast it loud enough to annoy neighbors. If your dad or grad prefers to listen to music while working out, you might opt for a set of high-quality wireless earphones, like the $129 Jabra ROX in three sizes.The ROX can connect to a smartphone, tablet or laptop using Bluetooth and offers Dolby (DLB) stereo for terrific sound quality. Its rechargeable batteries provide six hours of play-time or, when used as a phone headset, 5.5 hours of talk time and up to 190 hours of standby time. It's a simple set of equations. Graduation = Summer, Summer = Party, Party = Karaoke. It might be a tad hokey, but getting up and singing to the music is (usually) fun for all. The Singing Machine Co. offers more than two dozen models of karaoke machines.We tested the company's $199 iSM-1030BT model, which consists of a display pedestal, two microphones and two speaker columns, easily assembled. The pedestal is 38 inches tall and each of the two stereo speakers stands 27.6 inches high. The top of the pedestal has a seven-inch color display that shows menus and song lyrics; a player for CD+G discs, which have music and lyric files; microphone holders and jacks for cables and the AC power supply.The machine has a docking deck that is compatible with Apple (AAPL) iPhones and iPods, and its 3.5-inch audio input and Bluetooth enables you to bring in music and MP3+G files from other devices. A sample CD is included. Numerous collections of karaoke-track CDs are also available online, as are downloadable files from sites such as KaraokeAnywhere.net. Learning a musical instrument isn't easy. But with a video game like ""BandFuse,"" it can be fun. The $79 game, available for the Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox 360 or Sony (SNE) PlayStation 3, is similar to ""Guitar Hero."" But the game comes with a special cable that allows you to play it with a real electric guitar instead of a guitar-shaped controller.If your grad or dad follows the tutorials on-screen, they'll be more likely to become a real-life guitar hero. For an extra $100, you can buy the game with a Squire Bullet Stratocaster HS electric guitar included. Most of these gift suggestions are appropriate for dads and older grads. The $159 littleBits Synth Kit makes a terrific gift for a budding middle-school musician. Developed with Korg, the synthesizer company, the Synth Kit has a dozen models that snap together. (Each module has a magnet that holds it to another module.) These small modules include oscillators, a filter, a sequencer, a delay module, a mini-keyboard and more.Your gift recipient can hook up these modules in various ways to produce notes, drum beats and other sounds. A booklet provides 10 projects to get your musician started and explains elements of sound including frequency, pitch and timbre. And if your grad isn't into music, littleBits has other kits, including a Space Kit developed in collaboration with NASA. If Dad is a die-hard charcoal-grill enthusiast, he's probably tried several ways to get the coals hot enough to cook in a timely manner.To get the grill going, go for the $49 BBQ Dragon. While you might have seen the gadget on an infomercial, it does get the burgers on the table pronto. It looks like a hair dryer or heat gun attached to a spring clip with a gooseneck arm. It uses four AA batteries or optional rechargeable batteries (there's a USB cable included to let you charge rechargeable batteries using a wall charger). A rotating knob adjusts the speed of the BBQ Dragon's internal fan, blowing a stream of air onto your just-lit coals to heat them fast.

476,USB,"The weak September jobs report had a silver lining for most stocks: The Federal Reserve will be less likely to raise interest rates this year. But for JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C), it's just another storm cloud.Bank of America and other major banks have been counting on higher interest rates to widen the spread between their short-term borrowing costs and their long-term lending rates. Net interest margins have been squeezed in recent years, hurting core profitability.Citigroup analysts estimated that continued low interest rates would cut their 2016 earnings per share estimate for JPMorgan Chase by 5% in 2016 and 8% in 2017.The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.99% Friday after tumbling to 1.91% intraday. That's down from 2.3% on Sept. 16 — just before the Fed voted to leave rates near zero.Bank of America stock fell 1.1% on the stock market today, after dropping nearly 6% intraday. JPMorgan lost 1%. Citigroup was off just 1 cent while Wells Fargo 0.3%.Goldman Sachs (GS), which relies more on investment banking, rallied to close up 0.6%. But big regional lenders, like US Bancorp (USB) and Regions Financial (RF), lost 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rallied for 1.4% — 1.7% excluding financials.JPMorgan reports Q3 earnings on Oct. 13, with Wells Fargo the following day and other banks soon after that.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

485,USB,"A week that started off with business as usual ended on a tumultuous note, with the market swinging wildly in response to the Fed's statement Thursday.Stocks initially rose Thursday afternoon following the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates, then sold off late in the session to end mixed.On Friday, the major indexes sank early before paring some of their losses.Some industry groups were particularly affected by the Fed decision. The super regional banks group reversed sharply lower Thursday afternoon and closed down nearly 3%. On Friday, it lost another 3%.Super regionals ranked No. 126 among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, down from No. 63 six weeks ago. Go to Investors.com to view the full industry group list and rankings.Most of the stocks in the group, including Northern Trust (NTRS), PNC Financial (PNC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB), fell further below their 200-day moving averages. They've been toiling below the support line since last month's big market sell-off.Banks benefit from higher interest rates because they can get bigger net margins. When rates are low, their borrowing costs are low. But the amount they can charge on loans, and banks' earnings from other investments, are also low.Money center bank stocks are taking a hit, too. The group reversed Thursday for a more than 1% loss, and fell north of 2% Friday. It fell to No. 123 from No. 70 six weeks ago.UBS (UBS) gapped down Friday, breaching its 200-day moving average for the first time since March.It's now 13% below a 22.27 cup-with-handle buy point cleared in mid-July. UBS, with a 67 Composite Rating, is the top stock in the group based on that metric.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also gapped down Friday. The stock is holding above its Aug. 24 low, when it triggered the 8%-loss sell rule as it sank as much as 21% during the session. It's now 3% below a 62.97 buy point initially cleared in April.Also among financials, investment bankers and brokers (No. 121) lost further ground Friday.Charles Schwab (SCHW), Credit Suisse (CS), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Cowen (COWN) each gave up more than 3%.Utility stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, rose both sessions. They tend to outperform when bond yields are low, as they are now.But if rates go up, utility stocks face more competition from bonds because bond yields typically rise.The water supply group (No. 102) was one of the few gainers Friday. The gas distribution utilities group (No. 72) was nearly flat. (For more on utilities, see today's Income Investor column on Page B15.)Real estate investment trusts also tend to move with rates. Investors like them for high yields, but not as much when bond yields go up.Property REITs (No. 128) and mortgage REITs (No. 132) were also among the day's better performers, relative to other groups.
"
486,USB,"Mother's Day is right around the corner, and tech gifts provide a nice break from the usual flowers, chocolates and perfume. Here are some suggestions: Your mom isn't just any mom, and her speakers should be something special as well. Voxx International's (VOXX) $79 AR For Her wireless speakers can stream audio from a source, say a tablet, up to 30 feet away. It features both great sound and an appearance that resembles a clutch purse rather than an audio device. For even more audio portability, the $29 Zipstick, a smaller wireless speaker, resembles a large lipstick tube and comes in five colors and patterns. V-Moda is known for high-quality earphones and headphones. The new XS over-the-ear headphones come in black or silver, look fantastic and sound even better. When Mom hits the road, the XS folds up and fits in its own small hard-shell case. At $212, these aren't your run-of-the-mill headphones, but Mom deserves the best. If your mom has always wanted to take piano lessons, the Casio LK-165 keyboard makes a great present. With 61 full-size keys and 110 built-in songs, this $199 keyboard is a great learning tool. When your mom follows along with the keys as they light up and lead her through the songs, she'll soon be the one who can say, ""They all laughed when I sat down at the keyboard!"" It's not easy being a mom, but coffee helps. Why not replace the old percolator or drip machine with something a lot snazzier? If your mom likes to experiment with different brews, Keurig Green Mountain's (GMCR) single-serve K-Cups are available in over 200 different varieties of different coffees, roasts and even teas and hot chocolates. Keurig offers a number of its own brewing machines (lots of businesses have these in their waiting rooms), and its technology is licensed by other coffee makers. The one we tested was Cuisinart's $249 SS-700.There are much less expensive K-Cup brewers, but the SS-700 pulls out all the stops with a huge, 80-ounce water reservoir, five different cup sizes and even a storage compartment for the included My K-Cup holder, which lets mom use her favorite ground coffee to brew a cup.If Mom is into espresso, the new $299 Nespresso VertuoLine offers 12 blends of espresso and coffee, and can automatically read which kind of pod is in the machine and brew it correctly with a rich crema, that fancy layer of foam at the top.If Mom prefers the occasional latte or cappuccino, the Keurig Rivo might be for her. This $229 machine comes with a built-in milk frother, one key to a good latte or cappuccino, and can brew any of four flavors of Lavazza espresso in servings of either 1.4 ounces or 2.8 ounces. All Mom has to do is pop in a single-serve Rivo cartridge, press the brew button and enjoy. If the thought of mom being stranded with a dead cellphone bothers you as much as it does us, consider gifting her with the $59 Power Grid, from Tego Power. About the size of a deck of cards, it comes in four colors (black, blue, green and pink) and has a 4,200 mAh (milliamp-hours) capacity — enough to charge two phones simultaneously with its two USB ports.It comes with a USB cable so you can recharge the Power Grid from most laptops or a cellphone charger. Five small LEDs indicate how much power remains in the battery so Mom will know when to recharge. Bigger is better. That's especially true when it comes to a computer display, especially if Mom likes to watch movies or YouTube videos on her PC. The ViewSonic VX2770Smh-LED monitor provides a 27-inch wide-screen viewing experience that's excellent for looking at movies as well as more everyday tasks such as email and Web browsing. The $299 display offers 1920 x 1080 high-definition video, multiple inputs to hook it up to a TV (or cable or satellite box) and built-in speakers so Mom won't need to have separate ones cluttering up the desk. Does Mom have the new iPad Air that you gave her for the holidays? Why not give her a stylish case that will also provide protection and a real keyboard for the Apple (AAPL) tablet? The $129 Belkin QODE Ultimate Keyboard Case for the iPad Air is made of thin and light aluminum, and has an adjustable viewing angle so Mom can place the screen at any of three angles. The keyboard is both responsive and much easier to type on than the virtual on-screen keys of the tablet. And it turns on automatically when the cover is opened and off when it's closed. The QODE is available in black, silver or white.

526,USB,"Following the release of the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results last week, the Federal Reserve approved the capital plans of 34 financial institutions out of the 35 participating (including the U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets) in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).However, the capital plan of the U.S. holding company of Germany-based Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) has been rejected by the Fed on qualitative reasons. Notably, the bank’s plan failed to receive consent on flaws in assumptions for forecast of revenues and losses.Moreover, the capital plans of Goldman GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) received conditional consent with their total dividend payouts and stock buybacks to be maintained at the current levels. Additionally, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) plan has been given a green signal with the clause of improving its hypothetical lending risks analysis with other big banks.The Fed’s nod for most of the major U.S. banks reflects stability in the banking system to a great extent.""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" said Fed’s vice chairman Randal Quarles.Root of the Capital RulesCurrently authorized under the Dodd-Frank financial-services law, these stress tests were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. During the economic downturn, big financial institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed, while several others were on the verge of a meltdown. Such a turbulent situation compelled the U.S. government to infuse billions of dollars into credit markets and save the entire financial system from crumbling. Stress tests have been annually conducted since 2009.These major banks, now, have the privilege to raise dividends and buy back shares. This year’s stress test was the toughest, with severe adverse scenario featuring a severe global recession and the U.S. unemployment rate increasing to 10%, along with a steepening Treasury yield curve. Further, changes in tax rates had an adverse impact on banks’ financials as the tax law eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that inclined to increase net income at the time of financial crisis.Under this hypothetical scenario, these banks will incur a loss of $578 million. Notably, the projected losses included $113 billion from credit card loans for the banks, at an equal level with trading and counterparty positions. Also, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio (in aggregate) would fall to 7.9% from an actual 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the figure is well above the 4.5% minimum mark set by regulators.This apart, the Fed requires the big banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 3% of their assets and certain other positions.Banks that AcedWells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) are among the major banks which received the Fed’s green light to raise their dividends or repurchase shares.Among these, M&T Bank currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while all other banks carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Since the first round of stress tests, there has been substantial increase in capitals of U.S. firms. The common equity capital ratio has also more than doubled from the 5.2% in first-quarter 2009 to 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017 of the 35 bank-holding companies which participated in the 2018 CCAR. Such positive results reflect rise in common equity capital from about $800 billion to more than $1.2 trillion during the same period.Recovery on the WayGiven the tax cuts and easing of stringent regulations, banks’ optimism has yielded results. With the capital plan approvals, banks keen to reward shareholders by enhancing the size of their capital-deployment plans (raising dividends and repurchasing shares) have announced respective dividend hikes and share repurchase plans.Nevertheless, the Fed’s approval to increase dividend payment and accelerate the share buyback program will definitely help banks attract more investments, moving ahead.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

528,USB,"Driven by top-line strength, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.2% in second-quarter 2018. Earnings from continuing operations per share of $1.62 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54. Also, earnings were up 28% year over year.Net income came in at $4.5 billion or $1.63 per share, compared with $3.9 billion or $1.28 reported in the prior-year quarter.Overall high revenues were reflected, driven by elevated banking, equity markets and consumer banking revenues, along with loan growth. Moreover, expenses remained stable. However, fixed income market revenues disappointed.Citigroup’s costs of credit for the second quarter were up 6% year over year to $1.8 billion. This rise largely reflects net credit losses of $1.7 billion and a credit reserve build of $87 million.Top-Line Strength Recorded, Expenses StableRevenues were up 2% year over year to $18.5 billion in the reported quarter. This upswing highlights elevated revenues in the global consumer banking and institutional clients group, partly offset by decline in corporate/other revenues. The revenue figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.4 billion.In the Institutional Clients Group (ICG), revenues came in at $9.7 billion in the quarter, up 3% year over year. Though fixed income revenues decreased 6%, higher equity markets (up 19%) and securities services revenues (up 12%) offset this fall on a year-over-year basis. Notably, revenues from total banking climbed 6%.Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues increased 2% year over year to $8.3 billion, mainly driven by higher revenues in North America, Latin America and Asia GCB.Corporate/Other revenues came in at $528 million, tanking 20% from the prior-year quarter. The decline mainly underlined legacy assets runoff.Operating expenses at Citigroup were almost in line year over year at $10.7 billion. Increased volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were offset by efficiency savings and the winding-down of legacy assets.Strong Balance SheetAt quarter end, Citigroup’s end of period assets was $1.91 trillion, up 3% year over year. The company’s loans grew 4% year over year to $671 billion. Deposits increased 4% year over year to $997 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesTotal non-accrual assets decreased 20% year over year to $4.1 billion. The company reported a dip of 16% in consumer non-accrual loans to $2.4 billion. In addition, corporate non-accrual loans of $1.6 billion plunged 23% from the year-earlier period.Citigroup’s total allowance for loan losses was $12.1 billion at quarter end, or 1.81% of total loans, compared with $12 billion, or 1.88%, recorded in the year-ago period.Solid Capital PositionAt the end of the second quarter, Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 12.1%, down from 13.1% in the year-ago quarter. The company’s supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter came in at 6.6%, down from 7.2% in the year-earlier quarter.As of Jun 30, 2018, book value per share was $71.95, down 7% year over year and tangible book value per share was $61.29, down 9% from the prior-year period.Capital DeploymentDuring second-quarter 2018, Citigroup repurchased about 33 million of common stock. Notably, the company returned around $3.1 billion to common shareholders as common stock repurchases and dividends.Our ViewpointCitigroup reported impressive results this time around also, though the bank was impacted by lower fixed income market revenues. The company exhibits capital strength which continues to support its dividend and share buyback program. Also, overall rise in revenues is commendable. Moreover, stable expenses reflect prudent expense management.One can consider a strong brand like Citigroup to be a sound investment option over the long term, given its global footprint and attractive core business. Additionally, the company’s growth looks encouraging amid the rising rate environment, as well as anticipated ease of regulations.Nevertheless, several legal hassles and escalating costs of credit remain concerns for the company. Citigroup Inc.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Competitive LandscapeImpacted by lower mortgage banking revenues,Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) recorded a negative earnings surprise of 3.6% in second-quarter 2018. Adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12. Results were in line with the prior-year quarter earnings.Notably, results exclude net discrete income-tax expense of 10 cents per share. Including non-recurring items, net income came in at $5.2 billion or 98 cents per share compared with $5.9 billion or $1.08 per share reported in the prior-year quarter.Lower provisions and higher net interest income aided results. However, reduced fee income was an undermining factor. Moreover, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans and deposits acted as headwinds for the quarter.Among other major banks, Bank of America Corp.

529,USB,"Higher-than-expected trading revenues and rise in demand for loans drove JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2018 earnings of $2.29 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.22. The figure was up 26% from the prior-year quarter.The stock rose nearly 1% in the pre-market trading, indicating that investors have taken the results in their stride. Notably, the full-day trading session will depict a better picture.Unexpected improvement in trading activities, mainly driven by escalating trade war tensions between the United States and China boosted JPMorgan’s markets revenues. Fixed income trading and equity trading revenues were up 7% and 24%, respectively.Further, higher investment banking fees (up 17%), with equity underwriting and advisory supporting the growth, acted as a tailwind. Nevertheless, mortgage banking income declined owing to lower mortgage origination volume.Decent loan growth (driven mainly by improved wholesale and credit card loans) and rise in interest rates aided net interest income growth. The reported quarter also recorded stable provision for credit losses. Further, lower tax rate supported profitability during the quarter.The overall performance of JPMorgan’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments, except Corporate, reported a rise in net income on a year-over-year basis.Among other positives, credit card sales volume was up 11% and merchant processing volume grew 12%. Further, Commercial Banking average core loan balances grew 4% and Asset Management average loan balances rose 12%.Net income was up 18% year over year to $8.3 billion.Trading Income, Higher Rates & Loan Growth Support RevenuesNet revenues as reported were $27.8 billion in the quarter, up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the tally topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.6 billion. Rising rates, loan growth and increase in Markets revenues were the main reasons for the improvement. These were partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees and Card net interchange income.Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $16 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily due to higher compensation expenses, investments in technology and auto loan depreciation.Credit Quality ImprovesProvision for credit losses were $1.2 billion, relatively stable year over year. Also, as of Jun 30, 2018, non-performing assets were $5.8 billion, down 10% from the year-ago period.However, net charge-offs rose 4% year over year to $1.3 billion.Strong Capital PositionTier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 13.6% as of Jun 30, 2018 compared with 14.2% as of Jun 30, 2017. Tier 1 common equity capital ratio (estimated) was 11.9% as of Jun 30, 2018, down from 12.5% a year ago. Total capital ratio came in at 15.4% (estimated) as of Jun 30, 2018 compared with 16.0% as of Jun 30, 2017.Book value per share was $68.85 as of Jun 30, 2018 compared with $66.05 as of Jun 30, 2017. Tangible book value per common share came in at $55.14 at the end of June compared with $53.29 a year ago.Bottom LineContinued improvement in loans and higher interest rates are expected to continue supporting JPMorgan’s revenues. With the Fed expected to continue raising rates, the company’s interest income will likely increase. Also, gains from lower tax rates will aid profitability.However, slowdown in mortgage business is likely to continue in the near term for JPMorgan. Also, rise in operating expenses makes us apprehensive.JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | JPMorgan Chase & Co.

530,USB,"In the last five trading days, bank stocks delivered a bullish performance. While escalating trade war between the United States, China and the European Union continued to weigh on investor sentiments, strong economic data on the domestic front largely mitigated this.The latest job market data lessened the concern that the economy is in the late stage of expansion. This news resulted in rising yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury Notes. Hence, the bank stocks gained as their financials are dependent on improving economy and widening of spread.Coming to company specific news, banks’ efforts to digitize operations continued.

531,USB,"As expected, the Fed has raised interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2%. This also marks the seventh rate hike since December 2015. The central bank signaled a hawkish outlook tweaking its language for economic growth to “rising at a solid rate"" from “moderate” provided in May (read: June Rate Hike in the Cards: ETFs to Win & Lose).It also dropped its word ""stayed low"" for unemployment and “moderated” for household spending. The Fed now believes that the unemployment rate has ""declined” and household spending ""has picked up."" All these indicate two more lift-offs that would translate into four total increases in 2018.  The Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, stated that the economy had strengthened significantly since the 2008 financial crisis and is approaching a “normal” level that could allow the Fed to soon step back and play less of a hands-on role in encouraging economic activity. This reflects optimism about the health of the economy and a faster-than-expected rates hike that would shoot up the borrowing cost for cars, home mortgages and credit cards over the next year (read: Time to Buy Consumer Discretionary ETFs: 5 Top Picks).The Fed also raised its forecast for GDP growth to 2.8% for this year compared with the previous expectation of 2.7% and lowered the expectation for unemployment rate to 3.6% from 3.8%. Additionally, inflation forecast rose to 2.1% for this year through 2021.Coming to unwinding of the balance sheet, the Fed will increase the monthly cap of its $4.4 trillion balance sheet shrinkage by $10 billion per month beginning in July, bringing the total monthly reduction of its balance sheet to $40 billion from $30 billion as of June. This move will continue to push long-term rates higher.A Boon for BanksA rising rate environment is highly beneficial for cyclical sectors like financial, technology industrials and consumer discretionary but banks are in the most advantageous position. This is because they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. With the steep rise in long-term interest rates, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits (see: all the Financial ETFs here).While focusing on a particular stock in this space is certainly an option, investing in a basket of stocks via ETFs could lead to risk-adjusted returns. Given this, we have highlighted five bank ETFs that would gain from a hawkish Fed and have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report)This fund, having AUM of $5.3 billion and average trading volume of around 6.2 million, offers exposure to the regional banks.

532,USB,"Move aside traditional bankers, Humanoid Robots are here!As customers embrace new technology, banks are also trying to meet client expectations by digitizing their operations with the help of latest technology including artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual assistance.  So, for the first time in the United States, HSBC Holdings (HSBC  -  Free Report) has unveiled seven humanoid robots — Pepper — at its flagship Fifth Avenue branch in New York. Developed by SoftBank Robotics Group, the humanoid robots are expected to reduce wait time at branches, assist and encourage customers to use available technical tools and platforms, and make clients aware of HSBC products and services. All these efforts are expected to draw more business.If the robots are able to enhance customer experience, HSBC will roll these out to its 228 U.S. branches. Further, the bank intends to gradually increase Pepper’s capabilities and allow customers to complete product applications on its tablets. Notably, the company has spent nearly $131 million on robots and other technology upgrades.Pablo Sanchez, regional head of retail banking and wealth management segment for HSBC in the U.S. and Canada, said, “We’re focused on developing the ‘branch of the future,’ and our use of Pepper will streamline branch operations and delight our customers, allowing bank staff to have deeper, more high-value customer engagements.”HSBC is not the only bank using AI to interact with customers. In 2016, Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) introduced Erica, the AI-enabled financial assistant. This along with Zelle (which allows consumers make payments to one another using their smartphones) is helping this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to win new customers.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) are also using virtual assistance to interact with clients.

533,USB,"Regional banks ETFs are rising this week. There are many reasons behind this trend.The economy is gaining momentum and most of the recent economic reports, including the jobs report, have been better than expected. Regional banks benefit from an improving economy as loan growth picks up.And rates are rising. The 10-year note yield, which was around 2.4% at the beginning of the year had surged to over 3.1% last month. It has since come down to around 2.95%, mainly due to geopolitical concerns.Rates have been inching higher again after the jobs report and the Fed appears all set to raise rates at its meeting next week.Last month, the congress approved the biggest roll-back of Dodd-Frank reforms that were enacted in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Small and regional banks are set to benefit from easing of these regulations.A strong economy and higher interest rates benefit all banks but regional banks stand to benefit more since interest rate spread is their main source of earnings.The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) is the most popular ETF in the space with $5.2 B in AUM. It’s an equal-weighted ETF with 120 holdings.The iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (IAT  -  Free Report) has 53 holdings and top three holdings—U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report), PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) and BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report)--account for more than one-third of assets.The PowerShares KBW Regional Banking Portfolio (KBWR) also follows equal-weighing methodology.

534,USB,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is slashing 100 jobs in its mortgage operations branch located in Fort Mill on account of subdued activity in U.S. housing market.""The decision to reduce our workforce is made with great concern for our team members. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is committed to retaining valued team members and, where possible, we will work to identify other opportunities within Wells Fargo,"" the bank said.Wells Fargo has taken this decision to better align staff levels with present sales volume. The U.S. mortgage market is facing declining origination volumes as mortgage rates are becoming expensive. Further, intense competition and falling supplies of homes for sale has also impacted housing demands.For the first three months of 2018, Wells Fargo reported a decline in residential mortgage loan originations compared with the last few months of 2017.Similar Layoffs by Other BanksWells Fargo is not the only company to be impacted by declining mortgage activity. Other mortgage lenders have also announced layoffs in 2018 while some have shut down the segment altogether.In late May 2018, Movement Mortgage, a South Carolina-based mortgage lender, announced the decision to lay off about 100 employees after having already reduced its workforce by 75 employees in February.Also, U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) banking subsidiary, U.S. Bank, announced that it will cut 260 jobs, starting July, as it plans to close its Bedford mortgage and consumer banking office.In April 2018, MB Financial (MBFI  -  Free Report) disclosed plans to shut down its national mortgage origination business, which resulted in the layoff of almost 600 employees at locations across southeast Michigan.""With recent economic changes, the competitiveness of the mortgage industry, and recent low origination margins, we determined that we would be unable to successfully execute that strategy within a reasonable period of time"", CEO Mitch Feiger said in a statement at the time.Our TakeWells Fargo is finally on the journey to move ahead of its past misconducts and legal involvements. Its impressive cost-control plan for 2018 will help it deal with the pressure on costs. Also, the bank’s efforts to recover its image, along with an improving economic backdrop might support the company’s growth in the near term.The stock has lost 1.9% in the past year against the industry’s growth of nearly 13%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same space is Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report).

535,USB,"Over the last five trading days, the most important development was the Fed’s decision to raise the outlook for number of rate hikes to four this year, apart from increasing the interest rates for the second time in 2018. Also, the central bank provided improved economic growth forecast for the year.As banks are the biggest beneficiary of higher interest rates and their overall growth is tied to that of the nation, these developments will likely further support their profitability.However, banks’ price performance was bearish over the last five trading sessions. So, what could be the reasons behind this dismal investor stance?Well, one of the reasons seems to be lackluster performance of the broader market over the same time frame. Impending trade war fear and geo-political tensions were the primary reasons for this dismal performance. So, banking stocks did not remain untouched.Further, the finding by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) wasn’t alone in opening unauthorized accounts and that there are several other major banks with similar business misconducts made investors skeptical. While no names were disclosed, the concern that banks may face additional probes and lawsuits hurt investor sentiments.Additionally, in line with other major banks, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) also provided soft trading outlook for the second quarter.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending Jun 1, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

536,USB,"Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of $56 billion, up 27.5% year over year. Notably, community banks, constituting 92% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported net income of $6.1 billion, up 17.7% on a year-over-year basis.Banks’ earnings were driven by higher net operating revenues and a lower effective tax rate. Further, rise in loans and net interest margin were tailwinds. Moreover, decline in number of ‘problem banks’ was a positive. However, higher non-interest expenses and provisions were undermining factors.Banks, with assets worth more than $10 billion, accounted for a major part of earnings in the reported quarter. Though such banks constitute only 1.8% of the total number of domestic banks, these accounted for approximately 80% of the industry’s earnings. Leading names in this space include JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report).All the above-mentioned banks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

More than 70% of all FDIC-insured institutions reported improvement in quarterly net income, while the remaining witnessed a decline from the prior-year quarter level. Additionally, the percentage of institutions reporting net losses in the quarter declined to 3.9% from 4.3% in the year-ago quarter.As of Mar 31, 2018, the measure for profitability or average return on assets (ROA) increased to 1.28% from 1.04% recorded as of Mar 31, 2017.Net operating revenues were $198.7 billion, up 8.2% year over year. A rise in net interest income, as well as non-interest income, was the driving factor.Net interest income was recorded at $131.3 billion, up 8.5% year over year, driven by rise in net interest income of 85.9% of banks. Net interest margin (NIM) inched up to 3.32% from 3.19% recorded in the year-earlier quarter, stemming from growth in interest-bearing assets. Notably, 69.4% of banks reported rise in NIM.Non-interest income for the banks climbed 7.9% year over year to $67.4 billion. This upswing was backed by higher trading revenues and other non-interest income.Total non-interest expenses for the establishments were $115.6 billion in the quarter, up 5.8% on a year-over-year basis, due to rise in other non-interest expenses, and elevated salary and employee-benefit expenses.Credit Quality: A Concern?Overall, credit quality was a mixed bag in the reported quarter. Net charge-offs increased to $12.1 billion, up 4.7% year over year. Notably, higher credit card charge-offs aided the upside.In the reported quarter, provisions for loan losses for the institutions were $12.4 billion, up 3% year over year. The level of non-current loans and leases declined 10% year over year to $112.5 billion. The non-current rate was 1.15%.Strong Loan & Deposit GrowthThe capital position of the banks remained solid. Total deposits continued to rise and were recorded at $13.5 trillion, up 3.4% year over year. Further, total loans and leases were $9.8 trillion, up 4.9% year over year.As of Mar 31, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance increased to $95.1 billion from $84.9 billion as of Mar 31, 2017. Furthermore, interest earned on investment securities and assessment income primarily supported growth in fund balance.No Bank Failures, Shrinking Problem Institutions, New Charters AddedDuring the January-March quarter, none of the banks failed, three new charters were added, while 65 were merged. As of Mar 31, 2018, the number of ‘problem’ banks declined from 95 to 92. This signifies the lowest number since first-quarter 2008. Total assets of the ‘problem’ institutions declined to $56.4 billion from $13.9 billion reported in the prior quarter.Our ViewpointThe decline in the number of problem institutions looks encouraging, with the quarter witnessing top-line growth on higher NIM. Banks have been gradually easing lending standards and trending toward higher fees to counter pressure on the top line. In addition, more interest rate hikes will help ease the pressure on interest income. Also, continued expense control and stable balance sheets are likely to act as tailwinds in the upcoming quarters.What encourages us is that a lot depends on to what extent Trump lives up to his promises. Bank stocks are likely to face the brunt if the promised policy goals are not achieved.The Fed’s actions on expediting rate hike — which is again a function of economic growth based on Trump’s policy alterations — will also play a key role in keeping the optimism on bank stocks alive.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

537,USB,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is USB due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.U.S. Bancorp's Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues UpU.S. Bancorp’s first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 82 cents.The company’s top line benefitted from rise in net interest income on the back of easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Further, elevated average loans and deposit balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses and lower mortgage banking revenues remained major drags.After considering impacts of notable items, net income was $1.68 billion, up 13.7% year over year.Revenues, Loans & Deposits Rise, Costs IncreaseU.S. Bancorp’s net revenues came in at around $5.5 billion in the quarter, up 3.4% year over year. The increase in net interest income and non-interest income contributed to higher revenues.U.S. Bancorp’s tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 5.5% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to loan growth and rising interest rates, partially offset by deposit and funding mix.Average earning assets climbed 3.1% year over year, supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities, along with elevated average other earning assets. Furthermore, net interest margin of 3.13% was up 7 basis points (bps) year over year, driven by higher interest rates. Higher funding costs, loan mix and elevated cash balances partially mitigated the rise in margins.U.S. Bancorp’s non-interest income increased slightly on a year-over-year basis to $2.3 billion. The rise was primarily due to higher payment services revenues, trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges, partially offset by lower mortgage banking and commercial products revenues.Provision for credit losses decreased 1.2% year over year to $341 million in the reported quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s average total loans climbed 2.3% year over year to $279.4 billion. The growth was backed by a rise in commercial loans, residential mortgages, credit card lending, total other retail and retail leasing. These increases were partially offset by a drop in commercial real estate.Average total deposits were up 1.9% from the prior-year quarter to $334.6 billion. The rise was due to growth in interest-bearing deposits, partly offset by lower non-interest-bearing deposits.Non-interest expenses rose 5% year over year to $3.1 billion, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expenses, technology investment and seasonal marketing and development expenses, partially offset by lower professional services and other expenses.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagCredit metrics at U.S. Bancorp deteriorated in the reported quarter. Net charge-offs came in at $341 million, up nearly 1.8% year over year. On a year-over-year basis, the company experienced deterioration, mainly in net charge-offs in the credit card segment. Also, total allowance for credit losses was $4.4 billion, up 1.2%.However, non-performing assets came in at $1.2 billion, down 19.5% year over year.Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review, U.S. Bancorp maintained a decent capital position. Beginning Jan 1, 2018, the regulatory capital requirements fully reflected implementation of Basel III.The tier 1 capital ratio came in at 10.4%, down 6 bps from the prior-year quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 9.5% in the year-ago quarter.All regulatory ratios of U.S. Bancorp continued to be in excess of well-capitalized requirements. In addition, based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach, the Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.5% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 11.8% as of Mar 31, 2017.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.7% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 7.6% in prior-year quarter.U.S. Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share, which increased to $26.54 as of Mar 31, 2018, from $25.05 recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company’s capital strength during the first quarter, U.S. Bancorp returned 68% of earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks.OutlookManagement expects the total interest bearing deposit beta following the most recent rate hike to be about 40%. As future rate hikes occur, deposit beta is expected to continue to gradually trend toward 50% level.Management expects net interest income to increase at a mid-single digit on a year-over-year basis in second-quarter 2018.Management expects fee income to increase at a low single digit on a year-over-year basis. Notably, fees are seasonally higher in the second quarter.Merchant processing revenue continues to be impacted by exiting two joint ventures in the second quarter of 2017. Therefore, management continues to expect that merchant acquiring revenue will return to a more normalized mid-single digit pace by the third quarter of 2018.Expense growth on a year-over-year basis is likely to be in the mid-single digit range, within long-term growth target of 3 to 5%. Management expects positive operating leverage for the full year 2018.Credit quality is projected to remain stable sequentially.Full-Year 2018Management expects effective rate in 2018 to be nearly 21%.Management expects full-year 2018 expense growth to be within the 3-5% range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

539,USB,"Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter earnings results on Apr 16 and Apr 18, respectively. While Bank of America’s first-quarter earnings per share and revenues outpaced their respective estimates, U.S. Bancorp managed to beat its bottom-line estimate by only a cent, while missing on the top line.Both bank stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Now, let’s see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals, post-earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings came from other big banks like The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report).Q1 Earnings PerformanceBank of America’s first-quarter earnings of 62 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Also, the figure was 38% higher than the prior-year quarter. Net quarterly revenues came in at $23.1 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.9 billion and increasing nearly 4% from the prior-year quarter. (Read More: BofA Tops Q1 Earnings on Higher Rates, Equity Trading)Meanwhile, U.S. Bancorp’s first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by only a penny. The figure did not show improvement from the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 82 cents. U.S. Bancorp’s net quarterly revenues of $5.5 billion lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53 billion. (Read More: U.S. Bancorp's Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Up)Price PerformanceBank of America has gained 30.3% in the past year and outperformed the broader industry that has moved up 16.9%. In comparison, U.S. Bancorp has not only underperformed the broader industry but also Bank of America, declining 3.3% over the same time frame.ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the industry is clearly undervalued. This implies that the industry has upside potential for the near future. The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/B ratio — which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next — of 1.74, which is below the S&P 500’s average of 3.85. Hence, it might be a good idea to focus on stocks belonging to this particular industry post-earnings.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.86 U.S. Bancorp is undervalued than the S&P 500 but overvalued than the industry. However, Bank of America with a P/B ratio of 1.25 is less pricey than both the S&P 500 and the industry. Dividend YieldU.S. Bancorp’s dividend yield over the last year is 2.41%, higher than the broader industry’s figure of 2.11%. With a dividend yield of only 1.63%, Bank of America shareholders earn a comparatively lower dividend yield than both its smaller competitor and the broader industry.Return on Assets (ROA)Return on assets (ROA) is one of the key financial ratios for banks as they rely heavily on their assets to create revenues. A positive ROA indicates that the company has reported gains from its assets for the period in question. Coming to U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America, ROA for the trailing 12-months (TTM) is 1.36% and 1.21%, respectively. U.S. Bancorp has a higher ROA than not only Bank of America, but also the industry, which has ROA of 1.06%.Earnings History and Estimate RevisionsU.S. Bancorp delivered positive surprises in each of the last four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 0.95%. In comparison, Bank of America delivered an earnings beat in all the trailing four quarters and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5.8%.When considering estimate revisions, Bank of America’s earnings estimate for the current year has improved 2.8% over the last 60 days. Meanwhile, U.S. Bancorp’s earnings estimate has declined by 0.3% over the same period. ConclusionIn our comparative analysis, we found that both the two big banks have certain positives. U.S. Bancorp has better ROA position and has a higher dividend yield. However, in terms of valuation, Bank of America is underpriced compared to U.S. Bancorp. Further, Bank of America has comparatively better price performance than U.S. Bancorp.Moreover, Bank of America holds an edge over U.S. Bancorp when considering its average positive earnings surprise and estimate revisions. What clinches the case in favor of Bank of America at this point of time is that it has posted better earnings results than U.S. Bancorp. In this respect, our analysis clearly indicates that Bank of America is better positioned than U.S. Bancorp and thus calls for investors’ attention after earnings.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Moreover, net interest margin increased 22 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 3.44%.Non-interest income was around $68.7 million, up nearly 9% year over year. The rise was primarily prompted by higher deposit service fees, wealth and investment fees and other income. These were, however, partially offset by a fall in mortgage banking activities along with loan-related fees.Non-interest expenses of $171.6 million climbed 4.8% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to higher compensation and benefits expenses, technology and equipment along with other expenses, partially offset by a fall in marketing and occupancy costs.Efficiency ratio came in at 59.76% compared with 62.10% as of Mar 31, 2017. A lower ratio indicates improved profitability.  The company’s total loans and leases as of Mar 31, 2018 were $17.8 billion, up 1.6% sequentially.

This was mainly due to higher interest-earning asset yields given balance sheet optimization initiatives and improving loan mix, partly mitigated by increase in funding costs.Also, non-interest income declined 2% to $371 million.

543,USB,"The financial sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. After President Donald Trump passed the tax reform last year, analysts are highly optimistic about the financial sector’s performance owing to recent trends in the sector.The Senate recently passed the deregulation bill, scaling back Dodd Frank. This is expected to be a huge positive for regional banks. Moreover, the current market sentiment around rate hikes by the Fed is expected to play in favor of the overall financial sector.Cause for AppealIn a landmark victory for Trump, the Senate passed a massive banking deregulation bill. In a rare showing of bipartisanship, the Senate voted 67 to 31 in favor of the bill, intended to help small banks become more competitive. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets would be exempted from the Volcker Rule, which prohibits federally insured institutions from trading for their own profits and also puts regulatory measures in place to limit their ownership of risky investments.Although some hurdles still remain, as the House may seek a more expansive rollback of the Dodd-Frank act, the bill is widely expected to become law. Moreover, although the regional banking sector celebrated this event, skeptics have warned of dire consequences in case it becomes law (read: Time for Top Bank ETFs Ahead of Powell's First Fed Meeting?).Further, driving positive sentiment for the overall financial sector is the current scenario around interest rates. Traders place a 94.4% probability around a rate hike in Jerome Powell’s first FOMC meeting, per the CME Fedwatch tool. Moreover, the debate on if the Fed will go ahead with three rate hikes or four in 2018 is still doing the rounds. Rate hikes are particularly positive for financial stocks, as it leads to an increase in the prime rates, at which banks lend to customers.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the space.Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks in the U.S. equity markets.

546,USB,"BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents. The figure recorded 31.1% surge from the year-ago quarter.Results reflected a slight rise in revenues and lower operating expenses. However, higher credit costs and a decline in loan balance were the undermining factors.Results excluded merger-related and restructuring charges. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $745 million or 94 cents per share, up from $378 million or 46 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Grow Slightly, Expenses DeclineTotal revenues (taxable-equivalent) came in at $2.84 billion, up marginally year over year. The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.83 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income increased slightly from the prior-year quarter to $1.66 billion. Net interest margin fell 2 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.44%.Non-interest income increased nearly 1% year over year to $1.18 billion. Higher investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, and bankcard fees and merchant discounts were partly offset by decline in insurance income and mortgage banking income.Non-interest expenses of $1.69 billion fell 19.8% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower outside IT services costs and net merger-related and restructuring charges as well as absence of loss on early extinguishment of debt.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 57.3%, down from 58.0% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates rise in profitability.As of Mar 31, 2018, total deposits were nearly $158.2 billion, up marginally from the prior quarter. Total loans and leases of $144.2 billion were down slightly on a sequential basis.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Mar 31, 2018, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $669 million, down 16.5% year over year.

Return on average common equity improved to 11.43% from 5.72% as of Mar 31, 2017.As of Mar 31, 2018, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12%, on par with the year-ago quarter.

Also, expected growth in loans, along with an improving rate scenario, is likely to propel its organic growth trajectory in the quarters ahead. However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability to some extent.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteBB&T carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

547,USB,"Most banks that reported first-quarter 2018 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of rising rates, lower taxes and improved trading activities. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, banks’ results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, the results show eased margin pressure.Importantly, high volatility led to improved trading activities in the quarter, leading to higher trading revenues for banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing. Also, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and personnel, and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor. Nevertheless, legal expenses remained under control. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Apr 13, 2018)Important Earnings of the Week1. Driven by top-line strength, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3% in first-quarter 2018. Earnings per share of $1.68 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.35 per share.

Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) recorded positive earnings surprise of 4.7% in the first quarter. Earnings of $1.12 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07.

Nonetheless, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income, with lower mortgage revenues, were the undermining factors. Additionally, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans and deposits acted as headwinds for the quarter. (Read more: Wells Fargo Q1 Earnings Beat, Low Provisions Recorded)3. Amid an expected weakness in investment banking, strong trading results, higher rates and lower tax rate drove JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $2.37 per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.28. The reported figure was up 44% from the prior-year quarter. Results in the reported quarter included 11 cents per share of mark-to-market gains related to the adoption of new recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost.Decent loan growth (driven mainly by improved wholesale loans) and higher interest rates aided net interest income growth. Further, higher equity trading income (up 26%) and fixed income trading (up 8%) supported the top line. Additionally, mortgage banking income witnessed a rise, driven by growth in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by fall in mortgage origination volume.

PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $2.43 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Moreover, the bottom line reflected a 24% increase from the prior-year quarter. Continued easing of pressure on net interest margin helped the company earn higher net interest income during the quarter. Though mortgage banking revenues declined, overall non-interest income witnessed year-over-year growth. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent. Further, the results were partially offset by higher provisions. The company’s net income for the quarter was $1.24 billion, up 15.4% from the prior-year quarter.

548,USB,"Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc.’s (WDR  -  Free Report) issuer rating has been downgraded from Baa3 to Ba1 and the company has been assigned a Corporate Family Rating (CFR) of Ba1 by Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation. Simultaneously, the company’s outlook has been changed to stable from negative.Reasons for the Rating Downgrade & Stable OutlookOwing to a challenging business environment and continuous net outflows across all of its distribution channels, Waddell & Reed has been reporting a fall in its assets under management (AUM) since the past few years. Over the last five years (2013-2017), AUM decreased at a CAGR of 10.5%. As a result, its competitive position within the industry weakened.Adding to this, the presence of substantial intangibles on the company’s balance sheet increases risk. Moreover, looking at the company’s recent investments, the reinvestment of $300 million of its cash reserves into a portfolio of investment grade fixed income securities with a one-year average duration increases its market risk.It is because of the above-mentioned reasons that Moody’s went for a rating downgrade. Moreover, Moody’s believes that though the company is taking several initiatives to improve efficiency, optimize operations and modernize its Retail Broker-Dealer channel by providing additional support to its advisors through training opportunities and enhanced technology tools, these are not sufficient to improve its credit profile that has been impacted negatively because of the deterioration in its investment management business' competitive position.Additionally, because of an increased focus toward passive investment management, regaining its competitive position, particularly within the Retail Unaffiliated Distribution channel, is not expected in the near future, according to Moody’s.Nevertheless, Moody’s upgraded the company’s outlook from negative to stable as it believes that the steps taken to modernize the Broker-Dealer channel would lead to slight improvement in margin and it would help the company’s fundamental business model to diversify economically. This is because, going forward, a portion of the company’s assets will become less dependent on the investment performance of its funds for asset retention and replacement.What Can Drive the Ratings UpPer Moody’s, a rating upgrade can take place if the company witnesses sustained rise in net flows with replacement rates of more than 100%, has retention rates of more than 80% and delivers continued growth in revenues with investment performance improvement.What Can Bring the Ratings DownOn the other hand, a downward pressure on ratings can occur if there is an increased decline in AUM, if losses develop in the company's corporate bond investments or the company is unable to improve its investment performance materially.Shares of Waddell & Reed have gained 14.7% in the past six months, marginally outperforming 14.3% growth for the industry.The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

549,USB,"Barclays’ (BCS  -  Free Report) senior unsecured debt and the Baa2 long-term issuer ratings, and the Prime-3 short-term issuer ratings have been placed under review for possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report).Additionally, the baa2 standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA), the A1 long-term deposit and senior unsecured debt ratings, the Prime-1 short-term deposit ratings and the A1 (cr) long-term Counterparty Risk (CR) assessment of the bank’s operating entity Barclays Bank PLC are under review for probable downgrade. Nonetheless, Barclays Bank's Prime-1(cr) short-term CR assessment has been reiterated.Reasons for Probable Ratings DowngradeAndrea Usai, Senior Vice President at Moody's said, “The review for downgrade on Barclays reflects the group's ongoing credit weaknesses and likely impact of ring-fencing implementation, which have been the main drivers for the negative outlook since last September.”Barclays is restructuring its operations given the impending requirement to separate its domestic retail and business banking operations from other business, per the U.K.'s ring-fencing rules. The company intends to fulfil this by April 2018 with Barclays Bank becoming its non-ring-fenced bank.Therefore, Barclays’ existing U.K. retail and business banking operations will be transferred to the newly created ring-fenced bank — Barclays Bank U.K. As this new entity will become more dependent on risky wholesale and capital markets activities, it will lead to rise in risk profile and earnings volatility. Overall, these would result in “a weaker standalone credit profile for Barclays Bank.”At present, Barclays Bank’s ratings are supported by Barclays’ strong businesses, solid loan growth and diversified funding sources, partially offset by weaker net profitability (expected to continue over the next few quarters) and capital markets activities.What Will Moody’s Review?As part of review, Moody’s intends to reassess the standalone credit profiles of Barclays Bank (following the rind-fencing) and broader Barclays. This will include whether business diversification going forward will support stable profits “sufficient to maintain the one-notch positive adjustment for Business Diversification, currently included in the BCA for Barclays Bank.”Moody’s also plans to assess the expected loss for each instrument class issued by Barclays, Barclays Bank and Barclays Bank U.K. through its advanced Loss Given Failure analysis. Further as a result of implementation of ring-fencing, Moody’s for the first time will provide “separate notional BCA to the broader Barclays group.”Our TakeBarclays’ restructuring and business simplifying efforts have ended successfully and will likely continue to result in decrease in expenses. Also, driven by these efforts, the company intends to announce dividend of 6.5 pence per share (subject to regulatory approvals) in 2018.While Moody’s review (expected to be completed over next few weeks) may weigh on the stock in the near term, improving global economy will support Barclays’ profitability.Over the last six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 17.9% on the on the NYSE, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereNotably, other than Barclays, the rating agency have put some other finance companies including E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) under review.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

550,USB,"Over the last four trading days, volatility in the stock market has affected the banking stocks as well. The main highlight was the release of the Fed minutes of the January FOMC meeting. The latest report highlights that improving economic growth, stimulus from the recent tax cuts and rise in inflation support a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.Further, given the growth in economy, low unemployment rate and healthy consumer sentiment, the demand for loans and other related products of banks will rise. Overall, though these will be beneficial for the banks’ financials, the markets seem to be wary of such a scenario. Thus, this led to significant volatility and bank stocks’ performance turned bearish over the last four trading sessions.Mortgage rates were also on an upswing, with 30-year mortgages averaging 4.40% (highest since April 2014), as money was pulled out of the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Rise in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, efforts to strengthen profitability persisted. Further, past business misconduct continued to haunt over the last four trading days. Moreover, banks are undertaking initiatives to pass on the benefits from lower tax rates to employees and shareholders.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Feb 16, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

In March 2017, the rating agency had rated U.S. Bancorp’s senior unsecured and subordinated debt as A1.Moody’s initiated the review on account of the $613 million settlement that U.S. Bancorp had agreed upon with several U.S. regulatory bodies last week due to shortcomings in its anti-money laundering and willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.Ratings for U.S. Bancorp’s subsidiaries along with its bank subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association, have been placed for review. U.S. Bank’s long-term deposits rating of Aa1, issuer and senior unsecured debt rating of A1, baseline credit assessment (BCA) of aa3 and counterparty risk assessment of Aa2(cr) are also under review. However, short-term ratings of Prime-1 for short-term deposits and senior debts were affirmed and are not under review.Following the legal settlement, Moody’s felt the necessity to review whether the company’s risk management system continues to be better in comparison to its competitors. Though, the settlement amount was beyond Moody’s expectations, it anticipates U.S. Bancorp’s earnings and capital position remains well poised to bear the impact.The rating agency will be considering whether U.S. Bank’s BCA rating of aa3 is still justified.

551,USB,"U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 82 cents.The company’s top line benefitted from rise in net interest income on the back of easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Further, elevated average loans and deposit balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses and lower mortgage banking revenues remained major drags.After considering impacts of notable items, net income was $1.68 billion, up 13.7% year over year. Revenues, Loans & Deposits Rise, Costs IncreaseU.S. Bancorp’s net revenues came in at around $5.5 billion in the quarter, up 3.4% year over year. The increase in net interest income and non-interest income contributed to higher revenues. However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53 billion.U.S. Bancorp’s tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 5.5% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to loan growth and rising interest rates, partially offset by deposit and funding mix.Average earning assets climbed 3.1% year over year, supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities, along with elevated average other earning assets. Furthermore, net interest margin of 3.13% was up 7 basis points (bps) year over year, driven by higher interest rates. Higher funding costs, loan mix and elevated cash balances partially mitigated the rise in margins.U.S. Bancorp’s non-interest income increased slightly on a year-over-year basis to $2.3 billion. The rise was primarily due to higher payment services revenues, trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges, partially offset by lower mortgage banking and commercial products revenues.Provision for credit losses decreased 1.2% year over year to $341 million in the reported quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s average total loans climbed 2.3% year over year to $279.4 billion. The growth was backed by a rise in commercial loans, residential mortgages, credit card lending, total other retail and retail leasing. These increases were partially offset by a drop in commercial real estate.Average total deposits were up 1.9% from the prior-year quarter to $334.6 billion. The rise was due to growth in interest-bearing deposits, partly offset by lower non-interest-bearing deposits.Non-interest expenses rose 5% year over year to $3.1 billion, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expenses, technology investment and seasonal marketing and development expenses, partially offset by lower professional services and other expenses. Credit Quality: A Mixed BagCredit metrics at U.S. Bancorp deteriorated in the reported quarter. Net charge-offs came in at $341 million, up nearly 1.8% year over year. On a year-over-year basis, the company experienced deterioration, mainly in net charge-offs in the credit card segment. Also, total allowance for credit losses was $4.4 billion, up 1.2%.However, non-performing assets came in at $1.2 billion, down 19.5% year over year. Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review, U.S. Bancorp maintained a decent capital position. Beginning Jan 1, 2018, the regulatory capital requirements fully reflected implementation of Basel III.The tier 1 capital ratio came in at 10.4%, down 6 bps from the prior-year quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 9.5% in the year-ago quarter.All regulatory ratios of U.S. Bancorp continued to be in excess of well-capitalized requirements. In addition, based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach, the Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.5% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 11.8% as of Mar 31, 2017.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.7% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 7.6% in prior-year quarter.U.S. Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share, which increased to $26.54 as of Mar 31, 2018, from $25.05 recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter. Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company’s capital strength during the first quarter, U.S. Bancorp returned 68% of earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks.ConclusionU.S. Bancorp posted a decent quarter. Elevated revenues on the back of increased lending activities and higher interest rates was a positive factor. Further, improving economy and lower taxes are likely to continue supporting its financials. Moreover, its efforts to enhance digital offerings and expand treasury management and payment services capabilities bode well for the long term.Nevertheless, weakness in the credit card portfolio adversely affected its asset quality. Additionally, there are concerns related to the impact of legal issues and the company’s global exposure. Also, escalating expenses remain a headwind. U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteU.S. Bancorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

552,USB,"Over the last five trading days, volatility in the stock market affected the banking stocks as well. The Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s congressional testimony dominated, wherein he presented an optimistic picture of the U.S. economy. This view hints at a rise in inflation, which will give the Fed all the more reason to take a hawkish stance in raising interest rates.Additionally, growth in economy, low unemployment rate and strong consumer sentiment will drive the demand for loans and other related products of banks. These will support banks’ financials though the markets seem to be wary of such a scenario. Hence, this led to significant volatility and bank stocks’ performance turned bearish over the last five trading sessions.Driven by the Fed’s upbeat view on the economy, mortgage rates were also on an upswing with 30-year mortgages averaging 4.43% (highest in more than four years). However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Rise in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, business misconducts continued to dominate headlines. On the other hand, banks seem to be optimistic about gains from improving economy.Further, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $42.2 billion, down 2.3% year over year. Results were adversely impacted by elevated income taxes, higher non-interest expenses and loan loss provisions.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Feb 23, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

(Read more: Wells Fargo Sued Over Unfair Discrimination Practices)3. In yet other setback for Wells Fargo, it disclosed to have overcharged customers in investment and fiduciary services business. In the annual filing, the bank said the review process of its Wealth and Investment Management segment is in “preliminary stages.”After facing inquiries from the financial regulators in late 2017 for forcing customers to buy products and services they did not require, Wells Fargo agreed to do a detailed investigation of the segment.In its latest 10-K filing, the bank revealed that it is currently assessing whether there has been unjustified referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers to the bank’s investment and fiduciary services business.So far in the review process, the bank has found that in some cases customers have been overcharged fees in connection with certain assets and accounts. There have been issues of incorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record of the values associated with certain assets.Wells Fargo is yet to determine the number of accounts that were affected along with the reason that led to the wrongdoing.4.

Including the one-time tax-reform impact, net income came in at $4.1 billion, down 14.2% year over year.Banks’ earnings were affected by elevated income taxes, higher non-interest expenses and loan loss provisions.Banks, with assets worth more than $10 billion, accounted for a major part of earnings in the reported quarter. Though such banks constitute only 1.8% of the total number of domestic banks, these accounted for approximately 80% of the industry’s earnings. Leading names in this space include JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report).For 2017, FDIC-insured banks reported net income of $183.1 billion, up 7.2% year over year. Including the one-time tax-reform impact, net income came in at $164.8 billion, down 3.5% year over year.Net Interest Income & Margin Rise, Non-Interest Income Falls, Costs Flare UpAs of Dec 31, 2017, the measure for profitability or average return on assets (ROA) edged down to 0.97% from 1.04% recorded as of Dec 31, 2016.Net operating revenues were $192.2 billion, up 5.5% year over year. A rise in net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest income, was a driving factor.Net interest income was recorded at $129.5 billion, up 8.5% year over year, driven by rise in net interest income of 86.4% of banks. Net interest margin (NIM) inched up to 3.31% from 3.16% recorded in the year-earlier quarter owing to a rise in interest-bearing assets. This depicts the highest average margin for the industry since fourth-quarter 2012.Non-interest income for the banks declined slightly year over year to $62.7 billion.Total non-interest expenses for the establishments were $118 billion in the quarter, up 8.6% on a year-over-year basis, due to rise in other non-interest expenses.Credit Quality: A Concern?Overall, credit quality was a mixed bag in the reported quarter. Net charge-offs increased to $13.2 billion, up 8.7% year over year, reflecting the ninth quarterly rise. Notably, higher credit card charge-offs drove the upside.In the reported quarter, provisions for loan losses for the institutions were $13.6 billion, up 8.9% year over year. The level of non-current loans and leases declined 11.8% year over year to $116.4 billion. The non-current rate was 1.20%, reflecting the lowest rate since third-quarter 2007.Strong Loan & Deposit GrowthThe capital position of the banks remained solid. Total deposits continued to rise and were recorded at $13.4 trillion, up 3.9% year over year. Further, total loans and leases were $9.7 trillion, up 4.5% year over year.As of Dec 31, 2017, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance increased to $92.7 billion from $83.2 billion as of Dec 31, 2016. Furthermore, interest earned on investment securities primarily led to growth in fund balance.Two Bank Failures, Shrinking Problem Institutions, New Charter AddedDuring fourth-quarter 2017, two banks failed, one new charter was added, while 64 were merged. As of Dec 31, 2017, the number of ‘problem’ banks declined from 104 to 95. This signifies the lowest number in more than seven years, down from 888 recorded in first-quarter 2011. Total assets of the ‘problem’ institutions declined to $13.9 billion from $16 billion.Notably, for 2017, five new charters were added, 230 institutions merged and eight banks failed.Our ViewpointThe decline in the number of problem institutions looks encouraging with the quarter witnessing top-line growth on higher NIM. Banks have been gradually easing lending standards and trending toward higher fees to counter pressure on the top line. In addition, more interest rate hikes will help ease the pressure on interest income. Also, continued expense control and stable balance sheets are likely to act as tailwinds in the upcoming quarters.What encourages us is that a lot depends on to what extent Trump lives up to his promises. Bank stocks are likely to face the brunt if the promised policy goals are not achieved.The Fed’s actions on expediting rate hike — which is again a function of economic growth based on Trump’s policy alterations — will also play a key role in keeping the optimism on bank stocks alive.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Also, it was 40.9% above the prior-year quarter.Higher net interest income (reflecting rise in interest rates) and fee income (indicating higher trading services income) supported top-line growth. Also, improvement in assets under custody and administration and assets under management (AUM) acted as a tailwind.

555,USB,"Stock market correction seems to be in the offing as over the last five trading days extreme volatility was witnessed. The banking stocks are not untouched by this.It all started last Friday when January job and wage data was released. Needless to say, wages grew at the fastest pace last month in more than eight-and-a-half years. Though this indicates an improving economy, it raised fears of rise in inflation, in turn, reinforcing assumptions of a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.Additionally, a two-year budget deal announced by top senators will likely further strengthen the economy, thus giving the Fed all the more reason to raise rates. This also drove up the bond yields.While indications of an improving economy and expectations for a more hawkish Fed stance are beneficial for banks on the whole, overall markets seem to be wary of such a scenario.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) dominated the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Its business mishandlings continue to hurt.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jan 29, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. Issues related to past misconducts continue to haunt Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve punished the lender with new sanctions for the recently-revealed malpractices and fake accounts scandal which came into the limelight in September 2016. The bank has been ordered to replace four board directors and not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017).

556,USB,"For investors seeking momentum, iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (IAT  -  Free Report) is probably on radar now. The fund just hit a 52-week high, and is up about 27% from its 52-week low price of $41.83/share.But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:IAT in Focus    This ETF offers exposure to small and mid-size U.S. regional banks with heavy concentration on the top two firms U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial Services (PNC  -  Free Report) at 14.2% and 12.4%, respectively, while other firms hold no more than 7.12% share. While regional banks make up for a substantial portion, diversified banks make up for about 14.2% share in the basket. The fund charges investors 44 basis points a year in fees (see: all the Financial ETFs here).Why the Move?The banking corner of the financial space has been an area to watch lately especially after the speculation of faster-than-expected rates hike. The upbeat jobs report initially sparked inflation fears and the prospect of speedy rates hike. Then, the Fed minutes signaled a hawkish stance and now the new Fed chairperson Jerome Powell has hinted at more rate hikes than the three penciled in for this year in its first testimony to Congress. Rising rates have been great for the banking sector, as it will bolster their profit margins.More Gains Ahead? Currently, IAT has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook. Therefore, it is hard to get a handle on its future returns one way or the other. However, many of the segments that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank, so there is definitely still some promise for those who want to ride on this surging ETF a little longer.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

557,USB,"BancorpSouth (BXS  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings of 54 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents. Also, the bottom line compared favorably with the year-ago quarter earnings of 41 cents. Results benefitted from an improvement in net interest revenues and non-interest revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Loans and deposit balances remained strong during the quarter. Further, the company recorded net recoveries in the quarter, which was a tailwind. However, worsening of capital position remained a key headwind.The company’s net income for the quarter amounted to $53.5 million compared with $38.1 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Rise in Revenues Partially Offset by Higher Expenses, Loans and Deposits IncreaseQuarterly net revenues increased nearly 17% year over year to $217 million. Also, the reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $210.7 million.Net interest revenues came in at $138.1 million, up 20.5% year over year. Fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin (NIM) was 3.67%, increasing 21 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest revenues increased 11.4% year over year to $78.9 million. The rise was primarily due to growth in mortgage origination volumes and positive MSR valuation adjustment.Non-interest expenses were $147.7 million, increasing 16.2% on a year-over-year basis. The rise is due to impact of merger expenses and a single forgery and theft loss witnessed in the quarter.As of Mar 31, 2018, total deposits were $13.9 billion, up 16.6% sequentially while loans and leases, net of unearned income increased 11.2% to $12.3 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNon-performing loans and leases were 0.66% of net loans and leases as of Mar 31, 2018, down from 0.76% as of Mar 31, 2017.

Also, the company recorded $1 million of provisions in the quarter, stable year over year.Further, non-performing assets were nearly $90.7 million, up from $90 million registered in the prior-year quarter. Annualized net recoveries, as a percent of average loans and leases, were 0.01% compared with 0.02% a year ago.Capital Ratios DeteriorateAs of Mar 31, 2018, Tier I capital and tier I leverage capital was 11.30% and 9.39%, down from 12.16% and 9.95%, respectively, at the end of the prior-year quarter.The ratio of its total shareholders' equity to total assets was 11.99% at the end of the quarter, up from 11.45% as of Mar 31, 2017. However, the ratio of tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets contracted 80 bps to 8.69%.Share RepurchasesDuring the quarter, the company repurchased about 2.1 million common shares at a weighted average price of $32.32 per share. As of Mar 31, 2018, it had 3.9 million remaining shares available for repurchase under current share repurchase program through Dec 31, 2019.  Other DevelopmentsFollowing the earnings release, BancorpSouth announced plans to acquire Icon Capital Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, Icon Bank of Texas, National Association. The acquisition would expand BancorpSouth’s presence in Houston. Also, the acquisition will add total assets worth $794 million, loans of $624 million and total deposits of $692 million to BancorpSouth’s balance sheet.Per the terms, the acquirer will issue about 4.1 million shares of its common stock along with $17.5 million in cash, for all outstanding shares of Icon Capital Corporation capital stock, subject to certain conditions and potential adjustments.Our ViewpointBancorpSouth reported a decent quarter. Improved NIM along with loan growth is likely to support its top line in the quarters ahead. Also, the company’s efforts to grow through acquisitions are encouraging.However, persistent decline in mortgage banking revenues continues to be a major concern. Also, deterioration in capital position remains another drag. Further, mounting expenses might hurt bottom-line growth.BancorpSouth Bank Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise BancorpSouth Bank Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BancorpSouth Bank QuoteBancorpSouth carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of other BanksU.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.

560,USB,"U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) long-term ratings are under review for downgrade by Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation. In March 2017, the rating agency had rated U.S. Bancorp’s senior unsecured and subordinated debt as A1.Moody’s initiated the review on account of the $613 million settlement that U.S. Bancorp had agreed upon with several U.S. regulatory bodies last week due to shortcomings in its anti-money laundering and willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. (Read more: U.S. Bancorp to Pay Penalty of $613M for Money Laundering)Ratings for U.S. Bancorp’s subsidiaries along with its bank subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association, have been placed for review. U.S. Bank’s long-term deposits rating of Aa1, issuer and senior unsecured debt rating of A1, baseline credit assessment (BCA) of aa3 and counterparty risk assessment of Aa2(cr) are also under review. However, short-term ratings of Prime-1 for short-term deposits and senior debts were affirmed and are not under review.Following the legal settlement, Moody’s felt the necessity to review whether the company’s risk management system continues to be better in comparison to its competitors. Though, the settlement amount was beyond Moody’s expectations, it anticipates U.S. Bancorp’s earnings and capital position remains well poised to bear the impact.The rating agency will be considering whether U.S. Bank’s BCA rating of aa3 is still justified. Also, the changes in board processes along with oversight and the ability to guide management in identifying and mitigating potential future risk will be reviewed.U.S. Bancorp’s enterprise-wide risk governance, asset quality and operational risks will also be in focus of the review process. Notably, the company remains exposed to the risk of coming into light some other breach of law, which would lead to a violation of the two-year deferred prosecution agreement that the company had agreed upon with the regulators.What Can Drive the Ratings UpRatings of the company might witness an upgradation if Moody's is of the opinion that its enterprise risk governance and management stand superior to its peers and that it is likely to maintain above-average and consistent financial metrics.What Can Bring the Ratings DownOn the flip side, long-term ratings can be downgraded if Moody’s finds that the company’s enterprise-wide risk governance and management are not strong enough to place it above its peers. A sustained weakening in asset quality, capital or profitability metrics could also act as a negative factor.Shares of U.S. Bancorp have gained 4.7% over the past six months, underperforming the 19.7% growth for the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank & Key PicksThe stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

561,USB,"Bond yields are scaling record highs on expectations of a hike in interest rate. A two-year budget deal declared by top senators should strengthen the economy giving the Federal Reserve enough reason to raise rates. A pick-up in wages sparked fears of inflation, bolstering expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates.Lest we forget, a soft Treasury auction on Feb 7 dragged bond prices down and helped yields move up. This rise in bond yields rattled the equity market, resulting in a lot of gyrations. And why not? When bond yield rises, it increases the opportunity cost of investing in other asset classes such as equities, thus, making them less attractive.Given such uncertain times, investors should select the safest of stocks, particularly those that are sound enough to withstand the intensifying volatility in the market.US Stocks Finish Lower, Bond Yields SpikeThe stock market is on a roller-coaster this week. Major bourses largely finished in the red on Feb 7 and at current levels, they stand nearly 5% below last month’s record high. The Dow shed 19.42 points to 24,893.35, while the broader S&P 500 slid 13.48 points to 2,681.66. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, in the meantime, remained at 27.73. Any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market. This is in sharp contrast to the fear gauge’s reading in 2017. Last year, VIX fell as low as 9.14.While stocks struggled for direction, marked by the comeback of once-dormant volatility, treasury yields continued to scale record highs. The 10-year Treasury note yield was up 7.8 basis points to 2.843% following a decline of 2.648% earlier in the week. The two-year Treasury notes rose 4.3 basis points to 2.134%, registering its largest one-day gain since Oct 16. Similarly, the 30-year rate jumped 7.5 basis points to 3.118%, its highest level since March.  What’s Driving Treasurys?Treasury yields moved north after Congressional leaders struck a two-year bipartisan budget deal, boosting expectations of a stronger economy. This in turn bolstered possibility of an imminent rate hike eventually leading to higher bond yields. In fact, record rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Fed will hike rates more times than anticipated.Bipartisan Budget DealU.S. Senate leaders reached a deal to raise federal spending by almost $300 billion to address all kinds of fiscal issues that have been plaguing Washington for years. They have agreed to lift caps on defense funding and some domestic government outlays. Defense budget will be raised by $160 billion, while funding for domestic programs will be hiked by $128 billion.Congress has time and again voted to raise the budget caps. Earlier, there have been two bipartisan deals to uplift caps by billions of dollars. The first was in 2013, forged between PaulRyan and Patty Murray, while the second was signed in 2015. However, both the deals that have extended through fiscal 2017 have expired.Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009The labor market has come a long way since the Great Recession, with wages growing at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009.Needless to say, several states have raised wages. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute.Why Spike in Bond Yield Halted a Market Rally?Major selling point for equities since the financial crisis has been rise in bond yields. Investors always compare yield of equities with that of fixed income. In case of equities, earnings are largely considered the yield of a share of stock. Thus, the current rise in bond yields have made these more alluring, compelling investors to pull money out of stocks.Moreover, value of future earnings goes down as interest rates go up. Higher interest rate affects almost everything from mortgages to auto loans. Purchasing a house becomes expensive and credit card bite becomes harder. All these in turn could lead to recession, ending the nine-year-old bull market.Best Screening Parameters Amid Widespread UncertaintyAs the equity market frets over rising yields, make sure you pick safe investments. In general, you should look for companies that are unperturbed by wavering market conditions. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.These stocks also have a good position in the market and pay out part of its earnings to shareholders as dividends. After all, dividend payers boast solid financial structure and are immune to market vagaries. Further, they are positioned to grow in the near term and are economically priced.5 Top Safe Stocks to BuyWe have, thus, selected five stocks flaunting the aforesaid virtues along with a solid Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

562,USB,"Riding on strong fixed income trading revenues, Goldman Sachs’ (GS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results recorded a positive earnings surprise of 22.6%. The company reported earnings per share of $6.95, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.67. Further, the bottom line witnessed 35% year-over-year improvement.The investment bank turned triumphant with strong trading activities on high volatility during the first quarter, and a continued momentum in investment banking business, supporting the bottom-line numbers. In addition, investing & lending activities were strong. However, elevated expenses were an undermining factor.Notably, the quarter witnessed improved market-making environment and increased client activity levels.Net earnings applicable to common shareholders came in at $2.7 billion, up 27% year over year.Revenues Improve, Expenses EscalateGoldman’s net revenues were up 25% year over year to $10 billion in the quarter under review. Moreover, the revenue figure handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.9 billion.Quarterly revenues, as per business segments, are as follows:The Institutional Client Services division recorded revenues of $4.4 billion, up 31% year over year. The rise indicates elevated net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution revenues (up 23% year over year), driven by higher revenues from commodities, currencies and credit products, partly mitigated by lower revenues from interest rate and mortgage products.Increase in equities client execution, securities service revenues, along with high commissions and fees, resulted in the upsurge in Equities revenues (up 38%).The Investment Banking division generated revenues of $1.8 billion, up 5% year over year. Results highlight higher underwriting revenues (up 27%), aided by elevated debt and equity underwriting revenues. However, lower financial advisory revenues (down 22%) due to decreased industry-wide completed mergers and acquisition transactions were recorded.The Investment Management division recorded revenues of $1.8 billion, up 18% year over year. The uptick was mainly driven by higher management and other fees, along with elevated transaction and incentive fees.The Investing and Lending division’s revenues of $2.1 billion in the quarter came in 43% higher on a year-over-year basis. The upside stemmed from the surge in revenues from investments in equities and debt securities.Total operating expenses flared up 21% year over year to $6.6 billion. Expenses moved up mainly due to rise in compensation and employee-benefit expenses (up 25%), and non-compensation expenses (up 14%).Notably, lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were recorded.Strong Capital PositionGoldman displayed a robust capital position in the reported quarter. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.1% under the Basel III Advanced Approach, highlighting the valid transitional provisions. The figure was up from 10.7% recorded in the prior quarter.The company’s supplementary leverage ratio, on a fully phased-in basis, was 5.7% at the end of the reported quarter, down from 5.8% reported in the previous quarter.Return on average common shareholders’ equity, on an annualized basis, was 15.4% as of Mar 31, 2018.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring first-quarter 2018, the company repurchased 3 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $264.32 and a total cost of $800 million.Concurrent with the earnings release, Goldman’s board of directors hiked the quarterly common stock dividend to 80 cents per share, up 6.7% from the prior payout. The new dividend will be paid on Jun 28 to common shareholders of record as on May 31, 2018.ConclusionResults of Goldman highlight an impressive quarter. Remarkable improvement in trading revenues, robust investment banking results and underwriting business drove revenue. The company’s well-diversified business, apart from its solid investment banking operations, continues to ensure earnings stability.Its focus to capitalize on new growth opportunities through several strategic investments, including the digital consumer lending platform, will likely bolster overall business growth. However, costs stemming from brokerage and market development remain near- to medium-term headwinds. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. QuoteCurrently, Goldman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other BanksDriven by top-line strength, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3% in first-quarter 2018. Earnings per share of $1.68 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.35 per share.Overall high revenues were reflected, driven by elevated banking, equity markets and consumer banking revenues, along with loan growth. However, fixed income markets revenue disappointed. Moreover, expenses escalated on ongoing investments.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) recorded positive earnings surprise of 4.7% in first-quarter 2018. Earnings of $1.12 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. Additionally, results improved from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.03.Notably, results are preliminary which might be impacted on resolution of matters with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) related to the bank’s compliance risk-management program with a charge of $1 billion in civil money penalties.Lower provisions and higher interest income aided results. However, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income with lower mortgage revenues were the undermining factors. Moreover, expenses soared. Furthermore, reduction in loans and deposits acted as headwinds for the quarter.Among other Wall Street giants, U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 18.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

563,USB,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks has been bullish. The 10-year Treasury bond yields escalated at four-year highs on higher-than-expected inflation. Positive economic growth, along with central banks’ moves globally to improve interest rates from ultra-low levels, boosted yields which supported bank stocks, encouraging investors to focus more on bank stocks.Additionally, investors’ confidence received a boost from President Trump’s much-awaited $200-billion infrastructure plan that rolled out earlier this week.Mortgage rates were also on an upswing, hitting a nearly four-year high of 4.38%, as money was pulled out of the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Increase in mortgage rates will limit reduce refinancing activity.Further, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations, and resolution of litigations and probes related to legacy matters and business misconducts persisted in the last five trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Feb 9, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

The bank limited the number of suspicious activities that could be identified by its monitoring systems due to limited number of employees present to track them.4.

564,USB,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) has agreed to pay about $613 million in penalty to the U.S. regulators for deliberate violations of the Bank Secrecy Act by its subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association.Willful ViolationsThe bank has been slapped with charges of failing to put together proper anti-money laundering (AML) control programs along with intentionally not reporting suspicious activities to the authorities.For a period of nearly six years (ended 2014), U.S. Bancorp was found of using weak AML measures. The bank lowered the number of suspicious activities that could be identified by its monitoring systems due to limited number of employees present to track them.Also, the bank had hidden this fact from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Despite knowledge of these improper practices and repeated warnings from the reviewers of staff levels to be “stretched dangerously thin”, U.S. Bancorp chose to conceal facts from the minutes of internal meetings.Further, the regulators also noted the bank’s failure to properly track Western Union transactions made by non-customers at its branches. Suspicious transactions were allowed to go uninvestigated despite employees raising concerns.Second allegation on the bank was keeping the wrongdoings of Scott Tucker, a former professional race car driver, from the authorities until it received a subpoena from the U.S. attorney in Manhattan in 2013.The bank allowed Tucker to use accounts under tribal names to conduct fraudulent payday lending scheme. Since 2008, these sham companies had lent millions of loans to the customers and generated profits that he spent to fulfil his lavish needs.In 2011, investigators reported about these misdoings to which the bank responded by closing Tucker’s accounts in the names of the tribal companies but refrained from filing a suspicious report. Moreover, they allowed him to operate through non-tribal accounts letting millions from illegal payday business schemes to flow in.Penalties ImposedU.S. Bancorp has signed a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York and has agreed to pay a fine of $453 million.The bank is also liable to pay $75 million to the OCC, $70 million to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Federal Reserve will be paid $15 million.Apart from penalty, the bank will continue to undertake proper modifications of its AML program, only after which charges will be dismissed by the government.Our TakeThough this settlement might impact U.S. Bancorp’s financials to an extent, it still remains well poised for growth on the back of its solid business model and diverse revenue streams.Also, such incidents help instill investors’ confidence in regulating bodies and keep banks from engaging in illegal activities.Shares of U.S. Bancorp have gained 6.5% over the past six months, underperforming 20.5% rally for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

565,USB,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 18, before the opening bell. The bank’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year.Benefits of higher rates, improved lending scenario and rebound in trading activities are anticipated to offset muted investment banking performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $5.5 billion reflects a rise of 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s fourth-quarter 2017 results reflected an increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Also, a strong capital position and increasing loans were the positives. However, higher expenses and lower mortgage banking revenues were the key headwinds.Notably, the company displays a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 1.2%. U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that U.S. Bancorp will likely beat on earnings in the first quarter. This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for a possible earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for U.S. Bancorp is +0.96%.Zacks Rank: U.S. Bancorp carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have remained stable over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 94 cents reflects growth of 14.6% year over year.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsRise in net interest income (NII): Improvement in loan demand, particularly in commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer areas, along with and rising interest rates during the to-be-reported quarter will likely support the company’s NII. Also, income from interest earning assets (average balance) are projected to rise 4.5% to $417.2 billion.Non-Interest Income Likely to Improve:  Strong equity issuances along with a potential rise in fees from increasing M&A’s are likely to have supported U.S. Bancorp’s fee income. Per the consensus estimate, trust and investment management fees are likely to improve 8.1% to $398 million on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter, which is likely to boost the bank’s credit and debit card revenues by 4.8% from year-ago quarter to $306 million.Nevertheless, with the slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates, no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment. The consensus estimate for mortgage banking revenues is $197 billion, down 4.8% year over year.Expenses Might Trend Higher: Increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings and seasonally higher compensation expenses might escalate costs moderately.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BOK Financial Corporation (BOKF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.78% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

566,USB,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), slated to announce first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, is expected to show improvement in net interest income (NII), driven by higher interest rates. Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans recorded solid growth year over year, even though the quarter witnessed a modest improvement in lending activities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average total loans of $87.2 billion for the first quarter indicates year-over-year growth of 1.3%. Driven by loan growth, earning assets are also likely to rise. The consensus estimate for average interest earning assets of $123.4 billion for the to-be-reported quarter indicates an increase of 3.1%.Thus, KeyCorp’s NII, one of the main revenue sources, is expected to support earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (tax equivalent basis) of $948 million for the to-be-reported quarter reflects 2% increase on a year-over-year basis.Let’s check out other factors that are expected to influence KeyCorp’s Q1 performance:Muted non-interest income growth: KeyCorp’s first-quarter non-interest income will benefit from rise in service charge on deposits as deposit balance is expected to improve in the quarter.However, given lower debt placement activities, investment banking fees are expected to fall. Also, as equity market performance was dismal during the quarter, trust and investment services income is expected to witness a decline.Further, due to lower mortgage originations, growth in mortgage banking fees will likely be muted during the quarter. Therefore, non-interest income growth is expected to be disappointing.Notably, management expects fee income to decline sequentially, given the seasonality in loan fees and corporate-owned life insurance as well as normalized levels of investment banking and debt placement fees.Fall in expenses to lend support: KeyCorp has been diversifying products, reorganizing operations and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. Thus, the company’s overall non-interest expenses (excluding merger-related charges) are expected to be manageable.Also, management will be realizing the majority of remaining $50 million cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal in the first quarter. In fact, KeyCorp anticipates operating expenses to decline sequentially.Asset quality to aid results: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing asset of $402 million indicates a plunge of 35.5% year over year. Likewise, the consensus estimate for non-performing loans of $339 million, reflects a decrease of 40.8% from the year-ago quarter.As KeyCorp is likely to witness a rise in loans, a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected. But overall, this is expected to be manageable.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of KeyCorp beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is -0.95%.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of the earnings beat.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is 38 cents, which reflects year-over-year improvement of 18.8%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.56 billion indicates 4.3% growth from the prior-year quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few major bank stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.96% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

567,USB,"Key bank earnings that are scheduled for release this week and next will likely to provide a better understanding of the sector’s near-term prospects. At present, the central short-term concern for banks will be one-time U.S. tax charges, which may affect their full-year profits. However, a lower U.S. corporate tax rate is expected to favor profitability in the long run.Encouraging economic environment, a low tax rate and high Fed rate hike prospects have clearly shifted attention to the bank stocks, which will kick-start the first-quarter earnings season. In this context, Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) which are scheduled to report on Apr 16 and Apr 18, respectively, assume greater significance. Both banks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major stocks reporting earnings from Apr 16 to Apr 20 include The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceBank of America has gained 37.2% in the last one year and outperformed the broader industry that has moved up 22.3% over the same period. In comparison, U.S. Bancorp has not only underperformed the broader industry but also Bank of America, gaining only 2.5% over the same time frame.ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the industry is clearly undervalued. This implies that the industry has upside potential for the near future. The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 1.77, which is below the S&P 500’s average of 3.75. Hence, it might be a good idea to focus on stocks belonging to this particular industry.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.91 U.S. Bancorp is undervalued than the S&P 500 but overvalued than the industry. However, Bank of America with a P/B ratio of 1.28 is less pricey compared to both the S&P 500 and the industry. Dividend YieldU.S. Bancorp’s dividend yield over the last year is 2.34%, higher than the broader industry’s figure of 2.04%. With a dividend yield of only 1.57%, Bank of America shareholders earn a comparatively lower dividend yield than both its smaller competitor and the broader industry.Return on Assets (ROA)Return on assets (ROA) is one of the key financial ratios for banks as they rely heavily on their assets to create revenues. A positive ROA indicates that the company has reported gains from its assets for the period in question. Coming to U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America, ROA for the trailing 12-months (TTM) is 1.32% and 0.83%, respectively. U.S. Bancorp has a higher ROA than not only Bank of America, but also the industry, which has ROA of 0.99%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Bank of America has delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 8.8%. On the other hand, U.S. Bancorp has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 1.2%.When considering Earnings ESP, U.S. Bancorp has an ESP of +0.56%, while Bank of America has an ESP of -0.37%. Then again, U.S. Bancorp’s earnings estimates for the current year have increased by 0.5% over the last 60 days, while the same metric for Bank of America has advanced by 0.8%. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Bank of America holds an edge over U.S. Bancorp, when considering valuations and price performance. Additionally, when we take a more comprehensive look at the companies’ previous earnings performance and estimate revisions, Bank of America is the better stock.However, when considering return on assets and dividend yield, U.S. Bancorp holds an edge over Bank of America. What clinches the case in favor of U.S. Bancorp at this point of time is that it has a better ESP than Bank of America. This is why it may be a good idea to bet on U.S. Bancorp over Bank of America as both prepare to report earnings over the next few days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

568,USB,"BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. The bottom line recorded 7.7% improvement from the year-ago quarter.Results reflected a rise in revenues driven by higher rates and loan growth. However, an increase in operating expenses and higher credit costs were the undermining factors.Results excluded merger-related and restructuring charges and adjustments related to the tax reform. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $614 million or 77 cents per share compared with $592 million or 74 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.For 2017, adjusted earnings of $3.14 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.77. Also, the figure was up 9.4% year over year. After considering non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders was $2.2 billion or $2.74 per share compared with $2.2 billion or $2.77 per share in 2016.Revenues Improve on Modest Loans & Deposits GrowthTotal revenues (taxable-equivalent) for the quarter came in at $2.91 billion, up 5% year over year. The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.84 billion.For 2017, total revenues (taxable equivalent basis) were up 4.8% from the prior year to $11.5 billion. The figure was marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.4 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income rose 4.7% from the prior-year quarter to $1.68 billion. Also, net interest margin expanded 11 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.43%.Non-interest income increased 5.4% year over year to $1.23 billion. Rise in all fee income components except insurance income and mortgage banking fees, drove the increase.Non-interest expenses of $1.86 billion increased 11.2% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a rise in personnel expenses, net merger-related and restructuring charges and professional service costs.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 57.2%, down from 58.3% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates rise in profitability.As of Dec 31, 2017, total deposits were nearly $157.4 billion, up marginally from the prior quarter. Also, total loans and leases of $144.8 billion were up slightly on a sequential basis.Credit Quality ImprovedAs of Dec 31, 2017, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $627 million, down 22.9% year over year. As a percentage of total assets, NPAs came in at 0.28%, down 9 bps year over year.Also, during the quarter, allowance for loan and lease losses came in at 1.04% of total loans and leases held for investment, on par with the prior-year quarter. Further, net charge-offs were 0.36% of average loans and leases, down 6 bps year over year.However, provision for credit losses was $138 million at the end of the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase on a year-over-year basis.Profitability Ratios Strong, Capital Ratios WeakenAt the end of the reported quarter, return on average assets was 1.19%, up from 1.16% in the prior-year quarter. Return on average common equity improved to 9.10% from 8.75% as of Dec 31, 2016.As of Dec 31, 2017, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.8%, down from 12.0% in the year-ago quarter. BB&T's estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III (on a fully phased-in basis) was approximately 10.0% as of Dec 31, 2017, down from 10.2% as of Dec 31, 2016.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, BB&T repurchased $373 million worth shares through open-market purchases.Our TakeBB&T remains well positioned for revenue growth through strategic acquisitions. These efforts will also support bottom-line growth in the near term. Also, expected growth in loans, along with an improving rate scenario, is likely to propel its organic growth trajectory in the quarters ahead. However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability to some extent.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteCurrently, BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The figure came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 82 cents.Easing margin pressure on rising rates was witnessed in the quarter.

Also, revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.U.S. Bancorp’s tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.1 billion in the quarter, up 6.4% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to loan growth and rising interest rates.Average earning assets climbed 2.8% year over year, supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities, along with elevated average other earning assets. Furthermore, net interest margin of 3.08% was up 10 basis points (bps) year over year, driven by higher interest rates and loan portfolio mix. Higher funding costs and elevated cash balances partially mitigated the rise in margins.U.S. Bancorp’s non-interest income increased slightly on a year-over-year basis to $2.4 billion. The rise was primarily due to higher payment services revenues, trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges, partially offset by lower mortgage banking and other revenues.Provision for credit losses decreased 2% year over year to $335 million in the reported quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s average total loans climbed 2.6% year over year to $279.8 billion.

These increases were partially offset by a drop in commercial real estate.Average total deposits were up 3% from the prior-year quarter to $339.2 billion. The rise was due to growth in interest-bearing deposits, partly offset by lower non-interest-bearing deposits.Non-interest expenses rose 31.1% year over year to $3.9 billion.

On a year-over-year basis, the company experienced deterioration, mainly in net charge-offs in the commercial real estate and credit card segment.Also, total allowance for credit losses was $4.4 billion, up1.4% on a year-over-year basis.However, non-performing assets came in at $1.2 billion, down 25.1% year over year.Strong Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review, U.S. Bancorp maintained a solid capital position.

Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9.1% as of Dec 31, 2017, in line with the year-ago quarter.All regulatory ratios of U.S. Bancorp continued to be in excess of well-capitalized requirements.

571,USB,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for KeyCorp. Rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank. Though flatter yield curve offsets the benefits to some extent, pressure on KeyCorp’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017. Further, the quarter witnessed growth in its consumer loan portfolio as a result of a rise in consumer confidence.Moreover, President Trump’s success with the tax overhaul boosted the stock market during the quarter and is likely to support KeyCorp’s fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.58 billion indicates a 1.9% year-over-year improvement for the to-be-reported quarter.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Lower credit cost, an increase in fee income, and improving loans and deposits were among the positives. However, higher operating expenses were on the downside.Activities of KeyCorp during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 36 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 16.1%.Notably, KeyCorp’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 17.8% in the past three months, outperforming the 13.8% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of KeyCorp beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are dim. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is -0.33%.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: In addition to higher interest rates, moderate improvement in lending, mostly on the consumer front, is likely to perk up interest income. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest income is projected to be $966 million, up 1.9% year over year. For 2017, management expects net interest income in the range of $3.8-$3.9 billion.Modest non-interest income growth: KeyCorp’s fourth-quarter non-interest income will benefit from increasing investment banking income, primarily driven by slightly higher debt placement fees. Also, as the equity markets performed fairly well during the quarter, trust and investment services income is expected to witness a rise.Nevertheless, due to lower mortgage originations, growth in mortgage banking fees is likely to be rather muted during the quarter. Therefore, non-interest income is projected to record a marginal improvement.Decline in expenses should support profitability: KeyCorp has been constantly diversifying products, reorganizing operations and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. As a result of this, we expect the company’s overall non-interest expenses (excluding merger-related charges) to be manageable. Also, management expects cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal to support the bottom line marginally.Asset quality to worsen: As KeyCorp is projected to witness a rise in loans, a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing asset of $570 million and non-performing loans of $530 million, reflect a rise of 2.5% each from the last quarter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

572,USB,"Investors usually attach a greater degree of importance to investment banks compared to their plain vanilla counterparts. Yet, as earnings season heats up, it would not be out of place to point out that their troubles seem to mimic those of the wider banking sector.Goldman Sachs’ fourth-quarter 2017 results are likely to reflect a $5 billion negative impact triggered by the new tax reform, which levied taxes on overseas income. Also, deferred tax assets (DTAs) will lose value due to tax cut. (Read: Goldman Expects Tax Reform to Have a One-Time $5B Impact) Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said on Jan 5 that its upcoming earnings numbers are likely to reflect a $1.25 billion negative impact, also due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On the positive side, both stocks hold promise in 2018. A bullish global economy, higher inflation and rising market volatility are likely to provide a major boost to these stocks in the year ahead.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report fourth quarter earnings numbers on Jan 17 and Jan 18, respectively. While Goldman Sachs has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Morgan Stanley has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other banking stocks reporting earnings over these two days include Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report).Return on Assets (ROA)Examining earnings per share alone would not generate any significant insights when determining the level of profitability of a bank. Return on Assets is a ratio which reveals how efficiently a bank is utilizing its assets to generate profits.Currently, Morgan Stanley holds total assets of $99.7 billion while Goldman Sachs has total assets of around $97 billion. Our research shows that the average one year trailing 12-month ROA for Goldman Sachs stands at 0.95%, marginally higher than 0.85% for Morgan Stanley.Price PerformanceIn terms of price performance, Morgan Stanley is a clear winner. Morgan Stanley has gained 30.8% over the last one year, outperforming the broader industry which has gained 25.4% over the same period. In comparison, Goldman Sachs has gained only 9% over the same period and is well behind both Morgan Stanley and the broader industry.ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the broader industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has the potential to gain in the near future. The industry has an average one year trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 2.75, which is below the S&P 500 average of 3.93. Hence, it might be a good idea not to stay away from stocks belonging to this industry.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.29 Goldman Sachs is undervalued compared to the S&P 500 and the industry. However, though Morgan Stanley is also undervalued compared to the industry and the S&P 500, with a P/B ratio of 1.39, it is marginally pricier than Goldman Sachs.   Dividend YieldMorgan Stanley’s dividend yield over the last one year period is 1.81%. With a dividend yield of 1.24%, Goldman Sachs’ shareholders earn a lower dividend yield than those of Morgan Stanley.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Goldman Sachs has delivered earnings surprises in three of the four preceding quarters. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley has delivered earnings surprises in all of the four preceding quarters. While Goldman Sachs has an average earnings surprise of 9.1%, Morgan Stanley stands out with an average earnings surprise of 16.3%.When considering Earnings ESP values, there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks since both their ESP values stand at zero. At the same time, Morgan Stanley’s earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 5.2% over the last 30 days, higher than Goldman Sachs’ level of 2.8%.  ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that both stocks are nearly neck to neck when considering valuation and return on assets. Also, both stocks have an ESP reading of zero, so there is little to choose between the two on this count.However, Morgan Stanley is superior when considering price performance, dividend yield, estimate revisions and a more detailed earnings history. With a Zacks Rank #2 and a higher projected EPS growth for the year at 18.2% compared to Goldman Sachs’ value of 11.2%, Morgan Stanley is clearly the better of the two investment bank stocks.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

573,USB,"The earnings season seems to have gotten off to a decent start with the banking giants reporting improved earnings and revenues so far.The banks that have released results till now reported higher revenues supported by improved loan balances and hike in interest rates. However, lower mortgage and trading revenues impacted fee income to some extent.The last three months of 2017 saw significant changes, stretching from passage of tax reform to Federal Reserve’s goal to continue raising rates steadily. The potential rise in equity issuances and persistent increase in debt underwriting has led to strengthening of investment banking. Also, the broader trends might lend banks some respite from the prevailing low volatility in the market. However, poor commercial and industrial loan growth during the quarter remains a concern.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in fourth-quarter 2017 are projected to decline 2.6% year over year.Earnings releases are coming in thick with Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) reporting on Jan 16, while U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report on Jan 17, before the opening bell.Let’s have a look at what can be expected from these three Major Regional Banks when they report fourth quarter and 2017 earnings.Citigroup’s earnings are expected to be $1.18, reflecting 4.4% improvement from the last-year quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $17.1 billion, slightly higher than the prior-year quarter. Rise in loans along with a favorable interest rate environment is likely to benefit the bank’s net interest income (NII). Fee income is expected to benefit from strong momentum in investment banking business, partially offset by lower volume of M&A and poor mortgage activities during the quarter.Nevertheless, the tax reform is expected to hurt its results for the quarter. The company expects a one-time charge of $16-$17 billion related to the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs) and charge related to cash repatriation to be around $3-$4 billion.

Also, the consensus estimate for average earning assets of $66.4 billion reflects marginal growth from the previous quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee income is $2.4 billion, slightly up sequentially.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. Bancorp’s current-quarter earnings of 87 cents reflects a 6.1% rise year over year.However, the bank’s goal of advancing technologically is likely to keep costs high.

574,USB,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the market opens. Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans recorded solid growth on a sequential basis, though the quarter witnessed an overall modest improvement in lending activities.In fact, BB&T expects total average loans, on an annualized basis, to grow 1-3% sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter. Driven by loan growth, earning assets are likely to rise too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $1.96 trillion for the first quarter indicates an increase of 1.5% sequentially.Nonetheless, despite a higher rate environment, management expects GAAP net interest margin (NIM) to be down 1-3 basis points (bps) on a sequential basis. Notably, core NIM is expected to be stable, attributable to the adjustment on tax exempt assets from the new corporate tax rate change.Thus, BB&T’s net interest income (NII), one of the primary sources of revenues, is not likely to aid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.62 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects 1.6% decline on a sequential basis.Now, let’s check out other factors that are likely to influence BB&T’s Q1 performance:Dismal fee income performance: Refinancing boom is nearing its end and higher interest rates are leading to a decline in mortgage originations. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income of $94 million reflects a fall of 9.6% sequentially.Also, despite rising deposit balances, the company is not expected to register an increase in service charge on deposits. Notably, the consensus estimate for service charge on deposits is $173 million, down 5.5% from the prior quarter.However, BB&T is expected to register higher insurance income in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus estimate for insurance fees of $462 million reflects 10.5% increase from the prior quarter.Overall, total non-interest income is projected to witness a 2.4% fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.20 billion.Stable expenses: Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BB&T expects expenses in the first quarter to remain flat on a year-over-year basis.Asset quality is not of much support: BB&T expects loan loss provision to match net charge-offs (NCOs) in addition to providing for loan growth. Further, management expects NCOs rates to increase sequentially and be in the range of 35-45 bps on the assumption of no deterioration in the economy.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing assets of $634 million for the to-be-reported quarter shows 1.1% increase on a sequential basis.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of BB&T beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BB&T is +1.63%.Zacks Rank: BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #3.BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is 92 cents, which reflects year-over-year improvement of 24.3%.

576,USB,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) reported net operating earnings of $2.26 per share in first-quarter 2018. The bottom line improved 5.1% year over year.In addition, top-line growth was recorded. Moreover, improved credit quality was a positive factor. Further, pressure on margin eased. However, decrease in loan and deposit balances was a headwind. Also, results were affected by higher expenses.Net operating income came in at $357 million, up around 1% year over year.On a GAAP basis, M&T Bank’s earnings per share of $2.23 jumped 5% year over year. Net income inched up 1% year over year to $353 million. Notably, litigation reserve has been increased by $135 million. On an after-tax basis, reserve reduced net income by $102 million, or 68 cents per share.NII & Fee Income Growth Boost Revenues, Expenses Flare UpM&T Bank’s revenues came in at $1.44 billion comparing favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.37 billion.Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 6% year over year to $980 million in the quarter, driven by increased net interest margin, partly offset by lower average earning assets. Furthermore, net interest margin expanded 37 basis points year over year to 3.71%.Supported by strong growth in trust income and distribution from Bayview Lending Group LLC, the company’s other income climbed 3% year over year to $459 million. These increases were partially offset by unrealized losses on investments in equity securities.Non-interest expenses were $933 million, up 18% from the prior-year quarter. Excluding certain non-operating items, non-interest operating expenses came in at $927 million, escalating 19% from the year-ago quarter. The rise reflected increased litigation reserve, elevated salaries, and employee-benefit costs and other expenses.Efficiency ratio came in at 64% this quarter, up from 56.9% in the prior-year quarter. Rise in ratio indicates fall in profitability.Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, edged down 1.8% year over year to $87.7 billion at the end of the reported quarter. Additionally, total deposits declined 6.3% year over year to $90.9 billion.M&T Bank's net operating income highlighted an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholder equity of 1.28% and 13.51%, respectively, compared with 1.21% and 13.05% recorded in the prior-year quarter.Credit Quality ImprovedM&T Bank reflected an improved credit quality picture in the reported quarter. Provision for credit losses shrunk 22% year over year to $43 million. Net charge-offs of loans came in at $41 million, down 5% year over year.Further, the ratio of non-accrual loans to total net loans was 0.99%, down from 1.04% in the comparable period last year.

We believe the company, with its sturdy business model and strategic acquisitions, is well poised for growth. The Hudson City acquisition has, in all probability, provided an upside to M&T Bank’s top line by leveraging on the retail network of the former, as well as product and balance-sheet diversification.However, regulatory issues and escalating costs remain headwinds for the bank. M&T Bank Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteCurrently, M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Earnings of $1.12 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07.

However, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income, with lower mortgage revenues, were the undermining factors. Moreover, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans and deposits acted as headwinds for the quarter.Driven by top-line strength, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3% in the first quarter. Earnings per share of $1.68 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago tally of $1.35 per share.Overall top-line strength was reflected, driven by higher banking, equity markets and consumer banking revenues, along with loan growth. However, expenses escalated on ongoing investments.Among other major banks, U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Apr 18.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

577,USB,"Welcome to a Super Bowl LII edition of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into the business behind the big game, looking specifically at which companies took advantage of the Super Bowl’s massive television reach.Last night, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 in an epic game that wasn’t decided until the final whistle. But while the teams battled it out on the field, some of the biggest companies in the world spent millions of dollars on advertisements designed to become the talk of offices, bars, and living rooms around the country over the next few weeks.NBC’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) coverage of Super Bowl 52 was officially brought to us by Pizza Hut YUM, Kraft KHC, U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report), Sprint (S  -  Free Report), Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) new Solo: A Star Wars Story movie, and a few others.On top of ads from these companies, Toyota (TM  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) showed off multiple campaigns and sponsored halftime, where Justin Timberlake helped Nike NKE subtly sell exclusive new Jordan Brand sneakers.Some of the biggest Super Bowl ad spenders over the last 20 years, such as Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), all poured money into ads once again.Familiar names also presented some unfamiliar messages.

578,USB,"Markets started the New Year on a strong note, posting fresh records on multiple occasions. Newly instituted tax cuts had a beneficial impact on stocks with the Dow breaching the 25,000 and 26,000 mark in the same month. Economic data remained strong even as fourth-quarter earnings promised to be the most bullish in recent times. Meanwhile, the Fed refrained from raising rates but indicated that a hike was more or less certain in March.January’s PerformanceFor the month of January, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased 5.8%, 5.6% and 7.4%, respectively. The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which permanently slashed corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, last December contributed to January’s gains. Additionally, in its Beige Book, the Fed provided an encouraging outlook about the U.S. economy, which in turn also boosted investor sentiment.Moreover, during the month, the Senate gave its consent to pass a short-term spending bill that ends the recent government shutdown. Additionally, an upbeat fourth-quarter earnings season, which includes a very strong revenue momentum, an above-average proportion of positive surprises and an unusually positive revisions trend for the current and coming quarters, also contributed to strong market performance.Benchmarks Breach Multiple RecordsKey indexes achieved multiple milestones over last month. On Jan 2, the Nasdaq closed above the 7,000 mark for the first time. On the very next trading day, the S&P 500 moved past 2,700 for the first time. Optimism over strong market performance in 2018 contributed to these gains.On Jan 4, the Dow touched the psychological level of 25,000 for the first time. This was the blue-chip index’s fastest 1,000-point rise since its inception in May 1896. On Jan 9, the S&P 500 gained 3.6 points to close at a record for the sixth straight session. This marks its best start to a year since 1987.On Jan 17, the Dow finished above 26,000 for the first time. Additionally, both the Dow and S&P 500 posted their best 11-trading day start for the first time in a year since 1987, following which bond yields and the U.S. dollar increased. Benchmarks hit record levels again on Jan 22, after the Senate gave its consent to the bill.Finally, on Jan 26, all three U.S. benchmarks closed at record levels following better-than-expected earnings. The S&P 500 finished at a record level for 14 trading days, its best such feat in a month since June 1955. The index also posted its best one-day rise since Mar 1, 2017. Additionally, the Dow posted a rise of more than 220 points, while the Nasdaq registered its biggest one-day gain since Jan 2.Bullish Domestic DataEconomic data released during November was largely encouraging in nature. The ISM manufacturing index rose to 59.7% in December and reached its highest settlement in the last two years. Construction increased 0.8% from downwardly revised October figure to its highest level on record. Factory orders surged 1.3% during the month of November.

U.S. trade deficit increased 3.2% in November to settle at $50.5 billion. This is the highest level of deficit since January 2012. Meanwhile, PPI for the month December 2017 decreased 0.1%. This was the index’s first decline in 10 months. However, Core PPI shot up 0.2%.Housing Sector SoftensA certain degree of softness afflicted the housing sector in January. The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped slightly in the first month of 2018 after reaching an 18-year high in December 2017, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ (NAHB) Housing Market Index. The January 2018 reading was down two points to 72 from the December level of 74.Also, housing starts declined by 8.2% in December, the largest percentage drop recorded since November 2016. However, industry watchers believe that the downturn experienced in December is likely to be temporary. Further, housing possibly felt the chill from December’s brutally low temperatures.

In fact, this marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.The economy was boosted by solid consumer spending, which increased at 3.8% over the quarter after a 2.2% gain in the third quarter. Consumer outlays registered its fastest pace of growth in the fourth quarter in almost two years. Companies also ramped up spending in the fourth quarter by 6.8%.

The average workweek for the last month came in at 34.5 hours, remaining constant with the figure for the last month.Q4 Earnings Reflects All-Round StrengthA slew of earnings results from major banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(Read: A Very Strong Earnings Picture)Fed Leaves Rates Unchanged, Hike Likely in MarchOn Jan 31, the Federal Reserve opted to leave benchmark rates unchanged within the 1.25-1.5% range. Nevertheless, Fed policymakers reckon three rate hikes for this year, setting the stage for an imminent increase in March under Jerome Powell. The two-day policy meeting that concluded yesterday was the last overseen by Janet Yellen. Her post is set to be taken by Powell.In its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that economic activity has increased at a “solid rate” and will continue to grow at a “moderate pace.”Additionally, per the statement, labor market remains strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The FOMC also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.5 Star Performers for JanuaryI ran a screen on Research Wizard for companies with the following parameters:(Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today):Percentage price change over the last 4 weeks greater than or equal to 20%Forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current financial year (F1) less than or equal to 20.

Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation have weighed on bond prices, sending yields higher.However, effective signaling on the part of the Fed is likely to result in investors pricing in this decision well before the hike actually takes place. Ultimately, a strong fourth-quarter earnings season and steady economic growth are likely to propel markets toward new milestones in the weeks ahead. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

But after Minneapolis was awarded the big game, which is set to be held in the new $1.13 billion U.S. Bank Stadium, Minnesota Gov.

580,USB,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 17. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.The improving economic backdrop — reflecting lower commercial tax, rise in consumer spending and decent lending scenario — is likely to support Comerica’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $811.6 million for the first quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 9.5%.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.Comerica’s fourth-quarter 2017 results reflected an increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Also, strong capital position and improving credit quality were the positives. However, higher expenses and a fall in loan balance were the key headwinds.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8%.The positive earnings surprises along with fundamental strength helped Comerica’s shares gain 45.6% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 19.3% rally. Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteA Surprise in Store?Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Comerica is +0.95%.Zacks Rank: Comerica carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have remained stable over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.49 reflects growth of 34.2% year over year.Factors to Drive the ResultsNet Interest Income to Rise: Comerica’s net interest income is likely to improve in the to-be-reported quarter supported by expanding net interest margin and decent loan growth.Higher Fee Income: Trend of consumer spending was strong during the first quarter, which is likely to boost Comerica’s non-interest income. Also, investment banking and equity markets were decent due to higher volumes of M&As. Thus, the related fees are expected to increase marginally.Lower Mortgage Banking Revenues: The company is likely to continue witnessing lower revenues from this division owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates.Credit Quality Might Improve: The quarter continued to witness benign credit quality trends. Also, Moody’s Investors Service has projected a favorable credit environment for the banks in 2018. The consensus estimate shows 21.3% and 19.8% decline in non-performing assets and non-performing loans, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 18.

581,USB,"Driven by top-line strength, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3% in first-quarter 2018. Earnings per share of $1.68 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.35 per share.Net income came in at $4.6 billion, up 12.2% year over year.Overall high revenues were reflected, driven by elevated banking, equity markets and consumer banking revenues, along with loan growth. However, fixed income markets revenue disappointed. Moreover, expenses escalated on ongoing investments.Citigroup’s costs of credit for the first quarter were up 12% year over year to $1.9 billion. This rise largely reflects net credit losses of $1.9 billion and a net loan loss reserve release of $36 million.Top-Line Strength Partly Offset by Higher ExpensesRevenues were up 3% year over year to $18.9 billion in the reported quarter. The rise highlights elevated revenues in the global consumer banking and institutional clients group, partly offset by decline in corporate/other revenues. The revenue figure came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.At Institutional Clients Group (ICG), revenues came in at $9.8 billion in the quarter, up 6% year over year. Though fixed income revenues decreased 7%, higher equity markets (up 38%) and securities services revenues (up 16%) offset the fall on a year-over-year basis. Notably, revenues from total banking climbed 6%.Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues increased 7% year over year to $8.4 billion, mainly driven by higher revenues in North America, Latin America and Asia GCB.Corporate/Other revenues were $591 million, tanking 51% from the prior-year quarter. The decline mainly underlined legacy assets runoff.Operating expenses at Citigroup were up 2% year over year to $10.9 billion. Increased volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and the winding-down of legacy assets.Strong Balance SheetAt quarter end, Citigroup’s end of period assets was $1.92 trillion, up 6% year over year. The company’s loans grew 7% year over year to $673 billion. Deposits increased 5% year over year to $1 trillion.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-accrual assets decreased 20% year over year to $4.4 billion. The company reported a dip of 13% in consumer non-accrual loans to $2.6 billion. In addition, corporate non-accrual loans of $1.7 billion plunged 29% from the year-earlier period.Citigroup’s total allowance for loan losses was $12.4 billion at quarter end, or 1.85% of total loans, compared with $12 billion, or 1.93%, recorded in the year-ago period.Solid Capital PositionAt the end of the reported quarter, Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 12.1%, decreasing from 12.8% in the year-ago quarter. The company’s supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter came in at 6.7%, down from 7.3% in the year-earlier quarter.As of Mar 31, 2018, book value per share was $71.67, down 5% year over year and tangible book value per share was $61.02, down 7% from the prior-year period.Capital DeploymentDuring first-quarter 2018, Citigroup repurchased about 30 million of common stock. Notably, the company returned around $3.1 billion to common shareholders as common stock repurchases and dividends.Our ViewpointCitigroup reported impressive results this time around also, though the bank was impacted by higher expenses and lower fixed income markets revenue. The company exhibits capital strength which continues to support its dividend and a share buyback program. Also, overall rise in revenues is commendable.One can consider a strong brand like Citigroup to be a sound investment option over the long term, given its global footprint and attractive core business. Additionally, the company’s growth looks encouraging amid the rising rate environment, as well as anticipated potential ease of regulations under President Trump’s administration.Nevertheless, several legal hassles and escalating costs of credit remain concerns for the company. Citigroup Inc.

Earnings of $1.12 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. Moreover, results improved from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.03.Notably, results are preliminary which might be impacted on resolution of matters with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) related to the bank’s compliance risk-management program with a charge of $1 billion in civil money penalties.Lower provisions and higher interest income aided results. However, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income with lower mortgage revenues were the undermining factors. Moreover, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans and deposits acted as headwinds for the quarter.Among other major banks, Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Apr 16, while U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) will report on Apr 18.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

582,USB,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) recorded positive earnings surprise of 4.7% in first-quarter 2018. Earnings of $1.12 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. Moreover, results improved from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.03.Notably, results are preliminary which might be impacted on resolution of matters with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) related to the bank’s compliance risk-management program with a charge of $1 billion in civil money penalties.Lower provisions and higher interest income aided results. However, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income, with lower mortgage revenues, were the undermining factors. Moreover, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans and deposits acted as headwinds for the quarter.The quarter’s total revenues were $21.9 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.7 billion. However, the figure compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $22.3 billion.Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, quarterly revenue generation at the business segments was mixed. Community Banking segment’s total quarterly revenues increased slightly, while Wholesale Banking revenues were down around 3.9%, and revenues for the Wealth and Investment Management unit edged down moderately.Loans, Non-Interest & Interest Income Fall, Costs EscalateWells Fargo’s net interest income in the quarter came in at $12.2 billion, down 1% year over year. Increased interest income from debt securities, loans held for sale, loans, equity securities, along with higher other interest income, were mostly offset by higher interest expense. Further, net interest margin contracted 3 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.84%.Non-interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around $9.7 billion, down 2% year over year, primarily due to fall in almost all components of income, partly offset by net gains from equity securities and higher other income.As of Mar 31, 2018, total loans were $947.3 billion, down around 1.2% year over year. Reduction in consumer as well as commercial loan portfolio was recorded. Total deposits were $1.3 trillion, down 2.3% from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expense at Wells Fargo was $14.2 billion, up 3% from the year-earlier quarter. The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from a rise in salaries and commission, and incentive compensation, along with elevated other expenses. Nonetheless, Wells Fargo remains committed to achieve expense reduction of $4 billion by the end of 2019.The company’s efficiency ratio of 64.9% came in above the 62% recorded in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability.Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo’s credit quality metrics improved in the reported quarter. Allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $11.3 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, down 8.1% year over year.Provision for credit losses was $191 million, plummeting 68.4% year over year. Net charge-offs were $741 million or 0.32% of average loans in the first quarter, down 8% from the year-ago quarter’s net charge-offs of $805 million (0.34%). Non-performing assets were down 22.4% to $8.3 billion in the quarter under review from $10.7 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position. In the recently-reported quarter, the company returned $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.Wells Fargo’s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III (fully phased-in) increased to $153.1 billion from $148.5 billion recorded in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 12% under Basel III (fully phased-in) as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 11.2% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Book value per share advanced to $37.33 from $35.67 recorded in the comparable period last year.Our ViewpointTop-line headwinds, aided by lower net interest income and fee income, were perceived. Furthermore, flaring up expenses remained a major drag, along with slowdown in mortgage business. Nevertheless, improved credit quality reflecting lower provisions were positives.Despite several legal tensions, Wells Fargo remains focused on maintaining its financial position. Last year, the banking giant doubled its cost-cutting targets to combat escalating expenses. These efforts might help the company regain confidence of its clients and shareholders.We believe, over the long term, investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo, given its diverse geographic and business mix, which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth. We also anticipate strategic acquisitions and the bank’s efforts to address current adversities will help it expand its business and enhance profitability. Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company Quote Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The bank’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year.Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the consumer banking segment are anticipated to offset the slowdown in trading. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected to be $5.6 billion, up 3.9% year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that U.S. Bancorp will likely beat on earnings in the fourth quarter. This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for a possible earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for the stock is currently pegged at +0.13%.

Notably, U.S. Bancorp’s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6.1% from the prior-year quarter to 87 cents.U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp price-eps-surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsRise in net interest income (NII): Improvement in loan demand, particularly consumer loans, and rising interest rates during the to-be-reported quarter will likely support the company’s NII. Also, income from interest earning assets (average balance) are projected to rise nearly 1% to $421.3 billion.Non-Interest Income Likely to Improve:  Higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to have supported U.S. Bancorp’s fee income. Per the consensus estimate, trust and investment management fees are likely to improve 1.3% to $385 million on a sequential basis. Moreover, the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter, which is likely to boost the bank’s credit and debit card revenues by 6.2% sequentially to $327 million.Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment. The consensus estimate for mortgage banking revenues is $199 billion, down 6.6% sequentially.Expenses Might Trend Higher: While the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately. Also, there will be impact of the one-time charge that comes with the tax overhaul.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 87 cents over the last seven days.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

584,USB,"Volatility is back in the markets, resulting in higher trading activities. This is expected to benefit Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) first-quarter results, slated to be released on Apr 16, given the significant dependence of its top line on trading revenues.After three consecutive quarters of witnessing muted activities, the markets experienced considerable volatility in the last two months of the first quarter. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse.Last year, trading activities remained weak despite several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and absence of significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration. Subdued inflation in the United States and modest rise in long-term interest rates along with lack of specific catalysts were concerns.These factors resulted in lower fixed income trading, while equity trading also didn’t fare better.Nonetheless, concerns over trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation in the United States, further tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited significant volatility during the first quarter.Hence, in the to-be-reported quarter, both fixed income trading and equity trading revenues are anticipated to increase.Overall Earnings & Revenue Growth ExpectationsNotably for BofA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 59 cents reflects 43.9% surge on a year-over-year basis. Also, the consensus estimate for sales of $22.9 billion indicates a 3% increase from the prior-year quarter.Click here to know about the other factors that are expected influence BofA’s overall results.Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteConclusionAmid an improving operating backdrop, rebound in trading revenues is expected to benefit this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s top-line growth.

585,USB,"The Q1 earnings season is just around the corner and investors are eagerly awaiting the major bank results, which have remained in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons.The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This somewhat reversed the rally experienced by bank stocks since last September. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports affected the stock market rally in the quarter.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, as seen in both February and March. This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues, primarily for big banks.Notably, the first-quarter earnings are expected to report decent numbers as compared with the last quarter (impacted by huge one-time charges related to the tax law reform), with a rising interest-rate environment aiding net interest margins — the backbone for banks’ top-line growth.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending will likely energize interest income for banks. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are predicted to improve slightly on a sequential basis in the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.Therefore, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance Sector'stotal earnings) are projected to witness 11.1% year-over-year jump in earnings in the quarter to be reported. This comes in higher than 2.7% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article.)The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could deal a blow to the banks.However, strong equity issuances globally might have got boosted from IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are projected to increase. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&A’s in certain sectors will likely help banks garner advisory fees.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Expense reduction, which has helped banks to remain profitable, is not expected to be a major support, as banks have already slashed the majority of unnecessary expenses. While the absence of considerable legal expenses since the last few quarters is encouraging, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Selecting the WinnersWith the upcoming results likely to be impressive, there are a few major banks that are expected to stand out this earnings season. Therefore, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist.

586,USB,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Apr 13.The expected rebound in Citigroup’s trading revenues will likely have a positive impact on first-quarter 2018 earnings given the significant dependence of its top line on this source. Further, benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly consumer banking — are anticipated to offset the negatives.The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This reversed the uptrend experienced by banks since last September. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector affected the stock market rally in the quarter.Therefore, after three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues.Per John Gerspach, chief financial officer (CFO) of Citigroup, rising volatility at the very beginning of 2018 is expected to break the trading revenues’ slump. The bank expects first-quarter 2018 trading revenues to be up by a ""low-to-mid"" single digit on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, equities business is likely to record revenues of more than $1 billion in Q1, last recorded in 2015. However, management believes investment banking might go down as compared with the prior-year quarter.Other Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsConsumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth: In consumer, management expects continued modest year-over-year revenue growth, and positive operating leverage in both North America and International Consumer in 2018. In total, sequential growth in pre-tax earnings in Global Consumer banking was recorded over the last three quarters and is anticipated to continue into the first quarter as well.Acceleration in growth for overall Latin America Consumer revenues is expected in 2018 on rising card revenues.Investment Banking Fees to Decline: The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could impact revenues of Citigroup.However, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As will likely help banks to partially offset the lost revenues. Also, strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase. Thus, Citigroup is also likely to report a decent quarter.On the institutional side, continued year-over-year revenue growth in accrual businesses, including TTS, the Private Bank, Corporate Lending and Securities Services are anticipated.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction might not be a major support. Nonetheless, some legal settlements during the quarter might impact Citigroup’s earnings to an extent.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — might perk up interest income.Credit Costs Might Impact Negatively: Cost of credit is likely to rise, quarter on quarter, driven by the normalization of credit costs in ICG, offset by lower reserve builds in consumer. Net credit-card losses are likely to worsen. Citigroup expects NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points (bps) for 2018 and up to 325 bps over the medium term. In retail services, NCL rate is projected in the range of 500 bps for 2018 and up to 525 bps over the medium term.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Citigroup does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Citigroup is -0.74%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.60 comes in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62.Zacks Rank: Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.62 reflects a 19.12% rise on a year-over-year basis. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $18.9 billion indicates 4.29% growth from the prior-year quarter. Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Citigroup Inc.

587,USB,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Apr 13.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been in the news on a regular basis, following the sales scam that surfaced in September 2016. The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in the bank’s auto insurance business and online bill pay services.Therefore, the bank has been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.To add to the woes, during the first quarter, the Federal Reserve ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017). The Fed’s action demonstrates poor governance, compliance and risk management of Wells Fargo associated with the sales practices scandal, as well as mishandling of auto-insurance and mortgage fees.Notably, the firm is restricted from growth until governance and risk management improve. However, the bank is allowed to continue with current banking activities.Mortgage business, the primary source of revenue for Wells Fargo, is expected to witness a slowdown in the first quarter. With the interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this segment. Thus, growth in Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues is expected to be low.Here are the other factors influencing Wells Fargo’s Q1 results:Loan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are expected to improve slightly on a sequential basis during the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue into the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Also, the bank is cutting back its auto-lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Notably, in first-quarter 2018, management expects loan growth to be impacted by seasonally lower mortgage origination and credit card balances. Additionally, based on the current pricing trends and channel mix in held-for-sale pipeline, the gain on sale margin is expected to decline.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo might record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Moreover, high legal costs might be witnessed due to ongoing litigation hassles.Non-Interest Revenues to Grow Modestly: Outflows from the asset-management business will likely be recorded on market declines. However, driven by high volatility, trading activity is expected to improve marginally in the quarter and rise in trust income is anticipated on higher equity markets.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.73%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings remained stable over the last seven days and is expected to be up 7% year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $21.7 billion, down 1.5% year over year. Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 18.

588,USB,"The rebound in trading business is likely to drive Goldman Sachs’ (GS  -  Free Report) first-quarter earnings, to be reported on Apr 17. Moreover, benefits of higher rates and relatively better performance of other segments — mainly investing and lending — are anticipated to aid earnings.Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues.Notably, the quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This reversed the uptrend experienced by banks since last September. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector affected the stock market rally in the quarter.Reversing the trend of the last couple of quarters, higher trading revenues are expected in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Institutional Client Services division, of which the major portion comprises fixed income revenues, reflects a rise of 19.2% sequentially.In additionally, investment management unit of Goldman is projected to aid earnings as increase in investments in fixed income, alternatives and low-cost index funds are expected to escalate management and other fees. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the division projects a rise of 12.4% year over year.Here are the other factors that might influence Goldman’s Q1 results:Investment Banking Fees to Report Modest Results: The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could impact revenues of Goldman.However, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As will likely help banks partially offset the lost revenues. Also, strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are predicted to increase. Thus, Goldman is also likely to report a decent quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment banking segment is projected at $1.8 billion, up 12.5% year over year.Investing & Lending to Get a Boost: Higher asset values, improved corporate performance and rising rates are expected to aid revenues from this source. In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — might perk up revenues. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investing and lending segment is projected at $1.6 billion, up 23.1% year over year.Strong Expense Management: Goldman is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will unlikely be a major support. Furthermore, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might impact Goldman’s earnings unusually.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Goldman does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Goldman carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

589,USB,"Most banks that reported fourth-quarter 2017 results last week managed to record bottom-line improvement on top-line strength. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last six trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, the results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans driven primarily by consumer loans. Moreover, eased margin pressure acted favorably. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped steer the banks’ organic growth.However, mortgage banking business remained weak.

This could majorly support the bank’s results scheduled to be released on Wednesday, Jan 17.Investment banking income comprises underwriting revenues and advisory fees. So, now let’s dig a little deeper to see how these are expected to perform in the to-be-reported quarter.Underwriting fees, consisting of debt and equity underwriting, are projected to increase. As the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital in the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for roughly 40% of total investment banking fees for BofA, this will provide some support.Also, despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is likely to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets worldwide might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, equity underwriting fees are projected to increase for BofA.Talking about advisory fees, weaker M&A activity in terms of deals closed globally, despite a large number of new M&As announced in the fourth quarter, will have a slight adverse effect. But as BofA is one of the leading players in this space, it might not suffer a huge loss.Overall, management anticipates investment banking income to be up in mid-single-digits range in the to-be-reported quarter. For this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $4.92 billion indicates 8.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Overall Earnings & Revenue ProjectionsNotably for BofA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 44 cents reflects 10% growth on a year-over-year basis. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $21.3 billion indicates a 6.5% increase from the prior-year quarter. Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteClick here to know more about the factors that could influence BofA’s overall results.Our TakeIn a tough operating environment, modest improvement in BofA’s investment banking revenues will likely support top-line growth.Earnings Schedules of Other Major BanksAmong the major banks, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) are scheduled to release on Jan 16, while U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) will report on Jan 17.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

591,USB,"Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share improved from the prior-year quarter earnings of 96 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate came in at $1.04.Including $3.35 billion after-tax benefit, or 67 cents, from the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, $848 million pre-tax gain, or 11 cents from the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services and $3.25 billion pre-tax expense, or 59 cents related to litigation accruals, net income came in at $6.2 billion or $1.16 per share.Non-interest income recorded growth, partially offset by fall in net interest income. Moreover, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans acted as headwind for the quarter. Notably, lower mortgage income was also a negative. Improvement in credit quality and steady capital deployment activities were experienced.For the year ended 2017, earnings per share were $4.10, up 11 cents compared with the prior year. Results also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.98.The quarter’s total revenues were $22.1 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.4 billion. However, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $21.6 billion.Revenues for the year ended 2017 were $88.4 billion, slightly increasing year over year. However, revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89 billion.Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, quarterly revenue generation at the business segments was mixed. Community Banking and Wealth and Investment Management segments’ total quarterly revenues increased around 2.6% and 4.9%, respectively, while Wholesale Banking revenues edged down around 1.4%.Loans & Interest Income Fall, Non-Interest Income Up, Costs EscalateWells Fargo’s net interest income in the quarter came in at $12.3 billion, down 1% on a year-over-year basis. Increased interest income from trading assets, investment securities and loans, along with higher other interest income, mainly drove results. Further, net interest margin contracted 3 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.84%.Non-interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around $9.7 billion, up 6% year over year, primarily due to higher net gains from equity investments and debt securities, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues.As of Dec 31, 2017, total loans were $956.8 billion, down around 1.1% year over year. Reduction in consumer as well as commercial loan portfolio was recorded. Total deposits were $1.3 trillion, up 2% from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expense at Wells Fargo was $16.8 billion, up 27% from the year-earlier quarter. The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from rise in employee benefits and other expenses. Nonetheless, Wells Fargo remains committed to achieve expense reductions of $4 billion by the end of 2019.The company’s efficiency ratio of 76.2% came in above the 61.2% recorded in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability.Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo’s credit quality metrics improved in the reported quarter. Allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $12 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, down 4% year over year.Provision for credit losses was $651 million, declining 19.1% year over year. Net charge-offs were $751 million or 0.31% of average loans in the fourth quarter, down 17% from the year-ago quarter’s net charge-offs of $805 million (0.37%). Non-performing assets were down 23.7% to $8.7 billion in the quarter under review from $11.4 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position. In 2017, the company returned $14.5 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. Notably, in the reported quarter, the banking giant repurchased 51.4 million shares of its common stock.Wells Fargo’s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III (fully phased-in) increased to $154 billion from $146.4 billion recorded in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.9% under Basel III (fully phased-in) as of Dec 31, 2017, compared with 10.8% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Book value per share advanced to $37.44 from $35.18 recorded in the comparable period last year.Our ViewpointTop-line headwinds, aided by lower net interest income, were perceived. Furthermore, flaring up expenses remained a major drag, along with slowdown in mortgage business. Nevertheless, improved credit quality and tax benefit were positives.Despite several legal tensions, Wells Fargo remains focused on maintaining its financial position. Last year, the banking giant doubled its cost-cutting targets to combat escalating expenses. These efforts might help the company regain confidence of its clients and shareholders.We believe, over the long term, investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo, given its diverse geographic and business mix, which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth. We also anticipate strategic acquisitions and the bank’s efforts to address current adversities will help it expand its business and enhance profitability.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

592,USB,"Over the last four trading days, performance of banking stocks was largely bullish, with fourth-quarter earnings cheering investors. Banks were able to surpass earnings estimates along with reporting a decent overall financial performance.While expected weakness in trading, dismal mortgage banking and rise in credit costs hampered significant improvement in earnings, higher interest rates, modest loan growth and solid investment banking lent support. Further, banks were able to manage costs well.But what cheered investors the most was the upbeat 2018 guidance related to interest income and loan growth.

Moreover, all the three key U.S. indexes settled at new record highs after closing in the red on Tuesday.

595,USB,"The expected decline in Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) trading income is likely to adversely impact fourth-quarter 2017 earnings, slated on Wednesday, Jan 17. However, this is not expected to lead to dismal results as gains from higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly investment banking — are anticipated to offset the trading weakness.Moreover, though market volatility has not improved much in the last quarter, the decrease in trading revenues will primarily be due to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results.At an investor conference in early December 2017, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, stated that the company’s trading business till then in the fourth quarter was down roughly 15% year over year. In fact, there has been hardly any change in the scenario since then.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Markets segment (under which trading revenues are accounted for) revenues of $3.54 billion reflects a marginal rise of 1.9% from the prior quarter.Here are the other factors that are likely influence BofA’s Q4 results:Continuation of investment banking strength: The trend of pocketing advisory and underwriting fees is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter largely on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances.However, weaker M&A activity in terms of deals closed despite significant new M&As announced in the fourth quarter will have a slight adverse effect on advisory fees. But as BofA is one of the leading players in this space, it might not suffer a significant loss.Overall, the company projects investment banking income to be up in mid-single-digits range in the fourth quarter. For BofA, investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $4.92 billion reflects a rise of 8.2% year over year.Steady rise in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in improvement in net interest income (NII). Further, management expects NII in the to-be-reported quarter to increase sequentially, driven by modest growth in loans and deposits.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this division. Seasonality is also expected to hurt mortgage banking revenues. Moreover, BofA hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer Banking segment (under which mortgage fees are accounted for) revenues of $8.91 billion indicates 9.8% improvement from the prior-year quarter.Reduced scope of cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support this quarter. But given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall expenses are likely to remain more or less stable.Adverse impact of new tax code: In December 2017 (following the passage of the tax act), BofA announced expectation of one-time charge of $3 billion in the fourth quarter related to write-down of certain net deferred tax assets.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:BofA does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is -1.14%.Zacks Rank: BofA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

596,USB,"The Q4 earnings season is knocking at the door and investors are keen to see how major banks will perform this time, after reporting impressive results in the first three quarters of 2017.The last year has been a roller coaster ride for banks. Though the year begun on an optimistic note with high expectations from President Trump’s electoral promises, it lost some steam in the middle only to regain the bullish trend at the end.Banks showed resilience driven by the Fed’s hawkish stance (three rate hikes in 2017) and the gradually improving U.S. economy. Also, progress on the lesser banking regulation front cheered investors.Further, the new tax act drove the banks too. While the act will result in gains for banks over the long term, the to-be-reported quarter earnings will be adversely affected by huge one-time charges related to the changes in the tax law.Additionally, factors that weighed on major banks’ prior-quarter results persisted in Q4 as well. These, including trading weakness, slowdown in mortgage banking and stable net interest margins, will likely hamper profitability of major banks. On top of these, the above-mentioned charges add fuel to the fire.Also, while the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings is expected to escalate costs moderately.As such, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector'stotal earnings) are expected to witness a 6.3% year-over-year decline in earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This compares unfavorably with 6.5% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Analysis article).Nevertheless, strength in investment banking driven by a potential rise in equity issuances (strong rally in the equity market globally) and persistent increase in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) is expected to provide respite to some extent.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a slight improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer will offer marginal support interest income for banks.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Choosing the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are not likely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. So, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.5 Major Banks Set for Earnings SurprisesHere are five major regional bank stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming announcements:The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 12.

597,USB,"On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced the third rate hike of 2017 at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The Fed was tempted by the strengthening economy as well as impressive labor market gains.The benchmark federal funds rate has been hiked to 1.25-1.50%, from 1.00-1.25% raised in June 2017. Notably, this is the fifth raise in interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis, which led the Fed to lower rates to near zero.""The labor market has continued to strengthen and ... economic activity has been rising at a solid rate,"" the Federal Open Market Committee noted in a statement following its two-day meeting.Though policymakers have increased their expectations for economic growth in 2018, on the Trump administration’s proposed tax cuts, they continued with their projections of three hikes in 2018 and two hikes in 2019.“My colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists,” said Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman. She stated they expected the bill to provide “a modest lift.” “We continue to think that a gradual path of rate increases remains appropriate even with almost all participants factoring in their assessment of the tax policy,” Yellen further added.The central bank projects economic growth at the rate of 2.5% in 2018, up from the previous expectation of 2.1%. Further, the growth rate is anticipated to be 2.1% in 2019 — moderately higher than the previous forecast of 2%.Further, based on the updated economic projections, Fed expects inflation to be at 1.7%, below its target of 2%. The unemployment rate is predicted to fall to 4.1% this year, down from the prior forecast of 4.3%. Also, it is estimated to decline to 3.9% in 2018, down from the previous projection of 4.1%.“Changes in tax policy will likely provide some lift to economic activity in coming years,” Yellen said, adding that “the magnitude and timing of the macroeconomic effects of any tax package remain uncertain.”With decent economic growth and recent strong gains in the labor market, rate hike is an added advantage. However, there are temporary concerns over the weak inflation.In addition to the above, reiteration of number of rate hikes in 2018 and 2019 by the Fed officials disappointed the investors who were expecting more hikes on the likely strengthening of economic activity due to tax policy changes. Notably, Wall Street biggies including U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) edged down more than 1% following the rate hike announcement.Notably, U.S. Bancorp, BofA and Citigroup carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

598,USB,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks was overtly positive. The bullish trend was largely driven by progress in tax reform bill, favorable economic data and positive comments by Jerome H. Powell — President Trump's nominee for Fed Chairman.Powell’s comments in support of lesser regulations cheered investors.

599,USB,"Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $47.9 billion, up 5.2% year over year. Notably, community banks, constituting 92% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported net income of $6 billion, up 9.4% on a year-over-year basis.Banks’ earnings were driven by higher revenues and loan growth. However, higher expenses and loan loss provisions were major negatives.Banks, with assets worth more than $10 billion, accounted for a major part of earnings in the reported quarter. Though such banks constitute only 1.8% of the total number of domestic banks, these accounted for approximately 80% of the industry’s earnings. Leading names in this space include JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report).All the above-mentioned banks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Net Interest Income & Margin Rise, Non-Interest Income Falls, Costs Flare UpBanks have been striving to gain profits and are boosting productivity. Around 67.3% of all FDIC-insured institutions reported an improvement in quarterly net income, while the remaining saw a decline from the prior-year quarter level. Additionally, the percentage of institutions reporting net losses in the quarter declined to 3.9% from 4.6% in the year-ago quarter.The measure for profitability or average return on assets (ROA) inched up to 1.12% from 1.10% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Net operating revenues were $191.7 billion, up 4.4% year over year. A rise in net interest income, partially offset by non-interest income, was a driving factor.Net interest income was recorded at $127.5 billion, up 7.4% year over year, driven by rise in net interest income of 83.5% of banks. Net interest margin (NIM) increased to 3.30% from 3.18% recorded in the year-earlier quarter owing to a rise in interest-bearing assets. This depicts the highest average margin for the industry since fourth-quarter 2012.Non-interest income for the banks declined 1% year over year to $64.2 billion. Decline in gains on loan sales, servicing fee income and trading income led to the decline.Total non-interest expenses for the establishments were $109 billion in the quarter, up 1.9% on a year-over-year basis.Credit Quality: A Concern?Overall, credit quality was a mixed bag in the reported quarter. Net charge-offs increased to $11 billion, up 8% year over year, reflecting the eighth quarterly rise. Notably, higher credit card and auto loans charge-offs drove the upside.In the reported quarter, provisions for loan losses for the institutions were $13.8 billion, up 20.9% year over year. The level of non-current loans and leases declined 14.6% year over year to $114.4 billion, indicating the 29th decline in non-current loan balances in the last 30 quarters. The non-current rate was 1.20%, reflecting the lowest rate since third-quarter 2007.Strong Loan & Deposit GrowthThe capital position of the banks was solid. Total deposits continued to rise and were recorded at $13.2 trillion, up 3.3% year over year. Further, total loans and leases were $9.6 trillion, up 3.5% year over year.As of Sep 30, 2017, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance increased to $90.5 billion from $80.7 billion as of Sep 30, 2016. Furthermore, interest earned on investment securities primarily led to the growth in fund balance.No Bank Failures, Shrinking Problem Institutions, New Charters AddedDuring third-quarter 2017, no bank failed, two new charters were added, while 50 were merged. As of Sep 30, 2017, the number of ‘problem’ banks declined from 105 to 104. This signifies the lowest number in more than seven years, down from 888 recorded in first-quarter 2011. Total assets of the ‘problem’ institutions declined to $16 billion from $17.2 billion.Our ViewpointThe decline in the number of problem institutions looks encouraging with the quarter witnessing top-line growth on higher NIM. Banks have been gradually easing lending standards and trending toward higher fees to counter pressure on the top line. In addition, more interest rate hikes will help ease the pressure on interest income. In addition, consistent expense control and stable balance sheets are likely to act as tailwinds in the upcoming quarters.With lingering uncertainty in the economy, we do not see this issue-ridden sector returning to its pre-recession levels anytime soon. What encourages us is that a lot depends on to what extent President Trump lives up to his promises. Bank stocks are likely to face the brunt if the promised policy goals are not achieved.The Fed’s actions on expediting rate hike — which is again a function of economic growth based on Trump’s policy alterations — will also play a key role in keeping the optimism on bank stocks alive.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Results came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 84 cents.Easing margin pressure on rising rates was witnessed in the quarter.

The increase in net interest income was partly offset by lower non-interest income.U.S. Bancorp’s tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 8.3% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to loan growth and rising interest rates.Average earning assets climbed 3.8% year over year, supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities, along with elevated average other earning assets. Furthermore, net interest margin of 3.10% was up 12 basis points year over year, driven by higher interest rates and loan portfolio mix. Higher funding costs and elevated cash balances partially mitigated rise in margins.U.S. Bancorp’s non-interest income edged down around 1%, on a year-over-year basis, to $2.4 billion. The decline came primarily due to lower merchant processing services, mortgage banking revenues and reduced securities gains.Provision for credit losses increased 10.8% year over year to $360 million in the reported quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s average total loans climbed 3% year over year to $277.6 billion. The growth was stemmed by a rise in commercial loans, residential mortgages, total other retail and credit card loans. These increases were partially offset by a drop in commercial real estate and covered loans. Excluding covered loans, average total loans rose 3.3% year over year.Average total deposits were up 5.2% from the prior-year quarter to $335.2 billion. The upsurge was due to growth in interest-bearing deposits, partly offset by lower non-interest-bearing deposits.Non-interest expenses rose 3.7% year over year to $3 billion at U.S. Bancorp. The upsurge in mostly all components of non-interest expenses was partially offset by lower professional services, marketing and business development expenses along with other intangibles.Deteriorating Credit QualityCredit metrics at U.S. Bancorp deteriorated in the reported quarter.

On a year-over-year basis, the company experienced deterioration, mainly in net charge-offs in the credit card segment.Total allowance for credit losses was $4.4 billion, slightly up on a year-over-year basis. U.S. Bancorp’s non-performing assets (excluding covered assets) came in at $1.3 billion, down 23.5% year over year.Strong Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review, U.S. Bancorp maintained a solid capital position. Effective Jan 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements for the company comply with Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years to full implementation by Jan 1, 2018.The tier 1 capital ratio came in at 11.1%, in line with the prior-year quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9.6% as of Sep 30, 2017, up from 9.5% in the year-ago quarter.All regulatory ratios of U.S. Bancorp continued to be in excess of well-capitalized requirements. In addition, based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach, the Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.8% as of Sep 30, 2017, compared with 12.1% as of Sep 30, 2016.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.7% as of Sep 30, 2017, compared with 7.5% as of Sep 30, 2016.U.S. Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share, which increased to $25.98 as of Sep 30, 2017, from $24.78 recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company’s capital strength during the third quarter, U.S. Bancorp returned 79% of earnings to shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks. It came within the company’s long-term goal of returning 60-80% to its shareholders.OutlookFourth-quarter 2017Total average loan is expected to grow in line with the third quarter.Management expects net interest margin to be essentially flat sequentially.Since the third quarter was seasonally the highest quarter for fee income growth, management anticipates fee revenues to be essentially flat sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.Management anticipates to record positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and 2018 as well, supported by expense growth in the 3-5% range. Sequentially, expenses are estimated to be seasonally impacted by the timing of professional services and higher tax credit amortization expense.Credit quality is projected to remain stable.The taxable equivalent income tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%.Given the anticipated revenue impact from hurricanes to continue, management expects year-over-year merchant acquiring revenues will likely be essentially flat in the fourth quarter.Full-Year 2017Management expects compliance costs to grow in late 2017 and into 2018.The company commits to deliver positive operating leverage for full-year 2017.The year-over-year non-interest expense growth is expected to be in-line with long-term target range of 3-5%.

601,USB,"Over the last five trading days, the performance of banking stocks has been bearish. Expected delays in corporate tax reform and a flattening of the yield curve drove investor pessimism over bank stocks.Earlier this week, Democrats won elections in Virginia and New Jersey, which indicates increased prospects for their representatives in next year's midterm elections. This development increases investor apprehension, as this might challenge Republicans' plans of lessening regulations for banks. Expected weakness in economic numbers also added to the woes.Mortgage rates declined this week, hitting 3.9%, awaiting tax-reform results. Notably, concerns rose after the message sent by Republicans last week, “We think homeowners and home buyers have gotten much too sweet a deal from the federal tax code for far too long — and now we’re going to whack them down.”Nevertheless, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations and increased digital offerings persisted over the last five trading days.  (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Oct 27, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

602,USB,"Most banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of top-line strength and lower provisions. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, the results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing significantly. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing.

U.S. Bancorp’s non-performing assets (excluding covered assets) came in at $1.3 billion, down 23.5% year over year.Strong Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review, U.S. Bancorp maintained a solid capital position. Effective Jan 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements for the company comply with Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years to full implementation by Jan 1, 2018.The tier 1 capital ratio came in at 11.1%, in line with the prior-year quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9.6% as of Sep 30, 2017, up from 9.5% in the year-ago quarter.All regulatory ratios of U.S. Bancorp continued to be in excess of well-capitalized requirements. In addition, based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach, the Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.8% as of Sep 30, 2017, compared with 12.1% as of Sep 30, 2016.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.7% as of Sep 30, 2017, compared with 7.5% as of Sep 30, 2016.U.S. Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share, which increased to $25.98 as of Sep 30, 2017, from $24.78 recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company’s capital strength during the third quarter, U.S. Bancorp returned 79% of earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks. It came within the company’s long-term goal of returning 60-80% to its shareholders.ConclusionU.S. Bancorp posted a decent quarter. Along with elevated revenues, a solid capital position and increased lending activities were added advantages. In addition, rising margins was a positive.Nevertheless, weakness in the credit card portfolio adversely affected its asset quality. Additionally, there are concerns related to the impact of legal issues and the company’s global exposure. Also, escalating expenses, along with provisions, remain headwinds. U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteU.S. Bancorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

(C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% in the third quarter on prudent expense management. Earnings per share of $1.42 for the quarter easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.24 per share. Notably, results included after-tax gain related to the sale of a fixed income analytics business.Amid an expected trading slump, rising rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, easily surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects an 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million. Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and elevated interest rates supported net interest income. In addition, rise in advisory fees supported the top-line growth. A slight fall in operating expenses acted as a tailwind.Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Including previously disclosed mortgage-related discrete litigation accrual of 20 cents per share, earnings came in at 84 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.03 per share.Though rise in rates provided some respite, lower revenues aided by fall in non-interest income were recorded. Moreover, expenses soared. Also, reduction in loans acted as headwind for the quarter. Though the bank’s commercial portfolio improved, consumer loans disappointed. Improvement in credit quality and steady capital deployment activities were experienced.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

605,USB,"The earnings season had a decent start with the banking giants reporting improved earnings and revenues so far. Though the results have not been able to impress investors markedly, hopes are high that the industry will soon regain momentum.The banks that released earnings reported higher revenues supported by improved loan balances and higher interest rates. However, lower mortgage and trading revenues impacted the fee income to some extent.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, earnings for the major banks, accounting for nearly one-third of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500, are up 7.2% from the prior-year quarter while revenues are 1.9% higher.Earnings releases are coming in thick with U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Oct 18, before the opening bell.Let’s have a look at what can be expected from these three Major Regional Banks when they report third-quarter earnings.U.S. Bancorp is expected to report year-over-year improvement in revenues supported by higher net interest income (NII) on the back of loan growth. Some support is expected from the Mortgage Banking business as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenues is $215 billion, relatively stable year over year.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. Bancorp’s current-quarter earnings of 88 cents reflects a 4.5% rise year over year.However, the bank’s aim to be technologically advanced should keep costs high.

Rise in loans along with favorable interest rate environment is likely to benefit the bank’s NII. Fee income is likely to remain stable due to lower volume of M&A and equity issuance activities during the quarter, offset by expectations of higher trust income.M&T Bank’s investments in operational infrastructure and technology is likely to keep expenses escalated in the to-be-reported quarter.

606,USB,"KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results, scheduled on Oct 19, are expected to show a decline in net interest income (NII). While this could majorly affect its earnings, an improvement in revenues from other segments should offset the adverse impact on earnings.On a sequential basis, the quarter witnessed steady deceleration in home equity loan portfolio, while demand for commercial and industrial, and consumer loans rose. This is expected to lead to a rise in KeyCorp’s loan balance during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average loans of $87.3 billion reflects nearly 1% increase from the prior quarter.Further, KeyCorp is projected to record a 1.3% rise in average earning assets as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $121.3 billion.Despite these positive factors, KeyCorp is expected to witness a fall in NII owing to flatter yield curve for the major part of the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (tax equivalent basis) of $963 million shows a 2.4% decline on a sequential basis.Other Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsModest non-interest income growth: KeyCorp’s third-quarter non-interest income will be positively impacted by increasing investment banking income, mainly driven by slightly higher debt placement fees. Also, trust and investment services income is anticipated to have risen as the performance of equity markets was relatively decent during the quarter.However, growth in mortgage banking fees is expected to be relatively muted during the quarter owing to lower mortgage originations. Therefore, non-interest income is projected to record a marginal improvement.Decline in expenses should support profitability: KeyCorp has been consistently streamlining operations, diversifying products and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. This is expected to keep overall non-interest expenses (excluding merger related charges) manageable. Also, management expects cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal to support the bottom line marginally.Asset quality to worsen: As KeyCorp is projected to witness a rise in loans, a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing asset of $602 million shows 8.3% increase from the last quarter. Also, non-performing loans is projected to be $560 million, a rise of 10.5% sequentially.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict that KeyCorp will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it does not have right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is -0.22%.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the to-be-reported quarter has remained stable over the last 30 days at 35 cents, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 16.9%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.56 billion indicates 17.2% growth from the prior-year quarter.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 18.

607,USB,"BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results, slated on Thursday, Oct 19, are expected to witness a slight rise in tax equivalent net interest income (NII). This, in turn, will support the company’s revenues and bottom line.Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during quarter will support NII. On an annualized basis, BB&T expects total loans to grow 1-3% sequentially while core loan growth is anticipated to be in the range of 5-7%.Further, BB&T expects to record stable core net interest margin (NIM). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NIM of 3.46% reflects 1 basis point fall from the prior quarter. This is likely to be attributable to higher interest rates, which will be more than offset by marginally lower average interest earning assets (the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average earning assets is $193.3 billion).Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.68 billion shows marginal growth on a sequential basis. On the other hand, management expects NII to remain stable from the prior quarter.Now, let’s check out a few other factors that might influence BB&T’s Q3 performance:Lower non-interest income: BB&T has been witnessing continuous fall in mortgage banking fees as higher interest rates are leading to lower mortgage originations. However, an expected higher rate environment might have led to rise in demand for refinancing activities during the quarter, thus helping the company record some mortgage revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income of $106 million shows a jump of 12.8% sequentially.Further, as deposit balance rises, the company will record an increase in service charge on deposits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for service charge on deposits of $179 million reflects a rise of 1.7% from the last quarter.However, BB&T is expected to record lower insurance income as hurricanes hit the U.S coast during the latter half of the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for insurance fees is $417 million, plunging 13.3% from the prior quarter.Overall, total non-interest income is projected to witness a 3.4% sequential fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.18 billion while management projects the same to grow 1-3% year over year.Expenses might increase modestly: Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BB&T expects expenses to remain flat or increase 2% on a year-over-year basis.Asset quality to support results: BB&T expects loan loss provision to match net charge-offs (NCOs) in addition to providing for loan growth. Also, management expects NCOs rates to remain in the range of 0.35-0.45%.Non-performing asset (NPAs) levels will likely remain stable with the prior quarter. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NPAs is $690 million, stable sequentially.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of BB&T beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BB&T is +0.43%.Zacks Rank: BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the to-be-reported quarter has been revised 1.3% downward over the last 60 days to 78 cents, with four out of 12 estimates moving lower. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 2.2%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $2.84 billion indicates 2.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 18.

608,USB,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, before the opening bell. The bank’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that U.S. Bancorp is likely to beat on earnings in the third quarter. This is because the company has the combination of the two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for the stock is currently pegged at +0.26%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of U.S. Bancorp’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement.Notably, U.S. Bancorp delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.23% as depicted in the chart below:U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 3.2% for the three-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, underperforming growth of 3.9% recorded by the industry.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsExpenses Might Trend Higher: While the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on modest loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during the to-be-reported quarter will likely support the company’s NII.Consumer Revenue Growth: It is anticipated that an improving economy will spur consumer activity, which will help both payments businesses and consumer lending businesses. An improved economic backdrop will also lead to a rise in business spending on development and capital investments.Mortgage Banking Likely to Improve:  Higher mortgage banking is projected on stronger origination volumes. Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment. So, the contribution of mortgage revenues to total revenues will not be much. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenue is $215 billion, relatively stable year over year.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 88 cents over the last seven days. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $5.6 billion, up 4.9% year over year.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 26. The company has an Earnings ESP of +3.25% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

610,USB,"KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.KeyCorp’s shares fell nearly 2.4% in pre-market trading, reflecting investors’ concern over rising provision for credit losses. Notably, the price reaction during the full trading session will provide a better idea about how investors accepted the results.Results were supported by revenue synergies from the First Niagara Financial Group acquisition deal (completed in Aug 2016) and higher interest rates. On the other hand, higher operating expenses and increase in provision for credit losses were the downsides. Notably, the company witnessed marginal loan growth while deposit balances declined.Including merger-related charges of $43 million, net income from continuing operations came in at $393 million, up significantly from $193 million in the prior-year quarter.First Niagara Deal Continues to Drive Revenues, Expenses RiseTotal revenue surged 52.1% year over year to $1.64 billion. Also, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income jumped 63.1% year over year to $987 million. The rise was attributable to benefits from the First Niagara acquisition, a rise in earning asset balances and ongoing business activities. Also, taxable-equivalent net interest margin from continuing operations grew 54 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.30%.Non-interest income (excluding merger related charges) was $653 million, an increase of 38.1% from the year-ago quarter. A rise in all fee income components drove the surge.Non-interest expenses (excluding merger related charges) jumped 34.7% year over year to $951 million due to a rise in both personnel as well as non-personnel expenses. The quarter recorded a modest year-over-year fall in merger-related charges.Loans Rise Marginally, Deposits DeclineAt the end of the second quarter, average total deposits were $102.8 billion, down nearly 1% from the prior quarter. However, average total loans were $86.5 billion, up 0.4% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, increased 3 bps year over year to 0.31%. Provision for credit losses increased 26.9% year over year to $66 million. Further, KeyCorp’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $870 million, up 1.9% from the prior-year quarter.However, non-performing assets, as a percentage of period-end portfolio loans, other real estate owned properties assets and other nonperforming assets were 0.64%, down 39 bps year over year.Capital Ratios DeteriorateKeyCorp's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.56% as of Jun 30, 2017, down from 9.95% as of Jun 30, 2016. In addition, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.79% versus 11.41% as of Jun 30, 2016.The company’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 9.97% at the end of the quarter, down from 11.10% as of Jun 30, 2016.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, KeyCorp repurchased $94 million worth of shares as part of its 2016 capital plan.Our TakeRestructuring initiatives undertaken by KeyCorp will be supported by its robust balance-sheet position. The company’s financials will continue to benefit from the synergies of the First Niagara transaction. Further, with gradual rise in interest rates and increasing loan demand, margin pressure is expected to ease in the coming quarters.However, increased dependence on home equity and commercial real estate loans raises the exposure of the company’s profits to these avenues.KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteKeycorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Though the banks were able to surpass earnings estimates, the overall financial performance remained muted.Weakness in trading and investment banking as well as rise in credit costs hindered significant earnings improvement. Additionally, dismal mortgage banking hurt revenue growth.On the other hand, higher interest rates and loan growth along with prudent cost management supported banks’ profitability to some extent.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Oct 6, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1.

612,USB,"Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Including previously disclosed mortgage-related discrete litigation accrual of 20 cents per share, earnings came in at 84 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.03 per share.Though rise in rates provided some respite, lower revenues aided by a fall in non-interest income were recorded. Moreover, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans acted as headwind for the quarter. Though the bank’s commercial portfolio improved, consumer loans disappointed. Improvement in credit quality and steady capital deployment activities were experienced.Third-quarter net income came in at $4.6 billion, down from $5.6 billion recorded in the prior-year quarter. Results included $1 billion worth of discrete litigation accrual.The quarter’s total revenues were $21.9 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the prior-year quarter figure of $22.3 billion.Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, revenue generation at the business segments was mixed. Community Banking and Wholesale Banking segments’ total quarterly revenue decreased around 2.4% and 1%, respectively, while Wealth and Investment Management revenues increased around 2.4%.Loans Fall, Interest Income Rise, Costs EscalateWells Fargo’s net interest income in the quarter came in at $12.5 billion, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Increased interest income from trading assets, investment securities, loans held for sale and mortgages held for sale, along with higher other interest income, mainly drove results. Further, net interest margin expanded 5 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.87%, reflecting the rising interest-rate environment.Non-interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around $9.5 billion, down 9% year over year, primarily due to low mortgage banking revenues, lower net gains from trading activities and reduced service charges on deposit accounts.As of Sep 30, 2017, total loans were $951.9 billion, down around 1% year over year. Reduction in its consumer loan portfolio was recorded, partially offset by growth in commercial loans. Total deposits were $1.3 trillion, in line with the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expense at Wells Fargo was $14.4 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter. The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from rise in almost all components of expenses. Nonetheless, Wells Fargo remains committed to achieve expense reductions of $4 billion by the end of 2019.The company’s efficiency ratio of 65.5% was above 59.4% recorded in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability.Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo’s credit quality metrics improved in the quarter. Allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $12.1 billion as of Sep 30, 2017, down 4.7% year over year.Provision for credit losses was $717 million, declining 11% year over year. Net charge-offs were $717 million or 0.30% of average loans in the reported quarter, down 10.9% from the year-ago quarter net charge-offs of $805 million (0.33%). Non-performing assets were down 22.5% to $9.3 billion in the quarter under review from $12 billion in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position. In the reported quarter, the company returned $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.Wells Fargo’s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III (fully phased-in) increased to $152.8 billion from $147.8 billion in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.8% under Basel III (fully phased-in) as of Sep 30, 2017, compared with 10.7% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Book value per share advanced to $36.96 from $35.81 recorded in the comparable period last year.Our ViewpointWells Fargo reported a disappointing quarter. Top-line headwinds, aided by lower non-interest income, persist. Further, escalating expenses remained a major drag, along with slowdown in mortgage business. However, improved credit quality was a positive.This banking giant has been much in the news following the sales scam that came into light in September 2016. The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business and online bill pay services. Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer — Timothy Sloan — apologized for causing its customers trouble and promised to take appropriate steps to make it a better bank in the times to come.We believe, over the long term, investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo, given its diverse geographic and business mix, which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth. We also believe strategic acquisitions and the bank’s efforts to address current adversities will help the company expand its business and enhance profitability. Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteCurrently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Excluding significant items, non-interest income was down 5% year over year to $571 million. Notably, the quarter witnessed a fall in almost all components of income, partially offset by higher revenues from other income, service charges on deposits as well as wealth and asset management.However, non-interest expenses decreased 3% year over year to $957 million. The fall was due to lower net occupancy expense, equipment, card and processing, and other expenses.As of Jun 30, 2017, average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at $92.7 billion.

615,USB,"As we mull earnings reports from IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) from Tuesday afternoon and more Wall Street investment firms this morning, we also see fresh data on June Housing Starts and Permits. Both headline numbers came in hotter than expected: 1.215 million on June starts (up 8.3%) and 1.254 million in permits (up 7.4%). (These results are seasonally adjusted and annualized.)Housing Starts in May also saw a positive revision from 1.09 million units to 1.12 million. Analysts had only expected a 5.5% increase in starts and just 1.7% in permits. Starts were bolstered by a strong 849K in single-family housing. All this said, we are still well off the multi-year highs of roughly 2 million annualized housing starts per month.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped estimates on both top and bottom lines ahead of the bell this morning: 87 cents per share beat the 76 cents expected, and the $9.5 billion in revenues easily surpassed the $8.9 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. These results beat fairly low bars for Morgan in the quarter, however: our consensus earnings estimate for Q2 had tumbled more than 10% in the past month.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for its Q2 earnings and revenues, albeit more slightly: 85 cents per share beat by a penny, and revenues of $5.49 billion outperformed the $5.46 billion in the Zacks consensus. This is a very typical quarterly performance for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock: the trailing 4-quarter average earnings beat — in which the bank topped expectations each time — was 1.55%.Wednesday after the bell will give us a breather of sorts, with American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS  -  Free Report) reporting after the bell, but the real marquee names of earnings season begin after the bell with Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Thursday afternoon, and then the dam really breaks open next week.

The company reported earnings per share of 85 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Results also came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 83 cents.Also, shares of U.S. Bancorp gained more than 2% in the pre-market session, indicating that investors have been bullish on the results.

Loan portfolio mix, reduced reinvestment rates on maturing securities and elevated cash balances partially mitigated rise in margins.U.S. Bancorp’s non-interest income moved down 5.2% on a year-over-year basis to $2.4 billion. The decline was primarily due to lower commercial products revenue, mortgage banking revenue and other non-interest income.Provision for credit losses increased 7.0% year over year to $350 million in the reported quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s average total loans increased 3.4% year over year to $275.5 billion.

Excluding covered loans, average total loans rose 3.7% year over year.Average total deposits were up 7.7% from the prior-year quarter to $331.2 billion. The upsurge was due to growth in non-interest-bearing deposits, as well as interest-bearing deposits.Non-interest expenses rose 1.0% year over year to $3.0 billion at U.S. Bancorp. The upsurge in mostly all components of non-interest expenses was partially offset by lower employee benefits and other intangibles.Deteriorating Credit QualityCredit metrics at U.S. Bancorp deteriorated in the reported quarter.

On a year-over-year basis, the company experienced deterioration, mainly in net charge-offs in the credit card segment.Total allowance for credit losses was $4.4 billion, slightly up on a year-over-year basis. U.S. Bancorp’s non-performing assets (excluding covered assets) were $1.3 billion, down 23.5% year over year.Strong Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review, U.S. Bancorp maintained a solid capital position. Effective Jan 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements for the company comply with Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years to full implementation by Jan 1, 2018.The tier 1 capital ratio came in at 11.1%, in line with the prior-year quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9.3% as of Jun 30, 2017, in line with the year-ago quarter.All regulatory ratios of U.S. Bancorp continued to be in excess of “well-capitalized” requirements. In addition, based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach, the Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.7% as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with 12.0% as of Jun 30, 2016.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.5% as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with 7.6% as of Jun 30, 2016.U.S. Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share, which increased to $25.55 as of Jun 30, 2017, from $24.37 recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company’s capital strength during the second quarter, U.S. Bancorp returned 81% of earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks. It surpassed the high end of the company’s long-term goal of returning 60–80% to its shareholders.ConclusionU.S. Bancorp posted an impressive quarter. Along with higher revenues, a solid capital position and increased lending activities were added advantages. The company follows a conservative growth stratagem and has made small but strategic acquisitions.However, weakness in the credit card portfolio adversely affected its asset quality. Additionally, there are concerns related to the impact of legal issues and the company’s global exposure. Also, escalating expenses, along with provisions, remain headwinds.U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteU.S. Bancorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

618,USB,"Wednesday, July 19th, 2017As we mull earnings reports from IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) from Tuesday afternoon and more Wall Street investment firms this morning, we also see fresh data on June Housing Starts and Permits. Both headline numbers came in hotter than expected: 1.215 million on June starts (up 8.3%) and 1.254 million in permits (up 7.4%). (These results are seasonally adjusted and annualized.)Housing Starts in May also saw a positive revision from 1.09 million units to 1.12 million. Analysts had only expected a 5.5% increase in starts and just 1.7% in permits. Starts were bolstered by a strong 849K in single-family housing. All this said, we are still well off the multi-year highs of roughly 2 million annualized housing starts per month.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped estimates on both top and bottom lines ahead of the bell this morning: 87 cents per share beat the 76 cents expected, and the $9.5 billion in revenues easily surpassed the $8.9 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. These results beat fairly low bars for Morgan in the quarter, however: our consensus earnings estimate for Q2 had tumbled more than 10% in the past month.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for its Q2 earnings and revenues, albeit more slightly: 85 cents per share beat by a penny, and revenues of $5.49 billion outperformed the $5.46 billion in the Zacks consensus. This is a very typical quarterly performance for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock: the trailing 4-quarter average earnings beat — in which the bank topped expectations each time — was 1.55%.Wednesday after the bell will give us a breather of sorts, with American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS  -  Free Report) reporting after the bell, but the real marquee names of earnings season begin after the bell with Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Thursday afternoon, and then the dam really breaks open next week.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

619,USB,"Rising interest rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.82 per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57. Also, the figure reflects a 17% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $406 million.Solid loan growth and higher interest rates supported net interest income. Further, investment banking fees recorded a rise. Apart from these, results were supported by a fall in provision for credit losses, mainly driven by reserve releases in the Oil & Gas loan portfolio.As expected, fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Also, fall in mortgage banking income, due to higher funding costs and decline in mortgage origination volume, was a headwind. Operating expenses reported a rise during the quarter.Shares of JPMorgan lost over 1.9% in the pre-market trading. Perhaps, lesser support on the expense front and lower mortgage fees led to investors’ bearish stance. Nonetheless, the actual picture will emerge in the full day’s trading session, with investors and analysts considering the core results.The overall performance of JPMorgan’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments, except Consumer & Community Banking, reported a rise in net income on a year-over-year basis.Among other positives, credit card sales volume improved 15% and merchant processing volume grew 12%. Commercial Banking average loan balances increased 12% and Asset Management average loan balances rose 9%.Trading Decline Offset by Higher Rates & Loan Growth, Costs RiseManaged net revenue of $26.4 billion in the quarter was up 5% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.8 billion. Rising rates, loan growth and higher auto lease revenues were the primary reasons for the top-line improvement. These were partially offset by lower trading revenues and mortgage banking fees.Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $14.5 billion, a rise of 6% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher auto lease depreciation, FDIC-related costs and absence of legal benefit recorded in the prior-year quarter.Improving Credit QualityAs of Jun 30, 2017, non-performing assets were $6.4 billion, down 17% from the year-ago period. Provision for credit losses fell 13% year over year to $1.2 billion, primarily due to reserve releases in Wholesale loan portfolio.However, net charge-offs were up 2% year over year to $1.2 billion.Strong Capital PositionTier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 14.3% as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with 13.6% as of Jun 30, 2016. Tier 1 common equity capital ratio (estimated) was 12.6% as of Jun 30, 2017, up from 12.0% as of Jun 30, 2016. Total capital ratio came in at 15.9% (estimated) as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with 15.2% as of Jun 30, 2016.Book value per share was $66.05 as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with $62.67 as of Jun 30, 2016. Tangible book value per common share came in at $53.29 as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with $50.21 as of Jun 30, 2016.Bottom LineImprovement in investment banking fees during the quarter is expected to continue in the near term. Moreover, growth in loans and deposits reflects improvement in economy. This is expected to lead to a rise in interest income, which will further benefit from the Fed rate hikes.However, trading revenue slump owing to low volatility is expected to continue in the near-term. Further, expense control is less likely to support profitability going forward.J P Morgan Chase & Co Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  J P Morgan Chase & Co Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | J P Morgan Chase & Co QuoteCurrently, JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

621,USB,"Despite trading slowdown, loan growth and higher interest rates drove Bank of America Corporation’s (BAC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The figure was 17% higher than the prior-year quarter. Markets also seem to be happy with BofA’s results. In pre-market trading, the company’s shares were up nearly 1.4%.

Operating expenses also recorded a decline. Further, credit costs decreased despite rise in loans.However, a fall in trading revenues (as expected) and mortgage banking losses were the undermining factors.  Overall performance of the company’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments witnessed improvement in net income except Global Markets.Loan Growth Supports Revenues, Expenses DownNet revenues amounted to $22.1 billion, up nearly 1% from the prior-year quarter. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22 billion.Net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, grew 9% year over year to $11.4 billion. Further, net interest yield rose 13 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.36%.Non-interest income declined 7% from the year-ago quarter to $10.7 billion. The decrease was mainly due to lower trading income and mortgage banking loss.Non-interest expenses were $13.1 billion, down 3% year over year. The fall in expenses reflects reduced operating costs and lower litigation expenses.Credit Quality ImprovesAs of Sep 30, 2017, ratio of nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties was 0.75%, down 22 bps year over year. Also, provision for credit losses fell 2% year over year to $834 million, reflecting lower losses in consumer real estate and lower energy exposure.However, net charge-offs increased 1% from the year-ago quarter to $900 million, indicating higher losses in commercial loans.Strong Capital PositionThe company’s book value per share as of Sep 30, 2017 was $23.92 compared with $24.19 as of Sep 30, 2016.

624,USB,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. The earnings season has kick started and this time, banks are expected to be hurt by a tough operating backdrop. This seems to be one of the primary reasons for investors’ pessimistic stance.A number of factors including weak trading and investment banking activities, lower-than-expected interest rates and lesser demand for refinancing activities during the quarter must be weighing on investors’ mind. All these are expected to hurt banks’ revenue growth to some extent. With expense reduction not likely to be a major support, there is less chance of impressive growth in the banks’ bottom line.Nonetheless, the last five trading sessions witnessed streamlining efforts.

625,USB,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 19, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict an earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   The company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, aided by growth in net interest income and non-interest income. Further, the quarter recorded a rise in loan and deposit balances. However, on the down side, the quarter witnessed elevated expenses and higher provisions.Notably, U.S. Bancorp delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.55%.U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 1% for the three-month period (ended Jun 30, 2017), underperforming growth of 4.0% recorded by Zacks categorized Banks – Major Regional industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to U.S. Bancorp’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:U.S. Bancorp doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for U.S. Bancorp is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 84 cents. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: U.S. Bancorp’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsExpenses to Trend Higher: Expenses might trend upward in the upcoming release due to digitization and investments in technology. Moreover, costs are expected to be seasonally higher in the to-be-reported quarter.Pressure on Net Interest Margin to Ease Slightly: Though the lingering low-rate environment has taken a toll on the bank’s margins for the past several years, the Fed’s recent rate hike for the fourth time, since the financial crisis, and its commitment to raise rates faster (one more time) this year, based on a convincing pace of economic growth, will likely help banks get rid of shrinking margins further. However, lower treasury yields during the quarter might curb margin improvement.Top-line Growth: It is anticipated that an improving economy will spur consumer activity, which will help both payments businesses and consumer lending businesses. An improved economic backdrop should also lead to a rise in business spending on development and capital investments. Further, mortgage revenue is projected to improve sequentially.Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans (C&I) are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.Management expects commercial loan growth to improve on a sequential basis. Credit card, mortgage and auto loan growth is likely to be stronger due to seasonality.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter declined 1.2% to 84 cents over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

626,USB,"Expected slump in trading business is likely to adversely affect The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (GS  -  Free Report) third-quarter earnings, to be reported on Oct 17. Moreover, the bank is anticipated to record year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues.Goldman’s second-quarter 2017 results recorded a positive earnings surprise of 17.6%, driven by higher equities revenues and low expenses. However, lower fixed income revenues thwarted the bottom line. Notably, the quarter witnessed challenging market-making environment, reduced levels of volatility and low client activity levels.This earnings beat translated into impressive price movement for the company. During the three-month period ended Sep 30, shares of Goldman gained 6.9%.Will the upswing in stock price continue post third-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to beat on earnings this time. Notably, Goldman recorded positive earnings surprise in three of the last four trailing quarters as depicted below:Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t call for an earnings beat this time around. A stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at $4.31. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Goldman’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsMarket Volatility: Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. Therefore, the company is likely to be affected by the subdued volatility experienced during the quarter.Top-line Pressure: Reduction in equity issuance and feeble equity trading volumes are expected to negatively influence fee revenue growth this time around. Nevertheless, persistent rise in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) will likely provide some respite. Though continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support the bottom-line numbers, Goldman might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the to-be-reported quarter.Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As globally increased during the quarter. Notably, in the third quarter, Goldman acted as an advisor and helped closed M&A deals worth over $300 billion. Therefore, M&A advisory fees for the bank are expected to lend support to revenues.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $7.64 billion, down 6.5% year over year.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to elevated interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, as well as consumer — might perk up interest income.Strong Expense Management: Goldman completed an expense initiative during the first half of 2016 which translated into run-rate expense savings of around $1.6 billion in 2016. The bank is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. Thus, continuation of expense management is likely to aid bottom-line expansion in the coming quarters.Notably, this banking giant’s performance was inadequate to win analysts’ confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate decreased slightly to $4.31, over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

The trend might continue in the upcoming quarter.  Growth in Average Loan Balance: Comerica’s average loans are likely to increase given a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer loans.Net Interest Income to Grow: Owing to an improvement in loan balances and easing pressure on net interest margin, Comerica is likely to witness growth in interest income.Effective Cost Saving Initiatives: Expenses might trend down in the upcoming release due to the company’s GEAR Up expense savings initiatives.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) Earnings ESP is +0.27% and it carries a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy).

628,USB,"Despite weak fixed income market revenues, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% in third-quarter 2017 on prudent expense management. Earnings per share of $1.42 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.24 per share. Notably, results included after-tax gain related to the sale of a fixed income analytics business.Net income came in at $4.1 billion compared with $3.8 billion in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the gain, earnings came in at $1.29 per share.Overall top-line strength was reflected, driven by higher banking and consumer banking revenues. Moreover, expenses declined on efficiency savings by the bank.However, Citigroup’s costs of credit for the third quarter were up 15% year over year to $2 billion. This rise largely reflects net credit losses of $1.8 billion and a net loan loss reserve build of $16 million due to hurricane and earthquake-related loan loss reserve builds.Top-Line Strength & Low Expenses RecordedRevenues increased 2% year over year to $18.2 billion in the reported quarter. The rise highlighted elevated revenues in the institutional clients group and global consumer banking, partially offset by decline in corporate/other revenues. The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.7 billion.At Institutional Clients Group (ICG), revenues came in at $9.2 billion in the quarter, up 9% year over year. Notably, revenues from total banking climbed 11%. Further, though fixed income revenues declined 16%, higher equity markets (up 16%) and securities services (up 12%) revenues offset the decline on a year-over-year basis.Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues increased 3% year over year to $8.4 billion, mainly driven by higher revenues in North America, Latin America and Asia GCB.Corporate/Other revenues were $509 million, plunging 55% from the prior-year quarter. The decline mainly reflected legacy assets runoff, hedging activities impact and divestiture activity.Operating expenses at Citigroup were down 2% year over year to $10.2 billion. Efficiency savings and the winding-down of legacy assets mitigated increased volume-related expenses and ongoing investments.Strong Balance SheetAt quarter end, Citigroup’s end of period assets was $1.89 trillion, up 4% year over year. The company’s loans grew 2% year over year at $653 billion. Deposits increased 3% year over year to $964 billion.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-accrual assets decreased 19% year over year to $5 billion.

Notably, the company returned around $6.4 billion to common shareholders as common stock repurchases and dividends.Our ViewpointCitigroup reported impressive results this time around also. Furthermore, restructuring efforts, including streamlining moves, will likely continue to ease the bank’s burden on the expense base. The company exhibits capital strength which continues to support its dividend and a share buyback program. Also, rise in revenues is commendable.One can consider a strong brand like Citigroup to be a sound investment option over the long term, given its global footprint and attractive core business. Additionally, the company’s growth looks encouraging amid the rising rate environment, as well as anticipated potential ease of regulations under President Trump’s administration.Nevertheless, several legal hassles and escalating costs of credit remain concerns for the company.Citigroup Inc.

Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million.Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and higher interest rates supported net interest income. Further, rise in advisory fees supported the top-line growth.

629,USB,"The Q3 earnings season is just around the corner and investors are eagerly awaiting the results of banks that have been in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons.While investors’ optimism over the Fed’s plans to unwind its giant balance sheet and keep raising interest rates should drive bank stocks higher in the upcoming months, Q3 results are not expected to be overwhelming.This is because, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance Sector's total earnings) are expected to witness 5.1% year-over-year decline in earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This compares with 10% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article).Reduction in equity issuance, feeble equity trading volumes and subdued volumes of M&A’s are expected to negatively impact fee income growth for banks this time around. However, a persistent rise in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) and stability of fixed income trading flows will likely provide some respite.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer might energize interest income for banks.Credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards. Though a continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support the bottom-line numbers, banks might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the third quarter.On the cost front, while the absence of considerable legal expenses is positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Selecting the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are unlikely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. Therefore, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement.

630,USB,"When the Federal Reserve had begun quantitative easing (QE) program in November 2008 and lowered the interest rates to near zero, the economy was in a mess with a significantly high unemployment rate, plummeting housing and financial markets, and lower consumer spending. The main goal was to stabilize the economy and spur growth, primarily by revitalizing the banks.With the Fed injecting money into the economy, banks had more money to lend and earn from that. This liquidity infusion also fueled deposit growth. Over the years, major banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) recorded a significant increase in their deposit balances.As the economy was in shambles, lending activity failed to rise significantly. So, the banks were saddled with considerable amount of deposits. But with gradual economic recovery, loan demand improved. Along with this, banks witnessed a rise in deposits. So, they didn’t face much competition for attracting deposits to meet higher demand for loans.As economy has stabilized and there seems to be no need for liquidity support, the Fed is gradually tightening its monetary policy. In December 2015, the central bank raised its interest rates for the first time in a decade. Since then, three more rate hikes have been announced.Given the continued improvement in the economy, interest rate hikes will likely continue. With banks being one of the biggest beneficiaries of higher rates, this will support their revenue growth.Moreover, last month, the Fed announced the timeline for commencing its balance-sheet (currently standing at a whopping $4.5 trillion) normalization program. Banks are likely to benefit from this as well. As the Fed buys back short-term duration securities, the yield curve will become steeper. This, in turn, will result in rise in the yield on long-term bonds and thus banks will gain from improved margin spreads.While everyone is looking at the banks’ benefits from the Fed’s tightening monetary policy, there is a downside to it as well.Increased Competition for DepositsThe Fed’s plan to unwind its balance sheet is expected to result in deposit outflows. Also, as the money supply in the economy will reduce, lesser amount will get deposited in the banks.Such a scenario will lead to increased competition among banks to attract deposits. Similar sentiments are being echoed by top executives of major banks.William Demchak, chairman and chief executive of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), at an investors’ conference in September noted that competition for customer deposits could increase “partly as a result of the Fed draining cash out of the system by shrinking its balance sheet.”Earlier in July at second quarter earnings conference call, U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) chief financial officer Terrance Dolan said “…as excess liquidity comes out of the market you could expect to see and you will expect to see more competition with respect to deposits.”Competition will likely be more intense for wholesale deposits — those coming from institutional clients and large companies.Also, as the rise of online banking has made it easier from customers to switch banks and with the Fed expected to further increase interest rates, it will become easy for banks to offer higher rates on deposits. For customers stuck with persistently low deposit rates till now, banks providing higher rates on savings account will become more attractive.Nevertheless, with economy improving gradually, deposits are expected to rise as well. Specifically, retail deposits are expected to rise driven by higher rates on deposits.Overall, deposits are expected to continue increasing given the economic growth, though the pace of rise is likely to be slower compared with the QE period.Of the above-mentioned major banks, JPMorgan, BB&T, Bank of America, PNC Financial and Citigroup carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance in its just-concluded September meeting was the primary reason for increased investors’ optimism for banks.While the downsizing of balance sheet was expected, what surprised the market was the Fed signaling four more rate hikes over the next 12 months. With banks being one of the main beneficiaries of the interest rate hikes, the stocks moved higher and 10-year Treasury bond yields rose.Moving on to bank specific news, over the last five trading sessions, three major banks announced dividend hikes (as part of their 2017 capital plan). Further, their efforts to move toward digitization to improve efficiency continued.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Sep 15, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

The company’s income from continuing operations per share of $1.27 for the quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.25 per share.Despite earnings beat, investors were a bit disappointed on elevated costs of credit which led shares to decline around 0.45% to close at $66.72.Net income came in at $3.9 billion or $1.28 per share compared with $4.0 billion or $1.24 per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.Overall revenues escalated, driven by higher banking revenues. However, expenses surged. Further, Citigroup’s costs of credit for the second quarter were up 22% year over year to $1.7 billion. The rise largely reflects net credit losses of $94 million and a net loan loss reserve release of $16 million.Higher Banking Revenues, Costs Flare UpRevenues increased 2% year over year to $17.9 billion in second-quarter 2017. The rise highlighted higher revenues in institutional clients group and global consumer banking, partially offset by decline in corporate/other revenues.

Notably, revenues from total banking climbed 13%, partially offset by a 5% decline in total markets & securities services revenues on a year-over-year basis.Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues increased 5% year over year, mainly driven by higher revenues in North America, Latin America and Asia GCB.Corporate/Other revenues were $653 million, plunging 45% from the prior-year quarter. The decline mainly reflected legacy assets runoff and divestiture activity.Operating expenses at Citigroup were slightly up year over year to $10.5 billion. Further, expenses elevated 2% (in constant dollars) on increased volume-related expenses, performance-based compensation and ongoing investments. These were mostly offset by efficiency savings and the winding-down of legacy assets.Strong Balance SheetAt quarter end, Citigroup’s end of period assets was $1.86 trillion, up 2% year over year.

633,USB,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) recently announced a 7.1% hike in its quarterly common stock dividend. The new dividend of 30 cents is scheduled to be paid on Oct 16 to its shareholders on record as of Sep 29. Based on the last day’s closing price of $53.16 per share, the dividend yield is 2.26%.This dividend hike is in line with its 2017 capital plan, which also includes a share repurchase program of up to $2.6 billion for a four-quarter period beginning Jul 1, 2017.But would this dividend hike be able to give the stock a boost?Growth DriversThe company’s liquidity position can be judged from its rising loans and deposits. Over the last five years (ended 2016), loans and deposits have witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.6% and 7.3%, respectively.Further, U.S. Bancorp’s return on equity indicates that it utilizes shareholders’ funds better than the industry.Also, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) have increased 3.14% over the last three to five years. The trend is expected to continue in the near term as well. U.S. Bancorp’s projected EPS growth is 6.43% and 9.35% for 2017 and 2018, respectively.Moreover, U.S. Bancorp’s leverage picture looks encouraging. Its debt/equity ratio of 0.87 compares with 0.88 for the broader industry.ConcernsU.S. Bancorp’s revenues have seen a four-year (ended 2016) CAGR of 2.8%. Given its diverse revenue sources, the growth does not look encouraging.Additionally, the stock looks overvalued based on its price-to-book and price-earnings (F1) ratios, which are above the respective industry averages.In fact the stock has a Value Style Score of C. The Value Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of “value traps” and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount. Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of A or B, when combined with Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our ViewpointU.S. Bancorp’s growth prospects look encouraging based on its healthy balance sheet growth and lower debt burden. Further, projected increase in EPS is also encouraging.However, the stretched valuation limits the stock’s upside potential. Also, the company has not been able to gain analysts’ confidence, as indicated by a stable Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings over the past 30 days. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of U.S. Bancorp have gained 3.5% year to date, underperforming the 7.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report), State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2.PNC Financial’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings was revised slightly upward for 2017, in the past 60 days. Also, its share price has increased 44.7% in the past 12 months.State Street’s current-year earnings estimates were revised 3.6% upward, over the past 60 days. Further, the company’s shares have gained 34.6% in a year.M&T Bank’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings was revised slightly upward, over the last 60 days.

634,USB,"All eyes are currently on the crucial two-day FOMC meeting slated to start today. The central bank is expected to hold rates steady but start shrinking its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet, which is mostly composed of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities purchased until 2014 since recession (read: Asset Rollback Top Priority of Fed: ETFs in Focus).Additionally, investors will be watching Fed’s future course of action on rates hike as the fastest pace of increase in August inflation since spring increased the odds of a rate hike in December. The market is now expecting more than a 50% chance of a December rate hike, up from about 30% chance one week ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.Unwinding of Balance Sheet: Boost to BanksIn June, the Fed laid out plans of reducing bond holdings. So long, it has reinvested the entire proceeds it got from bonds. Now, the Fed will use a cap system every month to execute its roll off plans and reinvest the rest. The central bank has set a roll off target of $10 billion that will increase quarterly until it reaches $50 billion ($30 billion for Treasuries and $20 billion for mortgage-backed securities) a month. The process is likely to continue until the balance sheet reaches about $2-$2.5 trillion.The decision to reverse the Quantitate Easing policy is a step toward monetary tightening and will lower demand for the currency, leaving an adverse impact on global liquidity. The historic move will push long-term rates higher relative to short-term rates and in turn benefit bank stocks. This is because banks seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. With the steep rise in long-term interest rates, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits (read: De-Stress Your Portfolio by Betting on Bank ETFs).Given this, we have highlighted bank ETFs that would likely gain from the Fed’s likely move.SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE  -  Free Report)This fund offers equal weight exposure to 73 banking stocks by tracking the S&P Banks Select Industry Index.

635,USB,"Investors in U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 15th, 2017 $30 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for U.S. Bancorp shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, U.S. Bancorp is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Banks - Major Regional industry that ranks in the Top 43% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three analysts have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 90 cents per share to 88 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about U.S. Bancorp right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

636,USB,"Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of $48.3 billion, up 10.7% year over year. Notably, community banks, constituting 92% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported net income of $5.7 billion, up 8.5% year over year.Banks’ earnings were stemmed by higher revenues and loan growth. On the other hand, expenses flared up and loan loss provisions rose.Banks, with assets worth more than $10 billion, contributed a major part of the earnings in the reported quarter. Though such banks constitute only 1.8% of the total number of the U.S. banks, these accounted for approximately 80% of the industry’s earnings. Leading names in this space include Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report).All the above mentioned banks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Revenues Escalate, Costs Flare UpBanks have been consistently striving to reap profits and are consequently boosting productivity. Around 63.4% of all institutions, insured by the FDIC, reported improvement in quarterly net income, while the remaining recorded a decline in comparison to the prior-year quarter. Additionally, the percentage of institutions reporting net losses for the quarter edged down to 4.1% from 4.6% in the year-ago quarter.The measure for profitability or average return on assets (ROA) inched up to 1.14% from 1.08% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Net operating revenue was $190.5 billion, up 6.1% year over year.  A rise in net interest income, as well as non-interest income, was the driving factor.Net interest income was recorded at $123.7 billion, up 9.1% year over year, driven by rise in interest-bearing assets and net interest margin (NIM). NIM advanced to 3.22% from 3.08% recorded in the year-earlier quarter. It depicts highest average margin for the industry since fourth-quarter 2013.Non-interest income for the banks climbed 1% year over year to $66.8 billion. Increase in servicing income stemmed this rise, mostly offset by lower trading income and reduced gains on asset sales.Total non-interest expenses for the establishments were $108.6 billion in the quarter, up 3.3% on a year-over-year basis. Increase in salary, and employee benefit costs and other non-interest expense led to this rise.Credit Quality a Concern?Overall, credit quality was a mixed bag in the reported quarter. Net charge-offs increased to $11.3 billion, up 11.2% year over year, reflecting the seventh quarterly rise. Notably, higher credit card charge-offs led to this rise.In the reported quarter, provisions for loan losses for the institutions came in at $12.0 billion, up 2.3% year over year. The level of non-current loans and leases decreased 14.5% year over year to $116.6 billion, indicating the 28th decline in non-current loan balances in the last 29 quarters. The non-current rate was 1.23%, reflecting the lowest rate since third-quarter 2007.Strong Loan & Deposit GrowthThe capital position of the banks remained solid. Total deposits continued to rise and were recorded at $13.1 trillion, up 4.6% year over year. Further, total loans and leases were $9.5 trillion, up 3.7% year over year.As of Jun 30, 2017, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance increased to $87.6 billion from $77.9 billion as of Jun 30, 2016. Furthermore, interest earned on investment securities and assessment income primarily led to the growth in fund balance.Less Bank Failures, Shrinking Problem InstitutionsDuring second-quarter 2017, three banks failed, while 62 were merged. As of Jun 30, 2017, the number of ‘problem’ banks declined from 112 to 105, underlining the lowest number in more than seven years and significantly decreased from 888 recorded in first-quarter 2011. Total assets of the ‘problem’ institutions decreased to $17.2 billion from $23.7 billion.Our ViewpointThe decline in the number of problem institutions looks encouraging with the quarter witnessing top-line growth on higher NIM. Banks have been gradually easing lending standards and trending toward higher fees to counter pressure on the top line. In addition, more interest rate hikes will dodge the pressure on interest income. Then, again, consistent expense control and stable balance sheets will likely act as tailwinds in the upcoming quarters.With lingering uncertainty in the economy, we do not see this issue-ridden sector returning to its pre-recession levels anytime soon. What encourages us though is that a lot depends on to what extent Trump lives up to his promises. Bank stocks may be hit hard if he does not deliver on certain policy goals.The Fed’s actions on expediting rate hike – which is again a function of economic growth based on Trump’s policy alterations – will also play a key role in keeping the optimism on bank stocks alive.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

637,USB,"Higher interest income drove Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings which recorded a positive surprise of 4.9%. Earnings of $1.07 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.01 per share.Shares of Wells Fargo decreased more than 2% in the pre-market session, indicating that investors have been bearish on the results. The price reaction during the full-trading session will give a fair idea about the extent of disappointment among investors.Wells Fargo witnessed organic growth aided by strong loans and deposit balances. Higher net interest income was also favorable. In addition, a solid capital position and improving credit quality acted as the key positives. However, higher expenses and lower non-interest income were on the downside.Notably, reserve release of $100 million was recorded in the reported quarter, driven by strong credit performance. Second-quarter net income came in at $5.8 billion, up from $5.6 billion in the prior-year quarter.The quarter’s total revenue was $22.2 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion. Revenues were in line with the prior-year quarter figure.Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, revenue generation at the business segments was impressive. Community Banking and Wealth and Investment Management segments’ total quarterly revenue increased around 1.0% and 7.7%, respectively, while Wholesale Banking revenues declined around 4.5%.Loans and Deposits & Interest Income Rise, Costs EscalateWells Fargo’s net interest income in the quarter came in at $12.5 billion, up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Increased interest income from trading assets, investment securities, loans held for sale and mortgages held for sale, along with higher other interest income, mainly drove results. Further, net interest margin expanded 4 basis points year over year to 2.90%, reflecting a rising interest rate environment.Non-interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around $9.7 billion, down 7% year over year, primarily due to low mortgage banking revenue, lower net gains from trading activities and debt securities, along with reduced other income.As of Jun 30, 2017, total loans were $957.4 billion, up slightly year over year. Growth in commercial loan portfolio contributed to the rise, partially offset by reduction in consumer loan portfolio. Total deposits were $1.3 trillion, up 4.8% from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expense at Wells Fargo was $13.5 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from higher FDIC and other deposit assessments, as well as elevated other and employee benefits and salaries expenses.The company’s efficiency ratio of 61.1% was above 58.1% recorded in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability.Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo’s credit quality metrics improved in the quarter. Allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $12.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, down 4.7% year over year.Provision for credit losses was $555 million, plunging 48.3% year over year. Net charge-offs were $655 million or 0.27% of average loans in the reported quarter, down 29.1% from the year-ago quarter net charge-offs of $924 million (0.39%). Non-performing assets were down 25.2% to $9.8 billion in the quarter under review from $13.1 billion in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position. In the reported quarter, the company repurchased 43 million shares of common stock.Wells Fargo’s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III (fully phased-in) increased to $151.9 billion from $145.6 billion in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.6% under Basel III (fully phased-in) as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with 10.6% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Book value per share increased to $36.53 from $35.38 in the comparable period last year.Our ViewpointWells Fargo reported decent revenue numbers and we expect top-line headwinds to subside, given the improving interest rate environment. However, escalating expenses remained a major drag, along with slowdown in mortgage business.Cross-selling, which has been the company’s major strength in recent years, drew regulators’ attention as they discovered that thousands of bank employees were unlawfully enrolling consumers for products and services without their knowledge or consent, in order to receive incentives for meeting the sales targets. The bank has also been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.Nevertheless, we believe that over the long term, investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo, given its diverse geographic and business mix, which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth. We also believe that strategic acquisitions and the bank’s efforts to address current adversities will help the company expand its business and enhance profitability.Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteCurrently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

638,USB,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. Though most banks which reported second-quarter 2017 results this week managed to beat estimates, concerns over the underlying weakness shadowed the optimism.Results demonstrated an upswing in loans and improved margins. However, lower treasury yields curbed the benefits. Additionally, rise in deposit balances and lower provisions driven by reserve releases in the Oil & Gas loan portfolio were impressive.Investment banking fees were favorable, but fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Also, higher funding costs and decline in mortgage origination volume were on the downside.Though the absence of exceptionally high legal expenses was a big support, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jul 14, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1. Rising interest rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.82 per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57.

The figure was 12% higher than the prior-year quarter.Sequential decline in net interest margin (owing to lower treasury yields during the quarter) and decline in mortgage banking fees were headwinds. Further, a slight rise in expenses and fall in trading revenues (as expected) acted as negatives. However, increase in investment banking fees more than offset these and partially aided fee income growth during the quarter.The quarter witnessed modest loan growth, which helped in improving interest income. Additionally, provision for credit losses recorded a fall. (Read more: BofA's Q2 Earnings Top on Investment Banking, Loans)5. Riding on higher revenues, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
