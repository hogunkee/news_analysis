0,HBAN,"The Dow Jones industrials rose 0.5% in late-afternoon trading and look poised for a fifth straight advance in six sessions Tuesday, even as U.S. interest rates climbed sharply. Superregional banks took the lead, rising 1.8% as a group.X But certain medical names also flexed strength; stocks in IBD's Medical-Research Equipment/Services and Medical-Diversified industry groups also romped higher with similar-sized gains.But the top industry group performance belongs to oil and gas royalty trusts (up 2.3%) and Canadian oil explorers (up 2.1%) with roughly an hour to go in the regular session. U.S. crude oil prices continue to swing back up after a sell-off on Jan. 5, with near-term futures up 1.4% to $62.60 a barrel, the highest level since 2015.The Nasdaq composite lagged, rising 0.2%; the S&P 500 gained 0.3% despite another harsh sell-off in certain utility stocks, particularly in water supply and diversified utilities.The Dow utility average dropped 0.9%; the Dow transports rallied 0.3%, stretching its year-to-date gain to 3.9%.Despite the mild gains, breadth was slightly negative on the NYSE, as losing stocks edged winners by more than 200 issues. On the Nasdaq, winners and losers were roughly equal. Volume is running mildly higher vs. the same time on both main exchanges.SVB Financial (SIVB), a Silicon Valley-based lender, is part of IBD's super regional banking industry group, and shares in the stock market today added nearly 2% to 248.14 and new highs.SVB Financial entered Leaderboard on Nov. 30, trading around 227 at the time. The stock is now extended after clearing a narrow pullback that offered an extra entry point at 223.92.The ideal buy point was triggered on Oct. 26, when the stock lifted past a 191.48 entry in a saucer with handle. The next day, shares soared more than 12% in vigorous volume on an excellent third quarter (earnings up 32% to $2.79 a share, revenue up 22% to $544 million).SVB is one of just three superregionals that sport a Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup of 90 or higher. The other two are Comerica (CMA) (91 Comp) and Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) (90).Target (TGT), up nearly 3% to 69.48 in fast turnover,  has formed a bottoming base and could create a new buy point if resistance remains near 70.The discount retailing titan, which reported upbeat same-store sales growth of 3.4% for November and December combined, offered aggressive buy points at both 63.20 and 63.72 within its bottoming base, a bullish pattern after a near-cataclysmic decline.PayPal (PYPL) broke out of a narrow flat base at 79.48 but is stalling. The digital payments expert got as high as 80.39 intraday before gains melted to just 0.4%. But the stock gave follow-on entry points in December as it rebounded back above the 50-day moving average.Meanwhile, Bitcoin-related ETFs traded rather calmly.The Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) lost just 1.5% to 2,172.60. Quiet price moves in low volume are ideal right now for the hot alternative currency-tracking vehicle. The 50-day moving average continues to rise and play catch-up.Money continued to flow out of U.S. government bonds. The fresh cash may find its way into other asset classes, including equities and commodities such as industrial metals and crude oil.The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note jumped to 2.54%, its highest so far in 2018 and now just 8 basis points below the March 2017 peak of 2.62%.The yield curve continues to be positive, which encourages lending and economic growth.RELATED:What Is The Flat Base, And How Can It Pump Up Gains In Your Stock Portfolio?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Latest Names In IBD LeaderboardDo You Know This Crucial Chart Pattern For Stock Breakouts?How To Find Outstanding Stocks At The Right Time: Follow A Simple Routine

The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each lopped off 1.8%, the worst session for both since the Sept. 9 sell-off that followed comments from Federal Reserve officials that all but assured a rate hike that month.Volume roared, up significantly on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges.The trigger appeared to be news reports that notes by former FBI Director James Comey during a February meeting with President Trump, just after National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had resigned, portrayed the president pressing the director to drop the agency's probe of Flynn. Trump fired Comey on May 9. The White House has so far given conflicting reasons for Comey's firing.Markets in Europe carved out sizable losses, with the CAC 40 in Paris ending down 1.6% and Frankfurt's DAX taking a 1.4% loss.Fiber-optic stocks had some of the day's worst losses. Oclaro (OCLR) tanked 9.5% and Lumentum Holdings (LITE) skidded 8%. Finisar (FNSR) unraveled 9% and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) caved 5.5%.Superregional and investment banks were also hit hard. SVB Financial (SIVB) and SunTrust (STI) shed 6% apiece. So did Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC). Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 5%. Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) and Comerica (CMA) dived 6% apiece.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan (JPM) presented the worst losses among Dow industrials.

10,HBAN,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were slightly lower Wednesday morning in New York, signaling that Tuesday's sell-off heavy losses would continue into Wednesday.Futures for the Dow industrials and S&P 500 index slid about 0.2% vs. fair value, while the Nasdaq 100 lost about 0.3%.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite opened at a new high, led by big-cap techs such as Apple (AAPL) (also a Dow component). But market sentiment reversed amid concerns about President Trump's tax cuts: The Nasdaq composite tumbled 1.8%, the S&P 500 index 1.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average 1.1%, the worst losses of the year. The Dow Jones Transportation Average sank 1.9% to its lowest level since late November. Apple, for its part, reversed from a record high to close down 1.15%, below a recent buy point.There's growing concern on Wall Street that Trump's tax cuts and other parts of his pro-growth agenda could be derailed if the ObamaCare replacement bill falters, perhaps in a planned Thursday House vote. The concern is that Congress could get bogged down with health care, especially with a small GOP Senate majority and Trump's low approval ratings.The Dow and other major averages have soared since Election Day on hopes and expectations that the new president and GOP Congress would make good on his promises.That's hitting financial stocks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) especially hard.Expectations for Trump's agenda have helped bank stocks especially.Not only did stocks sell off on Tuesday, but Treasury yields continued their sharp decline since the Fed's March 15 decision. Worse for banks, the yield curve has flattened significantly recently.JPMorgan Chase tumbled 2.9% and fellow Dow financial Goldman Sachs lost 3.8%. Bank of America plunged 5.8% and Citigroup 2.6%. All are now below their 50-day moving averages.But it's not just the Wall Street giants. Every one of the Bank-Super Regional members is trading below their 50-day line.

11,HBAN,"The rally in regional banks has moderated, but two ETFs that track the industry are using that pause to refresh their charts.The charts of SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT) look like twins, the way they've behaved so similarly. Both have pulled back from highs reached at the start of March and are testing the 50-day moving average.With a bit more of a bounce, both exchange traded funds will be in buy areas. At the moment, the support at the 50-day line is not convincing enough. Watch for shares of both to climb at least one more point, and preferably in above-average volume.No chart reader would dispute that both ETFs were in need of a break. They shot up starting in mid-November on a combination of rising interest rates and President Trump's election. Trump and Republicans are trying to ease banking regulations, and higher rates are widening interest margins for banks.While SPDR Regional Banking has 100 stocks, iShares Regional Banks has about half as many.Still, the two portfolios are similar in terms of the largest holdings. PNC Financial Services (PNC), SunTrust Bank (STI), M&T Bank (MTB), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), Regions Financial (RF), Citizens Financial (CFG) and BB&T (BBT) are top-10 holdings in both funds.The two differ in that iShares Regional Banks has a big stake in U.S. Bancorp (USB) (more than 16% of the portfolio) while the superregional bank doesn't even make the SPDR Regional Banking portfolio.The holdings of SPDR Regional Banking are more spread out, with no single stock accounting for more than 4% of the total weighting.With the Federal Reserve expected to increase interest rates by a quarter-point two more times this year, the fundamental backdrop for regional banks is generally favorable. Higher rates tend to widen the margin between interest earned on loans vs. interest paid on deposits.LPL Financial, for example, had this to say: ""Steepening yield curve, deregulation, expanded credit access, strong fourth quarter 2016 earnings, and positive revisions are all supportive.""But Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, saw an economic warning sign in the banking sector. ""In the U.S., bank loan growth has slowed significantly since Q4 and the Atlanta Fed's GDP nowcast is only indicating 1.2% U.S. growth for the current quarter, compared to over 2.5% as recently as early February."" The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

13,HBAN,"Big banks JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got through the second and final round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests unscathed, resulting in a shareholder-returns bonanza shortly after the test results were announced late Wednesday.But Morgan Stanley's (MS) capital plan only got conditional approval, and U.S. segments of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Santander (SAN) failed once againStill, Morgan Stanley said it will move forward with a 33% quarterly dividend hike to 20 cents and a $3.5 billion buyback. JPMorgan OK'd a $10.6 billion buyback but kept its dividend the same. Bank of America announced a $5 billion repurchase program and a 50% payout increase to 7.5 cents. Citigroup will buy back $8.6 billion in stock and raised its payout to 16 cents from 5 cents.Goldman Sachs (GS) didn't give specifics but said its plan included buybacks and a dividend hike. Wells Fargo (WFC)  kept its capital plans unchanged.Morgan Stanley stock were little changed in pre-market trading on the stock market today after rising late Wednesday JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup climbed 2.4%, Wells Fargo rose and Goldman Sachs all rose fractionally. Deutsche Bank, which the IMF said ""poses the greatest risk to the global financial system,"" sank nearly 4% while Santander fell 2%.Other banks also announced bigger returns to shareholders.The Fed only gave conditional approval to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, in which it projected how it would perform under difficult economic conditions for this year's stress tests. As a result, Morgan must resubmit its capital plan and address broader concerns from the Fed by Dec. 29. If Morgan can't deliver on those promises, the Fed said, its governors ""would expect to object"" to the resubmitted plan, potentially hindering Morgan's shareholder returns.While the Fed did not technically object to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, the central bank said the company ""exhibited material weaknesses in its capital planning process,"" including in governance, modeling and other safeguards.""These weaknesses warrant further near-term attention but do not undermine the quantitative results of the stress tests for the firm,"" the Fed said, referring to the portion of the tests that quantifies what banks' capital levels would look like under financial turmoil.The Fed said Deutsche Bank and Santander, both of which also had their plans rejected last year, had tightened up some aspects of their capital planning methodology but still struggled with ""material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine (the) capital planning process.""The results follow a pattern of stress-test one-upmanship between the banks, which have been shoring up capital since the financial crisis, and the Fed, which has tried harder each year to catch the banks off-guard in the scenarios posed in the tests.While the banks that passed can move forward with their dividend and buyback hikes, tougher standards on the horizon could keep payouts restrained this year. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo warned this month that banks in future tests might have to make a ""significant increase"" in the assets they set aside to cushion against a potential economic crisis.The final round of results from the stress tests -- known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR -- came after all 33 tested banks last week passed the first round of the evaluation, which quantifies how banks' finances would be affected against a barrage of market shocks.The Fed outlined the economic scenarios for both tests at the beginning of the year. In the weeks that followed, the banks submitted their capital plans, which this year forecast how they would do amid 10% unemployment, negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries -- among the conditions in the Fed's worst-case scenario.The first round of test results can serve as a preview of sorts to the second, in which the Fed actually indicates whether it accepted, rejected or had any reservations with the banks' capital plans. If it does have an issue, banks could have to temper plans to issue buybacks and boost dividends in order to pass.The second round of tests contains both a quantitative element and qualitative element. The quantitative element measures banks post-stress-test capital levels and whether they could sustain any new dividend and buyback plans. The qualitative element evaluates the soundness of the banks' capital plans and how they were developed.Analysts largely had not anticipated major problems with the banks' stress-test results.

14,HBAN,"Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) and 27 other banks passed the first round of Federal Reserve stress tests on Thursday, despite losses of $526 billion forecast in the central bank's most dire economic scenario.Investors will now turn their attention to the second round of stress-test results, which the Fed releases Wednesday. Wall Street tends to focus more on that round, as the Fed determines whether the banks' requests for bigger dividends and stock buybacks are reasonable given the impact the firms would sustain under the test scenarios.The Fed said the 33 banks tested this year would sustain $385 billion in loan losses under the 2016 test circumstances, which include a sharp drop in housing prices, 10% unemployment and negative rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries, a notable difference from the tests last year. Consumer loans accounted for 52% of forecast loan losses among the banks, the Fed said.The Fed also noted that its hypothetical conditions were softer on investment banks' profits, but that the negative short-term interest rates were harder hit by the negative rates.""As compared to last year's severely adverse scenario, firms that are active in trading and market activities saw smaller losses in net income as a result of less severe stress in the equity markets, but firms more focused on traditional lending activities were more affected by negative short-term interest rates and greater stress in the real economy,"" the Fed said.Analysts largely expected the banks to get through the first round unscathed, although the Fed could still reject their capital plans next week.Among major banks, Citi came out with the highest Tier 1 common capital ratio -- a way of quantifying banks' most durable assets and the most-watched metric for the tests -- at a 9.2% minimum in the Fed's darkest scenario. Morgan Stanley had 9.1%, Goldman Sachs 8.4%, JPMorgan 8.3%, BofA 8.1% and Wells Fargo 7.2%. The Fed requires at least 5% to pass.Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) came closest to falling short, with a ratio of 5%.JPMorgan rose 1% after hours on the stock market today, Bank of America added 1.7% and Citigroup gained 2.7%, and Wells Fargo edged up 0.6%. Investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, seen as potentially more vulnerable to recent market swings, were up 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively.The Fed first posed the economic scenario to the 33 banks in January. Banks responded with their stress-test results and capital-return plans in April.""Today's results have reaffirmed what we already knew — U.S. banks are strongly capitalized and remain well-positioned to serve as a critical economic driver going forward,"" American Bankers Association CEO Rob Nichols said in a statement following the release of the stress-test results.""Even under the worst imaginable conditions, banks' strong capital positions and solid balance sheets would allow them to continue lending and meeting the needs of their clients, customers and communities.""

"
23,HBAN,"This year, the Fed examined 31 banks, each with assets exceeding $50 billion. All 31 banks passed DFAST last week, which means they met the Fed's minimum capital requirements. It was the first time they all passed since the test's 2009 inception.

And the Fed cited ""numerous and significant deficiencies"" in Deutsche Bank's capital planning.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) boosted their dividends and Morgan approved a new buyback plan, joining other banks that received the Fed's OK of their capital plans.Shares of BofA fell 1% late, while Morgan Stanley rose 2% and Wells Fargo edged up 0.1%.The second round of the exams — the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) — is more stringent than round one, the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST), because it examines banks' abilities to pay dividends, buy back shares and still serve borrowers during times of severe economic distress.This year, the Fed examined 31 banks, each with assets exceeding $50 billion. All 31 banks passed DFAST last week, which means they met the Fed's minimum capital requirements. It was the first time they all passed since the test's 2009 inception.A More Likely Place To TripRound 2 is where banks are more likely to stumble. Michael Corbat, the CEO of Citigroup (C), should be breathing easier, since the New York-based lender passed this year's tests after failing two out of the last three years. Last year's failure resulted in Citi's selling overseas branches as well as selling its consumer finance unit, OneMain Financial, for $4.25 billion.This is the first year Citigroup will be able to boost its dividend since the financial crisis. Corbat and Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach's jobs reportedly were on the line during this year's stress tests. Citi's passage comes as a big win for them. Citi shares rose 3.7% in after-hours trading.HSBC (HSBC) and Zions Bancorp (ZION) failed last year's CCAR but passed this year's exam.Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley met minimum capital requirements on a post-test basis after submitting adjustments.""This is becoming less and less an adversarial process between the organizations,"" said Ernest Patrikis, a former New York Fed official now with the White & Case law firm. ""I think for the banking system as a whole, we should feel a bit better.""Musing Over Board ControlWhile CCAR has become the key test of banks' health since the Great Recession, Patrikis said he'd like to see the day when a bank's board — not the Fed — again has the power to return money to owners. ""Banks should be allowed to have more freedom to raise dividends,"" he said.In addition to the banks listed above, the Federal Reserve had no objections to the plans of Ally Financial (ALLY), American Express (AXP), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), BB&T (BBT), BBVA Compass (BBVA), Bank of Montreal Quebec (BMO), Capital One Financial (COF), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Discover Financial Services (DFS), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings (MTU), Northern Trust (NTRS), PNC Financial Services (PNC), Regions Financial (RF), State Street (STT), SunTrust Banks (STI) and U.S. Bancorp (USB).

It sees upward earnings revisions as the main drivers of stock performance next year.As for large regional banks, KBW likes names that can grow net interest income regardless of the Fed's action on interest rates. It cites two in particular — Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), based in Columbus, Ohio; and Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks (STI).In the small to midcap group, it'll come down to the ""direction of estimates,"" KBW said.

During the four quarters ending Jun 30, 2019, it has also approved a share repurchase of up to $1.85 billion, reflecting its commitment to generate long-term value for shareholders.The board of directors is anticipated to approve a dividend hike and a new share buyback program at its July meeting. The new repurchase program would be replacing the present one.The passage of the company’s capital plan is indicative of its stable capital structure even under stress-test scenarios. This also implies that a planned capital deployment including dividend hikes and share buybacks are viable and acceptable in relation to the regulatory body’s minimum capital requirements. This should further cement investor's confidence in the company.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a strong performance with the bottom line beating estimates by 2.8%. This better-than-expected result carried on its positive earnings streak of from the preceding two quarters. Going forward, we expect the company to continue well with the winning trend, driven by its revenue momentum, a strong direct banking business, soaring card sales volume and an effective capital management.Recently, other companies like American Express Co.

57,HBAN,"On Jun 8, we issued an updated research report on Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report). The company continues to benefit from sound organic and inorganic growth strategies. However, mounting expenses and lack of diversification in loan portfolio remain key concerns.With $104 billion in assets as of Mar 31, 2018, Huntington’s profitability is expected to benefit greatly from the softening of regulations on account of lower compliance costs. Also, its bottom line will get further support from lower tax rates and rising interest rates.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has remained stable, over the last 30 days. As a result, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of Huntington have gained 20.5% in the past year, slightly underperforming the 21.5% growth for the industry.Huntington has witnessed consistent growth in deposit balance over the last few years as it remains focused on achieving the best deposit franchise. Also, loans improved due to its commendable performance in commercial and consumer portfolio. Management predicts average loans and leases to increase in the 4-6% band in 2018 while average deposits are expected to be up 3-5%. We believe the rising tendency in these balances is likely to continue in the quarters ahead with support from improving economic conditions.On the back of its strong liquidity position, Huntington continues to expand through acquisitions. In August 2016, it completed the buyout of Ohio-based FirstMerit Corporation. Management expects the deal to be accretive to earnings per share in 2018. We expect these initiatives to support its top-line growth and help it gain market share, going forward.However, the company’s non-interest expenses saw a CAGR of 13% over the last four years (ended 2017), mostly due to acquisitions and compensation-related expenses. Such consistent rise in costs is likely to deter bottom-line growth.Also, Huntington’s loan portfolio consists of nearly 51% of commercial loans. Such high exposure to commercial loans depicts lack of diversification, which can be risky for the company amid a challenging economy and competitive markets.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the financial space are Associated Banc-Corp (ASB  -  Free Report) sporting Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Farmers National Banc Corp. (FMNB  -  Free Report)  and First Merchants Corporation (FRME  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Associated Banc-Corp’s earnings estimates were revised upward by 11.4% for the current year, in the last 60 days. Also, its share price has jumped 15.4%, over the past six months.Farmers National’s current-year earnings estimates were revised 1.8% upward, over the last 60 days. Further, its shares have rallied 9.1%, in the past six months.First Merchants has witnessed 3.7% upward earnings estimates revision for the current year, in the past 30 days. Moreover, its shares have gained 12.9% in the past six months.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

The company recorded positive earnings surprise of 5.9%.Earnings per share of $1.61 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52. Further, the bottom line compared favorably with $1.35 in the prior-year quarter.Top-line strength was recorded aided by rising rates, higher loan balances and strong fee income.

The quarter witnessed growth in several income categories, partially offset by lower deposit service charges, along with brokerage and trading revenues.Total other operating expenses were $244.4 million, up 3.8% year over year. The upsurge mainly stemmed from higher personnel, and net occupancy and equipment costs, along with elevated net losses and operating expenses of repossessed assets. These were partially offset by lower mortgage banking costs and professional fees.Total loans as of Mar 31, 2018 were $17.3 billion, up 1.8% from the prior-year quarter. As of the same date, total deposits amounted to $22.2 billion, down 1.8% from the year-earlier quarter.Credit Quality ImprovesThe company recorded a benefit of $5 million during the first quarter compared with no provisions for credit losses witnessed in the prior-year quarter.

Leverage ratio was 9.40% compared with 8.89% as of Mar 31, 2017.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the reported quarter, the company repurchased 82.6 million common shares at an average price of $91.83 per share.Our ViewpointBOK Financial’s consistent revenue growth keeps us optimistic about the stock.

59,HBAN,"Huntington Bancshares (HBAN  -  Free Report) appears to be a solid bet right now because of its sound organic and inorganic growth strategies. This Ohio-based bank holding company experienced growth in revenues along with loan and deposit balances, over the last few years. Also, the improving economic backdrop, such as increasing interest rates and tax reform, are likely to further support its financials.Shares of Huntington have gained 12.2% over the past year, outperforming the 6.8% rally for the industry it belongs to.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has remained stable at 89 cents, over the last 30 days.

Management expects total revenues for full-year 2017 to increase 23%.Impressive Balance Sheet Growth: The company’s loans and deposits have witnessed a CAGR of 12.5% and 14%, respectively, over a three-year period (ended 2016). Further, management expects average balance sheet growth to be more than 20%, driven mainly by the FirstMerit acquisition. Also, both loan and deposit balances are likely to get support from an improving economy.Inorganic Growth Prospects: Backed by its robust liquidity position, Huntington is poised to grow via acquisitions.

60,HBAN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Huntington has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Huntington’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Huntington has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.7, so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in future.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management, and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Huntington’s P/CF ratio of 11.6 is lower than the industry average of 19, which indicates that the stock is undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Huntington currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Huntington a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Huntington is just 1.8, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2.2. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, HBAN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Huntington might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of c and a Momentum Score of B. This gives HBAN a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging. The current year estimate has seen two upward and six downward movements in the past two months.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current year estimate has gone lower by 3.3% over the same time frame. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and Consensus Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and Consensus | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineHuntington is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 36% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

65,HBAN,"The projected decline in Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) mortgage business will likely impact its fourth-quarter earnings given significant dependence of its top line on this source. However, this might not lead the company to report dismal results on Jan 12. Benefits of higher rates and loan growth are anticipated to be positive factors.Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues are expected to be low resulting from seasonality that might be eased due to immaterial negative MSR valuation adjustments. Notably, expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment.Here are the other factors influencing Q4 results:Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are expected to be in line on a sequential basis during the fourth quarter. Particularly, weakness in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth will likely be offset by rising consumer loans. However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue into the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Also, the bank is cutting back its auto lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income. Notably, management projects NII to grow in low- to mid-single digits for 2017.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo may record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Wells Fargo anticipates the efficiency ratio to be around 61% in 2017, excluding the $1-billion discrete litigation accrual recorded in third-quarter 2017 and any other non-recurring expenses. Further, the company is targeting around $4 billion of cost savings by 2019. Of the total cost savings target, 21% is expected to be achieved in 2017.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Also, though the company has not providing any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.76%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged over the last seven days and is expected to grow 0.97% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $22.4 billion, up 3.9% year over year. Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 23.

66,HBAN,"Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 21, before the market opens. The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to grow on a year-over-year basis.The company topped earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.3%.In the last quarter, the company lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to elevated expenses and higher provision for credit losses. However, increased revenues along with growth in loan balances were the positives.Huntington’s shares have gained 3.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry’s fall of 1.7%.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteWill the stock be able to maintain this uptrend post second-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to impress the market with the results.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our proven model, Huntington has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +4.35%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Huntington’s Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsRevenues Might Grow: Revenues are likely to increase in line with the company’s long-term financial goals. There are synergies of the FirstMerit acquisition to support.Alleviated Margin Pressure: The latest hike in interest rates might be successful in easing margin pressure to some extent. However, the contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Loan Growth: Though the quarter witnessed slow loan growth due to the lack of any tangible progress on the regulatory reform front, slight growth in loan balances can be witnessed due to the optimism prevailing in the market. Management expects loan growth to be in the range of 4–6% in 2017.Manageable Expenses: Though management remains focused on controlling expenses, we are apprehensive about the company’s continued investments. Huntington anticipates implementing cost savings related to the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation. Also, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements that might impact the firm’s earnings unusually in the to-be-reported quarter.Huntington’s activities during the quarter, however, failed to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 23 cents, over the last seven days.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings in their upcoming releases.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

67,HBAN,"Industrial goods manufacturer Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 21. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2%, beating estimates on three occasions. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors in the Second QuarterDuring the quarter, Honeywell pledged its support yet again for eco-friendly products with the announcement of the start of commercial operations in its new manufacturing plant in Geismar, LA. The facility will manufacture HFO-1234yf, sold commercially as Solstice yf, to meet the increasing demand for this environment friendly air conditioning refrigerant for the auto industry. Honeywell has invested significantly to build this state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which is likely to become the world’s largest producer of Solstice yf. In the process, the company also created several jobs in the area to boost the economic development of the region. With a ramp up in production, 40 million cars are expected to use Solstice yf by the end of 2017, up from its present tally of 20 million. Higher adoption of this refrigerant across the globe is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced by over 30 million cars. With such state-of-the-art products, Honeywell aims to gain a competitive edge over its rivals and augment its revenues.Also, the company inked a definitive agreement to acquire Nextnine, a privately held security management solutions provider for industrial cyber security, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction is likely to augment Honeywell’s cyber security portfolio with complementary products and services. Nextnine’s comprehensive portfolio will also be utilized in Honeywell Connected Plant that facilitates connected plant operations to improve plant availability, safety and reliability quotients.However, Honeywell expects a tepid demand pattern for its business jets and mobile scanners in 2017 due to sluggish global growth, volatility in crude oil prices and a tempered Chinese economy. Consequently, the company projects 2017 revenues to be down 1% to up 2% year over year.Although the company’s proactive restructuring initiatives have positioned it better than many of its peers, it is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets. A change in the U.S. government’s defense and aerospace funding could also adversely impact sales of Aerospace’s defense and space-related products and services. The high research and development costs could also be a drag on the Aerospace segment margin and affect its profitability.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Honeywell is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is  0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the consensus estimate are both pegged at $1.78.

Price and EPS Surprise | Honeywell International Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Honeywell has a Zacks Rank #3.

68,HBAN,"Associated Banc-Corp (ASB  -  Free Report) announced a 7.1% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The new dividend of 15 cents per share will be paid on Mar 15 to shareholders on record as of Mar 1.Based on yesterday’s closing price of $24.25 per share, the dividend yield is 2.47%.The hike comes after the company increased its dividend by 16.7% in October 2017. In fact, given a solid capital and liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital-deployment activities.However, is it worth considering Associated Banc-Corp stock for earning this dividend income?Let’s delve deeper into its financial performance and fundamentals to understand the risk and reward.Revenues: Driven by continued growth in loans, the company’s revenues have witnessed a CAGR of 4.5% over the last five years (2013-2017). Moreover, its projected sales growth of 13.2% and 4.9% for 2018 and 2019, respectively, ensures the continuation of uptrend in revenues.Earnings: Over the last three-five years, the company has witnessed earnings per share (EPS) growth of nearly 6.7%. Also, the company is expected to deliver a strong earnings performance as indicated by its projected EPS growth of nearly 16% for 2018 and 9.3% for 2019.Notably, its acquisition of Whitnell & Co. and Bank Mutual are also expected to be accretive to its 2018 and 2019 earnings, respectively.Valuation: Associated Banc-Corp stock looks undervalued based on its price-to-book (P/B) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. The company currently has a P/B ratio of 1.22 and a P/S ratio of 3.48, which are below the industry averages of 1.57 and 3.49, respectively.Leverage: Associated Banc-Corp has a debt/equity ratio of 1.10, which compares unfavorably with the industry average of 0.45. This indicates that the company has a higher debt burden relative to the industry.Return on Equity (ROE): The company’s ROE of 8.05% is lower than the industry average of 9.43%. This reflects that it is less efficient in utilizing shareholder funds compared with its peers.Expenses: Over the last five years (2013–2017), the company’s expenses have witnessed a CAGR of nearly 1%. The rise has been primarily due to higher personnel costs and FDIC expenses. Moreover, given the company’s efforts to grow inorganically and its continued investment in franchise, expenses are expected to increase further.Share Price Movement: The company’s price performance does not look impressive. Its shares have gained only 2.8% in 2017, underperforming 4.6% growth for the industry it belongs to.Our TakeWhile elevated expenses, a higher debt burden and inferior ROE makes us a little apprehensive about the stock, we believe that it is a wise idea to add the stock to your portfolio now, given its solid earnings and sales growth prospects, and favorable valuation.Moreover, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has also been revised nearly 8% upward over the last 30 days, indicating analysts’ optimism regarding its earnings growth potential. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other stocks in the same space worth considering are Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report), Commerce Bancshares, Inc. (CBSH  -  Free Report) and Enterprise Financial Services Corp (EFSC  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2.

Further, management expects loan growth to be modest on a sequential basis.Pressure on Net Interest Margin (NIM) Might Ease: The latest hike in interest rates might be successful in easing some margin pressure. However, the contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Controlled Expenses: Expenses in the second quarter are usually affected seasonally by personnel/benefits related expenses and variable compensation related to mortgage banking activity. However, it is likely that Citizens Financial’s cost base will remain controlled due to its TOP III Efficiency initiatives.Fee Income to Decline: Fee income might decline in the second quarter as a higher interest rate environment is likely to dampen mortgage banking business. However, improved capital markets are anticipated to be a favorable factor.Activities of Citizens Financial during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 59 cents over the last seven days.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Lazard Ltd.

71,HBAN,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.4% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HBAN due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Huntington Q1 Earnings Meet Estimates, Costs FallHuntington reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 28 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the figure came in higher than the prior-year quarter adjusted earnings of 21 cents.Results were driven by higher revenues and lower provisions. Continued growth in both loan and deposit balances was also recorded. Moreover, lower expenses were the primary tailwinds.Net income jumped nearly 28.3% year over year to $326 million during the quarter.Revenues, Loans & Deposits Rise, Expenses DropThe company’s total revenues on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis came in at $1.09 billion in the quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 billion. However, total revenues were up 3% year over year.Net interest income (NII) came in at $777 million on a FTE basis, up 5% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was driven by an increase in average earnings assets.  Net interest margin (NIM) remained unchanged at 3.30%.Non-interest income inched up 1% year over year to $314 million. The upsurge mainly stemmed from growth in capital-market fees, cards and payment processing income, along with trust and investment-management services.Adjusted non-interest expenses declined slightly to $633 million on a year-over-year basis. The decrease stemmed from a fall in almost all components of expenses, partially offset by rise in personnel costs. Including the impact of certain non-recurring items, non-interest expenses dropped 10% year over year.As of Mar 31, 2018, average loans and leases at Huntington jumped nearly 5% year over year to $70.5 billion. Also, average total deposits inched up 1% to $76.9 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesNet charge-offs were $38 million or an annualized 0.21% of average total loans in the reported quarter, down from $39 million or an annualized 0.24% recorded in the year-ago quarter.Provision for credit losses was down 2.9% on a year-over year basis to $66 million.

Non-interest expenses are expected to be down 2-4%.NIM for 2018 is estimated to remain flat year over year, on a GAAP basis, as expansion in NIM might offset the reduced benefit of purchase accounting. Further, efficiency ratio is projected to be 55-57%.Management predicts average loans and leases to increase in the 4-6% band on an annual basis, while average deposits are expected to be up 3-5%.Overall, asset quality metrics are likely to remain stable with moderate quarterly volatility, given the current low level of problem assets and credit costs.Management anticipates NCOs to remain below the long-term normalized range of 35-55 basis points.The effective tax rate for 2018 is estimated in the range of 15.5-16.5%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

Adjusted non-interest expenses came in at $197.8 million, up 3.8% from the prior-year quarter. Notably, increase in almost all components of expenses led to the rise, partially offset by lower advertising expenses, foreclosed real estate expense and other operating expenses.Adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 57.42%, as compared with 62.25% reported in the year-earlier quarter. A decline in ratio indicates improvement in profitability.Total deposits came in at $26.3 billion, up 4.6% year over year. Total net loans climbed 2.6% year over year to $24.9 billion.Credit Quality Marks ImprovementCredit quality metrics for Synovus improved in the quarter.Net charge-offs plunged 37.7% year over year to $4.3 million.

74,HBAN,"Huntington Bancshares (HBAN  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 28 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the figure came in higher than the prior-year quarter adjusted earnings of 21 cents.Results were driven by higher revenues and lower provisions. Continued growth in both loan and deposit balances was also recorded. Moreover, lower expenses were the primary tailwinds.Net income surged nearly 28.3% year over year to $326 million during the quarter.Revenues, Loans & Deposits Escalate, Expenses DropThe company’s total revenues on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis came in at $1.09 billion in the quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 billion. However, total revenues were up 3% year over year.Net interest income (NII) came in at $777 million on a FTE basis, up 5% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was driven by an increase in average earnings assets.  Net interest margin (NIM) remained unchanged at 3.30%.Non-interest income inched up 1% year over year to $314 million. The upsurge mainly stemmed from growth in capital-market fees, cards and payment processing income, along with trust and investment-management services.Adjusted non-interest expense declined slightly to $633 million on a year-over-year basis. The decrease stemmed from a fall in almost all components of expenses, partially offset by rise in personnel costs. Including the impact of certain non-recurring items, non-interest expense dropped 10% year over year.As of Mar 31, 2018, average loans and leases at Huntington jumped nearly 5% year over year to $70.5 billion.

Non-interest expense is anticipated to be down 2-4%.The NIM for 2018 is estimated to remain flat as compared with the prior year, on a GAAP basis, as expansion in NIM might offset the reduced benefit of purchase accounting. Further, efficiency ratio is projected at 55-57%.Management predicts average loans and leases to increase in the 4-6% band on an annual basis, while average deposits are expected to be up 3-5%.Overall, asset quality metrics are likely to remain stable with moderate quarterly volatility, given the current low level of problem assets and credit costs.Management anticipates NCOs to remain below the long-term normalized range of 35-55 basis points.The effective tax rate for 2018 is estimated in the range of 15.5-16.5%.Our ViewpointHuntington reported an encouraging quarter. The company, which has a solid franchise in the Midwest, is focused on capitalizing on its growth opportunities. Furthermore, it exhibits consistent efforts in increasing loan and deposit balances, aiding revenue growth. Additionally, we remain optimistic about the company’s several strategic actions, including acquisitions and consolidation of branches.Further, declining costs and stable credit metrics act as tailwinds for its financials. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteCurrently, Huntington carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.The company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It topped earnings in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 19.6%.In the last quarter, the company delivered in line earnings driven by increase in net interest income and lower provisions. However, lower non-interest income was an undermining factor.Looking at the price performance, Fifth Third’s shares have gained 3.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Banks – Major Regional industry’s decline of 1.7%.Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | Fifth Third Bancorp QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our proven model, Fifth Third has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +2.38%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Fifth Third’s Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsExpenses Might Remain Flat: Fifth Third’s ongoing strategic investments in several areas, including technology, will increase expenses. However, the company might be successful in offsetting these factors through its North Star initiatives.Sluggish Loan Growth: Impacted by uncertainties related to the proposed reforms by President Trump, overall loan growth is anticipated to be slow for the to-be-reported quarter. This might curb net interest income growth driven by improved interest rate scenario.Alleviated Pressure on Net Interest Margin: The interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in Mar 2017, followed by another in Jun 2017, should ease some margin pressure. However, contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Fifth Third’s activities during the quarter were, however, inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 42 cents, over the last seven days.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

78,HBAN,"Huntington Bancshares (HBAN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.The company’s first-quarter results are expected to reflect the support from robust organic growth and benefits of strategic moves.Rising interest rates might have worked in favor too. Though flatter yield curve offsets the benefits to some extent, pressure on Huntington’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the rate hikes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 billion for revenues indicates a 5.5% year-over-year improvement.Huntington has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 2.1%. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteLast quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues, continual growth in both loan and deposit balances, and lower provisions were among the positives. However, elevated expenses were the primary headwind.Activities of Huntington during the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained unchanged at 28 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year jump of 33.3%.Notably, Huntington’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 3.7% for the three-month period ended Mar 31, 2018, outperforming 2.7% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post first-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our proven model, we cannot conclusively predict if Huntington will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.77%.Zacks Rank: Huntington currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsRevenues to Grow: Revenues are expected to grow in line with the company’s long-term financial goals, including synergies from the FirstMerit acquisition.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — might perk up interest income. Notably, management’s projections of 2018 NIM to remain flat year over year on a GAAP basis as expansion in NIM is anticipated to offset the reduced benefit of purchase accounting is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well.Credit Quality to Normalize: Overall, credit quality is expected to remain at the current levels. However, in the quarter to be reported, moderate volatility can be recorded given the reduction in problem assets and credit costs, and volatility in the commodities and currency market. Notably, loan loss provisions are likely to gradually normalize and net charge-offs might remain below the long-term target range of 35-55 basis points.Expenses under Control: Though management remains focused on expense management, we remain apprehensive due to the company’s continued investments in business. However, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements that might impact the firm’s earnings unusually in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company projects non-interest expenses to be down 2-4% in 2018, the impact of which is likely to reflect in the first-quarter results.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) is +1.38% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

80,HBAN,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, revenue synergies from the First Niagara deal (completed in Aug 2016) and lower provision for credit losses helped KeyCorp outpace the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher operating expenses were a headwind.Analysts seem to be optimistic about KeyCorp’s prospects as the company’s second-quarter earnings estimates increased 3% in the last 30 days. The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history, delivering an average beat of 2.1% in the trailing four quarters.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteDriven by the strong fundamentals, the company’s share price increased 5.4% in the three months ended Jun 30, 2017, outperforming the Zacks categorized Major Banks industry’s rally of 4%.Will the stock’s rally continue post second-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict that KeyCorp will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it does not have right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 34 cents.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsImproving rates should support net interest income (NII) growth: During the quarter, loan demand improved moderately. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. This, coupled with higher interest rates should lead to NII growth.Modest non-interest income growth: We believe KeyCorp’s second-quarter non-interest income will be positively impacted by increasing investment banking income, driven by slightly higher debt placement fees. However, mortgage production is expected to be relatively weak during the quarter.Decline in expenses should support profitability: KeyCorp has been consistently streamlining operations, diversifying products and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. This is expected to keep overall expenses (excluding merger related charges) manageable. Also, management expects cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal to support bottom line marginally.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming announcements.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

Also, the figure compares favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 35 cents. The reported quarter’s earnings excluded acquisition related costs in connection with the Bank Mutual deal.Results benefited primarily from an improvement in revenues and absence of provision for credit losses. The company also witnessed growth in loans and deposits. However, rise in expenses was a headwind.After considering the acquisition related costs, net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $67.1 million, up from $53.9 million registered in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses IncreaseNet revenues for the quarter were $300.3 million, up 15% year over year. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $292.5 million.Net interest income was $209.9 million, reflecting an increase of 16% from the year-ago quarter. Net interest margin (NIM) was 2.92%, up 8 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest income totaled $90.4 million, up 13% year over year. The rise was driven by an increase in almost all income components. Notably, the quarter witnessed net asset losses of $107 million.Non-interest expenses were $213 million, increasing 23% from the year-ago period. The rise was primarily due to an increase in all components of expenses except net foreclosure/OREO expenses.Efficiency ratio (fully tax equivalent basis) increased to 69.60% from 64.89% in the prior-year quarter. Rise in efficiency ratio indicates deterioration in profitability.As of Mar 31, 2018, net loans were $22.6 billion, up 10% sequentially. Total deposits increased 5% from the prior-quarter end to $23.8 billion.Credit Quality: Mixed BagTotal non-performing assets declined 15% year over year to $232.6 million.

Also, return on average tangible common equity was 11.99% compared with 11.07% in the year-ago quarter.Our TakeAssociated Banc-Corp is well poised to benefit from higher interest rates and rise in loan demand. Also, the acquisition of Diversified Insurance, Bank Mutual and Whitnell are expected to aid its bottom-line growth in the future. However, continuously increasing expenses might hurt profitability. Also, the company's increased dependence on commercial loans remains a key near-term concern.Associated Banc-Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Associated Banc-Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Associated Banc-Corp QuoteAssociated Banc-Corp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

83,HBAN,"Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 23, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.The company’s fourth-quarter results are expected to be supported by robust organic growth and benefits from the FirstMerit acquisition (completed in Aug 2016).Rising interest rates might have worked in favor too. Though flatter yield curve offsets the benefits to some extent, pressure on Huntington’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 billion for revenues indicates a 3.3% year-over-year improvement.Huntington has a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed the earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.4%.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteLast quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues, continual growth in both loan and deposit balances, and lower provisions were among the positives. However, higher net charge-offs were the primary headwind.Activities of Huntington during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings has remained stable at 26 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 8.3%.Notably, Huntington’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 14.4% in the past six months, outperforming the 12.3% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our proven model, we cannot conclusively predict if Huntington will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because, it doesn’t have the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Huntington currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsRevenues Might Grow: Revenues are likely to improve in line with the company’s long-term financial goals, supported by synergies from the FirstMerit acquisition. Also, increasing net interest margin and a decent loan growth during the quarter will enhance net interest income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $93.9 billion reflects 1.1% sequential growth.Further, management expects the total revenue for 2017 to grow about 23% year over year.Expenses Likely to Increase: Management believes that all the cost savings related to the acquisition of FirstMerit have been achieved in the last quarter. They have now shifted their focus to revenue growth that is likely to push up expenses in this quarter. For full-year 2017, the company expects the non-interest expense growth to be nearly 13%.Credit Quality Might Deteriorate: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for allowance for loan and lease losses of $686 million shows a 1.6% increase from the last quarter. Also, net charge-offs are projected to be $43.1 million, reflecting a marginal sequential increase.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for Legg Mason, Inc.

However, lower treasury yields may curb the positive effect to some extent.Decline in Fee Income: Fee income might be affected by dismal global M&A activities in the quarter. Further, a higher interest rate environment might have affected its mortgage banking business.  Expenses to Trend Higher: Expenses might trend upward in the upcoming release due to digitization and investments in technology.

Improvement in both net interest income and non-interest income drove the better-than-expected results. However, higher operating expenses remained a headwind.In fact, BB&T boasts a decent earnings surprise history, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.8%.However, the company’s activities in the second-quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings has remained stable at 77 cents.Moreover, despite an improving operating environment and increasing interest rates, BB&T’s price performance has not been impressive.

The company expects the March rate hike to lead to an increase in core NIM by 2–4 basis points on a sequential basis.Revenues to Improve Slightly: There was a modest improvement in loan demand in the quarter. The company projects average loans to grow 1–3% sequentially, driven by improvement in commercial, specialized and retail loan portfolios.

Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, BNY Mellon’s adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A rise in revenues and provision benefits were offset by an increase in expenses and, lower foreign exchange and other trading revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents has remained stable over the last seven days in the absence of any estimate revisions.Also, BNY Mellon does not have a very impressive earnings surprise history.

However, we also need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsWe believe that the Mar 2017 rate hike should have had a positive impact on BNY Mellon’s margin in the second quarter. Moreover, management was of the opinion that any future rate hikes will lead to further improvement in margin. Based on this expectation, we believe the June rate hike to have a slight positive impact on margin in the quarter.The company believes that improving margins will more than offset the impact of reduced size of balance sheet, thus a modest increase in net interest revenue is expected in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company expects NIR to increase nearly 2–4% on a sequential basis.On the expense front, management expects legal and professional expenses to be slightly higher in the quarter due to ongoing compliance costs.

87,HBAN,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 16. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.The improving economic backdrop — stronger GDP growth, rise in consumer spending and increasing business spending — is likely to support Comerica’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $812.8 million for the fourth quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 12.6%.Further, management’s positive outlook for 2018 on the back of lower taxes and expectations of loan growth might lead the stock to new highs.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.Comerica’s third-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to a fall in expenses and higher revenues. It had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by lower loan balance and provision for loan losses.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history.

This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Comerica’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have remained stable over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.21 reflects growth of 31.5% year over year.Factors to Drive the ResultsNet Interest Income to Rise: Comerica’s net interest income is likely to improve in the to-be-reported quarter, supported by expanding net interest margin and decent loan growth during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $66.4 billion reflects a marginal sequential growth.Higher Fee Income: Trend of consumer spending was strong during the fourth quarter, which is likely to boost Comerica’s non-interest income. Also, the improvement of investment banking and equity markets might lend further support. However, poor mortgage activity during the quarter is likely to partially offset the positive.Effective Cost Saving Initiatives: Expenses might continue to trend down in the upcoming release due to the company’s GEAR Up expense savings initiatives. However, costs are likely to be affected slightly by the tax overhaul.Credit Quality Might Improve: With the improvement in oil prices during the quarter, normalization of credit metrics is likely to continue.

88,HBAN,"With a view to trim costs and enhance the quality of customer service, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is making plans to merge corporate and investment banks. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Citing people familiar with the matter, the journal reported that the bank’s restructuring move is likely to result in job cuts in industry coverage, advising, equity and debt capital along with corporate-level relationship managerial positions.Since news of the fake account scandals broke out, a lot of employees at Wells Fargo have been laid off. In July 2017, the company had removed about 70 senior executives from their posts. Some of the employees had moved to lower level positions while some preferred to shift to a new company.Furthermore, in its annual filing, Wells Fargo disclosed that it overcharged customers in its investment and fiduciary services business.  Also, the company said the review process of the Wealth and Investment Management segment is in “preliminary stages”.Due to the review conducted on the bank’s operations and staff level adjustments, some positions of Wells Fargo’s senior and junior level employees across credit sales and trading areas are likely to be affected. Per the newspaper, layoffs due to the review are not linked with Wells Fargo’s integration plans.We believe that Wells Fargo’s bottom-line growth is likely to be affected by legal hassles in the near term. However, the bank’s efforts to revamp its financial position along with support from lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Wells Fargo’s shares have lost 3.4% over the past six months against the 5.7% growth for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward estimate revision of nearly 1% in the last 30 days.

89,HBAN,"Navient Corporation (NAVI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, after the market closes. Both revenues and earnings are expected to decline on a year-over-year basis.The company boasts a weak surprise history. Navient lagged earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 2.5%.In the prior-year quarter, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate mainly due to lower net interest income. However, lower provision for credit losses and reduced expenses were the tailwinds.Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Navient Corporation QuoteFactors to Influence Q2 ResultsExpenses Likely to Increase: The company’s aim to defend itself against the student loan misconduct case filed against it is likely to increase legal expenses.Easing Margin Pressure: Owing to the recent interest rate hikes, we expect margin pressure to ease in the second quarter. However, lower treasury yields might offset the benefit slightly.Benefits from New Acquisitions of Student Loans: The student loans market has turned into one of the biggest consumer debt markets of the nation. Though conditions in the financial markets have been challenging lately, Navient’s seeks to acquire student loan portfolios, both Federally Guaranteed Student Loans as well as Private Education Loans, such as JPMorgan’s educational loan portfolio. These consistent efforts should lend some support to the quarterly results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Navient will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key components. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Navient is -2.38%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 41 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Navient currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Further, for the to-be-reported quarter, the analysts have also depicted a pessimistic stance on Navient. In the last seven days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate has declined 2.3%.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks worth considering in the finance space, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

90,HBAN,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 19, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict an earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   The company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, aided by growth in net interest income and non-interest income. Further, the quarter recorded a rise in loan and deposit balances. However, on the down side, the quarter witnessed elevated expenses and higher provisions.Notably, U.S. Bancorp delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.55%.U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 1% for the three-month period (ended Jun 30, 2017), underperforming growth of 4.0% recorded by Zacks categorized Banks – Major Regional industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to U.S. Bancorp’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:U.S. Bancorp doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for U.S. Bancorp is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 84 cents. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: U.S. Bancorp’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsExpenses to Trend Higher: Expenses might trend upward in the upcoming release due to digitization and investments in technology. Moreover, costs are expected to be seasonally higher in the to-be-reported quarter.Pressure on Net Interest Margin to Ease Slightly: Though the lingering low-rate environment has taken a toll on the bank’s margins for the past several years, the Fed’s recent rate hike for the fourth time, since the financial crisis, and its commitment to raise rates faster (one more time) this year, based on a convincing pace of economic growth, will likely help banks get rid of shrinking margins further. However, lower treasury yields during the quarter might curb margin improvement.Top-line Growth: It is anticipated that an improving economy will spur consumer activity, which will help both payments businesses and consumer lending businesses. An improved economic backdrop should also lead to a rise in business spending on development and capital investments. Further, mortgage revenue is projected to improve sequentially.Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans (C&I) are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.Management expects commercial loan growth to improve on a sequential basis. Credit card, mortgage and auto loan growth is likely to be stronger due to seasonality.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter declined 1.2% to 84 cents over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

91,HBAN,"The U.S. banking sector has been the center of attraction for quite some time now due to the favorable turn of events since Trump took office. Moreover, continual rise in interest rates and lower commercial tax rate are likely to further boost profitability of the banks.In addition, prospects of relieving banks from some of the stringent requirements of Dodd-Frank Act has made them optimistic of future earnings growth and raised investors’ sentiments greatly.Also, the lending scenario is expected to receive a push from the tax reform while the Fed’s moves will keep increasing competition for deposits in the months ahead. Thus, keeping the above factors in mind, it is likely that the momentum in banking stocks will continue.We are considering two such banks that are well poised to benefit from the improving economic backdrop — Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) and TCF Financial Corporation (TCF  -  Free Report).With a market cap of $16.2 billion, Huntington offers full-service commercial and consumer banking services, mortgage banking services, equipment leasing, investment management along with trust and brokerage services. TCF Financial provides retail banking, commercial banking services, commercial leasing and equipment finance along with commercial inventory finance services and has a market cap of about $3.8 billion.Both Huntington and TCF Financial carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wondering which is a better pick? As both the stocks are part of the same industry, we have considered their underlying strength and growth prospects  to determine which one is a better investment choice.Price PerformanceOver the past year, shares of TCF Financial have soared 35.9% compared with 11.4% gain for Huntington. While both the stocks have outperformed industry’s growth of 10.1%, TCF Financial clearly steals the show. Dividend YieldA dividend yield informs investors how much income they are receiving in relation to the price of the stock. Huntington has a current dividend yield of 2.97% while TCF Financial has a dividend yield of 2.64%.Although both the stocks’ dividend yield is better than the industry’s average of 1.97%, shareholders of Huntington gain more. Leverage RatioLeverage ratio helps provide insight on the financial health of the banks. The debt/equity ratio of both, Huntington (0.94) and TCF Financial (0.52), is more than the industry’s average (0.43).Hence, TCF Financial has an edge here.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12 months for Huntington and TCF Financial is 12.12% and 9.85%, respectively. Both the stocks are more efficient than their peers as the ROE for the industry is 9.30%, Huntington seems to be better positioned in terms of reinvesting its earnings when compared with TCF Financial. ValuationHuntington has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.12 and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio of 9.99, with a Value Score of C. TCF Financial has a P/E ratio of 13.05 and P/CF ratio of 7.52, with a Value Score of B. Both the stocks seem to be undervalued when compared with the averages of 13.78 for P/E ratio and 14.24 for P/CF ratio.However, TCF Financial seems to be at an advantage here due to a favorable Value Score. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Earnings Estimate Revisions & Growth ProjectionsFor Huntington, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share currently stands at $1.21 for 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 36%. For TCF Financial, earnings for the current-year are projected to jump 41.7% year over year to $1.70.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings of Huntington and TCF Financial has increased nearly 1%, over the last 60 days.Thus, we find this round to be biased toward TCF Financial.Sales GrowthFor Huntington, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $4.58 billion for 2018, reflecting 6.3% rise from the prior year.For TCF Financial, the consensus estimate for sales stands at $1.43 billion, indicating growth of 3.8% year over year.Therefore, Huntington has a lead on this aspect.ConclusionOur comparative analysis indicates that TCF Financial is positioned better than Huntington when considering price performance, leverage ratio, favorable valuation and earnings growth expectations. Huntington wins on sales growth projections, reinvesting potential and dividend yield.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

92,HBAN,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18.Hurt by higher expenses, Goldman’s first-quarter 2017 results recorded a negative earnings surprise of 4.3%. Further, the bottom line witnessed significant deterioration on a year-over-year basis. Results were primarily affected by lower equities revenues. However, higher underwriting fees were a tailwind. Notably, the quarter witnessed political uncertainty, reduced levels of volatility and low client activity levels.This earnings miss translated into deteriorating price movement for the company. Over the last six months, shares of Goldman declined 5.7%.Will the decline in stock price continue post second-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to beat on earnings this time. Notably, Goldman has recorded positive earnings surprise in three of the last four trailing quarters.Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) QuoteOur quantitative model doesn’t call for an earnings beat this time around. A stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at $3.51. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Goldman’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further lowers the predictive power of ESP. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsMarket Volatility: Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. Therefore, the company is likely to be affected by the persistent market swings experienced during the quarter.Top-line Headwinds: Trading revenues are expected to decrease year over year, mainly due to low volatility in both the bond and equity markets. The prior-year quarter’s trading results were quite unusual across the industry, with Brexit being the main driver. Apart from this, the global M&A activity remained dismal. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As globally fell during the quarter. Debt underwriting was soft as well. Also, overall investment banking income is likely to witness a decline, however improvement in equity underwriting is anticipated.Pressure on Net Interest Margin (NIM) Might Ease: The prolonged low-rate environment has been taking a toll on the bank’s margins for the past several years. However, the Fed’s recent rate hike for the fourth time, since the financial crisis, and its commitment to raise rates faster (one more time) this year, based on a convincing pace of economic growth, is likely to help banks get rid of shrinking margins. However, lower treasury yields during the quarter might curb margin improvement.Strong Expense Management: Goldman completed an expense initiative during the first half of 2016 which translated into run-rate expense savings of around $700 million. Further, the company continued those efforts in the second half of 2016 and generated nearly $900 million of run-rate savings. It is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. Thus, continuation of expense management is likely to aid bottom-line expansion in the coming quarters.Notably, this banking giant’s performance was inadequate to win analysts’ confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate decreased 5.4% to $3.51, over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +4.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

93,HBAN,"On Jan 5, we issued an updated research report on Huntington Bancshares (HBAN  -  Free Report). The company’s strategic initiatives including expansion moves are likely to bolster revenue growth. Also, a robust liquidity position along with growth in loans and deposits is expected to drive its long-term growth.However, bottom-line growth remains affected due to consistently increasing costs. Further, significant exposure to commercial loans may pose a threat for the company.Huntington is well-positioned to expand via acquisitions. In August 2016, the company completed the acquisition of Ohio-based FirstMerit Corporation. Prior to that, in April 2015, Huntington completed the acquisition of Australia-based Macquarie Equipment Finance, Inc. It also announced the opening of additional 43 in-store Meijer branches in Michigan. In 2014, the company acquired Camco Financial and 24 branches in Michigan from the Bank of America Corp. We believe that such efforts will help the company gain significant market share and thereby enhance its profitability in the long run.Moreover, the company is focused on acquiring the industry's best deposit franchise. Huntington’s total average deposits recorded a 3-year CAGR of 14.0% in 2016. Further, driven by strong performance in the commercial and consumer portfolio, total average loan balance recorded a 3-year CAGR of 12.5% in 2016. The increasing trend in average deposits and loan balances continued in the first three quarters of 2017 as well. We believe that both loan and deposit balances are poised to grow in an improving economy.Driven by such initiatives, analysts are optimistic about the prospects of the company. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being increased 2.8% over the last 30 days. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 10.1% in 2017 compared with 4.6% rise of its industry.On the flip side, Huntington’s consistently increasing cost base has been hurting the bottom-line growth to some extent. Following a volatile trend in 2013, non-interest expenses rose 7%, 6% and 24% during 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The uptrend continued in first nine months of 2017, primarily driven by the FirstMerit acquisition. Notably, in July 2014, Huntington initiated organizational actions in order to trim down non-interest expense and enhance productivity. However, a continued uptrend in expenses is likely to limit profitability and operational efficiency of the company.Also, majority of Huntington’s loan portfolio, nearly 51% as of Sep 30, 2017, comprises total commercial loans (commercial and business lending as well as commercial real estate lending). Such high exposure to commercial loans depicts lack of diversification which can be risky for the company amid challenging economy and competitive markets.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space are Enterprise Financial Services Corp (EFSC  -  Free Report), Civista Bancshares (CIVB  -  Free Report) and MainSource Financial Group , each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

94,HBAN,"Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market. The companies that put emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage, as strong sales are generally converted into growth.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings while assessing the growth of a business. This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability to generate more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base.Stable or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company and offers limited scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without solid top-line growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires robust sales growth.However, sales growth in isolation doesn’t indicate much about a company’s future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits.Therefore, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Roanoke, VA, Advance Auto Parts, Inc.

Adjusted earnings per share of 41 cents in the quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. Also, the figure represents an increase of 21% from the prior-year quarter.Results benefited primarily from an improvement in net interest income and absence of provision for loan losses. The company also witnessed growth in deposits.

Lower net mortgage banking fees and investment securities gains as well as net asset loss were the primary reasons for the decrease.Non-interest expenses were $181.7 million, increasing 2% from the year-ago period. The rise was primarily due to higher business development and advertising expenses, net foreclosure/OREO expenses, and legal and professional fees expenses.Efficiency ratio (fully tax equivalent basis) increased to 65.45% from 63.90% in the prior-year quarter. Note that a rise in efficiency ratio indicates deterioration in profitability.As of Dec 31, 2017, net loans were $20.5 billion, down nearly 1% sequentially.

96,HBAN,"Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 26 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the figure came in higher than the prior-year quarter adjusted earnings of 24 cents. The reported earnings figure excludes Federal tax reform-related estimated tax benefit of 11 cents per share.Results were driven by higher revenues and lower provisions. Continued growth in both loan and deposit balances was also recorded. However, elevated expenses were the primary headwinds.Including one-time adjustments, net income surged nearly 80.8% year over year to $432 million during the quarter.For full-year 2017, net income was $1.19 billion or $1.00 per share compared with $712 million or 70 cents per share in the prior year.

Moreover, the figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.3 billion.The company’s total revenues on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis came in at $1.12 billion in the quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 billion. Moreover, total revenues were up 4% year over year.Net interest income (NII) came in at $771 million on a FTE basis, up 5% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was driven by an increase in average earnings assets, along with an expansion of 5 basis points (bps) in net interest margin (NIM), to 3.30%.Non-interest income climbed 2% year over year to $340 million. The upsurge was mainly due to growth in capital markets fees and other income.Adjusted non-interest expense inched up 1% year over year to $633 million. The increase stemmed from rise in personnel costs, deposit and other insurance expense, professional services costs and other expenses. Including the impact of certain non-recurring items, non-interest expense dropped 7% year over year.As of Dec 31, 2017, average loans and leases at Huntington jumped nearly 4% year over year to $68.9 billion. Also, average total deposits ascended 1% year over year to $77.7 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet charge-offs were $41 million or an annualized 0.24% of average total loans in the reported quarter, down from $44 million or an annualized 0.26% recorded in the year-ago quarter.Provision for credit losses was down 13.3% on a year-over year basis to $65 million. In addition, total non-performing assets totaled $389 million as of Dec 31, 2017, down from $481 million as of Dec 31, 2016.However, the quarter-end allowance for credit losses, as a percentage of total loans and leases, increased to 1.11% from 1.10% in the year-earlier quarter.Strong Capital RatiosHuntington Bancshares capital ratios remained strong.Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio were 9.89% and 11.22%, respectively, as compared with 9.56% and 10.92% in the year-ago quarter.Tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.34%, down from 7.16% as of Dec 31, 2016.Outlook for 2018With improving macroeconomic environment and the company’s accomplishment of its core strategies, total revenues for full-year 2018 are projected to be up in the range of 4-6%. Non-interest expense is anticipated to decrease in the range of 2-4%.NIM for 2018 is estimated to remain flat as compared with the prior year on a GAAP basis as expansion in NIM is anticipated to offset the reduced benefit of purchase accounting. Further, efficiency ratio is projected at 55-57%.Management predicts average loans and leases to increase in the range of 4-6% on an annual basis, while average deposits are expected to increase around 3-5%.Overall, asset quality metrics are likely to remain stable with moderate quarterly volatility, given the current low level of problem assets and credit costs.Management anticipates NCOs to remain below the long-term normalized range of 35-55 basis points.The effective tax rate for 2018 is estimated in the range of 16-17%.Our ViewpointHuntington reported an encouraging quarter. The company has a solid franchise in the Midwest and is focused on capitalizing on its growth opportunities. Further, it exhibits consistent efforts in increasing loan and deposit balances, aiding revenue growth. Additionally, we remain optimistic about the company’s several strategic actions, including acquisitions and consolidation of branches.However, escalating costs and unstable credit metrics pose challenges to the company’s financials. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteCurrently, Huntington carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

99,HBAN,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Huntington Bancshares is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for HBAN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 24 cents per share for HBAN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for HBAN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 4.35% heading into earnings season.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that HBAN has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

100,HBAN,"Regions Financial Corporation (RF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   The Birmingham, AL-based company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to impressive growth in non-interest income and easing margin pressure. However, this was partly offset by escalating expenses.Notably, this positive performance resulted in an appreciation of the company’s share price. Over the last three months, the stock gained around 7.4%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Moreover, Regions has an impressive earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions’ stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Regions doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Regions is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 24 cents. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Regions’ Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans (C&I) are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. The bank projects average loans to be flat to marginally down on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impact of the third-party indirect-vehicle portfolio. Average deposits are expected to be relatively stable compared to the prior year.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, Regions should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII and other financing income to grow in the range of 3–5% are likely to show impact in the second quarter as well. Further, net interest margin is estimated to expand 3–5 basis points in the quarter to be reported.Non Interest Income Might Escalate: The persistent decline in non-interest income has weighed on the top line for the last few years. However, given the seasonal tailwinds, service charges and payments might escalate lifting fee income for the bank. Moreover, the company anticipates adjusted non-interest income to rise in the range of 1–3% in 2017.Expenses Might Rise Slightly: Regions’ efficient expense management might decently support the bottom line during the quarter. Owing to the current global macroeconomic headwinds, management’s plan to slash $300 million of core expenses by 2018 is right on track. Further, encouraged by recent increases in market interest rates, Regions expects to eliminate an additional $100 million by 2019. However, the company projects a marginal increase in its expenses, as a result of the investments which it is making for revenue generation.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Old National Bancorp (ONB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.

101,HBAN,"The expected fall in Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) trading revenues will likely have an adverse impact on fourth-quarter 2017 earnings given the significant dependence of its top line on this source. Nevertheless, this may not lead the company to report dismal results on Jan 16. Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly consumer banking — are anticipated to offset the trading slump.In 2017, several political and geopolitical developments, interest-rate hikes, tax act movements and absence of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have driven volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates, along with absence of positive catalysts, have been on the downside.Per John Gerspach, chief financial officer (CFO) of Citigroup, the low level of volatility in the fourth quarter, particularly compared to last year when market was reacting actively to the U.S. election, is likely to take a toll on trading revenues. He projects high-teens year-over-year decline in trading revenues. Fixed income and foreign exchange segments, on which the company depends significantly, are likely to have been affected the most.Gerspach also said that he projects revenues from Citi-branded credit cards in North America to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Pressure has been put on the revenues due to the company’s extensive marketing strategy.Other Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsConsumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth: In consumer, management expects continued modest year-over-year revenue growth, and positive operating leverage in both North America and International Consumer in fourth-quarter 2017. In total, sequential growth in pre-tax earnings in Global Consumer banking is recorded for the last two quarters and is anticipated to continue into the fourth quarter as well.Investment Banking Fees Might Escalate: Continued momentum in investment banking business is anticipated to support bottom-line numbers. Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the top line. As the interest-rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. Therefore, debt origination fees will lead to solid gains.Also, despite being a seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, the fourth quarter turned triumphant. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for banks. Thus, Citigroup is also likely to report an impressive quarter.On the institutional side, continued year-over-year revenue growth in accrual businesses, including TTS, the Private Bank, Corporate Lending and Securities Services are anticipated. Markets revenues are likely to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction might not be a major support. However, some legal settlements during the quarter might impact Citigroup’s earnings to an extent.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the consumer area — might perk up interest income.Credit Costs Might Impact Negatively: Cost of credit is likely to be in line, quarter on quarter, driven by the normalization of credit costs in ICG, offset by lower reserve builds in consumer. Net credit-card losses are likely to worsen. Rate in the branded-cards business is expected to be 285 basis points (bps) in 2017 and expand about 10 bps in 2018. Also, in the retail-services business, rate is expected to be 470 bps in 2017 and increase to 500 bps in 2018.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Notably, in early December 2017 (before the passage of the tax act), Citigroup executive had noted that the U.S. corporate tax overhaul will hurt earnings in the fourth quarter. The company had expected one-time charge of $16-$17 billion related to the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs) and charge related to cash repatriation to be around $3-$4 billion.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Citigroup does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Citigroup is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

102,HBAN,"Most banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of top-line strength and lower provisions. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, the results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing significantly. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing. Also, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and personnel, and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor. Nevertheless, legal expenses remained under control. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Oct 13, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1.

Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s economic net income surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by a significant rise in revenues, which was partially offset by higher expenses.Blackstone also boasts an impressive earnings surprise history, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 12.1%.These, along with fundamentals, helped Blackstone’s shares gain nearly 27.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Financial - Investment Management industry’s growth of 18.3%.The Blackstone Group L.P.

This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 62 cents is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents.Zacks Rank: Blackstone has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsOn the expense side, as the company’s well-performing funds require more headcount, compensation and benefit costs are expected to increase.With improvement in the overall economic scenario, the company’s fund-raising ability should aid the uptrend in its fee-earning AUM and total AUM. This will lead to stable or improving fee income for the company.Also, Blackstone continues to expand its investment activity to capitalize on public market dislocation and should report higher deployment of capital during the quarter.However, Blackstone’s activities during the quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence.

106,HBAN,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20. With expectation of year-over-year growth in revenues and stable earnings, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   The Bridgeport, CT-based company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and elevated expenses were recorded in the quarter. Growth in loans and deposit balances were the positives. Moreover, credit quality marked a significant improvement.Notably, in the second quarter, the stock declined around 3%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Moreover, People's United has a decent earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below:People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | People's United Financial, Inc. QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:People's United doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for People's United is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 23 cents. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: People's United’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans (C&I) are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 5–7%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, People's United should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII to grow in the range of 5–7% is likely to show impact in the second quarter as well.Fee Income to Escalate: Given the seasonal tailwinds, service charges and payments might escalate lifting fee income for the bank. Moreover, the company expects non-interest income to rise in the range of 5–7% in 2017.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, elevated expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Old National Bancorp (ONB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.

107,HBAN,"Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (CFR  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.29, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the reported figure was up from $1.11 in the year-ago quarter.The company’s quarterly results reflect higher revenues. Further, increase in loans and a strong balance sheet position were the positives. However, elevated expenses remained an undermining factor.Net income available to common shareholders came in at $83.5 million, exceeding the year-ago quarter figure by approximately 20.2%.Revenue Growth Offsets Escalated ExpensesThe company’s total revenue was $295.9 million, up 10.2% from the prior-year quarter. However, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $316.4 million.Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis increased 12.1% year over year to $258 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a rise in earning assets in loans and securities, higher yields on loans and increase in cash balances. Moreover, net interest margin increased 13 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.70%, as the Fed’s interest rate hikes led to higher yielding assets.Non-interest income totaled $81.1 million, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was mainly due to rise in trust and investment management fees.Non-interest expenses of $188.1 million rose 4.8% year over year. Increase in all the cost components led to higher expenses in the reported quarter.Strong Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, total loans were $12.5 billion, up 2.7% from the previous quarter. Total deposits amounted to $25.6 billion, down 2% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, provision for loan losses declined 72% year over year to $8.3 million.

Growth in loan balance indicates continued organic growth. Further, the company remains well poised to benefit from easing margin pressure. However, escalating expenses may continue to curb the company’s bottom-line growth. In addition, significant exposure to the risky real estate loans raises concerns.Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

108,HBAN,"Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   The Chicago, IL-based company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to a rise in revenues. However, this was partly offset by escalating expenses.Notably, this positive performance resulted in an appreciation of the company’s share price.  In the second quarter, the stock gained around 12.3%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Moreover, Northern Trust has a decent earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Northern Trust’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Northern Trust doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Northern Trust is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.24. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Northern Trust’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsTrust Revenues to Witness Improvement: The equity markets across the globe displayed a decent improvement in the second quarter. Both the MSCI EAFE Index (measuring international equity performance) and the S&P 500 Index gained.Notably, Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e. the computations are based on the prior quarter-end valuations. Since the performance of equity markets were relatively decent in the first quarter, the company will likely be able to record growth in custody, servicing and management fees.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, Northern Trust should have recorded an increase in NII. However, a slowdown in loan growth during the quarter will have a marginal adverse impact on interest income.Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Fall: Given the decrease in foreign exchange (“FX”) trading volatility, as well as mixed volumes in the second quarter, the company’s revenues from FX trading are likely to have deteriorated during the quarter on lower transactions.Marginal Increase in Expenses: Despite some cost-saving initiatives, Northern Trust’s continued investments in new business activities may lead to a slight rise in expenses.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Old National Bancorp (ONB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.

109,HBAN,"Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is slated to report its second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 21, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to record marginal growth on a year-over-year basis.Driven by an increase in revenues, Moody’s’ first-quarter earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, rise in operating expenses was an undermining factor.Also, the company’s business activities and prospects encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 for the just-concluded quarter moved up by a penny over the last seven days.Moody’s boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.7%.The company’s price performance has been impressive as well. Its shares have gained 34.3% year to date, significantly outperforming the Zacks categorized Miscellaneous Financial Services industry’s rally of 6.7%.Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Moody's Corporation Quote Before digging deeper into the factors that are likely to influence the results, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of Moody’s beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Moody’s is +4.51%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.39 is more than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33.Zacks Rank: Moody’s currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected Results  Favorable corporate bond issuance environment: Backdrop for bond issuance (driven by tightening of credit spreads and pull back of long-term yield curve) during the second quarter was favorable. Thus, investment grade bond and leveraged loan issuances volume remained strong year over year. So, Moody’s corporate finance revenues are expected to rise.Structured products issuance trend remain strong: Quarterly issuance volume for commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities remained robust.

111,HBAN,"Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) is slated to announce second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 19, before the opening bell. While investors cheered its enhanced capital deployment plan, we don’t think this optimism will continue following the earnings release.While Morgan Stanley’s performance in the last quarter reflected improved trading revenues and higher investment banking fees, a challenging operating backdrop is expected to dampen the company’s second-quarter earnings.Earnings estimate revisions depict pessimism too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter was revised 2.5% downward, over the last seven days. Nonetheless, the company’s revenues and earnings are expected to grow modestly year over year.Also, Morgan Stanley boasts a decent earnings surprise history. This is evident from the chart below:Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteEarnings WhispersDeclining earnings estimates increase chances of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively predict earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher – for increasing chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 76 cents.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Impact Q2 Results  Trading income slump on low volatility: For the major part of the quarter, trading activities remained sluggish largely due to low volatility in both bond and equity markets. While the markets witnessed a modest increase in volatility almost at the end of quarter, it is not likely to be enough for Morgan Stanley to record any improvement in trading revenues.Underwriting fees to record a slight rise: Driven by an improving market conditions, the second quarter witnessed an increase in equity issuance while debt issuance was hit by higher interest rates. Per the data compiled by Thomson Reuters, equity market activities led to more than nearly 22% rise in equity underwriting fees, with Morgan Stanley at the top spot (recording over 50% growth in fees).However, the data indicates that global fees related to bond activity roughly totaled $6.5 billion during the second quarter, down more than 16% year over year. So, Morgan Stanley should have recorded a decline in debt underwriting fees during the quarter.All in all, total underwriting fees is expected to witness a slight rise on the basis of improved equity markets.Advisory fee revenues to suffer: Global M&A activity remained lackluster. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As across the world fell during the quarter. Thus, total fees earned through deal making should have declined as well. Likewise, Morgan Stanley is expected to earn $372.1 million as advisory fees in the quarter, indicating a fall of 20.9% from the prior-year quarter.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and real estate during quarter is expected to support NII. Further, a rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income as well.Support to bottom line from expense control: Morgan Stanley has a cost savings plan – Project Streamline – in place. This is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Also, as much improvement in revenues is not likely, chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Jul 18.

112,HBAN,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, primarily driven by an increase in equity market volatility, lower level of fee waivers and absence of provisions were among the positives. These were, however, offset by higher expenses.The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history, delivering an average beat of 2.1% in the trailing four quarters.Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 9% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Investment-Brokers industry’s almost flat performance. The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteWill the stock’s rally continue post second-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Our proven model shows that Schwab has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is +2.56%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 40 cents is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Schwab has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsTrading Revenue to Improve: Equity markets and trading activities were decent during the quarter. This should have somewhat helped Schwab’s trading volumes. Moreover, the company opened 125,000 and 115,000 new brokerage accounts in April and May 2017, respectively, which indicates that investors were interested in entering the market.Asset Growth Should Boost Net Interest Revenue: Schwab witnessed a rise in average interest-earning assets in April and May on a year-over-year basis. These assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, may have helped Schwab experience higher net interest revenue during the quarter.Decline in Fee Waivers: Following the rate hikes in December and March, Schwab witnessed a decline in almost all its fee waivers. This should have helped the company earn more in the to-be-reported quarter.Activities of Schwab during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 39 cents.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

113,HBAN,"We expect TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report) to beat earnings expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 18. Notably, revenues and earnings are also expected to grow year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that TD Ameritrade has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat earnings this quarter.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for the stock, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at +2.44%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy): Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.The combination of TD Ameritrade’s Zacks Rank #2 and ESP of +2.44% makes us confident of an earnings beat.  It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.However, the company has a disappointing earnings surprise history as depicted in the chart below:TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation QuoteShares of TD Ameritrade declined 3.5% over the past six months compared with the slight decline recorded by the Zacks categorized Investment Bank industry.Factors to Influence Fiscal Q3 ResultsExpenses to trend high: Expenses are likely to remain under pressure given the company’s ongoing investments in technology, and advice and guidance offerings.  Further, operating expenses are expected to escalate to $530–$540 million on a quarterly basis due to Scottrade-related, sales incentives and trading-related expenses.Margin pressure might ease: A lingering low-interest rate environment has been weighing on TD Ameritrade’s net interest margin (NIM). Though spread-based revenues have increased in the recent quarters, the company has been experiencing a shrinking NIM. Nevertheless, the latest rise in the interest rates is expected to alleviate pressure on the bank’s NIM to some extent.Market Volatility: Being an investment bank, TD Ameritrade is exposed to extreme market volatility. Therefore, the company is likely to be hurt by the persistent market swings experienced during the quarter.Continued asset growth: The company has been witnessing double-digit asset growth for the last several years. Notably, during fiscal 2016, the company recorded an annualized growth rate of 9% in net new client assets, within the long-term target of increasing net new client assets at an annual rate of 7–11%. The increasing trend continued in the first six months of fiscal 2017 as well. With an innovative trading platform, consistent focus on high net-worth clients and enhanced service model to boost engagement and retention, we anticipate TD Ameritrade to display the improving trend in the fiscal third quarter as well.However, activities of TD Ameritrade during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter moved down 2.4% to 41 cents over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

However, the contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Growth in Average Loan Balance: Comerica’s average loans are likely to increase given a seasonal rebound in the mortgage banker finance. Further, clearing of some uncertainties related to Trump’s policies and a slightly better lending scenario was witnessed in the second quarter.Lower Fee income: Owing to the decline in M&As and equity issuance activities in the quarter, Comerica’s fee income might witness some pressure.Effective Cost Saving Initiatives: Expenses might trend downward in the upcoming release due to the company’s GEAR Up expense savings initiatives.Activities of Comerica during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence.

115,HBAN,"Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce second-quarter 2017 results on Tuesday, Jul 18, before the opening bell. Despite investors cheering the company’s latest capital deployment plan, the same is not expected to continue following the earnings release.While BofA’s performance in the last quarter reflected improved trading revenues, an increase in interest income and higher investment banking fees, challenging operating backdrop is expected dampen the company’s second-quarter earnings.In May, at an investor conference call, the company CEO Brian T. Moynihan said that second-quarter earnings are likely be hit by fall in trading revenues and lower-than-expected interest rates.Earnings estimate revisions depict pessimism too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter was revised 4.4% downward over the last seven days, with four out of eight estimates moving lower and none moving higher.Earnings WhispersDecrease in earnings estimates increase chances of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively predict the earnings beat this time. Here’s why:BofA does not have the right combination of two main ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher – for increasing chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 43 cents.Zacks Rank: BofA’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects 20.5% improvement on a year-over-year basis. Further, BofA has a decent surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteFactors Impacting Q2 ResultsLack of volatility to hurt trading revenues: For the major part of the quarter, trading activities remained sluggish mainly due to low volatility in both bond and equity markets. While the markets witnessed a marginal rise in volatility almost at the end of quarter, it is not likely to be enough for BofA to record any improvement in trading revenues.During an investor conference at the end of May, management revealed that the quarter’s trading revenues are expected to be down 10–12% year over year.Lack of investment banking activities to curb fee income: Global M&A activity remained lackluster. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As across the world fell during the quarter. Debt underwriting was soft as well, while equity underwriting seems to have improved. But as BofA’s is one of the lead players in this space, it might not suffer a loss.Mortgage revenues not to be a major support: An expected higher rate environment and less-concerned lenders over regulatory restrictions might have led to a rise in demand for refinancing activities during the quarter, thus helping BofA record some mortgage revenues. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no big support is expected from this segment. So, the contribution of mortgage revenue gains to total revenue will not be extraordinary.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on modest loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and real estate during quarter is expected to support NII. Nonetheless, management expects $100–$110 million reduction in NII owing to lower-than-expected interest rates and the divestiture of its U.K. consumer credit card operations, MBNA Ltd.  Reduced scope for significant cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support this quarter. In fact, BofA expects to record a charge of $100 million as it closes/sells its data centers.Nonetheless, given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall expenses should remain more or less stable.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Jul 18.
