Also understand that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, and such bases are more prone to failure. Earnings grew 53% last quarter, up from 10% in the prior report. Revenue also increased, from -6% to 0%. CSX holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in the Transportation-Rail industry group.

67,NSC,"CSX (CSX) shares tanked Friday, with the railroad operator losing billions in market value after reporting late Thursday that CEO Hunter Harrison — installed by activist investors at the start of this year — would take an unexpected medical leave of absence.X Jim Foote, chief operating officer since October, will temporarily assume the CEO position. He told investors in a Friday morning call that Harrison became ill last week after one of the chief executive's regular multiday pep-talks with management, and that the illness ""led to medical complications,"" The Wall Street Journal reported.Foote declined to discuss Harrison's medical condition and didn't divulge when the chief executive, who has been using an oxygen tank in recent months and largely working from his Florida home, might return, the Journal added.CSX plunged 7.6% to 52.93 on the stock market today. The sharp move lower saw the Florida railroader's stock undercut the 55.09 flat-base buy point it cleared in heavy volume just three weeks ago. Shares were right around their 50-day moving average after an intraday tumble to their 200-day line.Harrison's medical leave introduces incremental risk and uncertainty to CSX's  trajectory, Baird senior research analyst Benjamin Hartford wrote Friday. But with the stock near 50 and with  accelerating EBIT growth expected in upcoming quarters, Hartford sees a path to further outperformance.""We would be buyers on this morning's pullback,"" said Hartford. ""In our view, $48-50 offers near-term support.""Hartford has an outperform rating on CSX stock and a price target of 58.Among other railroad stocks, Union Pacific (UNP) added 1.1% to 130.57 while Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC) reversed higher for a 0.2% gain to 141.11. Union Pacific is extended from a breakout roughly two months ago, putting the stock out of buy range. Norfolk Southern is now just outside a buy zone that extends to roughly 141.All three stocks belong to the 20-member Dow Jones Transportation Average.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.According to the Journal, the CSX board was aware it was hiring a 73-year-old railroad veteran with ""known health risks,"" initially resisting pressure to do so from activist investor Mantle Ridge but finally agreeing to hire him.Harrison won a four-year contract, including an $84 million payment, with investor approval. Foote signaled CSX would continue with Harrison's ""disruptive"" turnaround strategy, featuring new train schedules, cost-cutting and terminal closures, but faced spiraling problems and customer complaints, the report said.CSX stock spiked massively at the start of 2017 when Harrison left Canadian Pacific (CP) to take over at CSX, raising hopes for a shake-up at the Florida company. But shares leveled off and moved sideways for several subsequent months before breaking out in late November.CSX matched earnings views in its last quarterly report, in mid October, but revenues slightly missed. Harrison said at the time the results reflected the resiliency of  the turnaround strategy he calls ""precision railroading"" and described the company's transition as ""largely behind us.""RELATED:Dow Stocks Lead Early Surge; Costco Gains, Top Railroad Sells OffOne Of The Hottest Dow Stocks Has A New Buy Point: Investing Action Plan

70,NSC,"Rob Brookby blends top-down investment themes with bottom-up research in managing the Putnam Growth Opportunities Fund (POGAX).X The approach has led the fund nearly 32% higher in 2017. The fund also has been dominant over longer periods. Putnam Growth Opportunities has posted average annual returns of 11.84%, 17.52% and 10.25% over the past three, five and 10 years. These results have bested the S&P 500 in each of those years, putting the fund on the path to win an IBD Mutual Fund Award.Brookby has been at the helm of the $4.6 billion fund  since 2009. IBD recently caught up with him to discuss which of his investment themes prospered in 2017 and how he sees the landscape for large-cap growth stocks in 2018.IBD: What makes a company a good candidate to be included in your portfolio?Rob Brookby:  I focus on three key growth investor metrics: the revenue growth rate of a business, the duration of the growth, and return on capital.IBD: How does your investing strategy differentiate the fund from other large growth funds?Brookby: I follow a thematic process to identify the duration of growth. What we want to try to understand is what the big picture or story is that is intersecting with the business that is driving the growth. At any given time, I am working with two or three dozen themes across the portfolio.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for actionable stocks? Check out our Stock Lists page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more.IBD: Have there been any investment themes that have fared particularly well this year for the fund?Brookby: We have seen the FANG stocks perform very well. We have owned Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). These companies are disrupting very big traditional markets. Our exposure to U.S. internet and U.S. cloud are underpinning FANG.The autonomous and EV innovation of automobiles is another theme that has fared well. We are exposed to autonomous driving on the semiconductor side. There are a lot of different technologies that are now showing up in automobiles, whether it is driver-assisted vision or integrated steering and braking, that are powered by semiconductors — companies like STMicroelectronics (STM) that we are invested in and have been for a while.Lastly, in the consumer space, we have been exposed over time to digital marketing, and the idea we have expressed it the most clearly through is our investment in Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). They have found ways to create advertising units, whether that is the headline sponsor at a concert, the naming rights to a venue or the signage in the parking lot. Advertisers are fighting in a crowded space for the consumer's attention and they have found clever ways to take an event and drive marketing around it.IBD: What is your outlook for large-cap growth stocks for 2018?Brookby: The rampage that large-cap growth stocks have gone on this year should give way to a more balanced performance between growth and value. Within the large-cap growth space, we are more interested in industrial cyclicals and financials and less interested in the big tech and big health care stocks that have done much of the heavy lifting this year and have seen their valuations expand greatly.IBD: Are there any particular industrial stocks that you like right now?Brookby: We have a major investment in Norfolk Southern (NSC). There are really only four railroads in this country. We haven't started another railroad in many, many decades. As economic growth picks up, you should see more freight in general moving over rails. The thing that makes them particularly interesting is not what is going on in rails, but what is going on in trucking. The major competitor of a rail is a truck, and there have been a number of regulatory changes in the trucking market that have really tightened up trucking capacity.IBD: What themes are you seeing at Alphabet that has led it to be a top holding in your portfolio?Brookby: The major one is YouTube. They have 1.5 billion monthly active users of YouTube that are using the service an average of an hour a day. The growth of YouTube this past quarter was just north of 30%. It is an amazing property that is hoovering up advertising dollars. Another major theme is Google Cloud Platform. It has some powerful technologies underlying it that are allowing for pretty explosive growth.IBD: What aspects of Amazon's business do you find to be the most intriguing?Brookby: The two things that intrigue me the most are what they are going to do with voice search expressed through Alexa and advertising in general. They have a high-margin opportunity to start to monetize the opportunity to advertise more directly on their platform. The big three advertising agencies — Publicis, Omnicom and WPP — announced earlier this fall that they were going to more than double the spend they are allocating to Amazon.IBD: How significant do you see Apple's services segment being for future growth?Brookby:  I don't think it is too strong to say it is really the key to the company's future. The iPhone business is down to about 55% of revenue and has been coming down as a percentage as the other parts of the business have picked up. Myself and many growth investors really want to see Apple transform itself into a more recurring revenue type of subscription business where customers are paying Apple $30, $40 or $50 a month, every month, to consume a set of services around its ecosystem, whether it be Apple Music, Apple Pay, the iTunes app store, iCloud or Apple Care.RELATED:Why Fidelity Gave This Mutual Fund Manager More Money To Invest

77,NSC,"At least 10 of the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial average gained 2 points or more to help power the blue chip index to a 1.4% gain and a leading position within Thursday's broad market rebound.XThe Dow Jones industrial average gained 3.8% in November, raising its year-to-date advance to 22.8%.Meanwhile, innovative new discount retailer Five Below (FIVE) rushed more than 3% higher in extended hours trading after announcing sparkling fiscal third-quarter results with earnings up 80% to 18 cents a share, crushing the 13-cent consensus view. Net margin shot 110 basis points higher to 3.8%.Revenue jumped 29% to $257.2 million, also beating views. In the prior four quarters, Five Below's revenue rose 18%, 19%, 21% and 29% vs. year- ago levels.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped as much as 1.6% and notched an all-time high of 24,327, breaking past 24,000 for the first time. At 24,272, the 30-stock Dow is now up almost 23% year to date.The Nasdaq composite recouped much of Wednesday's 1.3% drop, rising 0.7%. The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the all-electronic exchange, rebounded nearly 0.8%. The S&P 500 also rallied 0.8%. Volume zoomed higher on the NYSE on a blast of turnover in the final minutes and was virtually even on the Nasdaq.The Nasdaq composite rose 2.2% in November and is up 23.1% since Jan. 1, vs. a 2.8% monthly lift and a 18.3% year-to-date gain for the 500.Five Below, the Sector Leader and highly rated member of IBD's discount and variety retail group had already become extended from a pair of proper buy points. At Thursday's close of 61.77, Five Below was up nearly 14% from a five-month cup base with a 54.23 buy point. The small cap firm is also up nearly 7% past a narrow flat base with a 57.75 entry.Five Below's Retail-Discount & Variety industry group ranks 68th among 197 industry groups and subgroups rated each day for relative six-month price performance by IBD. In general, the biggest stock market winners hail from the top 20 to 40 industry groups. However, Five Below's group has jumped to its current spot from No. 102 four weeks ago, a good sign.IBD's TAKE: Track the industry groups moving fast up the rankings by going to Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, then click on Industry Sub-Group Rankings. IBD research has found that up to 50% of a leading stock's move can be attributed to the strength of its industry group and broad industry sector.Five Below is a relatively new public company, debuting in July 2012 at 17 a share. It has a very reasonable float of 54 million shares, easily meeting the criteria of S in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investment paradigm. The S stands for supply vs. demand. Goldman Sachs (GS) led the way among Dow 30 stocks in terms of point gain, rising more than 6 points, or nearly 3%, to 247.64. At one point, shares moved past a 247.84 buy point in  a nearly nine month saucer with handle.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, stretched its gains from an Oct. 27 breakout from a good cup with handle and a 160.97 buy point by rebounding 2.37, or 1.4%, to 171.85 in fast turnover. More than 40.1 million shares traded hands, 48% higher than usual.The gain for Apple from latest correct buy point is now back to 6.7%. The iPhone giant has also risen 45% since marking a breakout from a bottoming base on Jan. 6-9. At that time, Apple also cleared a cup with handle, shoving past a 118.12 entry.Back to Five Below, the Philadelphia-based company now operates more than 600 stores in 32 states. It has zero long-term debt and expanded its shareholders equity to $381 million vs. $288 million in the year-ago period.Five Below also forecast sales of $491 million to $503 million for the January-ending fiscal fourth quarter, well above Wall Street's consensus estimate of $484.1 million. Executives also see earnings of $1.09 to $1.16 a share, or up 21% to 29%.Five Below and peer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) are the only two stocks in IBD's Retail-Discount & Variety industry group to earn a top-notch 99 Composite Rating, according to IBD Stock Checkup.Railroad giant CSX (CSX) gained more than 2%, rolling past a 55.09 entry in a 19-week flat base and is up nearly 9% for the week. Volume is heavy, running more than 60% above its usual pace. The RS line, drawn in blue on IBD's daily and weekly charts, is not at all-time highs but is rising sharply in recent weeks.Norfolk Southern (NSC) joined the breakout train, rising nearly 2% in spirited volume and moving past a 134.62 buy point.Both Norfolk and CSX have shown improved fundamentals, at least on a quarterly basis. The former has grown profit 9%, 15%, 26% and 13% vs. year-ago levels over the past four quarters, while the latter has seen EPS gains of 21%, 38%, 36% and 6%. CSX's profit, however, is seen dipping 2% to 57 cents a share, due in part to a tough year over year comparison.The Dow Jones transports, up 3.3% and posting a closing high on Wednesday, ramped another 2.1% higher to all-time highs.Back to Apple, the company has shown improving fundamentals over the past 12 months, and the Street appears confident that the turnaround will continue. Over the next two quarters, analysts on consensus see earnings growing 12% and 39%. That would extend Apple's streak of double-digit EPS growth to five straight quarters.Revenue increases are helping drive those positive expectations.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, ended in September that year, Apple's sales slumped 9%. After that, revenue turned around, rising 3%, 5%, 7% and 12% in the next four quarters. Apple is now seen growing the top line 10% in the current first quarter (ending in December) to $86.18 billion, then another 30% to $68.77 billion in Q2 of fiscal 2018.Strong orders for the ultra-luxury iPhone X, a major iPhone replacement cycle, strength in digital services, increasing popularity of the cellular-enabled Apple Watch, and other products are helping continue Apple's dominance in consumer electronics.Apple's stock price strength also is improving. According to IBD Stock Checkup, the Relative Price Strength Rating is a respectable 80 on a scale of 1 (weak) to 99 (strong), up sharply since scoring a 59 on Jan. 1.Meanwhile, Apple's EPS Rating has improved to a solid 90 (also on a scale of 1 to 99), up from 45 on Jan. 1. The SMR Rating, which analyzes sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity, is at a top-shelf A on a scale of A to E.In the September-ended fiscal fourth quarter, Apple's aftertax margin rose 120 basis points to 20.4%, indicating strong pricing power of its products as well as likely hinting at improved operating leverage or cost efficiencies.Semiconductor stocks are trying to rebound. Nvidia (NVDA), a leader in chips for artificial intelligence, data center, self-driving and virtual currency markets, is trying to stem its decline after briefly sliding through the 50-day moving average on Wednesday.Shares gained 2%. The long-term uptrend is intact, and Nvidia still holds a 14% gain since clearing a narrow flat base with a a 174.66 buy point on Sept. 15.Nvidia, an IBD 50 play at No. 10 and recently highlighted in IBD Sector Leaders, is facing tough year-over-year comparisons after posting large double-digit to triple-digit earnings gains since the second half of fiscal 2017, ended in January. Yet Wall Street still anticipates solid growth in the quarters ahead. Analysts on consensus forecast a 16% rise in January-ending Q4 profit to $1.15 a share on a 22% jump in sales to $2.66 billion, which would be a quarterly best.Growth is expected to reaccelerate in Q1 of fiscal 2019, with earnings rising 24% to 98 cents a share on a 27% pickup in sales to $2.46 billion.Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), however, failed to hold on to early gains and fell mildly. Both are members of IBD Big Cap 20. Watch to see if they can recover their respective 50-day moving averages. Failure to do so would trigger a sell signal.In other financial markets, investors trimmed more of their long-term government bond holdings ahead of a widely expected Federal Reserve hike in interest rates. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose to 2.41%, the highest since late October.Despite elevated crude oil prices in recent months, transport stocks continued to thrive. This may come as no surprise given the acceleration of the U.S. economy, which rose at a revised 3.3% annualized rate in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturing output data came in stronger than expected.In addition to the Senate's vote on a major tax reform bill that could sharply reduce corporate taxes, Wall Street will focus on the ISM manufacturing survey for November, due Friday at 10 a.m. ET.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Bitcoin Reverses; 3 Reasons Why The Tech Rally Isn't OverFinding Great New IPO Stocks: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Microsoft, Intel and Cisco?These 7 IBD Stock Lists Are Crushing The Major Indexes This YearThe Big Picture: Why Square May Need To Take A BreakStocks Near A Buy ZoneWant To Find The Next Nvidia?

Freight revenue rose 11% on volume growth, increased fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains and positive mix of traffic.

While shale companies are back pumping more oil, and shipping it over rails, U.S. crude prices have fallen below $50 a barrel again, resulting in recent wobbles in drilling activity as well as domestic output.Meanwhile, slowing demand for autos could be another headwind in shipping, and U.S. sales have been steadily declining this year after setting a record high last year.Another concern is the consumer sector. U.S. retail sales in June unexpectedly slipped. And even excluding autos, gasoline, building materials and food services, sales were still lower vs. the prior month.Still, CSX on Tuesday backed its full-year EPS growth outlook of about 25%, below consensus for 27% growth.

90,NSC,"A political hit job was just carried out against the Trump White House, and the fate of the victims is yet to be determined.Last week, the far-left New York Times — which long ago abandoned any pretense of being unbiased or having journalistic standards — acted as the smear agent for unnamed ""American officials,"" and printed a piece that Pravda of the former Soviet Union could have only hoped to emulate.The article, titled ""2 White House Officials Helped Give Nunes Intelligence Reports,"" was meant to damage the credibility of Congressman Devin Nunes, who is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, while specifically targeting two of President Trump's most loyal White House aides.As the New York Times noted, Chairman Nunes refused to identify his sources regarding his proof of Trump employees and campaign officials being under the surveillance of American intelligence operatives and then having the names of those employees and campaign officials illegally unmasked in violation of U.S. law.An ""unmasking"" former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice is now doing a tap dance all around.The New York Times was more than happy to break that confidence. But, as the newspaper makes clear in its own article, they were doing so in conjunction with those murky and unnamed American officials.Said the Times in leaking the names:  ""Several current American officials identified the White House officials as Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a lawyer who works on national security issues at the White House Counsel's Office and was previously counsel to Mr. Nunes's committee.""It should be noted and stressed that, not by coincidence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick — described as ""a true American patriot and an outstanding intelligence analyst"" by several people I spoke with — had been the target of these same unnamed and murky ""American officials"" a few weeks earlier.As detailed on March 14 in an article titled ""Trump steps in to keep 30-year-old NSC aide,"" the left-of-center news site Politico outlines how on March 10 National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster allegedly told Cohen-Watnick that ""he would be moved to another position in the organization.""Politico then further reported that the ""conversation followed weeks of pressure from career officials at the CIA who had expressed reservations about the 30-year-old intelligence operative and pushed for his ouster.""The piece then cuts to the chase when it quotes another intelligence operative as to why certain individuals at the CIA wanted Cohen-Watnick removed.  It reports that Cohen-Watnick and his previous boss, Michael Flynn, saw ""eye-to-eye about the failings of the CIA human intelligence operations. … The CIA saw (Cohen-Watnick) as a threat, so they tried to unseat him and replace him with an agency loyalist.""If true, those would be the actions of a police state and should send chills down the spines of anyone in or out of government who still cares about ethics and our Constitution.For me personally, I don't believe there is any government agency more critical to the welfare of our national security than the Central Intelligence Agency.  Its field operatives are — anonymously — beyond heroic, and with Mike Pompeo as the new DCI, the agency could not be in more capable or ethical hands.That said, it would be foolish and professionally irresponsible not to acknowledge that there could be career operatives within the CIA — or any of our intelligence agencies — who, out of some twisted and misplaced loyalty to Barack Obama and his failed policies, are working in the shadows to damage the Trump White House and those tasked with carrying out the policies of President Trump.Surely, Director Pompeo will want to know if such unethical and potentially illegal actions are taking place on his watch.As detailed by Politico, three weeks ago, unnamed and murky ""American officials"" tried and failed to take Ezra Cohen-Watnick out.  Refusing to give up, they turned to the New York Times to assist them with their dirty work.According to the report, Senior White House Advisors Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner — with the blessing of President Trump — stepped in to personally protect Cohen-Watnick.Should that be the case, they need to do so again to protect not only Cohen-Watnick, but Michael Ellis as well.The New York Times story was nothing more than a vile political hit job carried out for partisan reasons, and if Cohen-Watnick and Ellis are not protected, then the deep-state operatives working out of the shadows will have won.The liberal mainstream media and their allies have long decried the creation of ""enemies lists"" and the punishment of those on such lists.Now, for their own partisan and ideological reasons, they employ them.RELATED:Did Susan Rice Commit A Crime?Is Susan Rice The Missing Piece In Obama Spy Scandal?Did Obama Spy On Trump?

The two first approached CSX in 2014, offering to merge it with Canadian Pacific, the Journal said.The Journal noted that Harrison had improved profits at Canadian Pacific, Illinois Central and Canadian National Railway (CNI).

Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski said in a research note Monday that ""the market has clearly decided to capitalize a potential Hunter-Harrison transformation"" at CSX.""Naturally, investors are now wondering how much is priced in, which begs the question of what a realistic upside scenario could look like,"" he added.""While shares may be closer to fair value now,"" he continued, ""we still see plenty of upside potential at CSX and are not inclined to fight increasingly bullish sentiment on the stock.""IBD'S TAKE: CSX's news comes as General Electric contends with the lingering effects from a commodity oversupply that has hurt its transportation and oil-equipment businesses.Canadian Pacific lost 1.8%.

Union Pacific (UNP), which beat earnings forecasts Thursday, added 2.4%, while Kansas City Southern (KSU), which reports Friday, reversed to end down 0.5%. Canadian Pacific climbed 3.5%.Creel will become Canadian Pacific's president and CEO effective Jan. 31, following Harrison's decision to retire.The company said Wednesday that ""Harrison had approached the board to discuss his retirement from CP and potential related modifications to his employment arrangements that would allow him to pursue opportunities involving other Class 1 Railroads.""In return for the limited non-compete waiver, Harrison agreed to end all roles with Canadian Pacific, forfeit benefits and stock awards totaling 118 million Canadian dollars, and no longer carry out a previously agreed-upon consulting role.Last summer, the company said Creel would take over July 1, 2017. He had already had stints serving as interim CEO during periods when Harrison had health issues.In April, the company abandoned its effort to buy Norfolk Southern for $30 billion amid broad opposition from industry and lawmakers. At the time, Harrison doubted that Canadian Pacific would pursue other rail rivals.The accelerated CEO handoff comes days before President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, is sworn in.

98,NSC,"Investors could toast the third quarter, the strongest of the year, but September alone was about as exciting as a bottle of bubbly that gone's flat.In the third quarter, the S&P 500 rose 3.85%, lifting U.S. diversified stock mutual funds by 4.8% on average. The broad market advanced despite barely breaking even in September, nosing upward a modest 0.02%. Stock funds edged ahead a mere 0.22% last month.That raised stock funds to a 6.38% gain year to date.The stock market's start-and-stop motion in the third quarter has prompted many fund managers to plan ahead by sticking with names driven by strong trends, such as the shift to cloud computing, and with companies that seem capable of grinding out growth no matter how blah growth may be in the broader economy.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""The first half of the year saw more of a defensive-led rally,"" said Lew Piantedosi, a manager of seven Eaton Vance funds with $3.8 billion in total assets. ""But in Q3 that reversed. Cyclicals like tech and industrials did better.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersWorld equity funds advanced 6.42% in Q3, outperforming U.S. diversified stock funds. Last month, world equity funds rose 1.33%. China regional funds, which gained 11.36%, led the world equity market. In September they racked up a 2.39% return.If cyclical sectors stay hot, then stocks tied to transportation of industrial goods and commodities could continue their third-quarter gains. Piantedosi held Norfolk Southern (NSC), which gained 14% in the third quarter, in his Focused Growth Opportunities Class I (EIFGX) as of July 31.His Tax-Managed Growth 1.1 (EITMX) held Union Pacific (UNP), which rolled to a 12% gain.But what if most cyclicals lose their head of steam? Piantedosi prefers the long view.""I focus on big-picture growth trends that are sustainable despite shifting macro noise,"" he said.Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are sustainable growers.""They benefit from great secular tailwinds,"" he said. ""While those names have done well — especially Amazon — there's still a runway for them.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Brian Deagon analyzes the tailwinds driving Amazon. In the ""Buys & Sells"" column, Julie Mak points out that some leading mutual funds have been selling Alphabet and Amazon.Another plus for the tech sector is that acquisitions seem to be picking up, he says.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformancePiantedosi says investors should brace for volatility until the elections. A Democratic White House, with the Senate and House in Republican hands would mean continued gridlock, he says. Still, his impression is that support for tax reform is growing in both parties. ""That would be a huge positive,"" he said.In health care, he's wary of many drugmakers due to political calls for price regulation. Still, he likes Celgene (CELG), Vertex (VRTX) and Biogen (BIIB).""Biotechs feel a little safer (than non-biotech drugmakers),"" he said. ""They are doing wonderful things to cure big diseases. They combine positive reward-to-risk. And they're beaten up and trading at valuations at attractive valuations.""Within retail, he likes a few names.""It's an area to watch as we head into the holidays, especially some more apparel-oriented stocks,"" Piantedosi said. ""This is a short-term theme.""Macy's (M) has gone through markdowns after having to discount last year's overstock, he says. The mild winter dampened consumer demand for warm clothes. And competition is stiff from Amazon.""The company has done a great job managing inventories going into the holidays this year,"" Piantedosi said. ""Expectations are low. And they've been monetizing real estate"" by selling or closing unneeded locations.And he continues to like home-improvement giants Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD).""Housing is still strong,"" he said. ""Interest rates are still low. Consumers are OK. And (stock) prices have come in a little over fears of a housing slowdown.""Jeff Rottinghaus, T. Rowe Price manager of $1.6 billion Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $314.1 million U.S. Large-Cap Core (TRULX), says stock prices in general seem fairly priced. But he likes some names in health care, where prices have been pushed down.He calls Becton Dickinson (BDX), Medtronics (MDT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) ""quiet"" because none is under political pressure over drug pricing. Becton develops medical supplies, Medtronic develops implantable cardiac devices and other products and UnitedHealth is the industry's biggest managed-care provider.Yet Rottinghaus is shopping among biotechs because prices are so beaten down.He is underweight in the tech sector. But he likes companies benefiting from the secular trend of cloud computing's growth. Those include Alphabet and Microsoft (MSFT). He also likes the sustainable secular growth of Visa (V) and Facebook.Rottinghaus also likes NextEra Energy (NEE), which has a 2.9% dividend yield.""It's the largest renewable-energy generator in the U.S.,"" he said. ""Its dividend yield is roughly 3%. But we wouldn't own it without the low-double-digit earnings growth we expect from them.""Growth-oriented sectors led stock funds' third-quarter charge. Science-technology funds zoomed ahead 13.21% for the quarter on top of a 2.89% September gain.Health-biotechnology funds were also strong, manufacturing gains of 6.84% and 5.83% in the quarter.Small-cap growth funds gained 8.19% on average, leading all U.S. diversified stock fund categories.

Revenue fell 14% to $4.83 billion, lighter than consensus for $4.9 billion amid weak freight volumes, as industrial products shipments declined 18% and coal was down 43%.""An energy market recession, low commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar in a soft global economy and muted domestic retail demand all contributed to market weakness across many of our business lines,"" CEO Lance Fritz said in a written statement.Union Pacific shares climbed 4% in the stock market today, closing above their 200-day average for the first time in more than a year.The auto market, one of the few bright spots for railroads, remains robust, but Union Pacific executives said on the earnings call they are ""a little cautious"" about that sector. Some analysts and auto industry executives have said they see signs that auto sales growth may be leveling off or even topping.Still, General Motors (GM) crushed Q1 earnings estimates Thursday, helped by strong results in the U.S. and China. Shares rallied 1.5%.Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), which is recovering from its failed bid to acquire rival Norfolk Southern (NSC), reported on Wednesday a decline in Q1 revenue, but EPS rose 11% to $2.50, 10 cents better than what Wall Street expected. Shares rose 0.8% Thursday.Norfolk Southern is slated to report Q1 earnings after the market close on Thursday. Analyst consensus was for EPS to decline 3% to 97 cents on a 7% drop in revenue to $2.39 billion. Shares fell 0.6%.

113,NSC,"Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) ended efforts to buy Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) after the U.S. rail carrier rejected several proposals and opposition mounted to the merger plan backed by investor Bill Ackman.“With no clear path to a friendly merger at this time, we will turn all of our focus and energy to serving our customers and creating long term value for CP shareholders,” Canadian Pacific Chief Executive Officer Hunter Harrison said in a prepared statement Monday. The company said it had withdrawn a resolution asking Norfolk Southern shareholders to vote in favor of negotiations for a deal.“No further financial offers or overtures to meet with the NS board of directors are planned at this time,” Canadian Pacific said in a statement.Canadian Pacific has sought to acquire Norfolk Southern, the second-largest eastern U.S. railroad, to create a coast-to-coast network that it said would benefit shippers by reducing costs and congestion. Norfolk Southern rebuffed three offers, including one in December that valued the company at $27 billion, as “grossly inadequate,” while expressing concerns regulators would reject a tie-up.The U.S. Justice Department on Friday said Canadian Pacific’s intention to create a voting trust to allow Harrison to run Norfolk Southern in advance of a takeover should be rejected. A day earlier, the U.S. Army voiced opposition to the deal and the trust, saying it could harm national defense for two companies with “potentially competing interests” to be managed as one.Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management is the second-largest shareholder of Canadian Pacific, with a 9.1% stake, had advocated for the merger during conference calls with analysts and investors.

"
116,NSC,"Determined to establish a transcontinental railroad, Canadian Pacific (CP) has reportedly again gone shopping for a bigger fish -- in the form of a $20 billion deal with CSX (CSX) -- and again had its offer rebuffed.News of the proposed merger comes on the heels of Canadian Pacific's third offer for Norfolk Southern (NSC), which it approached in December with a $28 billion cash-and-stock deal. Norfolk rejected it, citing regulatory concerns about the merger, which would create North America's third-largest railroad behind Union Pacific (UNP) and BNSF, which is owned by Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).Reports said Canadian Pacific had previously approached CSX with a deal.Canadian Pacific mainly serves the West Coast, while CSX and Norfolk Southern focus on the East Coast. Norfolk Southern has been supported by other railroads in its effort to resist Canadian Pacific's overtures.In a prepared statement Wednesday, Canadian Pacific said it's considering taking legal action ""in response to recent actions by a number of major U.S. railroads who have stated publicly they are working collectively to block CP's efforts to pursue a pro-customer, competition-enhancing combination with Norfolk Southern Corp."" The statement didn't say what specific measures are being considered.Canadian Pacific Chief Executive Hunter Harrison told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that both offers are on the table, and that the railroad wants to keep its options open.With annual revenue of $6.7 billion, Canadian Pacific would be merging with a larger railroad in either case. CSX reported sales of roughly $11.8 billion in 2015, while Norfolk Southern had $10.5 billion revenue.Railroads have been battered in recent years by lower shipments of coal, as oil and natural gas prices have plunged, and by weak commodity prices globally. The Transportation-Rail group ranks a poor 133 on IBD's list of 197 industries.CSX Chief Financial Officer Frank Lonegro said at a Barclays conference on Feb. 17 that he expects coal shipments to fall another 20% this year and lowered CSX's earnings forecast.“Based on the trends so far this year, we expect volume to decline in the mid-high single digits this quarter and to gradually moderate as we move through the year,” Lonegro said. “We expect first-quarter earnings to decline significantly.""CSX shares fell 0.4% to 24.55 on the stock market today after rising to 25.20 intraday. Its stock rose to a 37.46 close on May 1, 2015, just shy of its all-time high and has fallen about 33% since then. Its quarterly revenue growth has shrunk at an increasing rate in the last three quarters, falling 6%, 9% and 13%, respectively. It is projected to decline 11.3% this quarter.Canadian Pacific has followed a similar pattern, with revenue growth shrinking for the last four quarters. Its stock fell 2.45%. Norfolk Southern was up 1.45%, rising above its 50-day line.Among other large railroads, Union Pacific fell 0.8%, and Kansas City Southern was up 1.4%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

117,NSC,"Hotels.com has an amusing TV character called “Captain Obvious” who makes humorous commercials by saying clearly obvious things. The CIA has a director who is the exact opposite — a “Captain Un-Reality” — who constantly makes absurd claims contrary to facts and common sense.During an National Public Radio interview last month, for example, CIA Director John Brennan made what may be the most bizarre statement ever by an U.S. intelligence official: “We don't steal secrets,” he said. “Everything we do is consistent with U.S. law. We uncover, we discover, we reveal, we obtain, we elicit, we solicit.”This was a ridiculous statement. Although the CIA is required to comply with U.S. law, one of its core missions is stealing secrets abroad through a variety of means that blatantly violate the laws of other nations. This is the nature of intelligence collection.That this CIA director would say something so preposterous is symptomatic of the damage the Obama administration has done to our national security with his assistance. It also is not the only example of Mr. Brennan’s denying the obvious.He has repeatedly echoed President Obama’s refusal to use the terms “jihadist” or “Islamist” to describe members of Islamic terrorist groups like al-Qaida and ISIS.  He explained this in a 2010 CSIS speech by disputing ties between these groups and Islam.Brennan also said in this speech that we should not label “our enemy as jihadists or Islamists because jihad is holy struggle, a legitimate tenet of Islam meaning to purify oneself of one’s community.”Brennan had a controversial tenure as President Obama’s assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism in the National Security Council.  He played a role in the administration’s decision to read Miranda rights to Umar Abdulmutallab, the so-called “underwear bomber” who tried to destroy a civilian airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009.Brennan also was widely criticized for defending this decision by falsely claiming that the Obama administration had continued a Bush administration policy.While at the NSC, Brennan also was involved in editing talking points drafted by the CIA on the 2011 attacks on the U.S. consulate Benghazi which said, contrary to available intelligence and State Department reporting, that the attacks were in response to an anti-Muslim video and were not a pre-planned terrorist attack.Reports of Brennan’s ineptitude have grown since he became CIA director in 2013.Brennan hurt his credibility in December 2014 when he responded to a report by the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Democratic members by straddling the fence on the CIA enhanced interrogation program -- by saying this program may have produced “useful information” but claimed the cause-and-effect relationship on whether the interrogations produced useful information “is unknowable.”This wishy-washy statement played into the hands of Senate Democrats and contradicted what three former CIA directors said about the program.Brennan needlessly damaged relations with Congress in 2015 by the clumsy way he handled the theft of CIA documents and the hacking of a CIA computer system by Senate Intelligence Committee staff members during their investigation of the enhanced interrogation program.Although the CIA had the legal right to investigate this incident by auditing agency computers used by the Senate staffers, this course of action caused a predictable uproar from Senate Democrats and sparked false charges that the CIA spied on Congress.Brennan should have instead privately raised this issue with Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein.Recently there were reports that Brennan has put diversity above national security with a new plan to base CIA recruitment and promotions on racial, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religion, socio-economic status and other quotas.Brennan began a massive reorganization of the CIA last year to place analysts and operations officers working side-by-side in “mission centers” dedicated to specific threats or geographic areas.I fear this reform will undermine CIA’s efforts to protect sensitive sources and methods, and exacerbate a growing problem of analysts emphasizing quick-turnaround assessments and support to paramilitary operations over objective and innovative analysis.The nonsensical comments and mismanagement by the CIA’s “Captain Unreality” director are disturbing signs that the lack of national-security-mindedness of this administration extends to the Central Intelligence Agency.It’s vital that the next president name competent managers to top intelligence posts prepared to enact significant reforms to undo the damage done by Brennan and the Obama administration to U.S. intelligence agencies -- so they can produce the hard-hitting intelligence that U.S. officials need to protect the security of our nation.Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy. He followed the Iranian nuclear issue for the CIA, the State Department and the House Intelligence Committee during his 25-year government career.

119,NSC,"Union Pacific (UNP) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue as the energy slump continues and economic conditions remain unstable.Union Pacific, the nation's largest railroad operator, reported that operating income dropped 8% to $8.1 billion. That translates to an 18.6% drop in earnings per share to $1.31 early Thursday, missing Wall Street's target by 9 cents. It was the first miss in three quarters.Revenue fell 15.4% to $5.21 billion. Analysts projected $5.45 billion. Overall volume was 9% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The company blamed energy market woes as well as broader economic conditions. Oil prices have tumbled more than 70% since mid-2014.For freight shipments, revenue for coal plunged 31%, while industrial products slid 23%. Tellingly, intermodal — containers used by trains, trucks and ships that carry consumer goods such as electronics — slid 14%, indicating weakness beyond the energy sector.Auto revenue was the only category that rose. It was up 1%.Union Pacific sees first-quarter volume down in the mid-single digits.""Overall economic conditions, uncertainty in the energy markets, commodity prices and the strength of the U.S. dollar will continue to have a major impact on our business this year,"" CEO Lance Fritz said in a statement.Union Pacific stock fell 3.55% to 71 on Thursday. That's well off its intraday high at 98.26 on Oct. 23. Union Pacific has a weak 45 IBD Composite Rating, meaning 55% of all stocks have performed better on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Canadian Pacific Railway, which is making a hostile bid for Norfolk Southern (NSC) in November, also reported weaker-than-expected Q4 earnings and revenue amid declining volume on weaker oil and coal shipments.Canadian Pacific shares rallied to close up 0.5% at 104.87 after tumbling to 97.09 intraday.Norfolk Southern, which is fighting Canadian Pacific's overtures, fell 1.6%. Kansas City Southern (KSU), slated to announce financial results Friday, rose 0.3%.CSX (CSX), which reported mixed results last week, rose 0.3% after losing 2% on Wednesday.

Analysts' consensus was for $2.85 billion.Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Ward warned, ""With negative global and industrial market trends projected for 2016, full-year earnings per share are expected to be down compared to 2015.""CSX shares fell 2.5% in late trading Tuesday after closing up 0.8%. Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Union Pacific (UNP) were both unchanged after hours.The CSX report comes as analyst reports point to increasing weakness in the rail sector, even suggesting that this could be a barometer for a possible economic downturn.Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Ken Hoexter said in a report Tuesday that the decline in rail car shipments lately has been the steepest since 2009, noting ""We believe rail data may be signaling a warning for the broader economy.""CSX earnings also come amid potential consolidation wave in the railroad industry.Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), backed by activist investor Bill Ackman, continues to pursue its hostile offer for Norfolk Southern.

On Wednesday, he said that he didn't expect opposition from Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) owns BNSF Railway, because BNSF operates in the West, while Norfolk is in the East.""I just can't image Mr. Buffett going to Washington and saying, 'Help me with these Canadians coming down in here and doing all these ugly things to us,'"" Bloomberg reported Harrison saying at a Credit Suisse conference.Norfolk Southern shares closed down 1.1% in Friday stock market trading after tumbling as low as 86.59 intraday.

125,NSC,"A $28 billion takeover pitch from Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) on Wednesday met with a straight-arm response from Norfolk Southern (NSC).A statement from Norfolk's management said that it would carefully evaluate what it called an ""unsolicited, low-premium, nonbinding and highly conditional indication of interest.""The pressure for rail consolidation comes as the industry reels from a steep fall-off in coal shipments to utilities and steel makers.Home construction and automotive markets have been bright spots, but agricultural goods — most notably fertilizer — have also been slow to rebound.The strongest element of demand, and a key factor in Canadian's interest in Norfolk, is rail-oil transport.Canadian Pacific officials set out goals of a 50% gain in revenue to more than $9 billion in 2018 vs. $6.79 billion this year.A third of the expected gains would come from oil shipments, they said.The targets depend on investment in western Canada to increase track speed limits and allow for heavier trains.Canadian also plans to expand multiple terminals in Alberta.In 2014, about 60% of Canadian Pacific's oil cargo was light crude produced from the Bakken shale in southern Saskatchewan.But company strategy calls for a turn toward safer, less volatile and more profitable-to-move tar sands crude from northern Alberta, which it said would soon account for two-thirds of Canadian Pacific's oil revenue.The company estimated that oil shipments would reach 200,000 carloads in 2015, up 67% over 2014 and 122% above 2013 levels.Norfolk Southern has also sharply increased its rail-oil shipments, moving 102,000 carloads of oil in 2014, up from 75,000 in 2013 and 22,000 in 2012.The company said that it hauled heavy crude from western Canada and light crude from North Dakota's Bakken fields.More critically, Norfolk operates a thicket of rail lines accessing the country's largest consumer markets and refineries from the Northeast down to the Gulf Coast.Canadian Pacific's lines connect Alberta's oil sands, U.S. and Canadian Bakken shale fields and Marcellus shale gas fields with Midwest refiners and West Coast export terminals, as well as the Toronto and Montreal markets.A combined Norfolk-Canadian railway would command 2015 revenue in the neighborhood of $17.4 billion, according to current estimates — still well below Union Pacific's (UNP) $22.1 billion.Any major rail merger faces significant regulatory hurdles, Norfolk warned.

138,NSC,"Rail operator Canadian Pacific (CP) on Wednesday made public the details of its bid for Norfolk Southern (NSC) — a 50/50 cash and stock deal Canadian said would create a safer, more efficient transcontinental railway — after Norfolk said late Tuesday it received the offer but reacted frostily to its terms.
"
139,NSC,"Canadian Pacific, whose interest in buying Norfolk was reported last week, said Norfolk Southern shareholders would get $46.72 in cash and 0.348 share of the new company for every share of Norfolk Southern, making the offer worth around $28 billion. The deal was worth 97.72 a share near midday Wednesday. The new company would run both rail operators.
"
140,NSC,"Canadian, which is Canada's No. 2 rail operator, said that by the time of the deal's closing, expected on Dec. 31, 2017, the new company would be worth $270.68 per share. Shareholders of Norfolk Southern, the eastern U.S.' No. 2 railway, would own 41% of the new company.
"
141,NSC,"Canadian said the deal could bring over $1.8 billion in operating synergies annually in the coming years, as well as ""substantial tax savings.""
"
142,NSC,"Those details, expressed in a letter dated Nov. 9 to Norfolk CEO James Squires from Canadian CEO Hunter Harrison, come after Norfolk on Tuesday said it would evaluate what it called ""an unsolicited, low-premium, nonbinding, highly conditional indication of interest from Canadian Pacific"" that represented ""a premium of less than 10%"" based on Tuesday's closing prices.
"
143,NSC,"""Notably, any consolidation among Class I railroads in North America would face significant regulatory hurdles,"" Norfolk said.
"
144,NSC,"Norfolk Southern has a market cap of around $27.7 billion, according to IBD data. Canadian Pacific has a market cap of nearly $23 billion.
"

"
146,NSC,"U.S. railroads have drawn more attention from regulators amid complaints of slower service and accidents in recent years. Railroads have also struggled as oil prices have sunk and demand for coal has waned.
"
147,NSC,"Canadian Pacific in its letter to Norfolk said the deal would ""deliver unsurpassed levels of safety,"" a sentiment it repeated through the letter. Canadian also said a merger with Norfolk would create ""a larger, more diversified book of business less dependent on volatile commodities such as crude oil or thermal coal"" and help thin out rail traffic in hubs like Chicago.
"
148,NSC,"The potential buyout has raised speculation of further consolidation in the rail industry.
"
149,NSC,"Union Pacific (UNP) rose 3.1%, Kansas City Southern (KSU) 4.2% and CSX Corp. (CSX) 4.5%.

204,NSC,"CSX (CSX), Union Pacific (UNP) and other railroads say that financial momentum for U.S. railroads in the second half of the year has lost some steam.Falling prices and volumes for coal and gas, plus weakness in exports as China's economy contracts, have impacted shipments.Lower fuel costs for trains, plus the improving U.S. economic outlook, including strong housing and auto markets, have offset the impact somewhat.CSX Chief Sales and Marketing Officer Fredrik Eliasson, formerly the company's chief financial officer, said at Cowen's Global Transportation Conference in Boston that he expects the second half of the year to be challenging, given continuing headwinds in its coal market.As a result, CSX cut its full-year earnings growth outlook to the mid-single digits, down from its earlier projection of mid-to-high single-digit EPS growth for 2015, Eliasson said.""While we continue to target flat earnings per share for the third quarter, achieving that estimate will be more challenging given the weaker than expected volumes,"" Eliasson said.Overall, the volume of goods carried is down about 2% in the current quarter compared to the same period a year ago, with both coal and merchandise markets tracking slightly below the company's original third-quarter forecast.Late Tuesday, CSX CEO Michael Ward announced that Oscar Munoz had resigned as president. Clarence Gooden, previously chief sales and marketing officer, was promoted to replace him amid a management shakeup.Eliasson was named chief sales and marketing officer. Frank Lonegro, former vice president of service design, replaced Eliasson as CFO, and Cindy Sanborn was named chief operating officer of CSX Transportation, moving over from her prior position as executive vice president of operations.CSX closed down 0.7% in Wednesday trading on the stock market today.Union Pacific Chief Financial Officer Rob Knight said at the Cowen conference that crude oil shipments for the No. 1 railroad by revenue spiked a few years ago, peaking at 163,000 carloads in 2013 and falling to just 49,000 for the first half of 2015.Offsetting that somewhat are higher grain and auto shipments, which are up from the same time last year. As Knight noted, IHS Global Insights forecasts that U.S. light vehicle sales will rise to 17.1 million vehicles this year from 16.4 million in 2014.Knight added that Union Pacific is expanding in Mexico and expects a record 956,000 carloads there this year, up from 882,000 in 2014.Union Pacific fell 1%. Its stock hit an all-time intraday high at 124.5 on Feb. 13 and has fallen steadily since then. It's trading well below its 50-day and 200-day averages.Norfolk Southern (NSC) Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw acknowledged near-term headwinds associated with declining commodity prices but said that its international volume continues to grow amid rising shipments from both East Coast and West Coast ports. Norfolk Southern was up fractionally.Smaller railroad Genesee & Wyoming (GWR) said Wednesday that global volume by carload for August rose 41.6% to 253,807 carloads after it bought London-based Freightliner in March.But same-railroad traffic, minus new cars and acquisitions, in August was 155,743 carloads, a drop of 13.1% or 23,441 carloads. North American traffic in August on a same-railroad basis fell 12.6% due in part to lower coal and metals shipments. Genesee & Wyoming fell 0.3%.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

232,NSC,"Kansas City Southern (KSU) said it's reached an agreement to build a storage rail yard that it will lease to diversified firm Sasol Chemicals, which is building an $8.1 billion facility, including six chemical plants, in West Lake, La.The companies did not immediately provide financial terms.The project could help Kansas City Southern rebuild its revenue base, which along with profit growth has fallen due to weakness in the energy market. Like peers such as America's largest railroad Union Pacific (UNP), Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Canadian Pacific (CP), it's been hurt by low commodity prices in coal, oil, gas and steel.On May 14, Kansas City Southern withdrew its revenue and volume guidance and cut its capital spending target, citing uncertainty around energy markets and unfavorable currency rates. The railroad said at the time that its revenue was down by 50% and number of carloads had fallen nearly 40% from the same quarter a year ago.The railroad will build the storage-in-transit rail yard for Sasol and also replace and expand its existing rail car yard in nearby Mossville, La., to support Sasol's ethane cracking facility, which is expected to be completed by 2018.Ethane cracking is a process of converting ethane extracted from natural gas to create ethylene, a widely used chemical in the petrochemical industry.Kansas City Southern shares were down 0.8% to 93.37 in late morning trading in the stock market today, Monday. It closed at 90.02 on May 29, its lowest point since mid-January 2013. It has a poor 30 IBD Composite Rating, meaning 70% of stocks have performed better in recent quarters on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.The Transportation Rail Group is rated a near-worst 196 on IBD's list of 197 industries.

262,NSC,"Stocks on Monday failed to hold onto the early gains — as worries over the macro data, dollar strength and earnings once again weighed on traders' minds. All of the averages pulled back to end the day in negative territory. In my opinion — the action was more about profit taking after the move higher late last week and yesterday morning - all ahead of what could be more volatility and weakness in the days ahead. Will reports play on the strong dollar as a reason for the weakened earnings? Will they blame the consumer? Will it be global economic weakness? I mean estimates have already been slashed for all of these reasons — so will it just be more of the same?
"
263,NSC,"Today brings us JPMorgan Chase (JPM) & Wells Fargo (WFC) — later in the week they will be joined by Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) …. in what will the 1st qtr look like for the financials. Rising legal and regulatory expenses, slowing mortgage lending, a decrease in trading revenues, a collapsing energy space all will play into the mix… YTD - though, financials have underperformed the broader mkt.....down about 2% for the group....followed only by energy and utilities.......
"
264,NSC,"But like we said — earnings represent history — what is important is what the future looks like….and recently the Credit Managers Index (CMI) has reported an increase in rejected credit applications — this spike coming only in the last month — too late for any real impact on 1st qtr earnings but a clear indicator of what may be in store. With credit tight once again — will it bring the country to a grinding halt? Look — lending can be a risky business and with the global economy still struggling, along with the exposure created by the collapsing oil mkt, coupled with the threat of rising US interest rates — the future is anything but clear. But remember — investment bankers are keen to play with the numbers - they are well known for redefining common accounting practices...but hey.....it works for them and the regulators don't seem to mind.....……so what rabbit will they pull out of the hat? I do not expect them to 'miss the numbers' JPM announces early - and earnings are expected to +8% at $1.39/sh on revenues of $24.4 bil or a 2% increase yoy, WFC on the other hand is due to report a bit weaker numbers... 98 cents/sh - a 7% decline on revenues of $21.2 bil.

266,NSC,"Last night after the bell - we heard from Norfolk Southern (NSC) - in pre-release commentary - they prepared investors for a disappointment - not because of the dollar ..Oh No....it was because of 'lower fuel SURCHARGE revenue'.....(and lower coal shipments).....but isn't this just a kick in the pants? Oil declines in price bringing untold benefits to transportation companies along with a host of others and now Norfolk Southern tells us that earnings could be down 15% because they CAN'T charge higher fuel surcharges?
"
267,NSC,"(A surcharge is an ADD'L charge or payment on top of a regular cost.....so if investors are buying Norfolk - because they are able to increase revenues by increasing surcharges - then someone should think about a new portfolio manager......Surcharges do not represent organic growth, or an improved outlook - they only represent the ability of companies to fleece their clients with add'l fees etc......

All of the averages pulled back to end the day in negative territory. In my opinion — the action was more about profit taking after the move higher late last week and yesterday morning - all ahead of what could be more volatility and weakness in the days ahead. Will reports play on the strong dollar as a reason for the weakened earnings? Will they blame the consumer? Will it be global economic weakness? I mean estimates have already been slashed for all of these reasons — so will it just be more of the same?Today brings us JPMorgan Chase (JPM) & Wells Fargo (WFC) — later in the week they will be joined by Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) …. in what will the 1st qtr look like for the financials. Rising legal and regulatory expenses, slowing mortgage lending, a decrease in trading revenues, a collapsing energy space all will play into the mix… YTD - though, financials have underperformed the broader mkt.....down about 2% for the group....followed only by energy and utilities.......But like we said — earnings represent history — what is important is what the future looks like….and recently the Credit Managers Index (CMI) has reported an increase in rejected credit applications — this spike coming only in the last month — too late for any real impact on 1st qtr earnings but a clear indicator of what may be in store. With credit tight once again — will it bring the country to a grinding halt? Look — lending can be a risky business and with the global economy still struggling, along with the exposure created by the collapsing oil mkt, coupled with the threat of rising US interest rates — the future is anything but clear. But remember — investment bankers are keen to play with the numbers - they are well known for redefining common accounting practices...but hey.....it works for them and the regulators don't seem to mind.....……so what rabbit will they pull out of the hat? I do not expect them to 'miss the numbers' JPM announces early - and earnings are expected to +8% at $1.39/sh on revenues of $24.4 bil or a 2% increase yoy, WFC on the other hand is due to report a bit weaker numbers... 98 cents/sh - a 7% decline on revenues of $21.2 bil.In healthcare — Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is the bellwether...and they are also due to report....here investors will be keenly aware of the $ impact - but remember - like Alcoa (AA) - Johnson & Johnson should also see a benefit from overseas operations that are helped by weaker currencies abroad - it's not all about the $.....I'm just sayin.....Last night after the bell - we heard from Norfolk Southern (NSC) - in pre-release commentary - they prepared investors for a disappointment - not because of the dollar ..Oh No....it was because of 'lower fuel SURCHARGE revenue'.....(and lower coal shipments).....but isn't this just a kick in the pants? Oil declines in price bringing untold benefits to transportation companies along with a host of others and now Norfolk Southern tells us that earnings could be down 15% because they CAN'T charge higher fuel surcharges?(A surcharge is an ADD'L charge or payment on top of a regular cost.....so if investors are buying Norfolk - because they are able to increase revenues by increasing surcharges - then someone should think about a new portfolio manager......Surcharges do not represent organic growth, or an improved outlook - they only represent the ability of companies to fleece their clients with add'l fees etc......

316,NSC,"Following a tour of Canadian National Railway 's (CNI) Chicago operation, RBC Capital Markets said the railroad operator is positioned ""to sustain an industry-leading financial and operating performance"" in one of the nation's strongest sectors of the economy.With an IBD Composite Rating of 99, Canadian National ranks No. 1 in IBD's Transportation-Rail group. The group itself ranks No. 8 of 197 industries tracked, helped by heavy demand for oil and gas transportation.Other leading stocks in the group include three names on the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks: Kansas City Southern (KSU) and Union Pacific (UNP) — both of which also have a 99 Composite Rating — along with Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), with a rating of 98. Also high-ranking in the group is Norfolk Southern (NSC), with a rating of 95.In a note released Monday, RBC Capital analyst Walter Spracklin said he came away from a tour of Canadian National's Chicago operations ""with increased confidence in the company's operating model in this region.""The tour included a ride on the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern railway (EJ&E), which Canadian National acquired in 2009.Spracklin said the EJ&E ""provides control and fluidity in North America's most congested rail freight interchange."" Since taking over the operation, Canadian National has cut the travel time around Chicago from more than 24 hours to a range of four to six hours, he added.""In addition to the velocity benefits, this unencumbered route around Chicago has given (Canadian National) a significant competitive advantage as the company was able to quickly regain fluidity when extreme weather subsided earlier this year,"" Spracklin noted.In contrast, industry performance data suggest that other Class 1 railroad operators ""remain severely impacted by congestion in this region,"" he said. ""With the construction of two more connections on the EJ&E under way, we see upside to the velocity and efficiency gains that Canadian National has achieved to date.""Meanwhile, Canadian National continues to expand its Kirk Yard freight yard property, located southeast of Chicago in Northwest Indiana.The $142 million expansion program is expected to lift the yard's processing capacity by about 80% to 3,200 cars a day, Spracklin noted. ""With increased throughput capacity at Kirk Yard, (Canadian National) will consolidate classification activities in this location, freeing up space at other yards in the Chicago area.""In addition, he said, Canadian National ""will be able to build trains that can bypass other major yards, resulting in longer, more efficient hauls and taking pressure off of other high-traffic parts of the network.""Shares of Canadian National, which fell slightly in midday trading on the stock market today, are up about 24% since the beginning of the year. However, the stock is down about 6% from a Sept. 18 peak. The group is up 18% for the year to date.

319,NSC,"Investors interested in stocks from the Transportation - Rail sector have probably already heard of Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) and Canadian Pacific (CP  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Norfolk Southern has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Canadian Pacific has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that NSC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.NSC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.19, while CP has a forward P/E of 18.27. We also note that NSC has a PEG ratio of 1.52. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CP currently has a PEG ratio of 1.56.Another notable valuation metric for NSC is its P/B ratio of 2.71. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CP has a P/B of 5.23.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to NSC's Value grade of B and CP's Value grade of C.NSC stands above CP thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that NSC is the superior value option right now.

But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.NSC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.19, while CP has a forward P/E of 18.27. We also note that NSC has a PEG ratio of 1.52. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CP currently has a PEG ratio of 1.56.Another notable valuation metric for NSC is its P/B ratio of 2.71. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CP has a P/B of 5.23.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to NSC's Value grade of B and CP's Value grade of C.NSC has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than CP, so it seems like value investors will conclude that NSC is the superior option right now.

321,NSC,"Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) reported impressive traffic figures for June owing to low air fares. Notably, traffic increased 7% year over year to 12.6 million in the month. In fact, the passenger count in June was the highest so far (April, May and June) at Ryanair in fiscal 2019. Passenger count in April and May were 12.3 million and 12.5 million, respectively. We note that Ryanair’s fiscal year ends on Mar 31.Coming back to the June traffic report, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) came in at an impressive 96% buoyed by strong demand for air travel. The metric improved from the May 2018 reading of 95%. However, load factor was flat on a year-over-year basis.The impressive June traffic report provides some relief to this European low-cost carrier, which has been struggling with labor-related issues for quite some time. Ryanair’s pilots, based in Ireland, are scheduled to go on a 24-hour strike on Jul 12 in protest against management’s approach toward transfers between the carrier’s European and African bases. The strike, if it materializes, might hamper travel plans of many passengers as Jul 12 marks the beginning of the traditional holiday fortnight in Northern Ireland.Adding to its woes, Ryanair ‘s cabin staff in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain will go on strike on Jul 25 and 26 against management inaction as far as their demands pertaining to higher pay and better working conditions are concerned. What is worse is that more strikes may follow if the labor unrest is not resolved.The ongoing labor problems have been responsible for the 8.4% decline in the Ryanair stock over the last three months.Three-Month Price Performance  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderRyanair has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report).

322,NSC,"Investors looking for stocks in the Transportation - Rail sector might want to consider either Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) or Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that NSC's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.NSC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.73, while UNP has a forward P/E of 18.51. We also note that NSC has a PEG ratio of 1.48. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. UNP currently has a PEG ratio of 1.74.Another notable valuation metric for NSC is its P/B ratio of 2.62. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, UNP has a P/B of 4.46.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to NSC's Value grade of B and UNP's Value grade of C.NSC stands above UNP thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that NSC is the superior value option right now.

323,NSC,"The first-quarter earnings season is well into its latter half with more than 81% of the S&P 500 members having unveiled their quarterly results already. The picture that has emerged so far is quite encouraging and the Q1 earnings season remains on track to end on a strong note, displaying substantial growth.According to our latest Earnings Preview, total earnings and revenues for companies in the S&P 500 space are projected to expand 23.2% and 8.7%, on a year-over-year basis. Both figures compare favorably with the readings in Q4, when bottom line expanded 13.4% and revenues grew 8.1%. The bullish Q1 projection can be attributed to factors like the corporate tax overhaul apart from an improving economy and a much-improved job market.Given the prevalent healthy scenario, it is quite natural that the sectors should deliver an impressive performance. In fact, per the above report, all the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to end Q1 with year-over-year earnings growth. Moreover, 13 are anticipated to display double-digit earnings growth.One of the13 sectors is Transportation. Majority of the sector participants, including all S&P 500 members, have already reported financial numbers. Despite high fuel costs, the sector has seen key players like Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) reporting better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues.Outperformers Still Left in the BankWith most transportation players having already unveiled their Q1 numbers, only a handful reports from the space are still to come. Most of those companies belong to the shipping space. In fact, the scenario surrounding shippers is quite positive in view of the surge in the Baltic Dry Index (a gauge of the shipping costs of raw materials such as iron ore, coal and grain) recently.How to Pick the Winners?Given the bullish sentiment surrounding shipping stocks, it would not be a bad idea to add companies from the space, which have the potential of reporting better-than-expected earnings in Q1, to one’s portfolio. An earnings beat more often than not boosts investor confidence in the stocks, which translates into rapid price appreciation.However, given the high degree of diversity in the shipping space, the task is by no means easy. In fact, it is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, our proprietary methodology -- Earnings ESP -- makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You could further narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Our ChoicesWith the aid of the above methodology, we hereby present three shipping stocks that are expected to outshine earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Golden Ocean Group Limited (GOGL  -  Free Report), based in Hamilton, Bermuda,focuses on the transportation of dry bulk cargoes. It operates primarily in the Capesize and Panamax market.It has an Earnings ESP of +33.33%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 4 cents per share is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat. Golden Ocean Group will unveil its results on May 31.Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (SBLK  -  Free Report) is a Greece-based leading global shipping company in the dry bulk sector. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.08% and Zacks Rank #3. Star Bulk is expected to reveal its results on May 23.Our third choice is Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation (NNA  -  Free Report). This Monaco-based company is a provider of marine transportation services. The company has an Earnings ESP of +5.56% and Zacks Rank #3.  Navios Maritime is scheduled to reveal its results on May 10.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

324,NSC,"The transportation sector is riding high on first-quarter financial results, with total earnings from 97.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization, reported so far, up 20.9% on revenue growth of 8.7%. Both revenue and earnings surprises of 76.9% also seem impressive.This is because most of the key industry players managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both, while a few lagged.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.55 surpassed the earnings estimate by a penny while revenues of $17.11 billion edged past the estimated $16.44 billion. For fiscal 2018, the company continued to expect earnings per share in the range of $7.03-$7.37. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $7.22 (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).The major railroads – Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) – beat on both the top and the bottom lines while Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) missed. UNP and NSC surpassed the earnings estimate by 3 cents and 16 cents, respectively, and revenue estimates by $104 million and $35 million. On the other hand, earnings of $1.30 at KSU lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by five cents while revenues of $639 million were also marginally below our estimated $644 million.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat the earnings estimate by three cents and revenue estimate by $30 million.The two largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results. Earnings of 74 cents and revenues of $9.97 billion at Delta edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents and $9.91 billion, respectively. For the second quarter of 2018, the carrier expects earnings per share in the range of $1.80-$2.00 (read: ETFs & Stocks to Fly High on Record Spring Travel).At United Continental, earnings per share of 50 cents came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and revenues of $9.03 billion slightly edged past the estimated $9.01 billion. The company raised the lower end of the earnings per share to $7.00-$8.50 for the year from $6.50-$8.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $7.83.Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) came in couple of cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues were $76 million above the estimate.ETFs in FocusWhile the string of solid results from industry players made the case for transport ETFs appealing, a jump in oil price and a rise in dollar led to losses over the past month. As such, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report), SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR) shed 0.8%, 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX) at 14.7%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 47% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.2% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $804.5 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 248,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (read: Transport ETFs to Ride High on Huge Earnings Beat by FedEx).XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 42 stocks in its basket. The in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 31.2% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines, and air freight & logistics take one-fourth share each. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $225.6 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 34,000 shares a day.FTXRThis fund offers exposure to the 30 most-liquid U.S. transportation securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Transportation Index. The in-focus eight firms account for a combined 24% share. FTXR has accumulated $3.6 million in its asset base and charges 60 bps in annual fees.

Kansas City Southern’s operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated to 65.8% from 65.4% a year ago.  Operating expenses rose 5% in the quarter.We note that lesser the value of operating ratio the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks.

329,NSC,"Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the market opens.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.3%. Moreover, an encouraging earnings history shows the stock having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.2%.However, the scenario pertaining to this to-be-reported quarter does not appear too bright and this can further be gauged from the stock’s southbound estimate revision. The consensus mark for earnings has been revised 2.7% downward in the last 30 days.Factors at PlaySluggish coal and automotive revenues are expected to hurt the top line in the first quarter. Notably, at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials conference, the company stated that automotive and coal volumes declined 7% and 6%, respectively, as of Mar 10. Automotive weakness is thus anticipated to hurt the broader merchandise segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter coal revenues is pegged at $401 million, lower than $426 million reported in the previous quarter. The consensus mark for automotive in the quarter to be reported stands at $236 million, also falling below the past quarter’s $242 million.Additionally, the company’s high-debt levels raise concerns. Apart from a rise in the immediate finance costs, the high leverage ratio will require significant cash flows for repayments.However, higher volumes are expected to aid results. We expect the intermodal unit to perform impressively in the first quarter of 2018.The company’s cost-cutting efforts are also projected to generate significant cost savings, thereby boosting the bottom line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The company’s initiatives to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are also encouraging. In January, the company raised its quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88) from 61 cents (annualized $2.44).Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Norfolk Southern is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Norfolk Southern has an Earnings ESP of -0.50% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.76 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.77. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Norfolk Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, combined with the company’s negative ESP leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Norfolk Southern Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Norfolk Southern Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Norfolk Southern Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider stocks like American Airlines Group Inc.

331,NSC,"Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) reported lower-than-expected earnings and revenues in first-quarter 2018. Results were hurt by rough weather conditions.The company’s earnings (excluding 23 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.13 per share (C$2.70) lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16.

332,NSC,"Shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have gained 32.1% in a year’s time, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry’s rally of 23.1%.Reasons Behind the Impressive Price PerformanceThis railroad operator has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate.We note that a history of positive earnings surprise generally works as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass the estimates. So, investors take it in their consideration while betting on the stock, with an expectation that the company will do the same trick to outpace the estimates in the upcoming release.The most recent earnings beat came last month when this Norfolk, VA- based company reported first-quarter 2018 results. The earnings outperformance apart, it also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues. Both the metrics also improved on a year-over- year basis. Furthermore, its intermodal unit performed very well in the quarter. Intermodal revenues and volumes increased 19% and 7%, respectively.Also,Norfolk Southern’s cost-control efforts are impressive. To this end, the company’s operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) improved 70 basis points in the first quarter. The company aims to achieve an operating ratio below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. Annual productivity savings in excess of $650 million are expected by 2020.In fact, the lesser the value of operating ratio the better as it implies that more cash is available with the company to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks.Earlier in 2018, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an 18% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88 per share) driven by the new tax law. Norfolk Southern shelled out $205 million as dividends in the first quarter of 2018. Of late, the company also raised its current-year buyback target to $1.5 billion.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We believe the new tax law is a blessing for Transportation companies like Norfolk Southern. This is because the huge savings induced by the new law might result in an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities. Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also hiked dividend payouts recently owing to the new tax law.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

333,NSC,"A higher number of Americans are gearing up for a busy summer travel season. Be it by road or air, Americans this time are encouraged to travel thanks to a booming economy and growing consumer confidence.This is especially true as the frenzy for trips during the Memorial Day Weekend is far more than the past decade despite the highest gasoline prices in four years. Orlando, FL is expected to be the top destination, followed by Seattle, WA and Honolulu, HI.According to travel service provider American Automobile Association (AAA), Memorial Day weekend travel is expected to rise for the fourth straight year. More than 41.5 million Americans will travel 50 miles (80 km) over the Memorial Day weekend (May 24-28), up nearly 5% from the last year and the most in more than a dozen years. Of them, 36.6 million will go on a road trip, 3.1 million will fly, and 1.8 million will travel by train and other modes (including buses and cruises).Though road trip is expected to rise 4.7% over last year, motorists are expected to pay the highest gas price since 2014. Gas averaged $2.72 per gallon in April, up 33 cents from last year. However, travelers’ wallets will find some relief when paying for airfare, car rentals, and most mid-range hotels.This is because airfares are 7% lower than the last Memorial Day for an average $168 round-trip on the top 40 domestic routes while the average daily cost of a car rental is 11% cheaper and the lowest in the past four years, per AAA’s Leisure Travel Index. Meanwhile, AAA Three Diamond hotels are 14% cheaper than last year at an average rate of $186 per night.Huge travel demand should boost revenues and profitability for transporters, including airlines and railroads, thereby leading to higher share prices. Investors shouldn’t miss this opportunity and could tap this trend through any of the following stocks that stand to profit big time from the upbeat Memorial Day weekend travel trend.Echo Global Logistics Inc.

334,NSC,"There is no doubt that the new tax law has been a big positive for railroads and should be instrumental in driving growth for the industry. The new tax law apart, other factors like a buoyant U.S. economy and intermodal growth act as major tailwinds for this key sector.These positives notwithstanding, there are a few factors that raise concerns for railroads. Let’s dig deep on the subject.Sluggish Automotive Production – A Key ChallengeWeakness in the automotive sector has been hurting railroads for quite some time, with domestic production declining substantially. The scenario was not vastly different in the final quarter of 2017 as well. Results of major railroad operators like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) were hurt by soft automotive volumes.What’s worse is that the situation is unlikely to improve in the current year.Union Pacific on its fourth-quarter conference call said that light vehicle sales for full-year 2018 are projected at 16.9 million units, reflecting a 2% decline from the 2017 levels. Norfolk Southern, meanwhile, said that it expects automotive volume to lag vehicle production in the United States.These disappointing commentaries on the automotive sector do not bode well for railroads. As a significant portion of revenues is accounted for by this key sector, weakness pertaining to automotive production in the United States is a major headwind for railroads.Service IssuesCSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) was plagued by service disruptions last year, which severely dented its operations. However, the railroad took measures to combat the issue. The Precision Scheduled Railroading system, implemented by the company's former CEO, E. Hunter Harrison, seems to be paying off. The system generated efficiency-related savings to the tune of $460 million in 2017.However, service issues now seem to be hurting Canadian railroad operator, Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report). In fact, the company has been facing a number of challenges related to network congestion for the past few months, which have hurt its operational performance. Further, oilfield service major, Halliburton Company's (HAL  -  Free Report) statement issued in February 2018 that Canadian National’s service delays have been affecting its bottom line, underlines the gravity of this situation.Additionally, rival Canadian Pacific Railway Limited’s (CP  -  Free Report) commentary about its increasing network fluidity highlights the fact that these operational issues might affect Canadian National’s customer base and adversely impact its growth prospects, unless resolved quickly.Canadian National announced a change at its helm, in March 2018, in order to primarily address the service issues. The new CEO (interim) has apologized to its customers for the service woes. He has promised an improvement on the service front. However, in the event of management change failing to yield the desired results, the stock would be hurt further.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.NAFTANAFTA refers to the trade pact inked in 1994 between the United States, Canada and Mexico in a bid to secure better terms for domestic workers. NAFTA has basically done away with almost all tariffs among the three nations. However, President Trump has in fact threatened to withdraw from the agreement, if the negotiations, which are currently in progress, fail to yield the desired results. He believes that it is a bad deal, not in favor of American workers.The uncertainty over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) continues to hurt railroads, especially the ones like Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report). A significant portion of Kansas City Southern’s revenues come from U.S.-Mexico shipment. In fact, many railroads including Kansas City Southern are not in favor of the U.S. scrapping NAFTA. They believe that such a move might put pressure on supply chains, jobs and consumers apart from having adverse political implications.However, the President has stuck to his guns and imposed a deadline of May 1 pertaining to the NAFTA negations. Beyond that date, there will be imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada.Railroads would be hoping for a favorable resolution to the issue as an unfavorable development on this key issue might dampen their prospects severely.Other HeadwindsPresident Trump’s plans to shift focus to traditional energy businesses such as coal is aimed at benefiting the coal industry and therefore railroads. This is because the fortunes of railroads are tied to coal.However, even if the Obama-era Clean Power Plan (CPP) is repealed, as wished by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), coal revenues might not pick up. In the current year, the EIA predicts coal production to be 736 million short tons (MMst), down 5% year over year.Moreover, many are not in favor of repealing the CPP due to fears of environmental hazards among others. Furthermore, the process of repealing CPP is time-consuming. With uncertainty regarding CPP’S fate, a major overhang on railroad shares would remain until there is clarity on this key issue.Even if legislative and regulatory measures hindering the coal industry come into effect more vigorously, the commodity’s long-term competitive position has materially been weakened by the abundant and largely cheap natural gas supplies. In other words, railroads will benefit from  some incremental improvements in coal shipments, but the long-term trend is in the opposite direction.  Check out our latest Railroad Industry Outlook for more news on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend looks ahead for this important sector at the moment.
"
335,NSC,"After being laid low by declining coal shipments for the last few years, stocks in the railroad space performed well over the past year. The outlook for coal shipments has notably improved, given the favorable regulatory backdrop under the current administration.The improvement can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to this key revenue-generating commodity in the final quarter of 2017. For example, at Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 5.7%, while the same at CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) rose 4% year over year. At Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), revenues improved 115% at the energy segment on the back of impressive performances at Frac Sand and Crude Oil units.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Railroads are expected to perform well in the first quarter of 2018 as well with coal continuing to show improvements. In fact, under the Trump administration, the coal industry is seeing better days. In a bid to revive the industry, the President has made it clear that he intends to relax regulations that were detrimental to its prospects.Rising natural gas prices also bode well as far as demand for coal is concerned. Since revenues from coal account for a significant portion of railroads’ top line, any positive development toward the commodity augurs well for the sector.Intermodal Strength Augurs WellThe intermodal unit is another key source of revenues for railroads. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the intermodal unit performed reasonably well for the key railroads. For example at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), freight revenues from the segment increased 4% year over year. At Norfolk Southern, intermodal revenues rose 14.5% year over year. At Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CP  -  Free Report), intermodal revenues increased 7%.In fact, intermodal volumes increased significantly in 2017 after a lackluster 2016. According to the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA), intermodal volumes improved 5.8% year over year in the final quarter of 2017. Growth on the international front contributed to the impressive performance of this key segment in 2017.In fact, according to many market watchers, the segment is expected to perform strongly in the current year as well driven by a significant rise in international business.New Tax Law a Huge PositiveOn Dec 22, 2017, Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). Under the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package, corporate tax rates have been slashed significantly. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow, which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors railroads as they invest substantially in capital expenditures.As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. For example, Norfolk Southern expects the effective tax rate to come down to around 24% from 35.4% recorded in 2017.Uptick in Shareholder-Friendly Activities LikelyThe likes of Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) have already announced dividend hikes this year. A further increase in shareholder-friendly activities (dividends as well as buybacks) is likely in the wake of the massive savings prompted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Improvement in Operating Ratio Another PositiveOperating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is an important metric to gauge the performance of railroads. The lesser the value of operating ratio the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks.In fact, many key railroads witnessed improvement with respect to the metric in the final quarter of 2017. At Norfolk Southern, the metric improved 150 basis points last year on a year-over-year basis. Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. Annual productivity savings in excess of $650 million are expected by 2020.Further, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space. Moreover, the significant investments made by railroads to promote safety and enhance productivity are also encouraging.To ConcludeWe expect railroads to perform well going forward on the back of these positives. Moreover, a strong U.S. economy supports the bullish case for railroads, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the country.We believe that in light of factors like better coal and intermodal volumes, Trump’s pro-coal stance and industrial growth, investors should look at stocks in the space with renewed interest.Check out our latest Railroad Industry Outlook for more news on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend looks ahead for this important sector at the moment.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

336,NSC,"Freight railroad is vital for domestic freight as it accounts for around 40% of the U.S. transport sector. A strong U.S. economy supports the bullishness of freight railroad operators, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the country.The robust financial health of railroads bears testimony to the fact that the scenario has improved considerably for players in this industry, after having been battered by coal-related headwinds over the last few years. This indicates that freight railroad stocks will provide good return in the long-term.Coal Price, Intermodal Volume Improvement Boosts RailwaysThe turnaround of this key industry can be attributed to an improvement in the coal-related scenario. This is because coal is considered as a key revenue-generating commodity for railroads.On Feb 16, U.S. Energy Information Association (“EIA”) estimated that U.S. coal production for 2017 will amount to 773 million short tons (MMst), This figure is 45 MMst higher than 2016 as well as the largest year-over-year tonnage increase since 2001. The agency also stated that the coal prices across the United States rose in 2017, especially for Central Appalachian coal.Moreover, prospects of the coal industry have brightened because of President Trump’s pro-coal stance, wherein he promised to relax emissions rules. Higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in global market have also given a boost to the demand for this key commodity. As the fortunes of most railroad operators depend on coal, any positive development related to this commodity augurs well for railroads.Improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth policies of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  Further, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space.Robust AAR DataThe Association of American Railroads (“AAR”), the industry body of the class 1 freight railroad operators, reported that U.S. rail traffic (including carloads and intermodal units) stood at 534,282 for the week ended Mar 10, 2018. This reflects an increase of 1.6% year over year. Six of the 10 carload commodity groups posted an increase compared with the same week in 2017. Total combined U.S. rail traffic (including carloads and intermodal units) for the first 10 weeks of 2018 was 5,193,970, up 2% year over year.Railroads should continue to witness an improvement pertaining to another key metric - operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in 2018. The lesser the value of operating ratio, the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks.Over a year, the Zacks Rail Industry increased 17.5%. In comparison, stock price of five major railroad operators, Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report)  and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), rallied 29.1%, 21.5%, 19.9%, 18.4% and 17.2%, respectively. Each of these stocks has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineImprovement in the prospects of key units like coal and intermodal has been benefiting railroads since the beginning of the year. These positives will further drive the stock price of freight railroad operators.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

337,NSC,"Shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have gained 13.8% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry’s rally of 10.2%. Let’s take a look into the factors responsible for the impressive price performance and see if the company can add new feathers in its cap.In January 2018, Norfolk Southern reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017. The metrics also improved on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by volume growth owing to impressive performances at the key segments like coal, merchandise and intermodal.Moreover, the company’s efforts to cut costs in order to drive its bottom line are impressive. Improvement in operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is a positive as well. The metric has improved 150 basis points in 2017 on a year-over-year basis. Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. Annual productivity savings in excess of $650 million are expected by 2020.Additionally, the company’s focus on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and dividends are encouraging. In keeping with the objective of rewarding shareholders, the company announced an 18% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88 per share) in January. In fact, it has shelled out $703 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth $1 billion in 2017.Apart from Norfolk Southern, fellow railroad operators like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have raised dividend payouts recently. Last year, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) had hiked its quarterly dividend as well.Furthermore, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, proved conducive for the company. Norfolk Southern expects effective tax rate to come down to around 24% from 35.4% recorded in 2017. The resultant savings is anticipated to increase the shareholder-friendly activities. Moving ahead, the company envisions intermodal and merchandise networks to drive growth.Estimate Revisions & Zacks RankUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism about a stock’s prospects. Norfolk Southern scores impressively on this front too.

340,NSC,"Stocks in the railroad space are being aided by momentum in the U.S. economy, with more goods being transported across the country.The market is expected to continue its winning streak, banking on a rise in wages and more confident consumers. Moreover, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) should boost profits further and drive stock prices of the participants of this key sector higher.The robust financial health of railroads is reflective of the improved scenario for its players. The rebound has been aided by the much-improved scenario pertaining to the intermodal unit, a key revenue generating sector for railroads.The sector has bounced back after a disappointing 2016. Intermodal revenues are likely to grow this year as well. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to expand 4.2% in 2018, strengthening the top line for railroads in turn. Improvement pertaining to another key metric — operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) — is another positive for railroads.In view of the above tailwinds, the fourth-quarter earnings season had been a good one for railroad stocks. Notwithstanding a few headwinds including some lingering impacts of devastating hurricanes, railroad companies continued the earnings momentum in the December quarter. We note that a number of companies in the space — including prominent names such as Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Genesee & Wyoming, Inc. (GWR  -  Free Report) — delivered an earnings beat in the quarter.Volume Growth Likely to Drive Railroads in Q1The stocks are likely to perform impressively in the first quarter of 2018 driven by volume growth. For example, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) railroad — Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) — expects volume growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter to increase in the low single-digit range. Strong performance at the intermodal unit is expected to aid results. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Efforts of railroads to check costs should boost their bottom lines further. For example, at the 2018 Investor Conference held in March, CSX stated that its transition to precision scheduled railroading is progressing well. The new model will lead to top-line growth on the back of volume and pricing gains from the merchandise and intermodal segments. Moreover, scheduled railroading is anticipated to provide greater agility to the coal markets. This, in turn, will drive growth.Railroads should continue to see operating ratio-related improvements in the first quarter of 2018. The lesser the value of operating ratio the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks.In fact, the transportation sector, which includes railroads, is expected to see double-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. For more details about the earnings of this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights HeadwindsDespite the above-mentioned tailwinds, the Zacks Industry Rank # 247 (of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail Industry highlights that the industry is not bereft of headwinds. This unfavorable rank places the companies within the bottom 4% slot of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 over the last decade.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankThe ConcernsIt is a well-documented fact that the fortunes of railroads are tied to coal, since the latter is an important revenue-generating commodity for the sector. Despite President Trump’s pro-coal attitude, the coal industry is not yet out of the woods. In fact, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), coal production is expected to be 736 million short tons (MMst), down 5% year over year.The primary reasons for this are a drop in U.S. coal exports and a decline in usage of coal in electricity generation in the United States. The struggles related to coal are likely to hurt railroads in the first quarter. For example, Norfolk Southern stated at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials conference that coal volumes had declined 6% as of Mar 10. Naturally, any negative development for the commodity does not bode well for railroad operators.Declining automotive volumes due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States, have been hurting railroads for the past few quarters and the story is unlikely to be different in the first quarter. Union Pacific on its fourth-quarter conference call said that light vehicle sales for full-year 2018 are projected at 16.9 million units, reflecting a 2% decline from the 2017 levels.Moreover, service issues represent a major headwind for the sector and may hurt its customer base unless resolved quickly. CSX was badly hurt by such issues last year. Canadian railroad operator — Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report) — is the latest victim of operational problems, which are likely to hurt its first-quarter results.Moreover, uncertainty regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) represents a major overhang on shares of railroads, particularly those like Kansas City Southern, which generate a significant portion of revenues from U.S.-Mexico shipments. Other factors, like the weather-related disruptions — like the ones last year which resulted in freight costs skyrocketing — and the dispute regarding the proposals concerning reciprocal switching, are further challenges for railroads.Valuation PictureThe Zacks Rail industry is up 17.1% over the past year, modestly outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 15.5% gain in the same time period. The industry has struggled since January 9th, likely reflecting the NAFTA uncertainty.The industry’s valuation picture remains attractive, with multiples becoming a lot more reasonable following the recent sell off. The Zacks Rail industry currently trades 16.4X forward 12-month consensus EPS estimates, which is down from 19.4X back in December 2017. This compares to the current forward 12-month P/E multiple of 17X for the S&P 500 index.Over the last 5 years, the industry has traded as high as 19.4X forward 12-month consensus estimates and as low as 13.4X, with a 5-year median of 16.4X. In other words, the industry is trading at the same level as the 5-year median. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

341,NSC,"In a bid to strengthen its e-commerce portfolio, leading package delivery company FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of U.K.-based P2P Mailing Limited for £92 million. The earlier P2P offered customers unique last-mile delivery options. The company, prior to being acquired, provided parcel delivery services to more than 200 countries.P2P will operate under the FedEx Cross Border unit from now on. FedEx Cross Border operates under FedEx Trade Networks, Inc. (FTN), which has been operational since Mar 1. The decision is aimed at helping the company gain from the e-commerce boom.With e-commerce growing by leaps and bounds, it is natural that FedEx is looking to tap the opportunity. In fact, the strong growth of e-commerce is a huge positive for the company. On the back of such exponential growth, FedEx did extremely well in the holiday season. In fact, the company had left no stone unturned to cash in on the opportunity, hiring more than 50,000 seasonal workers to meet the surge in demand. FedEx’s rival United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) also saw an impressive holiday season.E-commerce Growth Drives StockShares of FedEx have done impressively well on rising e-commerce demand. The stock has gained 22.7% in a year’s time, substantially outperforming the 6.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Consequently, FedEx’s decision to boost its e-commerce portfolio through the P2P buyout seems to be a prudent one.New Tax Law — Another PositiveThe new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which slashes the corporate tax rate significantly, is a huge positive for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold ) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The tax cut has primarily backed the company raised earnings projection for fiscal 2018. For the fiscal, the company anticipates earnings per share (excluding TNT Express integration expenses and certain other items) of $15-$15.40, higher than the previous projection of $12.70-$13.30.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law now allows these companies to deduct capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of occurrence. This aspect hugely favors FedEx as it incurs substantially high capital expenditures. The company’s annual tax bill will not be significantly lower, courtesy of the higher deductions.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act might also ramp up shareholder-friendly activities (dividend payments and buybacks) at FedEx. It is encouraging to note that transportation stocks like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have already announced dividend hikes this year.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

342,NSC,"Shares of GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) gained 11.3% over the last three months, outperforming the Zacks Equipment and Leasing industry, which declined 5.9% in the same time period.   Let’s take a look at the factors responsible for the impressive price performance.In January, GATX reported higher-than-expected revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017. The strong performance of the Rail North America segment, which accounts for a bulk of GATX’s revenues, aided results.The company’s strong product portfolio is encouraging as well. Moreover, its efforts to modernize the fleet, particularly at its Rail Europe division, raise optimism in the stock.We are impressed by the company’s efforts to reward its shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments. We note that the company has been paying regular dividends, continuously since 1919. In January 2018, it raised the quarterly dividend by 5% to 44 cents per share. During 2017, it bought back shares worth $100 million.The new tax law is a blessing for transportation companies like GATX. The huge savings, induced by the new law, may result in an improvement in these shareholder-friendly activities. Apart from GATX, transportation stocks like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT  -  Free Report) also hiked their dividend payouts this year.Estimate RevisionsUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospect. GATX scores impressively on this front too. In fact, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 6.4% and 8.8% upward, respectively, in the last 90 days.

343,NSC,"The Dow traversed rough waters once again this week, a period which was marked by troubles for Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and the Fed’s latest policy statement. Concerns over Facebook’s data security policies arose following a whistleblower’s damaging revelations this week. Investors also remained focused on the central bank’s latest policy meeting. Trade war related concerns also surfaced with China preparing to retaliate against Trump’s latest actions on this front.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.3% last Friday following better than expected readings for industrial output. Industrial production surged 1.1% in February, comfortably surpassing the consensus estimate of 0.3% for the period.This marked its highest reading since October 2017.Investors braced for higher volatility due to Friday being a quadruple-witching day. Meanwhile, news surfaced that Trump will soon fire his national security advisor H.R. McMaster.The index lost 1.5% last week.  During this period, President Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former CEO of Exxon Mobil Inc. (XOM  -  Free Report). Further, special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents.This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment. President Trump was expected to levy fresh tariffs on Chinese imports and announced that U.S.’s trade deficits with China will be reduced significantly in the process.The Dow This WeekThe index decreased 1.4% on Monday following concerns over Facebook’s policies regarding privacy of user data.

Shares of Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) declined 2.8%, emerging as the worst performing Dow component. Meanwhile, market watchers also speculated over the possibility of a rate hike post the culmination of the Fed’s two-day FOMC meet on Wednesday.The index gained 0.5% on Tuesday, supported by a rally in energy shares after oil prices settled at their highest level for the month. Meanwhile, investors closely followed the FOMC’s policy meeting. Shares of Facebook continued to decline after the Federal Trade Commission decided to probe the data debacle which has taken markets by storm.The Dow gained 119 points on Tuesday to end in positive territory a day after losing more than 300 points earlier in the session. The day’s gains for the blue-chip index were buoyed by a surge in the shares of Boeing and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), which gained 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively.The index increased 0.2% on Wednesday following the much expected quarter-point rate hike by the Fed. However, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adhered to its December forecast of three rate hikes for 2018.The central bank also increased its GDP projection for 2018, paving the way for future rate hikes. Meanwhile, existing home sales rebounded in February following back-to-back declines in the two months prior to the current period.The Dow lost almost 45 points to end in negative territory on Wednesday. Shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) declined 2.3%, adding to the blue-chip index’s woes. However, the Dow surged more than 250 points at its session highs.The index slumped 2.9% on Thursday after the specter of a damaging trade war with China triggered a broad selloff. Consequently, the Dow finished at its lowest point since Feb 8, the second lowest close recorded so far this year. Currently, the index is 10% lower than the all-time high achieved earlier this year.Additionally, the Fed’s latest policy statement raised questions about the path of interest rate hikes. Also weighing on markets were ongoing troubles at Facebook, a factor which dragged tech stocks lower. Meanwhile, President Trump’s lead attorney resigned from his position, heightening political uncertainty.Components Moving the Index NIKE's third-quarter earnings per share of 68 cents were flat year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents.

Nike has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Revenues of the swoosh brand owner have increased 6.5% to $8,984 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,831.8 million. This was primarily driven by double-digit growth at international locations and global NKE Direct business, partly offset by soft North American Wholesale revenues. Sales grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis.Going forward, the company stated that its overall outlook for fiscal 2018 remains unchanged, excluding the one-time impact of the U.S. tax reform. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects reported revenue growth of high single-digit, backed by persistent strength in international regions and reversal of the trend in North America.

344,NSC,"GE Transportation, one of the operating segments of General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), announced that it has secured orders for 225 refurbished locomotives from several North American railroads in 2018, without disclosing the names of its clients.GE will also deliver 80 and 100 modernized locomotives previously ordered by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report), respectively throughout the year. With an increase in production schedule with a surge in demand, GE’s one million square-foot facility in Fort Worth is now the world’s largest locomotive modernization facility. The latest orders show that major railroads are seeking to control costs by refurbishing old machinery instead of purchasing new engines.The modernization program is aimed at updating aging locomotives, some more than 20 years old, with customized solutions. These range from simple changes including control system upgrades to complex restorations such as the comprehensive transformation of an aged DC locomotive into an AC locomotive with state-of-the-art digital technology.  GE Transportation targets to increase the asset value of locomotives over their lifecycle through the upgrades and optimize future growth opportunities for its customers. Modernizations also extend the service life of locomotives by approximately 20 years. Customers have also experienced substantial outcomes from the program, including up to 10% fuel efficiency gains, 40% increase in reliability and 50% increase in haulage ability.  On the cost front, the whole process is cheaper than buying a new one.This modernization program of GE Transportation has transformed more than 2,000 locomotives for customers worldwide in the last decade, including the majority of Class 1 Railroads in North America as well as international customers. These modernizations help to realize more value out of existing locomotive assets.According to chief executive officer, John Flannery, GE intends to exit at least $20 billion in operations to improve its financial performance. The company continues to explore options for its transportation unit, lighting division and healthcare information technology business.GE has underperformed the industry in the last three months, losing 22.1% on an average compared with a decline of 5.3% for the latter. Moving forward, the company intends to focus on three core segments — power, aviation and healthcare equipment — which require advanced hi-tech products with a high degree of reliability. These products generate higher margins and are likely to contribute to long-term growth, thus lifting shares up.  General Electric carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the industry is Leucadia National Corporation , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

346,NSC,"Stocks in the railroad industry performed well in 2017 after struggling to find stability for the past couple of years. Factors including increased coal and intermodal revenues have led to this improved scenario.Impressive Q4Most sector participants dished out an impressive performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 on the back of strong volume growth. In fact, key players namely Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) have reported substantial year-over-year improvement in earnings as well as revenues. Norfolk Southern has reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s bottom line rose 19% on a year-over-year basis while the top line improved 7% year over year.At Union Pacific, earnings per share and revenues increased 10.1% and 5.5%, respectively, year over year. Whereas at Kansas City Southern, both metrics grew 23.2% and 10.3%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceThe buoyant performance of railroad stocks in 2017 is well-reflected by its price performance. It surged 30.4%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index’s 19.6% rally. We expect the sector to continue performing well in the current year. The factors contributing to this positive scenario are as follows:Coal and Intermodal RevenuesCoal is considered a key revenue-generating commodity for railroads. With Trump’s presidency, the coal industry is seeing better days. In a bid to revive the industry, the president intends to relax regulations that were hurting its prospects.Rising natural gas prices are also favorable to boosting demand for coal. Moreover, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, coal production in the country is likely to increase by 2018. Since revenues from coal significantly drive the railroads’ top line, any positive development for the commodity augurs well for the sector.Coal aside, the intermodal space is a key revenue source for railroads, which improved by leaps and bounds in 2017. Per the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes registered the highest growth rate during the third quarter of 2017. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to expand 4.2% in 2018, strengthening the top line for railroads in turn.Improved U.S. EconomyRecovery of U.S. economy is also anticipated to pave way for the railroads’ progress. Notably, U.S. GDP is expected to climb 2.4% in 2018, higher than the level achieved in the past couple of years. Generally, a buoyant domestic economy results in an uptick in rail shipments of goods across the United States.Per the Commerce Department’s latest report, the inland economy appreciated at a 3% decent annual rate implying a better economic scenario. Moreover, this reading was above the consensus estimate of 2.6%.The New Tax LawTrump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth presidential agendas such as a vital corporate tax cut and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy. Given the capital-intensive nature of railroads, this policy seems a huge vantage point for the sector. Under the current legislation, corporate taxes have been reduced to 21% from the previous 35%. Also by dint of the revised law, companies will be able to immediately subtract capital expenditures from the taxable income in the year of their occurrence. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This in fact leaves more cash in hand for these companies to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Moreover, the amended tax law has prompted several companies to hike their quarterly dividend payouts. Companies like Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corp. have raised dividends earlier this year, indicating financial prosperity. Further, we expect this new law to enhance these shareholder-friendly activities.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Bright PictureThe Zacks Industry Rank of 64 (of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail Industry also emphasizes the optimistic sentiment revolving around railroad stocks. This favorable rank places the companies within the top 25% slot of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 over the last decade.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankDon’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

347,NSC,"The diversified transportation sector, which includes airline companies, railroads, truckers and shippers, to name a few, recovered in the last quarter of 2017 after struggling for most of the year. An improving U.S. economy, substantial surge in manufactured and retail goods, and a sharp rebound in a number of end markets are expected to fuel growth of the transportation sector. Of the various means of the U.S. transport, freight railroad is an integral one.  Railroads Prosper Due to Multiple TailwindsThe robust financial health of railroads bears testimony to the fact that the scenario has improved considerably for players in the sector, after being battered by coal-related headwinds for the last few years.In fact, the primary reason behind the turnaround in fortunes of this key industry can be attributed to an improvement in the coal-related scenario. This is because coal is considered a key revenue-generating commodity for railroads.Moreover, prospects of the coal industry have brightened because of President Donald Trump’s pro-coal stance, wherein he has promised to relax emissions rules. Higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in global market have also given a boost to the demand for this key commodity. As the fortunes of most railroad operators depend on coal, any positive development related to this commodity augurs well for railroads.Improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. In fact, according to the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes registered the highest growth rate in the third quarter of 2017. Moreover, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space.Growth-Induced PolicesTrump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  The proposal to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35% to 20% is likely to bring corporate tax rate at its historic low in 78 years.  A large part of transporters book much of their revenues in the homeland. Therefore, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate faced by transporters would be immediately accretive to cash flow. Moreover, the tax proposal offers to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate.Capital-Intensive Nature of Rail TransportationTransportation stocks, mainly railroads, invest significantly in capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. rail operators need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately, per the U.S. tax overhaul. Naturally, this aspect hugely favors freight rail transports.As and when the companies are able to reduce capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This in fact will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Effect on Transportation SectorA thriving and improving economy also supports the overall bullishness of the transport sector, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States. Improved global growth prospects and sustained business and consumer confidence have in turn helped the transport sector recover from the sluggishness in 2017 to quite an extent. Easily available credit also strengthens the situation.Momentum to ContinueIn fact, improvement in the prospects of key units like coal and intermodal has been benefiting railroads since the beginning of this year. The rise in natural gas prices will also boost demand for coal. Moreover, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal production in the United States will increase in 2018. Apart from coal, the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for transporters is intermodal, which has improved by leaps and bounds this year. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to grow 4.2% in 2018.Stabilization of commodity prices has helped reignite investors faith in the transportation sector with the improvement in the economic conditions. Railroads should continue to witness an improvement pertaining to another key metric - operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in 2018. The lesser the value of operating ratio, the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks.Rail Transport Industry Carries Strong Zacks RankThe Rail Transportation industry is currently in a great position from the Zacks Industry Rank perspective. The industry is currently in the top 16% (41 out of 256) of the Zacks Categorized industries, suggesting that it is well-positioned. Historically, the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our ChoiceAt this stage, we believe investors should choose stocks which carry a favourable Zacks Rank to cash in on future growth opportunities. Taking these factors into consideration, we present five stocks with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for investors to consider. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.These stocks also promise strong long-term growth with solid dividend yield.Union Pacific Corp.

With the overall economy back on track, things are looking up for the transportation sector as well.

348,NSC,"The picture that has been unfolding in the Q4 earnings season is a rosy one so far. According to the latest Earnings Preview, this positive scenario is anticipated to continue. In fact, the above report projects that companies in the prestigious S&P 500 space will end Q4 with an overall bottom-line growth of 11.4% year over year. Additionally, stocks in this highly sought-after fraternity are expected to end Q4 with their top line expanding 7.5%.

The bottom line for this sector is projected to increase 2.6% compared to the year-over-year decline of 13.9% in preceding quarter.Transports Bounce BackStocks in the transportation space seem to be back in favour, after being laid low for most of 2017 due to multiple headwinds like the back-to-back hurricanes. Also, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) is a huge positive for the companies in this space. Notably, the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package signed into law by President Trump on Dec 22, 2017, reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%.Buoyed by the new law, various sector participants like Southwest Airlines  and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) have declared bonuses for their employees. Apart from the huge drop in corporate tax rate, the fact that companies are now allowed to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately has proved to be favorable for transport stocks as they will be able to invest toward capital expenditures considerably.String of Outperformances in Q4In line with the optimism surrounding the sector, the key players like American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) have reported better-than-expected results in Q4.Moreover, the likes of Norfolk Southern and Alaska Air Group have announced hikes in their respective quarterly dividend payouts. This signifies their financial prosperity and shareholder-friendly attitude.What Lies Ahead?Given this healthy backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await Q4 reports from key sector participants like United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report), Schneider National (SNDR  -  Free Report), SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Heartland Express (HTLD  -  Free Report).According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.

352,NSC,"Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 24, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.7%. Also, the company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 5.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayNorfolk Southern’s automotive unit have been struggling due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States. This is likely to hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, automotive volumes declined 2% as of Nov 25. The company’s high debt levels are an added concern.However, the company is making constant efforts to streamline its operations in order to increase productivity. The company’s cost-cutting efforts to drive bottom-line growth are likely to aid results in the quarter. This is also anticipated to boost operating ratio in the same time period.Additionally, the improved coal and intermodal scenario might benefit the top line. At the Credit Suisse 5th Annual Industrials Conference, the company's chief financial officer stated that intermodal volumes have increased 7% as of Nov 25. The scenario was also encouraging for other segments, including coal.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show conclusively that Norfolk Southern is likely to beat estimates in fourth-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Norfolk Southern has an Earnings ESP of -0.37% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.55 per share lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Norfolk Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

353,NSC,"It is a well-documented fact that the widely-diversified transportation sector, which includes airline companies, railroads, truckers and shippers to name a few, has had a turbulent time in 2017 due to multiple headwinds. Issues ranging from customer dissatisfaction, high fuel costs, driver shortages, technological glitches and service disruptions due to hurricanes have let sector participants down at various times of the year.Lets have a deeper look into the major headwinds that have hampered this sector.Probably, the most infamous incident to have plagued the sector in 2017 was the David Dao incident at United Airlines, the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report), on Apr 9. The passenger dragging episode drew flak from across the globe, resulting in multiple apologies from the company. Apart from United Airlines, customer dissatisfaction issues have also hurt other airline operators like Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report).The rise in fuel prices also do not bode well for transportation stocks as expenses related to the commodity are one of the largest input costs for any sector participant. In fact, oil prices have increased more than 37% in the last three months, hitting a more than two-year high of around $59 recently.Additionally, the recent hurricanes disrupted operations of major sector participants. Consequently, airline operators like United Continental had to cancel multiple flights causing significant loss of revenues.Hurricanes also hurt operations of major railroads like Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) by damaging important rail lines. Freight costs skyrocketed following the natural disasters. Railroads have also been negatively impacted this year by weakness in the automotive sector due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States.In 2017, technological glitches have hurt sector participants as well. Operations at FedEx Corp.’s (FDX  -  Free Report) subsidiary, TNT Express, were crippled by a cyberattack in June. The attack caused large-scale service delays.Due the above-mentioned headwinds, the Zacks transportation sector is currently placed at the bottom among the 16 Zacks Classified sectors.S&P 500 Going from Strength to StrengthWith the domestic economy on a solid footing, it is of little surprise that U.S. stock markets are hitting all-time highs on a fairly regular basis. The S&P 500 also maintained its upward journey for 13 straight months through November. The benchmark index, in fact, hasn’t seen a drop of at least 3% since Nov 7, 2016, the longest stretch on record. The index had rallied more than 19% so far this year and is on track to record its best year since 2013.In fact, strong economic growth has been responsible for this upsurge in the S&P 500 Index. Bullish domestic data released recently are indicative of the healthy position of the U.S. economy.Per the Commerce Department’s second estimate, the U.S. economy expanded at a 3.3% pace in the third quarter. This represents an improvement from the annualized growth rate of 3.1% in the April to June period and the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014. Meanwhile, President Trump’s proposals to overhaul the tax law and make it business friendly, have added to the already buoyant scenario.Transports Lag the S&P 500 IndexWhile the S&P 500 equity index has been on an uptrend, it has been a turbulent 2017 for the transportation stocks as enumerated above. Given this contrasting scenario, it is of little wonder that the sector has lagged the coveted S&P 500 Index.The recent optimism surrounding the tax bill, which on becoming a law is expected to aid transports significantly, is primarily responsible for the sector giving positive returns to investors this year.  Despite this, it has not been a great year for the sector participants due to the headwinds mentioned above.The Zacks transportation sector rallied 10.9% year to date compared with the broader S&P 500's gain of 20.3%.5 Sector Outperformers in 2017Despite the headwinds to have plagued sector participants, there are a few stocks in the sector which have given higher returns than the sector.However, given the widely diversified transportation sector, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at such outperformers. To aid their search procedure, we have zeroed in on five such stocks.The stocks, apart from having solid fundamentals, have large market capitalizations.  This is because, focusing on such stocks is considered to be safe. Their large market capitalizations provide the requisite cushion to combat economic downturns and stringent credit conditions.Our first choice is FedEx Corporation. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers customers a one-stop source for global shipping, logistics and supply chain solutions. The company has an impressive expected earnings growth rate (next 3 to 5 years) of 12.8%. which is higher than the industry’s 11%.The company has a market capitalization of $63.95 billion and a VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Additionally, the stock has returned 34.9% year to date. Impressive performance during the current holiday season will boost the stock further. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Our next choice is Union Pacific Corporation. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) railroad operator is based in Omaha, NE. As the largest railroad in North America, Union Pacific connects the Pacific and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern United States gateways.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 2% and 0.7% upward, respectively, over the last 60 days. Additionally, the stock has returned 29.9% year to date. The company has a market capitalization of $101.68 billion.Moreover, railroads including Union Pacific are seeing good times under President Trump due to his pro-coal stance. Trump is aiming to revive the coal industry by relaxing regulations which were hurting its prospects. As fortunes of railroads are tied to coal, any positive development pertaining to the commodity is a boost for railroad operators.Additionally, railroads invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, Union Pacific has announced a $3.1 billion capital plan this year, which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect hugely favors railroads and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers. Our next choice is also a railroad operator — Norfolk Southern Corporation. This Zacks Rank #3 company is based in Norfolk, VA. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 2% and 1.7% upward, respectively, over the last 60 days. Additionally, the stock has returned 34% year to date. The company has a market capitalization of $40.31 billion.We are impressed by Norfolk Southern’s focus on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company's cost-cutting efforts to drive the bottom-line are also encouraging. The company expects earnings per share to grow in double digits (compound annual growth rate) by 2020. Airline behemoth Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) has also outperformed the transportation sector this year despite the headwinds. This Zacks Rank #3 company, based in Atlanta, GA, is a leading provider of scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States and around the world.The company has a decent record with respect to earnings per share, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters. The average beat is 1.6%. Moreover, the stock has an impressive dividend paying history.The stock has returned 14.3% year to date. Delta has a market capitalization of $39.39 billion. Moreover, the tax reform bill, on becoming a law is expected to aid airline stocks just like railroads. Our list of sector outperformers in 2017 is rounded off by American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report). The company, headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, operates more than 6,700 daily flights to over 330 destinations in more than 50 nations across the globe. This Zacks Rank #3 company has an impressive record with respect to earnings per share, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters. The average beat is 3%.Additionally, the stock has returned 11.2% year to date, outperforming the sector despite the difficult year. The company has a market capitalization of $24.03 billion.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

354,NSC,"As the Q1 earnings season is just round the corner, market experts are preparing to compare estimates with actual outcomes. Right now, investors are looking to add stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the quarter. This is because an earnings beat positively impacts the stock price.In fact, the projection regarding Q1 is very encouraging. Per the latest earnings outlook, the bottom line for S&P 500 companies is expected to expand at a highly impressive rate of 16% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7.4%. The report further predicts that 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the Q1 earnings season with the bottom line improving year over year.One of those sectors is transportation sector, wherein the top and bottom line are expected to increase 7.4% and 14.5%, respectively. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes railroads and airlines among others.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to indulge in a comparative analysis of key railroads — Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) —  ahead of their respective Q1 earnings reports. Norfolk Southern is slated to report on Apr 25, while Union Pacific is scheduled to unveil its earnings numbers a day later.As both railroads are on the same footing, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we use certain other parameters to find out which company is better positioned ahead of the Q1 reporting cycle. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price Performance When considering price performance in a year’s time, Union Pacific clearly scores over Norfolk Southern. Union Pacific has gained 24.1%, higher than its industry’s 14.8% rally. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern has gained 13.9% in the same time frame. Valuation Compared with the S&P 500, the broader industry is overvalued. The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is commonly used for valuing railroads because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 3.8. This is a tad higher than the S&P 500 average of 3. 7. Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 2.3 Norfolk Southernis undervalued compared with the S&P 500 and the industry. However, Union Pacific scores poorly on the valuation front and is overvalued compared with the industry and the S&P 500, with a P/B ratio of 4.2. Consequently, this Omaha, NE-based railroad operator is pricier than its Norfolk, VA-based counterpart. Dividend Yield The new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is a huge positive for railroads. This apart, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors railroads as they invest substantially in capital expenditures.The massive savings prompted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is favorable for shareholder-friendly activities like dividend payments and buybacks. In fact, both Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern have hiked the respective dividend payouts this year. Also, other railroad stocks like Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) and CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) have announced dividend hikes this year.Coming back to the two stocks under consideration, Union Pacific’s dividend yield over a year is 2.2%. With a dividend yield of 2.18%, Norfolk Southern shareholders fetch a slightly lower dividend yield than its larger rival. Earnings History and ESP Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, Norfolk Southernhas delivered a positive surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 7.2%. Union Pacificemerges second best in this respect, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 3.3%.However, the Earnings ESP scenario is quite a contrast, with Union Pacific’s reading at +0.22% and Norfolk Southern’s at -2.56%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Norfolk Southernholds an edge over Union Pacific, when considering a more detailed earnings history and valuation. Nevertheless, Union Pacific is superior when considering dividend yield and price performance.Additionally, Union Pacific has a positive ESP reading unlike Norfolk Southern. Although, both stocks have a the same Zacks Rank and seem to be evenly matched, Union Pacific is preferable ahead of earnings, since it holds a clear edge in the Earnings ESP stakes.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

355,NSC,"A higher number of Americans are gearing up for Thanksgiving travel by road or air this time encouraged by a healthier economy, rising income, higher consumer confidence and cheap fuel. The frenzy for trips during the Thanksgiving weekend is far more than the other years. Orlando, FL is expected to be the top destination, followed by Anaheim, CA and New York City, NY.According to travel service provider American Automobile Association (AAA), Thanksgiving holiday travel is expected to hit levels not seen in 12 years. As many as 50.9 million Americans will travel this Thanksgiving holiday period (Nov 22-Nov 26), up 3.3% from last year. Of them, 45.5 million will go on a road trip with a 3.2% rise in automobile travel, 3.95 million will fly, and the rest will travel by trains and other modes (including buses and cruises) (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).Though the road trip is expected to rise 3.2% over last year, drivers are expected to pay the highest gas prices since 2014.

Airfares are likely to drop 23% year over year to $57 on average.In order to accommodate an increased number of passengers, U.S. airlines will increase the number of seats. A4A expects airlines to offer 86,000 more seats, 3.2% higher than the last Thanksgiving (read: Will Airline ETF Crash on Subdued Q3 or Take Off on Value?).Huge travel demand should boost revenues and profitability for airlines and railroads, thereby leading to higher share prices.

356,NSC,"In a bid to revive its sagging fortunes, railroad operator Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) announced a change at its helm. Per the company, Jean-Jacques Ruest  has replaced Luc Jobin as the chief executive officer (CEO)  effective immediately. Notably, Jobin served as the company's CEO since July 2016.Ruest has also been appointed as the president of the company. Prior to this latest announcement, Ruest served the company as its executive vice-president and chief marketing officer for eight years. In fact, he has been associated with Canadian National for 22 years now. A search for a permanent CEO at Canadian National is underway. What Prompted the Change?Of late, Canadian National has been struggling due to various headwinds. This is quite evident from its lackluster price performance. In the past six months, the stock has lost 8.2% of its value against the industry’s gain of 8.9%.This Montreal, Canada-based company has been facing a number of challenges related to network congestion recently, which have hurt its operational performances. Unless resolved quickly, these operational issues might adversely impact its customer base, thus affecting company’s growth prospects. Increasing costs and the company’s high debt levels raise further concerns.In fact, the above issues are well-reflected in Canadian National’s lower-than-expected earnings per share in the last two quarters. In February 2018, oilfield service major, Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), stated that Canadian National’s service delays were also hurting the bottom line.Given the plethora of issues facing Canadian National, it is not at all surprising that the company has decided to make a change at its helm. However, only time will tell whether the CEO replacement revitalizes the company and yields the desired results.Guidance For 2018 Retained Canadian National still expects adjusted earnings per share for the current year between C$5.25 and C$5.40. Moreover, the company, which focuses on improving safety and efficiency, intends to spend C$3.2 billion under its capital program in 2018.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCanadian National carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in its industry include Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

357,NSC,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.6% in the past month, outperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NSC due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsNorfolk Southern reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings (excluding $12.10 from non-recurring items) of $1.69 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. The bottom line also expanded 19% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.Railway operating revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 came in at $2,669 million, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,664.5 million. The top line also improved 7% on a year-over-year basis. Overall volumes grew 5% on the back of impressive performances at key segments like coal, merchandise and intermodal.Income from railway operations (excluding the tax reform related $151 million benefit) climbed 13% year over year to $863 million. Operating expenses decreased 4% year over year to $1.7 billion. Railway operating expenses were reduced by $151 million due to the tax reform.Markedly, Norfolk Southern revealed that adjusted operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in the reported quarter improved to 170 basis points (year over year) 67.7%. Adjusted operating ratio came in at 67.4% in 2017, reflecting an improvement of 150 basis points from the 2016 figure.Segmental RevenuesOn a year-over-year basis, coal revenues surged 5.7% to $426 million.Merchandise revenues increased 4.8% year over year to $1,576 million.Intermodal revenues rose 14.5% year over year to $667 million.LiquidityThe company exited 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $690 million compared with $956 million at the end of 2016. The company, which aims to invest $1.8 billion in 2018 pertaining to safety of its rail network among other things, had long-term debt of $9,136 million compared with $9,562 million at the end of 2016.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum.Norfolk Southern Corporation Price and Consensus  Norfolk Southern Corporation Price and Consensus | Norfolk Souther Corporation Quote VGM ScoresAt this time, NSC has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A. However, the stock was also allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than growth investors.OutlookNSC has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

358,NSC,"The U.S. equity market has been on a roller-coaster of late. In fact, Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,033 points or 4.2%  on Feb 8. Other major bourses – the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq — also finished in the red on the same day.In fact, this was the second time in a week that the Dow shed over 1,000 points in a day after the 1,175 points decline on Feb 5. Following the latest U.S. sell-off, both the Dow as well as the S&P 500 are officially into the correction territory, down more than 10% from the recent all-time high reached in January.The steep sell-off was due to the stronger-than-expected job addition along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years. These factors, in turn, triggered fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected.Furthermore, heightened volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) — Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — which currently is more than 30 (near the highest level since August 2015) indicates bearish market prospects. Notably, any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market.Given this backdrop, investing in companies that not only pay consistent dividends but also raise the same seem to prudent. This is because such companies are financially stable and mature, and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Transportation Stocks Riding HighA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having transportation stocks. Transports have been having a good time lately after being laid low for most of 2017, due to various headwinds like back-to-back hurricanes, increased costs to name a few.Also, the string of outperformances (in terms of earnings as well as revenues) by the key sector participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) in fourth-quarter 2017 bears testimony to the improved scenario surrounding the highly-diversified Zacks Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).Factors Behind the ResurgenceRailroads are one of the most important sub-groups in the transportation sector. After facing multiple challenges over the past few years due to coal-related winds, stocks in the space seem to have bounced back on improvements in the coal scenario.Particularly with Donald Trump’s presidency, the coal industry is witnessing better days. In fact, Trump is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations, which were hurting its prospects. Apart from coal, the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads — intermodal — has improved by leaps and bounds lately.Airlines — another important sub-group in the broader sector – are also seeing good times now, courtesy of the improved demand for air travel. For 2018, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the profitability forecast of $34.5 billion for the current year.Moreover, package delivery companies like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) performed well on the back of e-commerce growth in the most recent holiday season. This further highlights the optimism surrounding transports.Trump’s Tax Overhaul — A BoonOn Dec 22, 2017, Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). Under the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package, corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21% from 35%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow, which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors transportation stocks as they invest substantially toward capital expenditures. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions.For example, Delta, which expects revenues in 2018 to increase between 4% and 6% on a year-over-year basis lifted its earnings per share guidance anticipating the new tax law to boost its results. The company now expects earnings per share in the range of $6.35 to $6.70 (previous outlook: $5.35 to $5.70).Shareholder-Friendly Activities Likely to Pick Up PaceAs noted above, many stocks in the transportation space reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks. For example, United Continental Holdings — a key transportation player — announced a new buyback program late last year. Moreover, the likes of Delta and Kansas City Southern hiked their quarterly dividend payouts in 2017.Following the new tax law, we expect an increase in these shareholder-friendly activities from various transportation companies. Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Dividend Paying Transports — A Prudent ChoiceIn view of the above-mentioned tailwinds, we believe that stocks from the transportation space should be in one’s portfolio. Moreover, picking dividend stocks seems prudent during uncertain times like the current scenario.Consequently, we have zeroed in on five stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history. Also, these companies have raised their dividend payouts recently. All the chosen stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our first choice is, UPS, the world's largest express carrier. Markedly, UPS provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally. UPS’ board of directors cleared an approximately 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 91 cents per share ($3.64 annually) on Feb 8. The first installment of the new dividend will be paid on Mar 7, 2018 to the stockholders of record on Feb 20.The raised dividend highlights UPS’ commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects, going forward.Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. The company has been rewarding shareholders with cash dividends regularly since 1969 and has more than quadrupled its dividend payout since it went public in 1999.Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of A highlights its short-term attractiveness. Notably, the Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is right to grab a stock and make the most of its momentum.Our next choice is Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), which provides rail transportation services across 23 states in the United States through its principal operating company, Union Pacific Railroad Company.On Feb 8, this railroad operator’s board of directors a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 73 cents per share (annualized $2.92 per share). The first installment of the raised dividend will be paid on Mar 30, 2018 to shareholders as of Feb 28.In fact, this is the company’s second dividend hike in three months.  In November 2017, the company had announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents per share. We believe that two dividend hikes in such a short span reflect the increased financial prosperity following the introduction of the new tax law.Additionally, the company has an impressive dividend history having rewarded shareholders through dividends for 119 consecutive years.The next member in our list is also a railroad operator — Norfolk Southern.  Last month, the company's board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88 per share) from 61 cents per share (annualized $2.44 per share). The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 10, 2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 2.Moreover, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. The company has paid dividends for 142 consecutive quarters, since inception in 1982.GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) is our next choice. This leading global railcar lessor specializes in railcar and locomotive operating leasing, aircraft operating leasing, information technology leasing, and venture finance for customers in diverse industrial sectors worldwide.On Jan 26, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared a 5% hike in its quarterly dividend to 44 cents per share ($1.76 annually). The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 31, 2018 to shareholders of record on Mar 5.Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. It has been paying dividends regularly since 1919. Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of B highlights its short-term attractiveness.The final member in our list is trucking company J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT  -  Free Report). On Jan 24, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared an approximately 4.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to 24 cents per share (96 cents annually). The first installment of the new dividend is payable  Feb 23, 2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 9.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

360,NSC,"Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 19, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.3%. The company’s earnings (on an adjusted basis) of $1.35 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. The bottom line also expanded 20.5% on a year-over-year basis.The company’s revenues of $656.6 million also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $647.9 million. The top line improved 9% on a year-over-year basis. Results were boosted by a 3% rise in overall carload volumes.We expect this Kansas City, MO-based railroad operator to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the fourth quarter too. In fact, the positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has inched up almost 1% over the last 30 days.Lets delve deep to unearth the factors likely to influence its Q4 results:We believe that volume growth will aid Kansas City Southern’s results in the final quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter carload volumes is pegged at 1.7%, higher than the figure reported in the previous quarter.The company's Industrial & Consumer Products segment and the Chemical & Petroleum unit are anticipated to maintain its strong performance in the fourth quarter. The improving scenario pertaining to coal is also a positive. The company’s efforts to control costs are expected to boost fourth-quarter earnings as well.Apart from Kansas City Southern, other railroad companies like CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) are focusing on cost control to drive earnings.Furthermore, we expect Kansas City Southern to report an improved operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in the to-be-reported quarter. The lower the value of operating ratio the better as it implies that more cash is available to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks.However, high operating expenses might hurt this railroad operator’s bottom line in the fourth quarter. In fact, the new tax law might push up operating expenses due to one-time bonus payments.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too indicates that chances of Kansas City Southern beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: Kansas City Southern has an Earnings ESP of +0.21%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.

362,NSC,"Shares of the major transportation companies surged on Dec 4. The uptick was primarily due to the Senate’s approval of the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades by a 51-49 vote in the early hours of Dec 2.Consequently, the Dow Jones Transportation Average — a price-weighted average of 20 U.S. transportation securities — ended the day 1.8% higher, thereby closing at 10,368.58. The Index includes railroads, truckers, marine transportation, delivery services and logistics companies, apart from the airlines. Hence, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index can easily be considered as a true representative of the U.S. transportation division.With the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index performing exceptionally well, it was no surprise that most participants had a field day. In fact, stocks like FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) that dominate and define the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo Industry gained 3.6% and 2.8% on the day, thereby hitting their respective 52-week highs of $239.05 and $123.02.Other notable gainers from railroads include — Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) (up 4.4%) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) (up 1.7%) — and from airlines — Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) (up 3.5%), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) (up 3.1%) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) (up 2.1%).All the above-mentioned stocks with the exception of FedEx and Alaska Air Group carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Tax BillWith the Senate clearing its version of the tax reform bill, President Donald Trump has secured his first major legislative win after more than 10 months in office. We note that the House had passed its version of the tax bill in mid-November. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package is expected to be enacted into law by year-end, following resolution of the differences in the two versions.As various market watchers seem to debate over the pros and cons of the tax reform bill, we expect transportation stocks in the United States to be a major beneficiary. The optimism was reflected by the buoyant performance of the sector participants in the stock market on Dec 4.Both versions propose to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35% to 20%. On materialization, this huge reduction will naturally benefit transportation stocks in the United States. Most sector participants book a significant part of their revenues, domestically. Therefore, the 15-point cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow, which in turn will aid their bottom lines.The proposal aims to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate than they otherwise would’ve shelled out. Currently, if foreign income is repatriated, it is taxed at 35% with a full credit of the local levies.Capital ExpendituresTransportation stocks — mainly railroads and airlines — invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, Union Pacific has announced a $3.1 billion capital plan this year, which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors transports and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Picture for AirlinesApart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space also are expected to be huge benefactors from the U.S. tax overhaul. The capital-intensive nature of the industry implies that the above-mentioned benefits pertaining to capital expenses should aid carriers as well.Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate, the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.In fact, most market watchers believe that the tax cut would benefit low-cost carriers like Alaska Air and JetBlue Airways more than the legacy carriers. This is because the likes of Delta had emerged from bankruptcy a few years ago. Consequently, their current incomes are still being offset by prior losses. Naturally, they do not stand to be benefitted immediately (tangibly) by the tax cuts. However, their smaller rivals like JetBlue are immediate gainers from the tax cuts as they were paying higher taxes till now.Price PerformanceFollowing the recovery from the negative effects of the back-to-back natural calamities stocks in transportation space have been performing well recently. Additionally, an  improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been a blessing for the sector participants. Also, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations.The fact that things are looking up for transports can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Transportation industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last month. While the industry rallied 4.4%, the S&P 500 Index has gained 2% in the same period. With the corporate tax cut likely to become a reality, transports are expected to gain further in the coming days. Naturally, investors will keenly wait for further updates on this burning issue.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

363,NSC,"Last week, Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) — one of leading players in the railroad space — announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents per share (annualized $2.66 per share). The first installment of the hiked dividend will be paid on Dec 28, 2017, to shareholders as of Nov 30.The raised dividend highlights Union Pacific’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects, going forward. Moreover, a look at past records reveals Union Pacific’s stable dividend payment history.Shareholder-Friendly Measures Highlight Strong Balance SheetsUnion Pacific is not the only railroad operator to have increased its dividend payout. Fellow railroad operators like Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have also raised their dividend payouts this year. Additionally, the board of directors at Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) cleared a new share buyback program in October 2017. The company is now authorized to buy back an additional 50 million shares through Dec 31, 2022.These investor-friendly measures adopted by railroads clearly highlight the financial prosperity of stocks in the space. Additionally, the strengthened balance sheets of sector participants have made them invest substantially for promoting safety and enhancing productivity.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Railroads Prosper Due to Multiple TailwindsThe robust financial health of railroads bears testimony to the fact that the scenario has improved considerably for players in the sector, after being battered by the coal-related headwinds for the last few years.In fact, the main reason behind the turnaround in fortunes of this key sector can be attributed to an improvement in the coal-related scenario. This is because coal is regarded as a key revenue generating commodity at railroads.Moreover, prospects of the coal industry have brightened because of Donald Trump’s pro-coal stance, whereby he has promised to relax emissions rules. Higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in global market have also boosted demand for this key commodity. As fortunes of most railroad operators depend on coal, any positive development related to this commodity augurs well for railroads.Improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. In fact, according to the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes registered the highest growth rate in the third quarter of 2017. Volume growth, pertaining to intermodal, was impressive in the earlier two quarters of 2017 as well.Furthermore, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in the stocks from this space. Improvement in a key metric — operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) — also augur well for railroad operators.  Evidently, this key metric improved at CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern and Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report) in the third quarter.Price PerformanceDriven by the above-mentioned tailwinds, the Zacks Rail industry has outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 15.7%, the industry rallied 19.2%.Union Pacific’s Dividend Hike Augurs WellBased on optimism surrounding railroads, we applaud Union Pacific’s decision to raise its quarterly dividend as it indicates brighter days ahead.As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments. Consequently, we believe that they should consider stocks in the space as lucrative investment options.The Zacks Industry Rank of 100 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 39% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half surpassed the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

364,NSC,"GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) delivered mixed results in the fourth quarter of 2017. Evidently, the company reported lower-than-expected earnings per share but better-than-expected revenues.The company’s earnings of 68 cents per share (excluding $8.15 per share from non-recurring items) fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. However, revenues of $352.8 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $346.1 million.In the reported quarter, both earnings and revenues declined on a year-over-year basis, reflecting challenging market conditions. While the bottom line contracted 40.4%, revenues declined 2.6%. Segment-Wise ResultsProfits at the Rail North America segment improved to $61.2 million from $48.5 million a year ago. The uptick was mainly due to higher revenues. In the fourth quarter, the renewal lease rate change of the company’s Lease Price Index (LPI) was -32.4%.

367,NSC,"The Q3 earnings season saw upbeat bottom-line performances by most railroad operators despite the recent hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria). In fact, railroads seem to be recovering this year after a prolonged struggle due to coal-related issues.The string of encouraging releases in Q3 (on the top- and bottom-lines) from key segmental players like Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) reflects the improved scenario regarding railroads.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereFactors Driving the Turnaround Stocks in the railroad space have performed well so far this year on the back of multiple tailwinds. In fact, the improvement in the coal industry has immensely benefited stocks in the space as coal is a key revenue generator.The commodity is likely to see even better days given President Trump’s pro-coal stance. Apart from coal, other key divisions of railroads like intermodal are also performing well. The strong performance of key sectors at railroads is leading to an uptick in overall volumes.Another factor working in favor of railroads is the improvement in the U.S. economy. In the third quarter of 2017, intermodal volumes increased 6.3% on a year-over-year basis. This was the highest growth rate recorded in more than three years.A buoyant domestic economy has also contributed to the turnaround at railroads. A vibrant economy implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail.In fact, the likes of Kansas City Southern, CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report) and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) have hiked their quarterly dividend payouts this year, which further highlights the financial prosperity of the sector participants.Operating Ratio Improvement - A Positive CatalystIn the third quarter, Kansas City Southern’s operating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) came in at 64.4% compared with 66.9% reported a year ago. At Norfolk Southern, this key metric improved to 65.9% from 67.5% in the third quarter of 2016.Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. At CSX, operating ratio operating ratio improved 90 basis points to 68.1% in the third quarter. In 2017, CSX expects operating ratio in the high end of mid-60s. The metric also improved at Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report). Additionally, the prudent cost management of railroad operators raise optimism in the stocks.Solid Price PerformanceDriven by the above-mentioned tailwinds, the Zacks Rail industry has outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 15.7%, the industry rallied 19.2%.Also, a 19.3% improvement in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index on a year-to-date basis, bears testimony to bullishness surrounding railroads.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 118 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 46% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankWhat to Expect in Q4?We expect railroads to continue performing well in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by volume growth as was the case in Q3. Key units such as intermodal and coal are also expected to aid in delivering encouraging results,.The cost discipline of railroads might also drive the bottom line. For example, CSX expects its bottom line to expand between 20% and 25% in 2017 (on a reported basis) over 2016 levels, driven by improved efficiencies.Currently, the valuation picture for railroads is favorable and certainly points at some degree of upside. When valued according to the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current financial year (F1), the Zacks Rail Transportation industry does not appear too expensive as it is trading at 19.8x P/E multiple. In fact, the reading appears favorable when compared with its own traded multiple (trading lower than its high end of 20.1x) in the last 12 months as well as the S&P 500 (20.5x). The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside.Despite the positives, there are a few factors which might hurt results in the fourth quarter. Evidently, weakness in the automotive sector had hurt the results of major railroads in the third quarter, consequently production declined in the Unites States.  The scenario is expected to remain gloomy in the final quarter of 2017 as well. In fact, sales of U.S. light vehicle sales for 2017 are projected at 17 million units, down approximately 3% on a year-over-year basis. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes might hurt railroads.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

368,NSC,"Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.8%. Also, the company has an impressive earnings history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 3.7%.Let’s see what awaits the company in the third quarter.Factors at PlayThe company expects the Hurricane Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share in the third quarter.Additionally, the company expects its automotive unit to suffer in the third quarter. Sluggish auto production is likely to hamper results this yet-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for automotive revenues stands at $490 million, lower than $513 million reported in the previous quarter.Units like agricultural products and chemicals are also expected to register below-par volumes in the quarter to be reported.  For agricultural products, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $917 million. While for chemicals, the metric stands at $892 million, slightly lower than the $898 million reported in second-quarter 2017.Shares of the company have underperformed its industry in a month due to the aforementioned headwinds. The stock has lost 2.4% of its value versus the industry’s 0.3% gain during the period.However, the improved coal scenario is likely to aid the company’s third-quarter results. The industrial products unit is expected to perform well in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for industrial products revenues stands at $988 million.In addition, the company’s cost-cutting efforts to increase efficiencies are impressive. In a bid to raise efficiency for utilization of its resources in a better manner, Union Pacific announced that it intends to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of -0.34%as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged lower at $1.48 per share than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49.

However, the bottom line declined 20.4% on a year-over-year basis.This year-over-year decline in earnings disappointed the investors. Consequently, shares of the company were down in early trading.Ryder System reported total revenue of $1,848.5 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,806.4 million.

372,NSC,"United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.58 surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 per share. The top-line also increased 11% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.Revenues improved 7.7% to $15,750 million from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,477.3 million. The upside was driven by growth across all the key segments of the company.Factors Likely to Influence This Quarter We expect the company’s bottom line to be hurt by escalated costs in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, high package delivery costs have been hurting UPS for some time and the third quarter is likely to be no different. Moreover, UPS is working hard to expand its presence. Though positive on such efforts, we believe that expansion related expenses might also drag down third-quarter earnings.Additionally, foreign currency-related headwinds are expected to hurt the quarter’s results as well. The third-quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues — international package — is pegged at $3,076 million, lower than the $3,163 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Moreover, unfavorable product mix and weakness in industrial production might dampen the company’s performance.We are, however, impressed by the company’s efforts to reward shareholders consistently through buybacks and dividends. An update on the subject will be awaited on the conference call. Also, UPS is leaving no stone unturned to perform well in the upcoming holiday season like its rival FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report). The company expects to benefit from growth in ecommerce. We expect a detailed commentary on the issue on the third-quarter conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UPS will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks Rank: UPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: UPS has an Earnings ESP of -0.06%, which acts as a spoiler. The Zacks Rank combined with a negative Earnings ESP leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive.

373,NSC,"The transportation sector is struggling this earnings season with total earnings from 97.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization that has reported so far down 14.2% despite revenue growth of 5.1%. This is much below earnings growth of 9.6% and revenue growth of 10% for the same period, in the last reporting cycle (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).Earnings and revenue beat ratio of 69.2% and 61.5%, respectively, are also disappointing despite the fact that most of the industry players dominating the sector managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.45 surpassed our earnings estimate by a penny while revenues of $15.98 billion edged past the estimated $15.61 billion. For fiscal 2017, the company narrowed its earnings per share guidance range from $5.80-$6.10 to $5.85-$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $6.00.The major railroads Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) also beat on both the top and bottom lines. NSC outpaced the earnings estimate by a wide margin of 11 cents while earnings at UNP and KSU came ahead by a penny and three cents, respectively. Revenues for the three railroads trumped their Zacks Consensus Estimate by $102 million, $9 million and $40 million, respectively.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat the earnings estimate by four cents and revenue estimate by $42 million.The two largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results but the latter lagged on revenues. Earnings of $1.57 and revenues of $11.1 billion at Delta edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 and $11.03 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.22 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18 but revenues of $9.878 billion slightly fell shy of the estimated $9.88 billion (read: Will Airline ETF Crash on Subdued Q3 or Take Off on Value?).Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel but revenues were $28 million above the estimate.ETFs in FocusGiven this, the sector saw a 2.3% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. As such, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading in the past one month. IYT shed 1.6% while XTN was down 0.4%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) rating with a High risk outlook (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large-cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 26% and 19% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX) at 14.3%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 47.2% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.8% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $799.2 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 258,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees.XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 43 stocks in its basket. It is skewed toward small caps at 47% while the rest is split between mid and large caps. As a result, the in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 32.3% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines takes one-fourth share. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $194.6 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 22,000 shares a day (read: ETFs to Buy After Weak Jobs Report).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

374,NSC,"The Q3 earnings season is in its latter half with a high proportion of companies having already unveiled their quarterly financial numbers.The picture that has emanated so far is an extremely healthy one and the Q3 earnings season remains on track to end on a strong note by displaying substantial growth. Markedly, many companies have reported better-than-expected earnings per share in the current reporting cycle.In fact, the impressive scenario with respect to earnings outperformance is reflected by the latest Earnings Preview. Per the report, approximately 75.7% of the S&P 500 members have outperformed on the bottom-line front.Despite the well-documented headwinds plaguing the highly-diversified Zacks Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), quite a few sector participants like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) have reported better-than-expected earnings per share in Q3.  Lowered Bar Facilitates Earnings BeatsWe suspect that the reason for the high proportion of transportation companies reporting better-than-expected Q3 earnings despite the headwinds lies in the conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Notably, earnings estimates have been moving south for quite some time due to the challenges confronting this sector.In this context, let’s consider the case of American Airlines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate third-quarter 2017 for the carrier was pegged at $1.39, much lower than the year-ago figure of $1.68. The conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate has made it easier for transportation companies to surpass them in the quarter.Zacks Methodology to the RescueEven though a high proportion of transportation players have already revealed their quarterly numbers, quite a few players are yet to announce their results. As has been the case so far in Q3, quite a few of them will outperform with respect to the bottom-line despite the overall challenges confronting the sector.Additionally, it is a well-established fact that an earnings beat more often boosts investor confidence in the stock that translates into rapid price appreciation. However, with a plethora of stocks available in the market at any point of time, spotting potential outperformers is by no means an easy task for individual investors. In the absence of proper guidance, to identify a winning stock is akin to searching for ‘a needle in a haystack’, for an investor.This is where the Zacks methodology shows its mettle.  It simplifies the task of stock selection by combining a favorable Zacks Rank – a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.  Research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Five Transportation PicksBased on the above methodology, we have zeroed in on five transportation stocks that are likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in Q3. We believe that these stocks could turn out to be great additions to your portfolio and are worth a look.LATAM Airlines Group S.A. (LTM  -  Free Report) offers domestic and international passenger and cargo air services. Based in Santiago, Chile, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +15.94%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 3 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents. The favorable combination makes an earnings beat likely in the quarter. The company will report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 15. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (SBLK  -  Free Report) is a leading global shipping company in the dry bulk sector.

(GNK  -  Free Report) engages in ocean transportation of drybulk cargoes worldwide. Based in New York, this company has an Earnings ESP of +10.74% and a Zacks Rank #3.

376,NSC,"Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. Also, the company has an impressive earnings history of surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 4.4%.However, due to recent disruptions caused by the natural calamities, shares of the company have lost 29.9% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 0.5% decline over the same period.  Let’s see how things shape up for this earnings.Factors at PlayHurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have greatly impacted Spirit. The storms forced the airline to cancel more than 1,650 flights in the third quarter. The company anticipates natural calamities and the pilot dispute to affect revenues in third quarter to the tune of $40 million and operating margin to the tune of approximately 450 basis points.The company estimates third-quarter economic fuel cost per gallon to be $1.75, much higher than the $1.66 reported in the previous quarter.The company anticipates roughly 6.5% year-over-year decline in TRASM (total revenue per available seat mile) in its third quarter. The carrier expects total available seat miles in third quarter to rise 18% year over year.The carrier expects adjusted cost per available seat miles in the third quarter between flat to down 1% due to fewer available seat miles and costs incurred in the process of recovery from the natural calamities.However, the carrier’s expansion and fleet modernization initiatives raise optimism. The company’s efforts to reward stockholders through share buybacks are also impressive. Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

377,NSC,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Norfolk Southern is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NSC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.65 per share for NSC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NSC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.59% heading into earnings season.Norfolk Souther Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Norfolk Souther Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Norfolk Souther Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that NSC has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Norfolk Southern, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

378,NSC,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.In the second quarter of 2017, the carrier’s earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) of $1.24 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20. The bottom line also improved 4.2% on a year-over-year basis. Operating revenues of $5,744 million was marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,733.2 million.However, this Dallas-based low-cost carrier is likely to face turbulence in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s third-quarter results are expected to be hurt due to the recent hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) and the earthquake in Mexico. These natural disasters have forced the airline to cancel approximately 5,000 flights. Markedly, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings has moved down 22.3% over the last 90 days.Consequently, the stock has struggled so far this year underperforming the Zacks Airline industry  over the last six months. Shares of Southwest Airlines have gained 5.1% compared with the industry’s rally of 5.9%. Let's delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Southwest Airlines’ third-quarter results.Owing to the multiple flight cancellations, the company expects third-quarter operating revenues are likely to be hurt to the tune of $100 million. Moreover, the carrier expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) in the quarter to be flat to down 1% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter passenger unit revenues is pegged at 12.33 cents, lower than 13.03 cents reported in the second quarter of 2017.Increased costs (fuel and labor) are expected to hurt the bottom line. Cost per available seat miles, excluding special items, is estimated to increase between 3% and 4%. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated between $2.00 and $2.05 in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel price is pegged at $2.00 per gallon, higher than $1.93 reported in the second quarter of 2017.Apart from Southwest Airlines other carriers like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) are also likely to be hurt by the natural calamities.We are, however, appreciative of the company's efforts to enhance its shareholders‘ wealth through dividends and share buybacks. At its annual meeting of shareholders, Southwest Airlines announced that its board of directors approved a new share repurchase program worth $2 billion. Notably, share repurchases benefit a company’s earnings per share by lowering outstanding share count.What Does Our Model Say?Our quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Southwest Airlines in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.

379,NSC,"American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. It also has an impressive earnings history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 19.1%.However, this Fort Worth, TX-based carrier is likely to face turbulence in the third quarter. Evidently, multiple headwinds including the back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) have hurt the entire space.The above hurricanes caused the company to call off approximately 8,000 flights in the third quarter. This negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings being revised 20.6% downward over the last 90 days.Consequently, the stock has underperformed the Zacks Airline industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of American Airlines have gained 11.2% compared with the industry’s rally of 14.9%.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact American Airlines’ third-quarter results.Owing to multiple flight cancellations, the company expects third-quarter pre-tax earnings to be affected to the tune of approximately $75 million. The carrier expects pre-tax margin, excluding special items, in the range of 9-11%. Increased costs (fuel and labor) are expected to hit the bottom line. Cost per available seat miles, excluding special items, is estimated to increase at approximately 4.5% in the third quarter owing to salary and benefit increases to employees. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated between $1.64 and $1.69 in the quarter.Despite the disruptions, the scenario with respect to total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) is an improved one from the year-ago quarter, courtesy better-than-expected yields. American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) for the third quarter to grow between 0.5% and 1.5%.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter TRASM is pegged at 14.98 cents, higher than 14.73 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter yields is pegged at 15.56 cents, higher than 15.27 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016.Apart from American Airlines, other carriers like Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) are likely to be hurt by the natural calamities.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model also does not show conclusively that American Airlines will beat on earnings in third-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Revenues of $359.6 million were also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $349.6 million.However, in the reported quarter, both earnings and revenues declined on a year-over-year basis, reflecting challenging market conditions. While the bottom line contracted 44.4%, revenues declined 0.9%.Segment-Wise ResultsProfits at the Rail North America segment declined to $70.2 million from $87.9 million a year ago. The downturn was mainly due to lower revenues and higher maintenance costs. During the reported quarter, the renewal lease rate change of the company’s Lease Price Index (LPI) was -27%. Additionally, average lease renewal term for cars included in the LPI was 35 months in the reported quarter compared with 29 months in the year-ago quarter.Per this transportation company’s press release, Rail North America’s wholly owned fleet had approximately 120,000 rail cars at the end of the third quarter. Fleet utilization came in at 98.5% compared with 99% in the year-ago quarter.Profits at the Rail International segment decreased 13.7% year over year to $20.1 million. The decline was owing to lower insurance proceeds. Moreover, GATX Rail Europe’s fleet totaled approximately 23,000 rail cars at the end of the reported quarter. Fleet utilization was 95.6% compared with 95% at the end of the third quarter of 2016.Profits at the Portfolio Management unit were $12.8 million in the quarter, down significantly from the year-ago figure of $64.1 million. The decline was primarily due to a residual sharing fee settlement amounting to $49.1 million that was received last year. However, the American Steamship segment's profit of $12.1 million in the same quarter compared favorably with the year-ago profit of $7.8 million.LiquidityGATX exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $199.2 million compared with $307.5 million at the end of 2016.

However, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCanadian National Railway's efforts to control costs are impressive. We expect the company’s bottom line to benefit from lower costs in the third quarter as well.

We are also encouraged by the improving scenario relating to coal.Robust volume growth continues to aid Canadian National. In fact, the top line is expected to benefit in the third quarter from increased volumes in key segments such as Canadian grain and fertilizers, overseas intermodal traffic, frac sand apart from coal.High fuel costs are, however, expected to hurt the company's bottom line in the third quarter.

385,NSC,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Norfolk Southern is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NSC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.65 per share for NSC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NSC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.61% heading into earnings season.Norfolk Souther Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Norfolk Souther Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Norfolk Souther Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

386,NSC,"JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.3%. It also has an impressive earnings history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.3%.However, things do not seem very favorable for the company this quarter.Shares of the company have underperformed its industry in the last three months. The stock has lost around 13% compared with the industry’s 1.7% decline.  Let’s divulge into the factors rendering such a dismal outlook.Factors at PlayJetBlue’s operations were disrupted by the devastating effects of consecutive natural calamities. The carrier expects its top line to be hurt to the tune of $44 million in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, operating income is likely to be adversely impacted in the range of $30-$35 million. The bottom line too in the soon-to-be-reported quarter is expected to be hurt between 6 cents and 7 cents.Notably, capacity is projected to expand approximately 3.7% in the third quarter. Due to weather-related setbacks, average seat miles (ASMs) have been trimmed to the tune of approximately 2.7 percentage points.The destructive hurricanes have increased projection for unit costs, excluding fuel, to the tune of roughly 2.75 percentage points. The metric is expected to grow between 2.75% and 3.25% for the quarter. Fuel cost per gallon is projected to be $1.71.However, revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) is estimated to inch up almost 0.9% in the quarter under review (the metric has been positively impacted to the tune of approximately 0.3 percentage points, thanks to the hurricanes).Additionally, the carrier’s cost-control efforts are impressive. The company is looking to reduce its debt levels. Its long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) ratio currently stands at 26.4. This compares favorably with its industry’s figure, which exceeds 100, as well as the S&P 500 index’s reading of 84.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that JetBlue is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: JetBlue has an Earnings ESP of -2.05% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged marginally lower at 51 cents than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: JetBlue carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.JetBlue Airways Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  JetBlue Airways Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | JetBlue Airways Corporation Quote Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider SkyWest, Inc.

387,NSC,"Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings numbers on Oct 25, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.7%. The company’s earnings of $2.94 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. Also, earnings declined 20.11% from the year-ago figure due to higher costs. Quarterly revenues, however, increased 16.2% year over year to $400.6 million, edging past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $399.8 million. Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe company’s third-quarter results are likely to be hampered by elevated costs. Similar to the previous quarter, high labor costs are expected to limit bottom-line growth in the third quarter as well. Cost per available seat mile excluding fuel (CASM-ex fuel) is expected to grow between 16.7% and 17.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at 7.01 cents. High fuel costs are another cause for the company’s concern.Also, decline in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) is worrisome. The metric fell in three consecutive months namely, July, August and September due to capacity overexpansion. The fact that Allegiant is a highly leveraged company, further adds to its woes.Driven by headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the last three months. The stock has declined 3.1% against the industry’s 0.9% gain during the period.The company expects total revenues per scheduled ASM (TRASM) for the third quarter in the range of 0.3-0.7% (previous guidance: -0.5-1.5%). Also, Fixed fee revenues and other revenues are predicted to be in the band of $22-$22.5 million (earlier view: $17-$19 million range).The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments are impressive. Its fleet modernization initiatives are appreciative as well.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Allegiant has an Earnings ESP of -4.76% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.31 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37.

388,NSC,"J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) performed disappointingly in the second quarter of 2017, reporting lower-than-expected earnings as well as revenues.This transportation company’s earnings of 88 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents. The bottom line also dipped 4.35% on a year-over-year basis due to higher operating expenses.Total operating revenue increased 6.93% year over year to $1,726 million but marginally fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,733.1 million. Excluding fuel surcharges, operating revenues increased 5% year over year. The top and the bottom line miss disappointed investors. Consequently, shares of the company declined in early trading.During the quarter, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company repurchased approximately 564,000 shares for $50 million. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Operating income in the second quarter decreased 6.8% to $164 million. Lower customer rates hurt results. But interest expenses increased on a year-over-year basis.The effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2017 is 37.4% compared with 38% a year-ago. The company expects a tax rate of 35% for full-year 2017. In addition, the  company revised some aspects of its full-year 2017 guidance. For example, CAPEX for 2017 is now projected at $471 million (old guidance: $477 million).Segmental PerformanceThe Intermodal division reported quarterly revenues of $1 billion, up 7% year over year. Overall volumes in the segment climbed 5%. Revenue per load, excluding fuel surcharge revenues, dipped 1%. Operating income increased 4% year over year to $110 million.Dedicated Contract Services revenues increased 8% year over year to $412 million. The company added new trucks to the fleet and customer retention rates remained above 98%. Operating income decreased 4% year over year to $49 million, primarily due to increased costs like driver wages.Capacity Solutions revenues surged 9% year over year to $222 million on the back of 20% increase in volumes. Revenue per load plunged 9% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income declined over 100% due to lower gross profit margin and higher costs.Truck revenues decreased 4% to $95 million. At the end of the quarter, the company operated 2,072 tractors, down 5.7% year over year. Also, operating income decreased 37% to $5.6 million due to higher costs like higher driver pay.LiquidityAt the end of the second quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $7.3 million compared with approximately $6.4 million at the end of 2016.  Long-term debt was $943.2 million compared with $986.3 million at the end of 2016.J.B.

389,NSC,"Leading railroad operator, Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the market opens.In the first quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.32 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23. Also, the bottom line expanded 13.8% on a year-over-year basis, aided by lower costs. Consequently, the improvement in the coal-related scenario boosted results. While coal revenues (freight) improved 25% year over year to $648 million, volumes increased 16%.We expect this bright scenario to aid results in the second quarter as well. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has moved up 2.23% in the last 30 days.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Union Pacific is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of +1.46% as the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.39, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.37. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Union Pacific holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.However, the combination of Union Pacific’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.46% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors at PlayWe expect coal volumes to increase and aid results in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, at the Bank of America 2017 Transportation Conference in May, the company's CFO, Rob Knight, painted a rosy picture for the quarter.Evidently, coal volumes increased 21% year over year as of May 12. Segmental volumes for all the segments, except Automotives and Chemicals, had increased in the Apr 1 to May 12 time frame. According to Knight, overall volumes had also increased 4% in the same period.It is to be noted that Union Pacific’s prudent cost management is also a positive. This, in turn, should drive the bottom line in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the company that achieved an operating ratio of 65.1% in the first quarter expects the metric to improve further in 2017.Currently, Union Pacific is on track to achieve its guidance of around 60% by 2019. Its peers like Canadian National (CNI  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report)) are also aiming to drive earnings by controlling costs.Additionally, Union Pacific’s efforts to constantly reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks are encouraging. An update on the issue will be awaited on the second-quarter conference call.Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Union Pacific Corporation QuoteAnother Stock to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader transportation space may also consider American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) as our model shows it possesses the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the first quarter.American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +2.75% and a Zacks Rank #1.

390,NSC,"Trinity Industries Inc. (TRN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after market closes.In the preceding quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.5%.  Also, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 8.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayWe expect Trinity Industries to continue struggling on the top-line front in the to-be-reported quarter, just like the previous one. Markedly, sluggish market conditions as well as weak demand for railcars are expected to weigh on the results. High costs and adverse foreign currency movement may add to the woe.In fact, the Rail Group segment which recorded disastrous results in the second quarter, is expected to continue its poor run in the third quarter as well. Additionally, the Inland Barge Group might come up with a below-par performance mainly due to lower barge deliveries and changes in product mix.Also, the Energy Equipment Group might perform poorly in the quarter under review owing to lower delivery volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter segmental operating profit is $22.6 million, lower than the $24.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders are encouraging. Of late, the stock has been boosted by the favorable ruling by a federal appeals court as well. Evidently, the court overturned a $663.4-million judgment against Trinity Industries, which had been accused of misleading the government by selling defective guardrails. We expect a detailed commentary on the issue on the conference call.Nevertheless, our quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this time. This is because Trinity Industries doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP:  Trinity Industries has an Earnings ESP of -0.62%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Trinity Industries’ Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) while going into an earnings announcement.Trinity Industries, Inc.

391,NSC,"The transportation sector is widely diversified in nature comprising of airlines, railroads, truckers, equipment and leasing stocks, logistics companies, among others. So far this year, the sector has been experiencing a tough time courtesy multiple headwinds like back to back hurricanes, terror attacks and driver shortages, to name a few.Turbulence Awaits Transports in Q3?The Q3 earnings season has seen releases from 52 S&P 500 participants as of Oct 18. In fact, the latest Earnings Trends predicts that the entire S&P 500 space will end the quarter with earnings per share and revenues improving 3% and 4.9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.However, this overall bright picture is not shared by the transportation sector. Per the report, the bottom line for this key sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) is expected to decline 15.2% in Q3 due to high costs, on a year-over-year basis. Markedly, the same had increased 9.4% in Q2.Disappointing Price PerformanceThe turbulence in the space can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Transportation sector has underperformed the S&P 500 Index on a year-to-date basis. The sector has gained 8.3%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 14.4%.Why this Slide?The recent natural calamities (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico) have hurt the sector participants, significantly. For example, airline operators had to cancel multiple flights leading to significant loss in revenues. In fact, the negative impact of the hurricanes is also well reflected in the key transportation earnings reports available thus far. Evidently, United Continental Holdings had to cancel 8,300 flights in the quarter and consequently its third-quarter pretax income reduced to the tune of approximately $185 million.Additionally, these catastrophes have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines, leading to rapid increase in freight costs. In this regard, Union Pacific Corporation, which will reveal its results on Oct 26, expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share in the third quarter.Also, the sluggishness of the automotive unit is a cause of concern for railroads. For trucking companies, shortage of drivers remains a major headwind. Meanwhile, the rise in labor costs have hurt J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ third-quarter results and the trend is likely to continue in the rest of Q3.Increase in Fuel CostsThe rise in fuel costs does not augur well for transports. This is because costs associated with oil are considered to be one of the major input for any transportation company.Of late, fuel costs are on the rise with oil prices crossing the $50 a barrel threshold. This upsurge can be attributed to the improving demand outlook for the commodity and OPEC deal extension talks. Harvey also contributed to the same owing to gasoline shortages caused by the storm.Some Tailwinds RemainDespite the challenges, there are some positives for the sector participants. For example, improvement in the coal scenario has turned out to be a huge blessing for railroads as it is a key revenue generating commodity for them.The election of Donald Trump as the President of United States last year also worked wonders for the coal industry.  This is because Trump is in favor of reviving the industry by relaxing regulations detrimental to its prospects.Moreover, the busy Labor Day travel period (Aug 30-Sep 5) for U.S. airlines this year substantiates the strong demand for air travel, which in turn bodes well for airlines.Additionally, the upcoming holiday season is expected to be another factor aiding the turnaround efforts of the transportation sector. Travel plans this season are likely to surge owing to a number of bullish factors like solid job growth, rising wages and increased consumer spending.The advent of the holiday season also implies that package delivery companies like FedEx Corporation and United Parcel Service have their hands full. Markedly, they are leaving no stone unturned to meet surge in demand.A successful holiday season for the abovementioned companies are likely to boost their stock prices as well. This, in turn, is a positive for the entire transportation sector.How to Pick Likely Q3 Winners?Despite the overall gloomy scenario, the aforesaid factors clearly suggest that all is not lost for transports. There exist few hidden gems in the space that investors can unearth as they have the potential to generate handsome returns.However, given the vastness of the transportation space and the current issues, it is by no means an easy task to identify the attractive picks. This is where our proprietary model comes to the rescue.According to our model, stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP are likely to outperform.

392,NSC,"Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.4%. Also, the company has an impressive earnings history. It outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 4.8%.However, recent weather-related disruptions have hurt the company severely. Hence, an earnings beat is quite unlikely to happen in Alaska Air’s favor this quarter.Factors at PlayOf late, Alaska Air has been lying low due to escalating costs. The increase in fuel costs is expected to limit the company’s bottom-line growth in the third quarter. Fuel cost is projected to be $1.76 per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting an approximate 12% jump over the year-ago figure.Evidently, the Zacks Consensus estimate for third-quarter has been revised downward 15.6% over the last 90 days.Also in May, the pilots of Alaska Air Group’s subsidiary, Horizon Air, had approved an amendment to the existing eight-year pay-related contract. This, in turn has spiked the labor costs, shooting up pilots’ compensation following the amendment. This is likely to put further pressure on the company’s bottom line in the third quarter.Even though the Virgin America deal — the company acquired Virgin America in December 2016 — looks positive, we note that this transaction like any other merger, has integration risks attached to it. Similar to the previous quarter, merger-related costs are predicted to hurt Alaska Air’s bottom line in the third quarter as well.Due to the above-mentioned headwinds, shares of the company have lost 10.7% of its value in the last three months against the industry’s 0.3% gain, over the same period.  However, the company’s expansion initiatives are impressive. In August, the company announced a customer-friendly deal with Singapore Airlines. Accordingly, the two will form a codeshare agreement to allow sharing of flights, i.e., a passenger can avail any flight operated by either company covered under the contract, irrespective of the flight number. Also, from Sep 27 onward, members of Alaska Mileage Plan and Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer loyalty programs have begun earning miles on the flight.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

Notably, stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Norfolk Souther Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Norfolk Souther Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Norfolk Souther Corporation Quote Factors at PlayNorfolk Southern has been making constant efforts to streamline its operations to increase productivity. The company is looking to cut costs in order to drive the bottom-line growth this third quarter. Also, similar to the previous quarter, its operating ratio is likely to improve in the quarter to be reported.The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through share repurchase and dividends are also impressive. In a bid to enhance its shareholders’ value, the company’s board of directors approved a new share buyback program earlier in September. The company is now authorized to buy back an additional 50 million shares through Dec 31, 2022.The company further anticipates improving coal volumes to boost its third-quarter results.

397,NSC,"Ryder System, Inc. (R  -  Free Report), which operates one of North America’s largest truck fleets, is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens.In the second quarter, the Florida-based company’s adjusted earnings of $1 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. Earnings, however, declined 36% on a year-over-year basis. Ryder has a mixed record with respect to earnings per share, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters.Factors Likely at Play in Q3Strong rental activity is likely to boost Ryder’s third-quarter results. The company's efforts to grow its lease fleet remain a positive. The continuous growth in ChoiceLease revenues is encouraging, which is driving growth at Ryder's primary division — Fleet Management Solutions.As bulk of the company’s revenues is derived from the Fleet Management Solutions division, impressive performance at this unit will boost the top line in the third quarter. In view of the improving rental activity, Ryder expects third-quarter adjusted earnings per share between $1.25 and $1.35, much higher than the figure reported in the second quarter.The company's strong customer base is also a positive. We believe Ryder's top line in the third quarter might benefit from a strong product portfolio.However, weakness pertaining to automotive production volumes is expected to hurt results at its Supply Chain Solutions unit. High costs also might affect segmental results. Results at the company’s Dedicated Transportation Solutions may be hurt owing to higher insurance premiums.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model does not show conclusively that Ryder will beat earnings in third-quarter 2017.

However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks Rank: Ryder carries a Zacks Rank #2.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP of -0.19%, however, acts as a spoiler.

400,NSC,"Hawaiian Holdings Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 earnings numbers on Oct 19, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%. Also, it has an impressive earnings history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average of 7%.However, hurt by the recent hurricanes, airline stocks are lying low. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings have lost 19.4% of its value over the past three months, underperforming the industry’s 2.4% decline.  Let’s see how things shape up for this earnings.Factors at PlayUnit costs, excluding fuel, are projected to rise significantly in the third quarter primarily due to higher labor costs. This is likely to hurt the company’s bottom line. Also, rising fuel costs have caused the carrier to recently project third-quarter economic fuel cost per gallon between $1.65 and $1.75 (previous guidance had estimated the metric between $1.55 and $1.65). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter operating cost per available seat mile (CASM Ex-fuel) stands at $8.86, while average fuel price per gallon is estimated at $1.62.There is also negativity surrounding the stock, evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the soon-to-be-reported quarter earnings being revised 3.1% downward over the last 60 days.However, the carrier’s performance with respect to unit revenues is encouraging. The metric is expected to register substantial year-over-year growth in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) is pegged at 12.85 cents, much higher than the 12.53 cents reported in the second quarter of 2017 .Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hawaiian Holdings is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Hawaiian Holdings has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.88, marginally higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87.

403,NSC,"Things have looked up for the railroad space so far this year  after not-so-favorable past few years (particularly 2015 and 2016) owing to weakness in domestic coal shipments. The improvement in the coal scenario has turned out to be a huge blessing for railroads as it is a key revenue generating commodity for the sector participants.The election of Donald Trump as the President of United States last year also worked wonders for the coal industry.  The President is in favor of reviving the industry by relaxing regulations detrimental to its prospects. He has started to act on his promises made during the campaigning phase. For example, he has taken measures to repeal the Climate Power Plan.The rise in natural gas prices is also helping to revive the demand for coal. Moreover, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal production in the United States will improve in 2017 and 2018. Given the importance of coal to railroads, any positive development for the commodity implies good news for the sector. Improvement in the freight scenario is also a positive for railroads.The revival of coal is evident  from the impressive performances of key sector participants like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) that registered double-digit growth with respect to coal revenues in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, an improving economy has also proved to be a boon for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail.The shareholder-friendly activities of the likes of Norfolk Southern and Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) in 2017 also highlight the financial prosperity of the sector participants.Rail Traffic Data Highlights ImprovementThe latest U.S. rail traffic report (for the week ended Sep 30, 2017) of the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) reveals 1.9% year-over-year growth in rail traffic (sum of total carloads and intermodal units). While total carloads for the week declined 1.6%, intermodal volume increased 5.5% year over year. The favorable intermodal scenario is also a positive development for railroads.The year-to-date data unveiled by AAR is also encouraging with a 3.8% improvement in total carloads. The favorable coal scenario is underscored by the fact that coal volumes have registered double-digit (12.3%) percentage gains so far this year. Overall rail traffic is up 3.6% year to date, with intermodal traffic rising 3.5%.Headwinds That May Mar Q3 Earnings PictureIn view of the coal-related improvement, the bullish scenario related to the intermodal unit and the thriving domestic economy, results of companies in the railroads space are expected to impress in the third quarter of 2017. However, there are a few factors, which might dampen their third-quarter performance.The back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines. Freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters. With fuel costs on the rise, the bottom line of these companies are likely to be hurt in the third quarter due to higher costs as a result of the hurricanes.Union Pacific expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share in the third quarter.The sluggishness of the automotive unit is also a cause of worry for railroads.  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes is also likely to hurt railroads in the third quarter.  What Awaits These 6 Railroads in Q3?Given this backdrop, let’s take a look at how key railroad operators might fare in the third quarter of 2017. According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), based in Kansas City, MO, is unlikely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the third quarter despite its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -1.18% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.33 per share is a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its results are likely to be hurt by Harvey.

In fact, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when it is witnessing negative estimate revisions.

Hunt have underperformed its industry in the last six months. The stock has gained 17.8% compared with the industry’s rally of 23.4% during the period.However, the company’s expansion efforts are appreciative.

453,NSC,"Shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have performed well so far in 2017. The stock has gained 22.4% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming its industry’s rally of 21.6%.  Additionally, shareholders of this railroad operator were in for another good news recently. In a bid to enhance its shareholders’ value, the company’s board of directors of approved a new share buyback program. The company is now authorized to buy back an additional 50 million shares through Dec 31, 2022.Notably, Norfolk Southern has been rewarding shareholders through buybacks since 2006. Following the new authorization, the total number of shares that may be bought back now stands at 225 million as opposed to 175 million earlier. In fact, the company has repurchased approximately 43 million shares for $3.8 billion between Aug 1, 2012 and Sep 25, 2017 with approximately 9 million shares remaining as of the latter date. Furthermore, the company’s shareholder friendly attitude can be discerned from the fact that while releasing its second-quarter results in July 2017, it had increased its full-year 2017 target pertaining to buybacks from $800 million to $1 billion. Earlier in 2017, the company raised its quarterly cash dividend by 3% to 61 cents per share (annualized $2.44 per share).Going forward, Norfolk Southern expects its bottom line to expand in double digits by 2020 (compound annual growth rate). Markedly, the company’s decision to approve a new buyback plan is in line with the objective. We note that share repurchases benefit a company’s earnings per share by lowering outstanding share count.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNorfolk Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation space are Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A.

454,NSC,"It is a well-documented fact that railroads have performed well so far in 2017, driven by multiple tailwinds. In fact, the revival in the coal-related scenario has aided stocks in this space immensely. This is because coal is a key revenue generating commodity for railroads. Notably, coal accounts for more than 15% of revenues for railroads in the United States. Also, President Trump’s support for fossil fuels compared with the renewable energy is an added positive for the commodity.In addition, a thriving and improving economy proves to be a boon for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail. Given the importance of this commodity for railroads, any positive coal-related development is expected to bode well for the sector. Markedly, the revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25%, while the same at CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively. The improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. Moreover, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), which is a key player in the same space, raised its quarterly dividend to 36 cents per share (annualized $1.44 per share) representing an increase of 9.1% over the previous payout. The likes of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have raised their quarterly dividend payout this year as well, thus highlighting the financial prosperity of railroads.Roadblocks to Watch Out for in Q3Given this backdrop, the scenario looks bright for railroads in the third quarter of 2017. Despite the positives, the recent disruptions particularly those caused by Harvey might limit growth. In this regard, Union Pacific expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share.Furthermore, sluggishness pertaining to automotive volumes is an added concern for railroads in the to-be-reported quarter. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes are likely to hurt railroads significantly.What’s in Store in Q3?Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, we expect railroads to perform impressively in the third quarter on the bottom-line front. To counter the top-line woes, many railroads are looking to cut costs to drive their respective bottom lines. To this end, Union Pacific announced its decision to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees in August 2017, in a bid to increase efficiencies.Also, Norfolk Southern is looking to cut costs in order to drive its bottom line. The company anticipates improving coal volumes to boost its third-quarter results. While it is impossible to be sure about the exact nature of performance by railroads in the to-be-reported quarter, we expect stocks in this sector to perform impressively driven by the above-mentioned tailwinds despite the prevailing challenges. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

455,NSC,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Oct 17, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.5%. The company’s impressive earnings history shows that it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 8.4%.Let’s see, how things shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayBack-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) havedisrupted railroad operations and CSX is not spared the catastrophe either. Also, freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters. With fuel costs on the rise, CSX’s bottom line is likely to be hurt in the third quarter.Sluggishness of the automotive unit is also a cause for worry in CSX’s case. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of revenues, softness in automotive volumes is but likely to limit the company’s bottom-line growth in this soon-to-be-reported quarter.Recently encountered service disruptions by the company also do not bode well for its future and might hamper results in the quarter.Further adding to its woes, CSX surfaces as a highly leveraged company. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 11.9% downward over the last 90 days and this in turn reflects the stock’s surrounding negative sentiment.Due to these headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed its industry in the last three months. The stock has declined 2.7% against the industry’s 0.6% gain.  However, improvement in coal volumes holds promise for CSX in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter coal revenues stands at $530 million.  The intermodal segment is also expected to perform well in the third quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $451 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CSX is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CSX is -1.33%.

456,NSC,"Some of you may notice that Food-Confectionery is near the top of the Industry Rank List. This small group is comprised of three Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stocks: Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), Tootsie Roll Industries  and WM Wrigley (WWY). 
"
457,NSC,"Rising commodity prices, particularly sugar and corn, are a concern for all three companies. However, the candy companies are attempting to pass along the higher costs to consumers. For instance, Wrigley recently announced its intention to raise prices by 10% on most products. (WWY and HSY are also engaging in cost-cutting strategies to improve their margins.) 
"
458,NSC,"Brokerage analysts seem to believe that the companies will have some success in managing the higher commodity costs. Full-year profit projections for HSY are up two cents over the 30 days to $2.55 per share. The sole analyst covering TR has raised his full-year forecast by six cents over the past 60 days to $1.29 per share. Two of the 14 analysts covering WWY have adjusted their projections within the past 30 days, causing the consensus estimate to rise by a penny to $2.21 per share.
"
459,NSC,"Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report) recently raised its first-quarter guidance. The company now expects to earn between 94 and 98 cents per share this quarter versus its previous forecast of 85 to 90 cents per share. 
"
460,NSC,"Steel Dynamics CEO, Keith Busse, credited decreased import activity and lower inventories at steel service centers for improving market conditions. Inventory levels had been a concern for the industry because of higher Chinese production and weak demand by automakers. Brokerage analysts raised their forecasts on STLD following the release of the new forecast, sending the consensus first-quarter earnings estimate up by a cumulative nine cents to 96 cents per share. Full-year estimates are 12 cents higher at $3.82 per share.
"
461,NSC,"There have been some signs of a spillover effect. For example, one analyst raised his second-quarter profit forecast on U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) within the past week, causing the consensus estimate to move seven cents higher to $2.49 per share. In addition, three of the 14 covering brokerage analysts have adjusted their full-year projections. The new full-year earnings estimate of $9.28 per share is 16 cents higher than a week ago. (The first-quarter consensus estimate is unchanged.)
"
462,NSC,"Both STLD and X are Zacks #2 Rank stocks and are classified in Steel-Producers. This group also contains one Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy), Gerdau , and three other Zacks #2 Rank stocks.
"
463,NSC,"Last week, I discussed negative earnings estimate revisions for trucking companies. As a follow-up, I looked at trends for railroad companies. Within the past 30 days and within the past seven days, brokerage analysts have lowered their first-quarter projections for Burlington National (BNI), Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), CSX (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report).
"
464,NSC,"There are some similarities between the earnings estimates cuts for trucking and rail companies. Higher fuel costs are a headwind. Economic weakness is also a drag on earnings. For the railroads, weakness in the housing sector (lower volume levels of building supplies such as timber and wallboard) are likely to have an impact on first-quarter results. Lower demand throughout the automotive supply chain is not helping either. Plus, weather issues, particularly in Canada, are being factored in to the revised forecasts.
"
465,NSC,"One factor that still appears to be hurting trucking companies more than rail companies is competition. Rail companies have been taking market share away from trucking companies as fuel costs are making long-haul shipments by rail a more attractive option for customers. In addition, there are more trucks on the road creating downward pressure on spot prices as trucking companies try to keep their drivers busy.
"
466,NSC,"We are in a quiet period for earnings news. Since the end of February, the number of estimate revisions  both positive and negative  for companies within the Zacks Rank universe has fallen by 50% (based on a rolling four-week calculation). Companies were notably tight-lipped in terms of mid- to late-quarter guidance during the second-half of last year. Furthermore, first-quarter earnings season does not officially start until Apr 10, when Alcoa (AA) is scheduled to report. Therefore, we are likely to continue to see a decreased number of estimate revisions into the first half of April.

470,NSC,"The second-quarter earnings season is expected to be strong, with the S&P 500 index anticipated to see earnings growth of 5.6% and revenue growth of 4.5%, per the latest Earnings Trends. The stock market is also at record levels. However, the ongoing turmoil in Washington, geopolitical risks, Fed-related uncertainty, and lofty valuation could bring some difficulties for stocks this season (read: Sector ETFs & Stocks to Tap Q2 Earnings Growth).  While five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to post double-digit earnings growth, six sectors would lag. Plus, the current earnings estimate is down from 7.9% projected at the start of the second quarter. Amid such volatility, investors should focus on ETFs with large allocations to stocks that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming release. This could result in a winning bet this earnings season.How to Find ETFs?Handpicking ETFs with a portfolio of stocks that are most likely to beat on earnings is no mean task. However, our proprietary methodology of finding out the Earnings ESP of stocks by calculating the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is a solid building block.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Betting on ETFs with the winning combination of stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) would lead to profits in investor portfolios. This is especially true as an earnings beat will definitely draw investors’ attention and propel the stock price and related ETFs higher. Let’s see how the ETFs have been selected with this combination of stocks.First, we ran our Zacks stock screener to find out the stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank. Then, we narrowed down the list by selecting the group of stocks with higher positive Earnings ESP. Accordingly, we chose three ETFs, which contain few stocks with higher chances of beating estimates in a particular industry (see: all the ETF Categories here).Our research shows that for the stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. As a result, this trio could be excellent for investors seeking sure profits this earnings season.PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment Fund (PEJ  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment Intellidex Index and holds a small basket of 30 stocks. It is pretty well spread out across various securities as each holds less than 5.6% of total assets. About half of the stocks in the portfolio are expected to come up with an earnings beat, suggesting a solid upside for the ETF. In particular, American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), McDonald's MCD and Time Warner , which are among the top five holdings and account for 5% share each,  have an Earnings ESP of +4.62%, +0.60%, +4.94%, and +2.56%, respectively. AAL and DAL have a Zacks Rank #1 while the other two have a Zacks Rank #2.From an industry look, restaurants and airlines take the largest share at 31% and 21% of PEJ, respectively, followed by hotels & leisure facilities (21%) and casinos & gaming (13%). The ETF has amassed $126.4 million in its asset base and trades in a light volume of 28,000 shares a day on average. Expense ratio comes in at 0.61%. PEJ has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 with a High risk outlook (read: What Lies Ahead of Leisure & Travel ETFs in 2H?).iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report)The ETF provides exposure to the broad transportation sector by tracking the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index.

471,NSC,"Third-quarter earnings season is rounding third and heading for home. No reason to hurry though, the season has clearly been a homerun, knocking analysts expectations out of the park. Positive surprises outnumber negatives by almost 4:1 and the median surprise sits at an impressive 3.2%. Median growth thus far has been 12.0% and with over 100 companies yet to report, this metric still has room to run.
"
472,NSC,"So far, the growth leaders have been the Energy and Industrial sectors. Energy has shown much greater strength than expected, with median growth of 24.7% and a surprise ratio of 4:1. The tough comps havent hit the sector as hard as expected, and oil field service firms like Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) and Baker Hughes (BHI) are picking up the slack for lagging E&Ps. However, it seems clear that this will be the sectors last quarter of stellar growth. In the fourth quarter growth is expected to drop to just over 1%. Then again last years fourth quarter for the sector was so good it lead to congressional hearings, that is by any definition a tough comp. The Industrial sector continues to show strength as well and boasts median growth of 20.4% and a surprise ratio of over 5 to 1. Big upside surprises here came from Boeing (BA) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report), among others. 
"
473,NSC,"The growth laggard thus far continues to be Consumer Staples, with median growth of only 6.1%. This is more favorable than expected however, as the sectors surprise ratio is over 5 to 1, with a median surprise of 2.7%. The two earnings surprise leaders for the sector were Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) and Supervalu (SVU  -  Free Report). Food firms Conagra (CAG  -  Free Report) and McCormick (MKC  -  Free Report) also posted double-digit surprises. The Financial and Consumer Discretionary sectors are also lagging with single-digit growth.

476,NSC,"The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month was 3,368. This is at or very near the peak of total revisions we will see during the third quarter reporting season. Last weeks four-week revisions total was 2,556 for comparison. In the coming weeks, we should see the total number of revisions begin to fall off. 
"
477,NSC,"Over the last four weeks, there were 2,080 upward revisions and 1,288 downward. This makes for a total revisions ratio of 1.61, materially up from last weeks 1.46. The uptrend has continued now for several weeks and the 2006 revisions ratio has held solid above 1. Continued positive EPS surprises have pushed this ratio back to levels we saw during the peak of the Q2 earnings season.  
"
478,NSC,"The upward revisions were very widespread, with every sector seeing more upward than downward revisions. Looking more closely at individual revisions ratios, Energys ratio remains the laggard but is much improved from last week. The ratio jumped from 0.70 to 1.02. Lower comparable oil and gas prices, however, will continue to weigh on the sectors outlook. On the upside of the revisions story, Healthcare remains at the front of the pack with an impressive ratio of 3.07. Revisions were across the board here with big pharma clearly showing strength. Amgen (AMGN), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) all boast strong upward revisions.

"
480,NSC,"Looking ahead to next year, the revisions ratio has continued its uptrend and remains above 1.0, at 1.15. This is extraordinarily important. With the economy slowing, housing in a free fall and the yield curve inverted, one can easily make an intellectually coherent case for a recession next year. However, there has never been a recession where earnings grow at anything close to a double-digit rate. This is the elephant in the room that must be explained by any recession predictor. There is no way that the expected growth rate will come down unless estimate cuts exceed estimate increases.
"
481,NSC,"The bright point regarding 2007 revisions is clearly Utilities. The sectors ratio has reached 2.05. Two positive revisions leaders were American Electric (AEP) and the FPL Group (FPL). Other sectors seeing higher revisions ratios than last week were Materials and Health Care. Energys ratio was slightly higher as well, though still a dismal 0.50.

"
483,NSC,"On a full-year1 basis, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid. Double-digit gains are expected on both a median firm and total net income basis. On a median basis, growth for the current and next fiscal year is expected to be 13.5% and 12.7%, respectively. This growth rate has stayed relatively stable over the last several weeks. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 15.3% versus 9.8% next year. While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is a 9.8% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near-term recession. Further, with the revisions ratios of both 2006 and 2007 above 1.0, a significant deterioration of the expected growth rate does not look likely at this point. 
"
484,NSC,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS, and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. The shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. Countering this is the expensing of options this year. As recently as last year companies were allowed to use bogus intrinsic value accounting for stock options. In other words pretend that there was no cost to the company for making its executives extraordinarily rich in many cases. Now they have to realize that compensation is indeed an expense, which holds down reported earnings growth, even if there is no change in the economic earnings. Wherever possible, our estimates include the effect of expensing options.
"
485,NSC,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms. Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing over 37% this year and approximately 21% next year. However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is at the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis. The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors  ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report),  and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report)  account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings. Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip. The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007. Going the other way, total earnings growth in 2006 is much higher than median growth from the Financial Services sector. This is largely due to the very large insurance losses in 2005 due to the storms. The Financial Services sector has more firms in it, and accounts for more of the S&Ps total earnings than the Energy and Industrial sectors combined.

"
492,NSC,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
493,NSC,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
494,NSC,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.4%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.3% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
495,NSC,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.5% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 9.3% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 13.9% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 9.3%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase. Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd. Even though the NASDAQ is at only half of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
496,NSC,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 20.7% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 42.5% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index. In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 10.0x 2006, and 9.6x 2007 earnings. Tech on the other hand is trading for 22.0x 2006 and 18.8x 2007 earnings. The S&P is trading for 15.7x and 14.3x, respectively. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.
"
497,NSC,"Matt Thurmond contributed significantly to this report. 1 We follow the convention of referring to the most recently reported full fiscal year as 2005, and the next full fiscal year to be reported as 2006. There can thus be some shifting in the growth rates even for 2005 as not all calendar year firms have completed their fiscal years.

498,NSC,"Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 17, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company came up with better-than-expected earnings but lower-than-expected revenues. Earnings (on an adjusted basis) improved 29.6% from the year-ago figure, while revenues increased 8.5% year over year.Let’s see how things shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayThe back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) have been a major dampener to railroad operations and Canadian Pacific was no exception. Rise in fuel costs from natural disasters have the potential to hurt the bottom line in the third quarter.With the automotive sector accounting for a significant revenue volume, softness in the same might limit the bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, decreased revenues in other key segments like Sulfur and Fertilizer and Forest Products might further hurt results in the quarter.Also, Canadian Pacific is a highly leveraged company. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 2.9% downward over the last 60 days. This, in turn, reflects the negative sentiment surrounding the stock.However, the company’s cost-controlling efforts are expected to aid results in the quarter. Plus, its attempts to reward investors through share buybacks and raised dividend payments are impressive.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Canadian Pacific CSX is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Canadian Pacific has an Earnings ESP of -0.98% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.32 per share, marginally lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Canadian Pacific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, combined with the company’s negative ESP leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Canadian Pacific Railway Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Canadian Pacific Railway Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Canadian Pacific Railway Limited QuoteStocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may look into stocks worth considering like C.H.

499,NSC,"The U.S. equity market has been jittery of late as it has been engulfed by domestic as well as international issues. On the domestic front, investors seem to be getting increasingly anxious about President Trump’s capability to push through his pro-business agenda.Moreover, the havoc wreaked by tropical storm Harvey has also hit certain sectors severely like the airlines. In fact, increased volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) indicate bearish market prospects.Apart from domestic events, issues like the escalating North Korea-Japan tension and the terror attacks in Spain also resulted in markets being subdued, of late.Given this backdrop, investing in companies that pay consistent dividends can make for wonderful investments. Such companies are financially stable and mature, and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Railroads Riding High on Coal RevivalA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having railroad stocks. Notably, railroads are witnessing good times currently after having struggled in the past few years. The most important catalyst behind the upsurge is the revival pertaining to coal, which is a key revenue generating commodity for the sector participants.The revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25%, while the same at CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively.Meanwhile, the bullishness surrounding the railroad operators is evident from a 12.3% increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index, year to date. Furthermore, Trump’s pro-coal stance is also a boon for the sector.Rebound in Intermodal Volumes – Another Positive Apart from the improvement on the coal front, intermodal volumes have also improved this year after a disappointing 2016. According to the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA), intermodal volumes improved 2% year over year in the first quarter of 2017.The scenario improved further in the second quarter with intermodal volumes rising 4.5%. In fact, this was the highest growth rate recorded in almost three years. The positive readings certainly support the air of optimism surrounding railroads.Solid Price PerformanceThe improved scenario regarding railroads can be out from the fact that Zacks Rail industry outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 11.7%, the industry added 14%.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 18 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 7% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankAttractive ValuationWhen valued according to the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current financial year (F1), the industry does not appear too expensive as it is trading at 18.7x P/E multiple. The reading appears favorable when compared with its own traded multiple (trading lower than the median of 18.9x) in the last 12 months as well as the S&P 500 (19.4x). The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside.Railroads+ Dividends = Winning StrategyIn view of the tailwinds mentioned above, we believe that stocks from the railroad space should be present in one’s portfolio. Moreover, dealing with dividend stocks is a prudent strategy during uncertain times like the current scenario as highlighted above. Markedly, the best dividend stocks that pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects are less susceptible to market downturns.Consequently, we have zeroed in on four stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history. Also, they have raised their dividend payouts in the past 12 months.Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) is engaged in the rail and related transportation business. The company, based in Montreal, Canada, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Value Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company has a dividend yield of 1.5%. It has hiked its dividend payments for many years.

For full-year 2017, the same been revised 6% upward in the same period.Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report), headquartered in Calgary, Canada, operates a transcontinental railway network in Canada and the United States.

500,NSC,"Stocks in the railroad space have performed impressively so far this year buoyed by the improvement in the coal-related scenario. Since coal is a key revenue generating commodity for stocks in this space, any positive coal-related update is bound to lift their spirits.In fact, improvement on the coal front is highly significant for railroads as stocks in the space had struggled over the last few years due to dwindling coal shipments. The bullishness surrounding the railroad operators is evident from a 11.3% increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index, year to date.Coal Revival - The Primary Catalyst Behind the SurgeThe revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25% while the same at CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively.Currently, all these three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In fact, the election of President Trump last year has been a boon for this industry. Notably, Trump’s pro-coal stance is a huge positive for the commodity which lost much of its relevance during President Obama’s tenure as a source of fuel.Trump has been advocating the case for fossil fuels instead of renewable energy, and has raised questions regarding climate change and its expected widespread impact. Already, he has started to act on his pre-election promises and has also taken measures to repeal the Clean Power Plan. He walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement as well.A thriving and improving economy also supports the bullish case for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States on the rails. This improvement under the new regime is evident from the fact that the Zacks Rail industry outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 11%, the industry added 12.8%.Based on this healthy picture, we expect a surge in the usage of coal during the Trump regime. Additionally, coal volumes will be positively impacted in the event of higher industrial production.Intermodal Shows PromiseApart from the bullish coal-related scenario and industrial growth, improvement in intermodal volumes and pricing are also expected to boost stocks in the railroad space. In fact, things  have turned around for the better in the current year, which is a positive for the sector as intermodal continues to generate significant revenues for major U.S. railroad companies.According to the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes improved 2% year over year in the first quarter of 2017. The scenario improved further in the second quarter with the measure rising 4.5%. In fact, this was the highest growth rate recorded in almost three years.Financial StrengthWe note that the strong balance sheets of major railroads have enabled them to engage in shareholder-friendly activities. In keeping with this trend, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) recently announced a 9.1% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 36 cents per share. Moreover, the company announced fresh buyback plans.Additionally, the likes of Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP  -  Free Report) and CSX Corp. have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year. In another shareholder friendly move, Norfolk Southern recently increased its full-year 2017 target pertaining to buybacks from $800 million to $1 billion.In fact, the significant investments made by railroads to promote safety also raise optimism and indicate toward their financial well being.Going forward, railroads are also looking to drive bottom-line growth through various cost cutting measures. To improve efficiencies, Union Pacific recently announced that it intends to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Bullish ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 17 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads as an investing option on the back of the tailwinds mentioned above. Markedly, the favorable rank places the companies in the top 7% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankRailroads Should Grace Your PortfolioGiven the bullish sentiment surrounding railroads, we believe that it will be prudent for investors to add stocks from the space to their respective portfolios to generate handsome returns.However, given the vastness of the railroad space, it is by no means an easy task to identify the few bright spots. Therefore, we have utilized our Zacks Stock Screener  to pinpoint such stocks. The Zacks Rank, which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy.Our ChoicesBased in Montreal, Canada, Canadian National Railway Company is engaged in the rail and related transportation business.

501,NSC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Norfolk Southern has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.55. This level compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.04.If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock the current level puts Norfolk Southern’s current PE near highs over the observed period. This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its own historical levels.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.27. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Norfolk Southern has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 18.93 – lower than the current level. So, it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Norfolk Southern stock in the near term too.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Norfolk Southern has a P/S ratio of about 3.43. This is lower than the industry average, which comes in at 4.81x right now.NSC is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Norfolk Southern currently has a Value Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Norfolk Southern an apt choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 12.13, which is slightly better than the industry average of 12.22. Furthermore, the EV/EBITDA for Norfolk Southern is 10.35, a level that is lower than the industry average of 10.9. The EV/EBITDA multiple (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) is capital structure-neutral, as it takes into account the level of debt on a company’s balance sheet, not just its equity.Clearly, NSC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Norfolk Southern might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘D’ and a Momentum score of ‘D’. This gives NSC a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘C’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to seven lower, while the full year estimate has seen four upward revisions and four downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a small but meaningful impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased 3% over the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Norfolk Souther Corporation Price and Consensus Norfolk Souther Corporation Price and Consensus | Norfolk Souther Corporation QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineNorfolk Southern is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a formidable industry rank (Top 2% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. In fact, over the past year, the respective industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Meanwhile, we are impressed by Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward investors through share buybacks and dividend payments. The company, which has paid dividends for 139 consecutive quarters, shelled out $700 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth $800 million in 2016.Nevertheless, value investors might want to wait for the NSC’s price to correct downward a bit as well as estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

502,NSC,"The Q2 earnings season is gathering steam with releases pouring in. According to the latest Earnings Preview, by the end of this week, 280 S&P 500 companies will release their quarterly numbers. Out of them, 183 will be reporting during the course of this week.Per the report, the entire S&P 500 fraternity is projected to end the Q2 reporting cycle with bottom-line growth of 8.6%. The same set of companies is projected to witness top-line growth to the tune of 4.7%.Notably, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to see their bottom line expand on a year-over-year basis. One such sector is the highly diversified Transportation sector. The participants from this space are likely to end this quarter with the top and the bottom line expanding 9.6% and 6.9%, respectively. Both these figures compare favorably with the readings in Q1, when revenues grew 6.9% and earnings contracted 17.8%.In fact, transport stocks have benefited from an improving economy that has bolstered their revenue streams, resulting in the bullish projection for Q2. Additionally, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been a blessing for the sector participants. Apart from an improving economy, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations bolstering airlines, which is  a key component of the transportation sector.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await Q2 reports from key sector participants like Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), Ryder System, Inc. (R  -  Free Report) and Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) on Jul 26.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.Based in Norfolk, VA, Norfolk Southern is a major player in the railroad space. We expect the company to report better-than-expected earnings in this quarter.

503,NSC,"GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected earnings per share but lower-than-expected revenues in the second quarter of 2017. The company’s earnings (on an adjusted basis) of $1.32 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10.Revenues of $348.8 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $360.7 million. However, both earnings and revenues declined year over year, reflecting challenging market conditions. While the bottom line contracted 11.41%, revenues declined 2.93%.Segment-Wise ResultsProfits at the Rail North America segment were $74.9 million compared with $76.8 million, reported a year ago. This downside was mainly due to lower lease revenues and higher maintenance costs. During the reported quarter, GATX Corp.’s Lease Price Index (LPI) plunged 21.4% compared with a reduction of 25.4% in the second quarter of 2016. The metric declined 32.6% in the previous quarter. Furthermore, average lease renewal term for cars included in the LPI was 32 months in the reported quarter compared with 34 months in the year-ago quarter.Per GATX Corp.’s press release, Rail North America’s wholly owned fleet had approximately 121,000 railcars at the end of the second quarter. Fleet utilization came in at 98.8%, marginally up from the year-ago quarter.Profits at the Rail International segment rallied 27.7% year over year to $16.6 million.

Also, the company is projected to incur pre-tax severance costs worth approximately $90 million, with almost the entire amount forecasted to be recognized in the current quarter.According to a report appearing in the Associated Press, of the 750 job cuts, two-thirds are managers and the remaining are other workers of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

However, the company’s vast network (spanning across 23 states in the United States) is expected to be impacted by this cost-cutting move.Union Pacific Corporation Price  Union Pacific Corporation Price | Union Pacific Corporation QuoteNotably, dwindling coal shipments in the last few years have been hurting stocks in the railroad space, and Union Pacific is no exception.

505,NSC,"This week Im going to start with a group that I do not generally discuss, Cosmetics & Toiletries. Two recent earnings reports should prompt investors interest.
"
506,NSC,"Alberto Culver (ACV) concluded its 15th consecutive year of record revenues and earnings. Fiscal fourth-quarter revenues rose 8.2% to $974.3 million. Fiscal fourth-quarter profits totaled 72 cents per share, excluding a two-cent charge for the sale of a business unit; the consensus estimate had called for earnings of 70 cents per share. Analysts responded to the report by raising their forecasts for fiscal 2007. The new consensus estimate calls for profits of $2.85 per share, three cents higher than the forecast of a week ago.
"
507,NSC,"ACV plans separate its Sally/BSG business. As part of the separation (ACV shareholders will own 52.5% of the new Sally/BSG), Alberto Culver intends to pay a special dividend of $25 per share. The business split and the dividend are dependant on the outcome of a special shareholder meeting scheduled for Nov 10. 
"
508,NSC,"Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) earned 27 cents per share from continuing operations during its fiscal first quarter. Net sales, excluding foreign currency translation, rose 5%. New products and strength in the companys Aveda and Bumble and bumble brands helped to offset the loss of sales outlets caused by merger activity among department stores. Looking forward, CEO William Lauder reiterated his guidance for full-year earnings of $2.00 to $2.10 per share. Six of the 14 covering analysts adjusted their projections for full-year earnings following the earnings report, pushing the consensus estimate to $2.08 per share.
"
509,NSC,"Separately, EL announced a 25% increase in its annual dividend to 50 cents per share. The dividend will be payable on Dec 27 to shareholders of record on the close of Dec 8.
"
510,NSC,"Both EL and ACV are Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stocks. Cosmetics & Toiletries also has two Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks: Helen of Troy (HELE  -  Free Report) and Inter Parfums (IPAR  -  Free Report).
"
511,NSC,"Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank stock, easily surpassed analysts expectations with third-quarter earnings of $1.02 per share. The consensus estimate had called for profits of 83 cents per share. Railway revenues rose 11% to a third-quarter record of $2.4 billion thanks to higher average revenues, including fuel surcharges. Following the release of the report, full-year estimates for both 2006 and 2007 rose notably. The new 2006 full-year estimate calls for profits of $3.57 per share, 23 cents above the forecast of a week ago. The new 2007 full-year estimate calls for profits of $3.97 per share, 27 cents above the forecast of a week ago.
"
512,NSC,"NSC belongs to the Transportation-Rail group, which also includes one other Zacks #1 Rank stock, Canadian National (CNI  -  Free Report) and two Zacks #2 Rank stocks, Burlington National (BNI) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). All four railroads enjoyed volume increases and pricing power. Coal shipments and strong agricultural (e.g. corn for ethanol) continue to have a positive impact on rail companies in general.
"
513,NSC,"The number of estimate revisions continues to increase, causing movement on the Zacks Industry Rank List.  Using a rolling four-week period for 2006 forecasts, there have been more than 7,800 estimate revisions, the largest number we have seen in about two months. Expectations for full-year earnings1 appear to be stabilizing at slightly above 21.3% for stocks within the Zacks Rank universe2.

"
517,NSC,"The transportation sector is riding high on second-quarter financial results, with total earnings from 97.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization that has reported so far are up 9.6% on revenue growth of 10%. Both revenue and earnings surprises of 76.9% also seem impressive.This is because most of the industry players dominating the sector managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both, while a few lagged (read: 3 ETFs Loaded with Positive ESP Stocks).For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company – United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) – topped our estimates on both fronts. Earnings of $1.58 surpassed our earnings estimate by 12 cents while revenues of $15.75 billion edged past our estimated $15.48 billion. For the current fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect earnings per share in the range of $5.80–$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $5.95.The major railroads – Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report)) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) – beat on both the top and the bottom lines while Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) lagged on revenues. UNP and KSU surpassed our earnings estimate by 8 cents and 7 cents, respectively, and revenue estimates by $87 million and $33 million. On the other hand, earnings of $1.71 at NSC trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents while revenues of $2.637 billion were marginally below our estimated $2.642 billion.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat our earnings estimate by 7 cents and revenue estimate by $24 million (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).The two largest U.S. airlines – Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) – reported varied results. Earnings of $1.62 and revenues of $10.79 billion at Delta missed our estimates of $1.66 and $10.85 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.75 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72 and revenues of $10 billion were ahead of our estimated $9.96 billion.Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier – J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) – came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents and revenues were $6 million below our estimate.ETFs in FocusHowever, strong results failed to boost transport stocks as the sector saw 2.4% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. Given this, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading over the past one month. IYT shed 3.7% while XTN was down 2.2%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank of 4 or ‘Sell’ rating with a High risk outlook.IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 28% and 18% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm – FedEx (FDX) – at 13.7%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 46.7% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 29.8% of the portfolio while railroads, airlines and trucking round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $842.7 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of more than 342,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (read: Transport ETF Hits New 52-Week High).XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 45 stocks in its basket. It is skewed toward small caps at 55% while the rest is split between mid and large caps. As a result, the in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 36.4% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines takes one-fourth share. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $176.5 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a moderate volume of around 33,000 shares a day. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

518,NSC,"United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.54%. It reported earnings of $1.32, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30. Earnings increased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the results were aided by the substantial increase in operating profits at the Supply Chain and Freight unit.Moreover, revenues improved 6.2% to $15,315 million from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,179.5 million.Let’s see what awaits the company in the second quarter.Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterWe expect the company’s bottom line to be hurt by escalated costs in the quarter.  As of now, high package delivery costs have been hurting United Parcel for some time, and the to-be-reported quarter is likely to be no different.Moreover, United Parcel, like its rival FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report), is leaving no stone unturned to expand its presence. Though positive on such efforts, we believe that expansion related expenses might also drag down second-quarter earnings.Foreign currency-related headwinds are expected to hurt the quarter’s results too. Additionally, unfavorable product mix and weakness in industrial production might dampen the company’s performance.In fact, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the 1.4% decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings over the last three months. However,  the company’s efforts to reward shareholders consistently through buybacks and dividend payouts are impressive.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that United Parcel will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: United Parcel has an Earnings ESP of -0.69% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.45 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.46. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: United Parcel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is, we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.United Parcel Service, Inc.

519,NSC,"Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Jul 26, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.96%. It also has an impressive earnings track record. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 5.21%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Alaska is likely to beat on earnings this quarter too, since it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.40%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $2.51, whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.50. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alaska carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayThe acquisition of Virgin America will continue to augment the company’s top line in its second quarter, owing to increased passenger revenues. The carrier’s expansion efforts are also encouraging. In May 2017, the carrier started non-stop flights connecting Philadelphia and Portland, OR to meet the growing demand during summer. The flights have been operating on a daily basis from May 22 and will continue until Aug 26.The company’s traffic results in May and June are also impressive. Consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles, RPMs) increased 7.6% and 8.3% in May and June, respectively. Additionally, load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers increased 140 basis points (bps) and 100 bps in May and June respectively, owing to an expansion in traffic growth in excess of capacity expansion. However, in May 2017, pilots of Horizon Air, a subsidiary of Alaska approved of an amendment to the existing eight-year pay-related contract. This will increase labor costs significantly, thus hurting the bottom line in the second quarter.Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Alaska Air Group, Inc.
