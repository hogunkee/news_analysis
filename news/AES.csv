0,AES,"Why would anyone buy an electric utility stock in this market?Interest rates are rising, trimming the chief advantage of dividend stocks. The electric utilities stock group is down 5% so far this year vs. an 11% gain for the Nasdaq.So, why would anyone buy a utility stock?The answer might be AES Corp. The Arlington, Va.-based utility with an international customer base was up as much as 22% this year before a recent drop trimmed the stock's gain to 17%.The stock's relative strength rating is 79, which means AES is outperforming almost eight of every 10 stocks in IBD's database.A midcap, AES pays an annualized dividend of 52 cents a share, which is 43% of its estimated earnings for 2018. The payout is only 16% of cash flow per share.According to IBD sister firm William O'Neil + Co., the dividend growth rate is a stunning 32%.Part of the reason for the fast growth in the dividend is that the company only began paying dividends in late 2012.Going into Wednesday's session, the annualized yield was 4%.After two years of declining earnings, AES increased earnings 14% in 2017. The Street expects earnings to grow earnings 11% and 9% in 2018-19.CEO Andres Gluski at the May 8 earnings call noted that the company is undergoing a transformation.Recent steps include selling the company's Philippine assets for $1 billion and using most of the money to pay down debt. AES also ""derisked"" a hydroelectric project in Chile by signing a new fixed-price construction contract.Gluski's goal is a $100 million cost reduction.The company laid off 12% of its global workforce, ""including eliminating 30% of management positions,"" Gluski said at the call.AES provides energy to 15 countries.RELATED:IBD's Stock Of The DayFacebook Fends Off CriticsGet Real: The Myth Investors Need To DropThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner

14,AES,"Stocks rode through Wednesday's closing bell with moderate gains, buoyed by the release of minutes showing the Fed bullish on a possible rate hike in June.The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq each added 0.4%. The S&P 500 rose more than 0.2% and made a new closing high. Preliminary data showed volume was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq than at the end of trade Tuesday.Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's May 2-3 meeting showed the Fed remained supportive of an increase in the key interest rate at its June meeting, which would mark the second rate hike this year and the third since December. The minutes also showed the committee considering to begin winding down the Fed's $4.5 trillion stockpile of bond holdings amassed in its monetary stimulus, but probably not until later in the year — a reprieve for those who had begun expecting some action as early as September.Investors liked what they heard, sending the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq sharply higher just after the release. That left the S&P 500 a breath below its prior high of 2405 set May 16. The Nasdaq and the Dow also held below their prior peaks.Goldman Sachs (GS) surged 2% to lead the Dow industrials. General Electric (GE) dropped 1.6% after Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said the company would need to cut deeper into costs to meet targets in its ambitious restructuring. Goldman Sachs rose close to its 10-week moving average. GE's loss snuffed a four-day bounce from a 52-week low.Financial software brand Intuit (INTU) easily topped the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, up 7% after strong fiscal third-quarter results late Tuesday. The gap-up left shares extended above buy points of 127.74 and 128.55.Clinching the No. 2 and No. 3 slots on the S&P 500 were utilities NRG (NRG) and AES (AES), up 5.5% and 3%, respectively. Rallying utilities sometimes signal a defensive shift among institutional investors.Jewelers took some of the day's hardest hits. Tiffany (TIF) suffered a 9% drop after delivering mixed first-quarter results. Signet Jewelers (SIG), scheduled to report first-quarter results before Thursday's open, tanked 7%.Aircraft components maker Triumph Group (TGI) spiked 30.5% after a big fiscal fourth-quarter earnings beat, although full-year revenue guidance was below the consensus view. The gain hoisted shares back above the stock's 10- and 40-week moving averages, ending 62% above an early-May low.Among IBD 50 stock's, Stamps.com (STMP) rallied 5% to close within 3% of a 136.10 buy point in a cup base. Dave & Buster's (PLAY) jumped nearly 3%, ending just below a 67.93 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.Dycom (DY) was the day's distress story, unraveling nearly 18% on weak current-quarter guidance.RELATED:Fed Is In No Rush To Shrink Balance Sheet, Markets Exhale3 Stocks In Or Near Buy Range: Investing Action Plan

Another is still in buying range.Utilities lagged Tuesday but have generally been acting well after Wall Street perceived the Fed to be more dovish than hawkish at the conclusion of last week's meeting.The Fed, as expected, left the federal funds rate unchanged, while longer-term rate projections showed a slower pace of increases. Policymakers now expect three rate hikes through the end of 2017, down from five at their June meeting.The Sept. 21 policy statement fueled a nice rally in interest-rate-sensitive utility stocks. SPDR Utility (XLU) jumped 2% in strong volume. However, on Tuesday, the popular ETF reversed off intraday highs, falling 1.3%, and sinking back below its 50-day moving average near 50.51.Consolidated Edison (ED) reclaimed its 10-week moving average last week as it works on a flat base with an 81.98 entry. It had the highest Accumulation/Distribution Rating in Tuesday's screen at A-. The rating, on a scale of A+ to E, is used to measure institutional buying and selling in a stock over the past three months. A+ signifies heavy institutional buy; E means heavy institutional selling.Consolidated Edison has paid a dividend of 67 cents a share for three straight quarters. It currently yields 3.4%.On a day when the Utility-Electric Power group fell around 1%, NextEra Energy (NEE) bucked the trend, rising 0.4%. It's also working on a flat base with a 132.08 buy point.NextEra pays a quarterly dividend of 87 cents a share, giving it an annualized yield of 2.8%.While many utilities are building bases, AES Corp. (AES) is in a slightly different boat because it's still in buy range after a breakout over a 12.82 buy point.The Virginia-based firm is another electric utility that pays a quarterly dividend of 11 cents a share, good for an annualized yield of 3.4% -- much better than the S&P 500's current yield of 2.07% as of Monday's market close.

Rowe Price Value Fund (TRVLX), Finn often uses the dips to set up long-term positions in his mutual fund.The recent December-to-January stock market pullback presented its own set of opportunities for Finn. ""It has been a GDP-scare sell-off,"" he said ""People are worried the economy might tip back into a recession, so cyclicality is on sale right now. What I am looking for in particular are companies where I can get a really attractive dividend yield and (which) generate a lot of free cash flow and (which have) been cheapened because they're perceived to be cyclical business.""Finn is ready to pick his spots should more pullbacks occur in the months ahead. ""I am not overly optimistic about the market overall,"" he said. ""If we end the year flat to where we began, I think that would be as expected. In the interim, I'm getting chances to buy some really good companies with dividend yields of close to 5% that are trading at P/E multiples of 9 or 10 times.""T. Rowe Price Value was down 5.79% year to date going into Thursday vs. declines of 5.61% for its large-cap value peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 5.25% for the S&P 500. Over the past five years, the mutual fund has returned an annual average of 9.90%, beating its peers' 7.58% but trailing the S&P 500's 10.46%.The fund carries an IBD 36-Month Performance Rating of A-, meaning it's among the top 10% of all mutual funds in three-year performance.Finn relies upon a robust team of research analysts to help with fundamental stock picking. “We are opportunistically trying to identify and invest in quality companies that are facing some controversy or perceived controversy that we have determined are trading below intrinsic value,” he said. “When we have a good idea, we make it a big position to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders.”As of the end of 2015, General Electric (GE) was T. Rowe Price Value's top holding. Finn is optimistic that GE’s renewed focus on its industrial businesses will help increase margins over time. ""It has been one of the best-performing industrial companies over the last one, three and five years,"" he said. ""I think GE is going to continue to relatively outperform in industrials. They have really figured out what their mission is.""GE has seen its stock price climb 15.9% over the past year. The shares were up almost 1% in the stock market today.Pfizer (PFE), another top holding, has sunk 16% below its 52-week high. ""It has fallen back because of its Allergan (AGN) acquisition, but Pfizer is a phenomenal company with a really nice pipeline of products, and it now has a really good yield,"" Finn said.Pfizer is down 13% from a year ago, but sports a 4.0% dividend yield.In the energy sector, Finn has a favorable outlook for Exelon (EXC). ""It has a great dividend yield, and it looks like there may be a cyclical bottom coming in energy,"" he said.Shares of Exelon yield 4.0% and have gained 12% so far this year.Holdings that Finn sees as undervalued also include International Paper (IP) and AES (AES). “These are companies trading at around a 5% dividend yield, and the market perceives them as being cyclical and risky, but I really don't,” he said.

34,AES,"It looks like all systems go for Tesla Motors' Model X crossover SUV launch Sept. 29, but analysts are watching the electric-car maker's battery strategy as a longer-term catalyst for Tesla stock, which rose to its 50-day moving average Wednesday. Tesla (TSLA) stock edged up a fraction Wednesday to 248.91. It's not highly ranked by IBD, with a Composite Rating…
"
35,AES,"What could the rise of battery energy storage systems by the likes of Tesla Motors do for utilities? To hear CEO Elon Musk put it recently when talking about his new Tesla Energy division, batteries could let the world turn off half its power plants just by tweaking how and when the rest run, not factoring in solar or wind…
"
36,AES,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) has inked a couple key new deals for its batteries to be used in big power projects, after debuting its Tesla Energy business unit in April and showing off Tesla Powerwall batteries for the home. That sent Tesla stock to a 2015 high.Ireland-based wind energy and energy-storage company Gaelectric Group said Thursday that it will deploy Tesla Energy's first battery power utility-scale project there next year — a one-megawatt demonstration project — while the companies collaborate to develop a pipeline of battery projects to build new transmission system services that are needed to help integrate renewables such as solar power and wind power with the electric grid.Storing the energy produced by renewables such as solar and wind can help those sources deliver power to the electric grid in a smoother pattern, so it's not just when the sun is shining and when the wind is blowing. And that can be crucial to the power grid's efficient planning and operation as renewable sources become bigger suppliers.""We are delighted to be associated with Tesla in introducing its battery systems to Ireland,"" Gaelectric CEO Brendan McGrath said in the announcement. ""As a renewable energy group with a pipeline of 500 MW of wind power in Ireland and energy storage projects in Ireland and Europe, Gaelectric has an obvious incentive to drive the adoption of technologies that facilitate the economic dispatch of wind and other renewable sources.""Gaelectric said that it and Tesla are focused on ""exploring the development and demonstration of innovative business models for energy storage within transmission systems"" and that Ireland ""has many compelling features"" for the commercialization of the Tesla Energy product range, ""given its scale and ambitious renewable energy targets and favourable regulatory framework.""Gaelectric said that investigation of other European markets will be part of the collaboration.On Wednesday, Georgia-based public utility Southern Co. (SO), which serves more than 4.5 million customers in the U.S. Southeast, announced at its annual stockholders meeting that it has reached an agreement with Tesla to test commercial-scale battery storage.Southern has also been testing Tesla vehicles for use in its operations, along with EVs from GM (GM), Ford (F) and Nissan (NSANY).In the utility arena, Tesla already has a pact with Edison International (EIX) units Southern California Edison and SoCore Energy, implementing energy storage projects that feature Tesla Powerpacks. It also has agreements with Advanced Microgrid Solutions, OnCor and AES (AES).And Tesla had previously named ""highlighted Powerwall distribution partners"" including Treehouse — billed as a ""sustainable home improvement store"" — inverter makers Fronius and SolarEdge (SEDG), and Vermont public utility Green Mountain Power.The lithium-ion batteries that Tesla uses, and will eventually make in its Nevada gigafactory as it works on emerging battery technologies, are not the only way to store energy at utility scale — thermal storage techniques use anything from water to sand.And there are other technologies. Gaelectric got into storage in 2006, formally setting up its Gaelectric Energy Storage business unit then. Among its projects is a 330-MW compressed-air energy storage tech project in Northern Ireland. The company notes that it has ""established positions"" in onshore and wind generation in Ireland and the U.S.Tesla stock rose 1.6% to 251.45 on Thursday, hitting its best intraday level since Nov. 18. Shares are up 13% so far this year.But after two straight non-GAAP losses, Tesla does not currently get a high Composite Rating from IBD, after a stellar stock run-up in 2013 and strong gains in 2014.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter: @IBD_DHowell.RELATED: What Is Tesla Energy And Can It Profit For Elon Musk?

38,AES,"At this year's American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, a medical conference that starts Friday in Chicago, some of the world's biggest drugmakers will show off the latest data from a new class of cancer drugs that could bring new hope to patients — and enrich investors.
"
39,AES,"These drugs are part of a field called immuno-oncology (I-O), which uses technologies that manipulate the patient's immune system to help it fight cancer.
"
40,AES,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) has already launched one such product, Yervoy, which is expected to crack the $1 billion sales mark this year thanks to its FDA approval for fighting melanoma. Bristol, though, has much bigger ambitions for Yervoy, especially in combining it with nivolumab, its newer immuno-oncology candidate.
"
41,AES,"Nivolumab is a PD-1 inhibitor, a drug that attacks the mechanism that lets cancer cells fool the immune system into leaving them alone. Merck (MRK) also has a PD-1 inhibitor in its pipeline called MK-3475, and AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche are developing similar drugs called PD-L1 inhibitors.
"
42,AES,"Until recently, Bristol-Myers was assumed to be the leader in the field for two reasons.
"
43,AES,"The first is that the company is one of the furthest along in clinical trials, and its excellent past results against squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) — an especially virulent form of the disease that has few treatment options — led investors to hope that Bristol would file for approval based on phase-two data and be first to market.
"
44,AES,"The second is that Bristol is testing nivolumab combined with Yervoy for lung cancer. If successful, the combination would mean revenue from both drugs in a much larger market than for melanoma.
"
45,AES,"In January, however, Merck surprised the Street by starting a rolling submission process for MK-3475 in melanoma. That means it will add data as they come in until the application is complete, which it expects to happen before the end of June. Bristol announced in April that it is starting the same process for nivolumab in squamous NSCLC, but it still seems likely to get to market second.
"
46,AES,"Then on May 14, the abstracts for presentations at theASCO meeting, which runs through Tuesday, went online. The abstracts gave investors their first good look at the combination trial of nivolumab and Yervoy in NSCLC and kidney cancer. They also cover trials testing the effect on lung cancer of nivolumab alone and combined with Roche's Tarceva.
"
47,AES,"The result: Bristol stock fell 6%.
"
48,AES,"In a May 15 research note, BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei downgraded Bristol's stock to market perform.
"
49,AES,"""In NSCLC, the focus was on the Nivo+Yervoy data, which showed a modest 22% response (rate) and a poor adverse event (AE) profile: 48% grade 3/4 AEs (on a scale of 1 to 5 by severity), most leading to discontinuation, and 6.5% drug-related deaths,"" he wrote. ""Similarly, the addition of Tarceva to nivo doesn't seem to add much, and the additional benefit of combining nivo with chemo(therapy) does not seem worth the added toxicity.""
"
50,AES,"Arfaei was also underwhelmed by the nivolumab-Yervoy data on kidney cancer, which was better than on lung cancer but not better than nivolumab had done with other agents.
"
51,AES,"T.J. Qatato, co-manager of the Frost Growth Equity Fund, told IBD that he was disappointed for the same reasons. But he advocates patience, pointing to the learning curve of clinical trials.
"
52,AES,"""You still have Bristol-Myers experimenting with what the right dosage is with Yervoy, given it is their first I-O drug,"" he said. ""We've also known that it does have higher adverse events than some of the other I-O drugs. You're dealing with some small sample sizes as well — try not to draw too many conclusions.""
"
53,AES,"Qatato, who owns Bristol-Myers shares, says that he'll be looking for the late-breaking abstracts, which will be made public on Friday. Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger echoed that sentiment when he reiterated his overweight rating on May 15, writing in a note that Bristol should unveil more mature data based on longer-term treatment. Risinger added that ""management continues to feel confident about moving nivo + Yervoy combo into Phase 3 for lung cancer later this year.""
"
54,AES,"Merck's abstracts, by contrast, were in line with expectations, though Qatato says he's disappointed that the company isn't speeding up its lung-cancer timeline to compete with Bristol's.
"
55,AES,"That's not a complaint that anyone can lodge against AstraZeneca. On May 8, the company announced that it will start a phase-three trial of its PD-L1 inhibitor, MEDI4736, in NSCLC, skipping phase two.
"
56,AES,"At the ASCO meeting, investors will get a look at some of the phase-one data, which so far consist of only a couple of small studies. One looks at 26 patients with lung cancer, melanoma or other cancers. The response rate was only 15%, which compares unfavorably with the response rates surpassing 30% for Bristol's and Merck's drugs.
"
57,AES,"Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, however, points out that the AstraZeneca study's patient count is tiny and that typically only a subset of patients respond to these drugs — especially those who express the PD-L1 biomarker. (A biomarker is a measurable substance or characteristic that indicates the presence of a disease or another biological condition or process.)
"
58,AES,"In fact, Bristol's study of nivolumab as a monotherapy (nivolumab without other drugs) for lung cancer found that while the overall response rate was 30%, the rate for PD-L1-negative patients was zero.
"
59,AES,"Fund manager Qatato hopes that the ASCO meeting will bring more information on this biomarker.
"
60,AES,"""I don't have a good sense of the population of cancer prevalence for the PD-1 expression,"" he said. ""What's difficult is that PD-1 expression isn't just positive or negative. You can have 1%, 5%, 50%. If we got a better sense of how big that population is, we would get a better feel for what kind of market opportunity we can throw on this whole I-O revolutionary treatment for cancer.""
"
61,AES,"But Conover says that in the near term, this ignorance of PD-1 prevalence will likely keep the market big.
"
62,AES,"""My sense is because there are no treatments out there, and because it (the family of PD-1 drugs) works very well if you get the right patients, it's going to be used across the board until the scientific community figures out PD-L1 status a little bit better,"" he said.At this year's American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, a medical conference that starts Friday in Chicago, some of the world's biggest drugmakers will show off the latest data from a new class of cancer drugs that could bring new hope to patients — and enrich investors.These drugs are part of a field called immuno-oncology (I-O), which uses technologies that manipulate the patient's immune system to help it fight cancer.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) has already launched one such product, Yervoy, which is expected to crack the $1 billion sales mark this year thanks to its FDA approval for fighting melanoma.

64,AES,"American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens. Last quarter, this electric utility reported a positive earnings surprise of 4.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAmerican Electric filed several rate cases in Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas in 2017, outcomes from which are expected by management in first half of 2018. Thus, we believe that the upcoming results are likely to be impacted by the developments of these rate cases.GDP growth in the company’s service territory exceeded that of the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017, courtesy of higher energy prices and the strong global economy. Moreover, rise in employment in its service territory hints at improved purchasing power and thus a notable residential sales growth for American Electric is expected in the near term.However, the company’s commercial sales were drab in the fourth quarter of 2017. Considering this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Electric’s first-quarter revenue estimate of $3.74 billion, reflects an annual decline of 4.9%.On the other hand, lower tax rates courtesy of the latest tax reform is expected to boost American Electric’s quarterly bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings reflects 4.2% improvement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for American Electric this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Electric has an Earnings ESP of -0.05%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Electric carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. American Electric Power Company, Inc.

CMS Energy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 0.61%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayLower tax rate, courtesy of the recent tax reform, is likely to fuel the company’s bottom line. In sync with this, the company’s first-quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 80 cents, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 12.7%.Weather conditions remain a key determinant for the company’s to-be-reported quarter. CMS Energy’s service territories witnessed colder-than-normal winters in the first quarter, which is likely to result in higher household expenditures on heating. Thus demand for electricity is likely to remain high. Needless to say, CMS Energy’s revenues in the quarter under review is likely to increase courtesy of this.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $1,829 million, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.During the first quarter, management increased CMS Energy’s dividend by 7.5%, which indicates the company has solid cash flow.

66,AES,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) will release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 90.95%. Also, Entergy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 60.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the first quarter, most of the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal winters. This indicates reduced demand for electricity in these regions, which in turn, is expected to weigh on Entergy's first-quarter sales.Moreover, management expects the company’s Entergy Wholesale Commodity (EWC) segment to post lower net revenues throughout 2018. The downside can be attributed to lower energy prices, increased non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses on account of higher projected nuclear spending. We believe the upcoming results to reflect this trend, which in turn, is likely to be a drag on the company’s total revenues. In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46 billion for Entergy’s first-quarter sales reflects a year-over-year decline of 5.1%.On the bottom-line front, corporate income tax expense courtesy of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is expected to boost Entergy’s earnings growth, in the first-quarter. Considering this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Entergy’s first-quarter earnings of $1.31 per share reflects annual growth of 32.3%.In November 2017, Entergy Mississippi filed its redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately $61.5 million as of September 30, 2017. In January 2018, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved the proposed energy cost factors effective for February 2018 bills. So, a part of this $62 million will positively impact the company’s first quarter results.On the flip side, higher fuel costs are expected to weigh heavily on the company’s results in the yet-to-be reported quarter. The increase in fuel costs can be attributed to rise in nuclear spending that Entergy expects to incur in relation to its nuclear strategic plan like continuing operation of the Palisades plant through 2022.Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Entergy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

68,AES,"As solar energy keeps getting cheaper by the day, countries across the globe are fast adapting to the clean energy source to fulfil all energy needs. Countries like China have stepped up their game by investing significantly in cutting-edge technologies related to solar energy. As a matter of fact, China has also surpassed the United States when it comes to investing in clean energy. This has led to speculation about the future of solar energy in the United States and whether it would lose to China in the solar race.Short answer: No. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has announced significant investments committed solely to developing the solar technology in the country. Also, the private sector has seized this opportunity to invest openhandedly in solar projects. Finally, the space witnessed a massive revolution in the last decade even as the U.S. government continues to keep pushing boundaries in the solar space.U.S. DOE to Fund Development of Solar TechnologyOn Apr 17, 2018, the U.S. DOE announced that it had reserved as much as $105.5 million for funding approximately 70 projects to enhance solar photovoltaic (PV) as well as concentrating solar thermal power (CSP) technologies. The funding also seeks to start off the process to securely integrate these projects into America’s national electric supply framework.U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry’s announcement regarding the funding also aims at preparing the US labor force for the future of the solar industry in the country. The funding program has been divided into four segments: About $46 million would be earmarked for about 14 advanced solar systems integration technologies, about $24 million would be spent on 21 CSP R&D projects and approximately $27 million would be kept aside for 28 projects for PV R&D. Finally, $8.5 million would be used to enhance the solar industry by preparing the workforce for the future.Federal funding has done a world of good to the energy landscape of the United States in the last 10 years. The return on investments from such federal projects has been astonishing. Investments to advance energy efficient technology have led to savings of about $22 billion. That roughly translates to a benefit-to-cost ratio of 66:1. Further, DOE’s continued efforts to reduce emission levels are likely to generate benefits of nearly $111 billion by the end of 2020.Corporate Ventures in the PipelineDeclining costs associated to wind and solar power along with grid developments have resulted in many global companies showing interest in the space. Further, conforming to the norm, even U.S.-based solar corporations have planned new ventures for the coming days.In March 2018, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) announced the single largest corporate purchase of solar power in the United States by signing an agreement with sPower — a subsidiary of AES Corp. (AES  -  Free Report) — to add 315 MW of electricity via two solar projects in Virginia.Further, again in March, NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) announced an agreement to purchase solar panel from Chinese solar module manufacturer — JinkoSolar Holding (JKS  -  Free Report). Over the next four years, JinkoSolar will supply approximately 2,750 MW of high-efficiency solar modules to NextEra Energy. Production of the solar panels will start in the second half of 2018. (Read More)San Jose, CA based SunPower Corp.’s (SPWR  -  Free Report) CEO Tom Werner stated last month that the company plans to set up a factory somewhere in the United States. Also, on Apr 18, the company entered into an agreement with Germany’s solar panel manufacturer SolarWorld for an undisclosed amount.The deal is expected to add a further 500MW to the company’s production capacity. The company has also entered into a deal with NextEra Energy to provide solar panels to the latter. SunPower has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Factors Supporting Sector’s GrowthWhat has kept the sector afloat has primarily been a steep reduction in cost of wind and solar energy. Per a report by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), solar photovoltaic (PV) modules prices had dropped more than 80% in 2017 from 2009. Costs related to electricity from solar PV fell by about three-quarters in the period between 2010 and 2017. Also, the global weighted average cost of electricity (LCOE) of utility-scale solar PV has seen a decline of 73% since 2010.Another reason why the segment has done well is the high demand outlook for renewables. Per, Renewable Energy: United States report of December 2017, domestic demand for clean energy is expected to surge to 12.6 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) by the end of 2021.Demand for solar energy in particular, is expected to soar 20% annually on the back of its abundant supply. This makes solar energy a better alternative to fossil fuel, which is deemed to get exhausted.Finally, the solar space has also richly benefited from the environmental tax credit which was introduced as part of the $1.15 trillion federal spending bill of December 2015. Per the terms of the Bill, the Congress modified and extended federal tax credits for new wind and solar generators.This helped solar corporations to claim federal Investment Tax Credits (""ITC"") at 30% of the price of solar energy systems installed by businesses or homeowners, essentially allowing for more funds for R&D.To ConcludeWashington’s continuous drive to establish a sustainable solar industry within the United States has resulted in the government splurging even more on the clean energy space. Labs controlled by governments together with private corporations have led to ground-breaking developments in the alternative energy space. Despite China’s efforts to stay at the top of the solar race by investing much more than its competitors, America has fast caught up with the Asian giant.Further, cost-efficient technology in the United States has enabled the government to save billions of dollars as well as created plenty of jobs. It would therefore be incorrect to say that the United States lags China, which currently suffers from its credit woes and therefore severe paucity of funds. The right investments would certainly place the United States ahead of China in the solar race.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

69,AES,"Industrial production continued to notch up gains in March, though the pace of increase declined to an extent. Data from the Federal Reserve shows that a sharp rebound in output from utilities and a second straight increase in mining output were primarily responsible for March’s gains.Meanwhile, capacity utilization touched a three-year high, indicating that the economy possesses sufficient underlying strength. This lower level of slack is likely to increase inflationary pressures which in turn would help to raise GDP. Given this backdrop investing in utilities stocks, which provide lucrative dividends, remains a smart option at this point.Capacity Utilization Hits 3-Yr HighThe highlight of last month’s industrial production data was a spurt in capacity utilization. This gauge of slack in the industrial segment of the economy advanced 0.3 percentage point to touch 78%. The figure exceeded the consensus estimate of 77.9 and also hit its highest level in three years. A decline in industrial sector slack will likely boost inflation, which in turn could fuel growth further.However, industrial production itself increased by only 0.5%, exceeding the consensus estimate of 0.3% but falling well behind February’s revised increase of 1%. The pace of gains dropped because manufacturing output managed only to inch up 0.1% in March after a 1.5% advance in February.Utilities Gains Powers Headline NumberPrimarily responsible for March’s manufacturing gains was a 2.7% increase in auto production. Assemblies of automotive units jumped to an annual pace of 12 million units, the highest recorded since December 2016. Excluding the auto production component, manufacturing actually declined 0.1% in March. This was in keeping with the ISM Manufacturing Index’s 1.5% decline to 59.3.Ultimately, gains in mining and utilities output lifted the headline number. Gains in support activities and oil and gas production helped boost mining output by 1%. More significantly, utilities output advanced by 3%. This strong rebound for the sector comes after a 5% decline in February, caused by a drop in demand due to unseasonably warm weather.Our ChoicesIndustrial production managed to notch up gains last month despite a drop in manufacturing output. A rebound in demand for utilities was one of the major factors powering gains for the headline number.With the economic environment remaining favorable, utilities demand is likely to remain strong in the months to come. This is why it makes sense to add stocks from this sector to your portfolios. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.South Jersey Industries, Inc.

70,AES,"Electric utility firm The Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) traditionally makes an announcement to up its payout at this time of year.Let’s evaluate whether Southern investors can expect a dividend increase this time around.With their regulated business models and stability in earnings, utilities are among the most consistent dividend stocks in the market. Southern Company is one such blue-chip utility stock.Based in Atlanta, GA, Southern Company is one of the largest power suppliers in the U.S. Offering an enticing dividend yield, the company remains an attractive option for investors seeking for a steady stream of income. Positioned in a niche industry with high barriers to entry, Southern's less-volatile, recession-proof business model presents a unique opportunity to earn high returns and steady payout hikes each year.The Business & FinancialsFollowing its merger with AGL Resources on July 1, 2016, Southern Company serves approximately nine million customers through its eleven electric and natural gas distribution units in nine states. It boasts of a generating capacity of 46,000 megawatts, around 200,000 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines, and more than 80,000 miles of natural gas pipelines. Southern Company’s operations include wholesale electricity generation and natural gas services, retail energy services and natural gas storage operations throughout the country.A look at the company's 2017 financials suggest that Southern Company reported impressive business performance last year. The power supplier grew its revenues by 16%, while adjusted earnings per share was up by more than 4% despite an increase in operating expenses.Strong Dividend History and Above-Average YieldOne of the premier domestic utilities, Southern Company pays an annual dividend of $2.32 per share, yielding an attractive return of 5.3% and above most other utilities. To put things in perspective, the utility offers current yield of 5.3. Meanwhile, the average yields for the utility sector and S&P 500 stands at 3.6% and 1.9%, respectively.The firm hiked its dividend payout by 3.6% in April 2017, marking sixteen consecutive years of such increases. In particular, Southern Company boasts of an uninterrupted streak of paying dividends since 1948.Room for Modest Hike Despite High Payout RatioUsing Southern's 2017 adjusted EPS of $3.02, the utility pays out 76.8% of its earnings as a dividend, which is rather high compared to sector's average payout of 64.1%. Southern forecasts earnings to fall to $2.80–$2.95 per share in the current year. Considering the current annual dividend rate of $2.32 per share, this equates to a steep payout ratio of 79%-83% for 2018.However, Southern also announced its long-term earnings per share growth outlook of 4–6%, commencing with this year's midpoint of $2.87 per share. We believe this should be sufficient for modest dividend increases.Importantly, the utility is confident in its ability to sustain a payout ratio in the range of 80% for a few years, which it expects to eventually come back down in the 70s once construction of the Vogtle nuclear plant expansion project ends.What Exactly to Expect?As per Southern Company, its financial outlook allows for a dividend growth of 8 cents per year, or 2 cents on a quarterly basis. This seems quite doable, with a 2 cents hike taking the quarterly distribution to 60 cents per share ($2.40 per share annualized), which would represent a payout ratio of around 84% and in line with the firm’s expectations.Therefore, going by Southern’s target, we see the quarterly dividend increase to 60 cents per share (or 3.4%) during the next few days.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksDespite being a top dividend-growth stock, Southern Company currently retains a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), ostensibly due to continued timing and cost overrun issues over two large construction projects -- Vogtle and Kemper.Georgia PSC's nod for the construction of the half-finished Vogtle nuclear plant expansion in Georgia notwithstanding, doubts remain about the $20 billion initiative that has gone well over budget and is years behind schedule. Southern is also facing challenges to place its Kemper, Mississippi project in service, which suffered yet another setback with the suspension of all coal gasification operations amid additional cost burden.We believe the financial stress from these projects, together with Southern’s hefty expenses to comply with environmental controls/regulations will cause an underperformance in the utility's shares relative to the market as well as the sector in the coming quarters.Not surprisingly, the stock has underperformed its industry in a year, having declined 7.4% versus the industry's 0.7% loss.Meanwhile, one can look at better-ranked utilities like CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report), The AES Corp. (AES  -  Free Report) and OGE Energy Corp. (OGE  -  Free Report) CenterPoint Energy is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, while both AES Corp. and OGE Energy hold Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

71,AES,"The broad consensus on the man-made nature of climate change notwithstanding, policies of the current U.S. administration run counter to it and favorable to the coal industry. But not all is lost – as a big part of the corporate sector and many local governments remain committed to taking steps to ensure a cleaner energy environment.In keeping with this, the RE100 collaborative global initiative has brought together some of the biggest U.S. companies from different sectors, with a target to source 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. As such, the demand for electricity generated from renewable sources is no longer restricted to a few companies. On the supply side, technological improvements have been helping bring down solar and wind power prices and the cost of energy storage, which have been acting in favor of the alternative energy industry.Here we take a look at the alternative energy space in an attempt to identify its strengths.Supply Growth: The underlying driver for the alternative energy industry is significantly high demand outlook for renewables. According to the Renewable Energy: United States report of December 2017, U.S. demand for renewable energy is forecast to reach 12.6 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) by 2021. While demand for solar energy is projected to rise 20% annually, the same for wind energy is likely to rise 7.2%. Currently, the primary advantage of using solar or wind energy is their abundant supply. This allows renewables to score higher than fossil fuel, which is exhaustible. Therefore, we expect the renewable space to continue to innovate to offer consumers clean and affordable energy. This should help stocks in this space maintain strong momentum in the days ahead.Declining Costs:  There’s no denying the fact that a steep drop in the cost of wind and solar energy has been helping the demand outlook for alternative energy. Per a report by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), solar photovoltaic (PV) modules prices had dropped more than 80% in 2017 from 2009. The cost of electricity from solar PV fell almost three-quarters in 2010-2017 and continues to decline. The drop in electricity costs from utility-scale solar PV projects since 2010 has been remarkable as well. The global weighted average cost of electricity (LCOE) of utility-scale solar PV has fallen 73% since 2010 for new projects commissioned in 2017.Meanwhile, the cost of wind turbines is the single largest component which makes up for 70% or more of the entire cost of a land-based wind project. Notably, wind turbine prices have fallen by around half over a similar period, leading to cheaper wind power globally. Onshore wind electricity costs dropped almost a quarter in 2017 from 2010. Moreover, hydropower is one of the cheapest and also the largest source of renewable electricity. The global weighted average LCOE of large-scale hydro projects in 2016 was $0.053/kWh, which had dropped to $0.047/kWh in 2017. The report by IRENA projects that, electricity from renewables will soon be consistently cheaper than from fossil fuels. By 2020, current power generation technologies from renewables under commercial use will become cost effective compared to cost of fossil fuels. This will give rise to higher preference of renewable energy.Solid Growth Prospects: In EIA’s 2017 International Energy Outlook’s (IEO) Reference case, worldwide net electricity generation is projected to increase 45% in 2015 to 34 trillion kWh in 2040. Notably, electricity is the world’s fastest-growing form of end-use energy and renewables are likely to become a major source for electricity generation, with average increase of 2.8% per year from 2015 to 2040. Being a major forerunner in renewables, no doubt these growth prospects will boost the United States’ alternative energy industry over the long run, even if we consider Trump’s latest moves against clean energy revolution. In this context, EIA earlier stated that even if the Clean Power Plan is abolished, the U.S. renewable space will continue to grow albeit at a slower rate. EIA projected U.S. renewable generation capacity growth by an average of 1.9% per year between 2017 and 2050. So, long-term global prospects continue to improve for the U.S. alternative energy industry.Role of the Private Sector:  Plummeting costs of wind and solar power along with grid developments have prompted global corporations to consider the clean energy space for their business strategies. In fact, after realizing the opportunities in the renewable energy space, many big corporate houses have joined the RE100 initiative. To make the most of this opportunity, U.S. majors have enrolled themselves in this program to minimize their carbon footprint and deploy more renewable energy. For instance, Google and Wells Fargo announced that they had reached 100% renewable electricity consumption in late 2017.Moreover, with solar being an attractive investment target within renewable, companies from other domains have started to invest in solar stocks. In March 2018, Microsoft announced the single largest corporate purchase of solar power in the United States by signing an agreement with sPower — a subsidiary of AES Corp. (AES  -  Free Report) — to add 315 MW of electricity via two solar projects in Virginia.Extension of Tax Credits: Solar and wind energy got a major boost from the environmental tax credit extension that came as part of the $1.15 trillion federal spending bill of December 2015, wherein Congress passed an extension and modification of federal tax credits for new wind and solar generators. The new environmental tax credit extension allowed solar power companies to keep claiming federal Investment Tax Credits (""ITC"") at 30% of the price of solar energy systems installed by businesses or homeowners.Moreover, the wind power industry benefited significantly from the production tax credit (“PTC”) extension. The PTC, which had expired at 2014-end due to congressional gridlock, was extended through 2020. In December 2017, a Republican tax bill was released that preserved key tax credits that were feared of being abolished by the Trump administration.The final tax bill retained the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar energy that have spurred investment in the fast-growth industries. It also eliminated the alternative minimum tax, which would have reduced the value of those credits. This surely came as a relief for those in the renewable energy industry, which according to SEIA employs 260,000 workers.          China’s Solar Plans: While we have already discussed the growth prospects of the U.S. solar market in our Alternative Energy Stock Outlook, China continues to hold the leading position in solar-power installations across the globe. As per Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), Chinese overseas investment in clean energy projects was a record $44 billion in 2017, compared to 2016’s investment of $32 billion. For certain, a bulk of that investment went to the United States as it is a major solar market.With China being its largest importer for solar panels and modules, the U.S. renewable energy industry largely depends on Chinese manufacturers. Although the latest imposition of import tax on solar modules have created possibilities of trade war between China and America, Chinese companies are maintaining their offshore investments in the United Sates to tap in on the bountiful opportunities.In March 2018, NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) announced an agreement to purchase solar panel from Chinese solar module manufacturer — JinkoSolar Holding (JKS  -  Free Report). Over the next four years, JinkoSolar will supply approximately 2,750 MW of high-efficiency solar modules to NextEra Energy. Production of the solar panels will start in the second half of 2018.India’s Solar Initiatives: While China and the United States have led the Solar industry in recent years, Asia's third-largest economy, India, has lately joined the list of solar power markets with a target of adding 175 GW of solar, wind and other renewable energy by 2022.India is striving to bump up its solar energy capacity to 100 GW by 2022, which will include 60 GW from grid-connected solar projects and 40 GW from rooftop solar. According to a new report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the country added 715 megawatts in rooftop PV power in 2017, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 117% since 2013. This has kindled the interest of U.S. solar players in India’s market.Company-wise, First Solar (FSLR  -  Free Report) has ample businesses in India and together with local firms is investing considerably in the country. During 2017, the company executed definitive sales agreements for two projects totaling 155 MW AC and commissioned two additional projects totalling 40 MW AC in Karnataka. It continues to maintain a strong presence in India with over 1.8 GW DC of installed modules.Boom in Offshore Wind Projects: The United States is one of the largest and fastest-growing wind markets in the world. The U.S. wind industry is an important component of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) strategy to cut carbon pollution, diversify the nation’s energy economy and bring the next generation of American-made clean energy technologies to market.Several key factors are driving the long-awaited take-off of U.S. offshore wind. These factors include innovations of sophisticated turbine technologies and economies of scale that are driving down costs. Surprisingly, the Trump administration, which had aggressively promoted the development of fossil fuels over renewable energy, seems to be supporting the offshore wind energy sector. According to the DOE, more than 25 offshore wind projects with a generating capacity of 24 GW are now being planned, mainly off the U.S. Northeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.In December 2017, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry announced the creation of a consortium to develop innovative offshore wind technologies. Notably, 90% of the announced $18.5 million in federal funding for the consortium will go to research and development, largely to cut down turbine costs and improve turbine efficiency. Although the offshore wind industry is currently at a nascent stage and the cost of installation in sea is high, with technological advancements prices are projected to decline eventually thereby improving the industry’s competitive position. With almost 80% of U.S. electricity demand coming from coastal states, offshore wind energy has the potential to contribute significantly to a cleaner energy environment.Stocks to BuyConsidering the aforementioned drivers of the alternative energy industry, we remain positive on stocks like SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG  -  Free Report) and JinkoSolar Holding; both of them sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

72,AES,"Just when the key indexes ended three straight trading days in the green and market watchers thought that chances of a trade war have finally dimmed after a fearful month, the tables turned. Investors encountered new shockwaves late on Thursday when President Donald Trump announced a new set of $100 billion worth of tariffs against China. Following this announcement, market futures plummeted after the bell.Renewed fears of a trade war may find investors scurrying toward safe-haven sectors, which have already emerged as preferred investments. One of the most-popular, safe-haven sectors is utilities. This sector comprises companies that provide telephone, gas, water and electricity services. In this context, investors looking for stable dividend and interest income can invest in utilities.Tariffs on China Could Add Up to $153 BillionOn Thursday night, the President called China’s decision an “unfair retaliation,” and instructed the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to decide whether new tariffs of $100 billion should be imposed on Chinese goods. Trump added that these additional tariffs will be suitable per Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and that the products will be selected accordingly.On Tuesday, the White House had announced new tariffs of $50 billion on more than 1,300 new Chinese products. Tariffs of 25% will be imposed on products ranging from aircraft batteries and parts to medical devices and flat-screen televisions. U.S.-China tensions started when Trump initially announced tariffs of around $3 billion on steel and aluminum imports from China in March.The reason for this war-like situation is China’s staggering $375-billion trade surplus with the United States in 2017, which the Trump administration is looking to reduce by at least $100 billion. Total U.S. tariffs on China now add up to around $153 billion. Following the United States’ tariff announcements, China also retaliated with similar moves.China Set To “Fight Back”China is clearly in no mood to sit back when the United States is gearing up to impose new tariffs on its imports. In fact, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said that the country does not want to enter into a trade war with the United States At the same time, China is “not afraid to fight a trade war.” He added that in case the United States sticks to its “protectionist trade practices,” China will not refrain from fighting back and instead will respond with “new comprehensive measures.”Most recently, China declared that it will levy tariffs on around 106 U.S. productsincluding soybeans, aircraft, chemicals and automobiles, with a total trading value of over $50 billion. Following the announcement of Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, China imposed tariffs of $3 billion on 128 American goods, with 15% duty levied on 120 products and 25% duty on other eight goods.China’s latest tariffs will definitely affect the U.S. economy as the exports to China were significant at $130 billion in 2017. China is the largest importer of soybeans from the United States, which was around $14 billion last year. Additionally, China’s import of aircraft equipment, oil seeds and oleaginous fruits, and motor vehicles was $16.3 billion, $12.4 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively in 2017.Buy These 5 Utility StocksWhile the recent trade war between the United States and China refuses to find any closure, investors should clearly look for defensive sectors. Utility stocks are good options in this regard.

73,AES,"Value investing is always a very popular strategy, and for good reason. After all, who doesn’t want to find stocks that have low PEs, solid outlooks, and decent dividends?Fortunately for investors looking for this combination, we have identified a strong candidate which may be an impressive value; The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report).AES Corporation in FocusAES may be an interesting play thanks to its forward PE of 9.6, its P/S ratio of 0.6, and its decent dividend yield of 4.5%. These factors suggest that AES Corporation is a pretty good value pick, as investors have to pay a relatively low level for each dollar of earnings, and that AES has decent revenue metrics to back up its earnings.The AES Corporation PE Ratio (TTM) The AES Corporation PE Ratio (TTM) | The AES Corporation QuoteBut before you think that AES Corporation is just a pure value play, it is important to note that it has been seeing solid activity on the earnings estimate front as well. For current year earnings, the consensus has gone up by 2.6% in the past 30 days, thanks to two upward revisions in the past one month compared to none lower.This estimate strength is actually enough to push AES to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting it is poised to outperform.

74,AES,"Wall Street is off to a disastrous start in the second quarter. Major bourses tumbled into correction for the second time this year and closed below key technical levels. Elevated trade tensions between the United States and China along with weakness in large-cap tech stocks are cited to be the reasons for the free fall. The prospect of rising interest rates and lofty valuations are expected to trigger another stock market correction in the near term.Given the turmoil, investing in defensive companies seems prudent. Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns, consistent dividend and steady earnings growth regardless of the state of the equity market.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The S&P 500 finished 2.2% lower at 2,581.88 on Apr 2, down 10.1% from its record high in Jan 26. The broader index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since the U.K.’s vote for Brexit in June 2016. The Dow Jones also closed below the aforesaid technical level, indicating further downtrend in the near future.Unlike the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq somehow managed to avoid a correction but it did lose more than 10% from its record high attained in March. This leaves all the three major indices in negative territory for the year, while the CNNMoney’s Fear & Greed Index slipped further into “extreme fear” territory.Global Trade WarSelling in stocks intensified after China decided to impose tariffs on about 130 U.S. goods, including a 25% charge on U.S. pork and 15% on fruits. The world’s second largest economy retaliated against Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum shipments.All these have not only weighed on U.S. meat producers as well as industrial stocks, investors panicked as a full-fledged trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment. It may also dent first-quarter corporate earnings results slated to release this month.Big Tech SelloffAdding to the downbeat tone is a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), in the meantime, slipped after Trump lashed out at the e-commerce company on its tax policy and subsequent effect on bricks-and-mortar retailers. Another tech major Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) took a beating after Apple Inc. decided to break away from the chip maker and make its own chips in its Mac computers as early as 2020.Electric car maker Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) is also sinking after one of its driverless technology vehicles was involved in a fatal crash, while it recalled 123,000 Model S vehicles because of an issue related to a power steering component.Rate Hike FearsAmid all these, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve has hiked rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020.This hasn’t gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy.How to Prepare for the SetbackAs the markets seem to be plagued with widespread uncertainty, defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option. Such stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the larger market. Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors.Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity, gas and water are essentials. Food, beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations.5 Solid ChoicesWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforementioned defensive sectors that boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).UtilitiesCenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) operates as a public utility holding company in the United States. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and a dividend yield of 4.2%.

76,AES,"On a day when all the major averages all closed more than 2.5% higher – the biggest one day percentage gains in two and a half years – one industry stands out as an even bigger winner, the semiconductor equipment manufacturers.  Already posting strong gains for the year even after last week’s steep sell off, two industry leaders outpaced the broader markets - Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) with each gaining approximately 6%.  Strong MomentumThe semiconductor equipment manufacturers enjoyed a record year in 2017, with $55.9B in sales, up sharply over the previous year’s $41.2B.  Sales are expected to increase even further in 2018 to $60.1B, a 7.5% increase and the second consecutive record high, according to SEMI, the global trade association for the Semiconductor supply chain industry. The stocks in the sector have been rewarded handsomely, with the top players more than doubling in price since 2016.  These impressive price increases were well justified however by similar increases in revenue and net earnings at these well-run companies, so they remain attractively valued as compared to market indices. LRCX also recently announced a $2B stock buyback.Attractive ValuationsAMAT trades at a forward P/E ratio of 12.57 with LRCX at 12.09, versus approximately 25 for the NASDAQ 100 index.  Both also sport lower P/E’s than industry competitors KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report), Advanced Energy Industries (AES  -  Free Report) and ASML Holdings (ASML  -  Free Report).  Semiconductor stocks do have a history of trading at  lower prices relative to earnings than the major indices owing largely to their higher price volatility, but both of these names are currently trading below their own historical P/E’s and well below the overall P/E of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX  -  Free Report)  of which they are both components.AMAT and LRCX both have a Zack’s #1 Ranked (Strong Buy), based on a recent history of positive earnings estimate revisions (with AMAT joining the list today.)

80,AES,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, AES Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.9x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, AES Corporation’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that AES Corporation has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for AES Corporation stock in the near term too .P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, AES Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, AES is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, AES Corporation currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20%  of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AES Corporation a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though AES Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F. This gives AES a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has seen two down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:The AES Corporation Price and Consensus The AES Corporation Price and Consensus | The AES Corporation Quote This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAES Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 24% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

81,AES,"WEC Energy Group (WEC  -  Free Report) is a consistent performer with capital investments, to reinforce infrastructure and expand customer base, reaping rewards. Efficient management and skillful execution of plans have culminated in robust results, the best part being better-than-guided earnings for 12 years nonstop.The average positive earnings surprise of 3.08% for the trailing four quarters should encourage investors as would a 1.5% upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 to 66 cents, in the last 30 days.WEC Energy projects capital expenditure of nearly $11.8 billion over 2018-2022. Of this, $5,514 million is allotted for Gas Delivery, $2,707 million for Electric Delivery, $2,691 million for Generation and $911 million for Energy Infrastructure. Since, more than 99% of the company’s earnings are generated from regulated operations, rate hikes give it the confidence to spend on infrastructure development and power to boost earnings.More good news comes from a swelling customer base thanks to the economy, which is gaining health. In third-quarter 2017, WEC Energy served 9,000 more electric and 18,000 more natural gas customers than it did in the year-ago quarter. Strong investment-grade credit ratings between A and A-, allows WEC Energy to enjoy superior credit worthiness. This, in turn, gives it access to cheaper funds for investment projects amid rising interest rates.Now, the company’s resolve is not just limited to its profits and performance. Its shareholder and environmental friendly ways are also worth mentioning. In December 2017, the company hiked its annual dividend rate by 6.25% to $2.21 from the 2016 level of $2.08. Also, it aims to cut down its emission in the state of Wisconsin nearly 40% below the 2005 levels by 2030. Timely completion of its ongoing capital projects, which are presently running per plan, holds the key to achieving this target.Price MovementThe WEC Energy stock has gained 11.9% in the last 12 months, outperforming the 5.5% growth of the Zacks Electric Power industry.The strong performance reflects the benefits of cost-saving initiatives, ongoing investments in infrastructure projects, and a gradual improvement in the economy in its service areas.Zacks RankLack of earnings estimate revisions for 2017 and 2018 has currently resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for WEC Energy.

82,AES,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) has recently inked a deal with SMC Global Power Holdings Corp., under which the company will divest its Philippines business to the later for $1.05 billion. The divestment is scheduled to be completed by the first half of 2018, subject to regulatory approval by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC).Details of the DealIn particular, AES Corp will sell its 51% stake in Masin-AES Pte. Ltd — a subsidiary that owns its business interests in the Philippines — to SMC Global Power. The terms of the transaction include divestment of AES Corp’s interest in the 630 megawatt (MW) Masinloc coal-fired plant, the 335 MW Masinloc 2 coal-fired plant (under construction) and the 10 MW Masinloc energy storage project (onstream).Notably, SMC Global Power will take-over the remaining 49% equity interest in the subsidiary, which is held by Thailand’s Electricity Generating Public Company Limited (EGCO Group), for $850 million.How Will AES Corp Benefit?AES Corp aims to use the proceeds from the divestment to pay down debt, which in turn will allow it to achieve investment grade metrics in 2019 — a year earlier than expected. The company also boasts the goal of attaining investment grade ratings by 2020, to which this deal will contribute substantially.A poor investment grade rating may restrict a company’s ability to obtain necessary finance to fund its new projects or expand the existing ones. So a good investment grade rating is always desirable and the latest Masinloc deal will help AES Corp to duly achieve that.Notably, AES Corp is well known for streamlining its portfolio through asset divestments and by exiting markets and businesses where it does not have or cannot develop a competitive advantage. The company follows a strategy of reducing complexity and portfolio simplification through withdrawal of operations in the markets that carry certain risks.To this end, before deciding on the vending of the Philippines business, in April 2017, AES Corp completed the sale of its combined heating and power coal plants in Kazakhstan, for net proceeds of $24 million. In the same month, DP&L and AES Ohio Generation entered into an agreement for the sale of DP&L’s undivided interest in Zimmer and Miami Fort for $50 million in cash.In September, the company sold out 5% of its Dominican Republic business for $60 million to Linda Group, an investor-based group. This transaction resulted in a net increase of $25 million to the company’s additional paid in capital and non-controlling interest, respectively.During the third-quarter earnings call, AES Corp announced plans to significantly upgrade its asset sales program, to enhance focus on core markets. In line with this, management aims at realizing $2 billion in proceeds during 2018-2020. Now, with the finalization of the Masinloc divestment, the company will be able to gain $1 billion of this, by 2018-end.Considering its trend of divesting assets to consolidate operations and in a bid to achieve the aforementioned target of $2-billion realization from sales proceeds, we except to witness more such divestment decisions from AES Corp.Price PerformanceAES Corp's stock has lost about 7.5% over a year, comparing unfavorably with the broader industry’s gain of 9%. The underperformance might have been led by unfavorable factors, such as devaluation in foreign currencies, higher interest and inflation rates in Brazil and hurricanes in the Caribbean Islands. Zacks Rank & Key PicksAES Corp currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Atlantic Power Corporation (AT  -  Free Report), DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) and Consolidated Edison Inc.

83,AES,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.‘s (CNP  -  Free Report) board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend hike of approximately 3.7% for the company’s common stocks.Notably, the revised quarterly stock dividend of 27.75 cents per share, up from 26.75 cents per share distributed earlier, will be payable on Mar 8, 2018, to shareholders at the close of business on Feb 15, 2018. Post the hike, the company’s new annualized dividend will amount to $1.11 per share of common stock, up from $1.07 per share of common stock distributed previously.Consequently, the company’s current annual dividend yield is 3.9% based on the closing share price of $28.40 on Dec 13, 2017, significantly higher than the yield of 1.74% recorded by S&P 500 as well as that of industry average of 3.04%.Dividend Hike is Common for UtilitiesUtility operators generate more or less stable earnings, owing to endless need for electricity and utility services. This helps the stocks in the utility space to enjoy a steady flow of revenues. A steady flow of uninterrupted income in turn encourages the operators to reward shareholders from time to time, with notable dividend hikes.Toward this, we have witnessed a few utilities reward their shareholders with incremental dividends in the past few weeks. Evidently, PNM Resources, Inc. (PNM  -  Free Report) has raised its annual dividend by 9.3%, while another utility operator – WEC Energy Group (WEC  -  Free Report) decided to raise its dividend by 6.3%. Most recently, The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) hiked its dividend by 8.3%.What led to Dividend Hike for Company?CenterPoint Energy has been more or less a steady performer in the past, as evidenced by its performance in the last four quarters. Notably the utility was successful in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.4%.Further, the company maintains a stable cash flow financial position. As of Sep 30, 2017, it had cash and cash equivalents of $201 million. Such stability in financial position has supported the company’s practice of returning value to shareholders with regular dividend hikes. In the nine months of 2017, the company paid $346 million as dividends to shareholders, up from $332 million paid in the year-ago period. The latest dividend hike marks the 13th in a row in as many years, following the 4% hike that CenterPoint Energy made this January.Going AheadCenterPoint Energy aims to invest approximately $4.1 billion through the 2017-2021 period toward its Electric Transmission & Distribution division, for conducting system modernization initiatives, maintenance projects and installation of meter-reading technology. Additionally, it intends to spend $2.7 billion in natural gas utilities for replacing aging infrastructure, development of the Minnesota Belt Line Project and public improvement requirements. These investments are expected to collectively aid the company in achieving 4-6% annual EPS growth, or exceeding the upper end of its range through 2018. Notably, this will aid the company in making dividend hikes in future.Price MovementShares of CenterPoint Energy have outperformed the industry in the last one year. The company’s shares gained 22%, compared with the industry’s growth of 15.9%.The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s solid cash flow generating capability.Zacks RankCenterPoint Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

88,AES,"The third-quarter earnings season has already passed the half way mark. Total earnings for the 272 S&P members that have released results till now, are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings and 66.2% topping revenue estimates.  This is going to be another busy week with 900 companies expected to release earnings including 134 members of the S&P 500. Combining the results of the 272 S&P 500 members with the index’s 228 members yet to report, we expect total earnings to be up 5.4% year over year on 5.5% higher revenues.Amid this backdrop, let us focus on Zacks Utilities sector this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space are expected to drop 5.1%. Notably, at present, 10 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline. Read more details in our weekly Earnings PreviewCapital intensive utilities are impacted by rise in interest rates in twice in this year — in March and June. In addition, the hurricanes also adversely impacted the utilities operating in Texas and Florida.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for investors.To maintain their performance level, these utilities are resorting to cost savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and also focusing more on renewables energy to produce electricity to lower emission.  Let us take a sneak peek at the four utility stocks scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 earnings on Nov 2.Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) surpassed earnings estimates in the previous two quarters, resulting in an average beat of 5.20%.  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

89,AES,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Nov 2.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 19.05%. However, AES Corp. missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 0.44%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn October 9, AES Corp. announced that following the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, its operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands has been significantly affected. Notably, three of the company’s Puerto Rico power plants sustained notable damage. Its Puerto Rico’s 24 megawatt (MW) solar plant and one of the two units of its 524 MW coal-fired plant were severely harmed. Despite the damages, the other unit is still able to generate electricity while the damaged one is being restored.Consequently, the company expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be in the lower half of the $1.00 to $1.10 range in 2017. An adverse impact of 3-5 cents is expected on the 2017 adjusted EPS guidance, primarily stemming from the sustained damages to the aforementioned power plants and other business interruptions. This, in turn, is expected to have a significant effect on third quarter results as well.For the soon-to-be reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is projected to move down 8.3% while the same for revenues is estimated to remain flat on a year-over-year basis.The AES Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The AES Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The AES Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that AES Corp is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case for AES Corp.Zacks ESP: AES Corp has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 29 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AES Corp has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are few utility stocks that worth considering on the basis of our model, which show that they have the right combination to pull off a beat.NiSource, Inc.

90,AES,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) made an announcement regarding its operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, following the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.AES Corp has aided and provided assistance to its employees and local communities in Puerto Rico that were critically impacted due to the devastating nature of the hurricanes.Impact of the HurricanesBoth the hurricanes caused significant disruptions to the AES Corp’s Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands operations. Notably, three of the company’s Puerto Rico power plants sustained damages. Its Puerto Rico’s 24 megawatt (MW) solar plant and one of the two units of its 524 MW coal-fired plant were impacted massively. Despite the damages, other unit is still able to generate electricity, while the damaged one is being reviewed.Details of the UpdateAES Corp has provided an update and reaffirmed 2017 guidance for all metrics. The company expects adjusted EPS to be in the lower half of the $1.00 to $1.10 range. An adverse impact of 3 cents to 5 cents is expected on the 2017 adjusted EPS guidance, primarily stemming from the sustained damages to aforementioned power plants and other business interruptions.How Have Utilities Been Impacted?According to BBC News, analysts had initially estimated that the United States will bear an economic cost of $300 billion from hurricane Irma alone. Meanwhile, hurricane Maria has been placed among the top 10 most intense Atlantic hurricanes on record, consequently hitting the company’s business in Puerto Rico quite hard.Toward this, utility operators like Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) the operations of which have been impacted due to the hurricanes have started undertaking several restoration steps to normalize operations.We expect impact of the hurricanes to show in third-quarter earnings of most utilities in the broader sector as it has severely affected the infrastructure of the state; nevertheless, investment toward restoration of service areas and infrastructure are likely to hurt the sector a little less than as previously anticipated.Price MovementShares of AES Corp have gained 3.6%, compared to the industry’s increase of 5.4% in the last three months.Weakness in overseas operation is adversely impacting the prospects of the company and cost of adherence to stringent environmental regulations can hurt margins.Zacks Rank & Key PickAES Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A better-ranked stock from the same space is CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) that sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

91,AES,"We issued an updated research report on The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) on Sep 7. This global power company follows a strategy of reducing complexity and portfolio simplification through withdrawal of operations in the markets that carry risks.In line with this strategy, AES Corp. sold its combined heating and power coal plants in Kazakhstan, for net proceeds of $24 million, in April 2017. In the same month, the company agreed to sale the undivided interest of its DP&L subsidiary in Zimmer and Miami Fort for $50 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017.One of the company’s notable business strategies include reduction of costs. To this end, AES Corp earlier launched initiatives worth $400 million for cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiatives. The initiatives will include overhead reductions, procurement efficiencies and operational improvements.Moreover, the company is merging its Europe and Asia strategic business units this year that is expected to lead to significant savings. Such initiatives are expected to enable the company achieve $50 million of incremental annual benefits in 2017 and to reach its annual savings target by 2020.Further, to curb carbon emission, AES Corp.’s generation mix includes a large portion of gas and renewables. In this line, AES Corp. is on track with its 1,384 MW Southland Repowering Project in California and has completed the $2 billion non-recourse financing for the project this June. The project is expected to initiate following this financing, in line with management’s expectation.AES Corp. has a 1,320 MW OPGC 2 project in India, which is making steady progress on construction. The project is expected to come online by the end of 2018.These projects are expected to be a key contributor to the company’s earnings and cash flow growth through 2020.On the flip side, the company’s results  has been reflecting lower margins owing to deferred fuel cost following the rate case of IPL in 2016, as well as lower regulated ESP rates at DPL.This might have lead the company to underperform its broader market. Evidently, AES Corp.’s share price has lost 13.9% in the last one year, against its broader industry's gain of 4.8%. The company also faces tough competition from its peers like Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report), CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report).Zacks RankAES Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

92,AES,"A divide has emerged within the Federal Reserve over the timing of proposed interest rate hikes, according to the minutes of its July meeting. This key economic measure has remained well below the Fed’s targeted level of 2% for an extended period. Moreover, the central bank’s pet measure of inflation experienced a decline recently, adding to concerns on this count.At the same time, the central bank looked united on the need to reduce the size of its balance sheet sooner rather than later. But the key takeaway from this document was Fed policymakers’ increased focus on the perils of low inflation levels. This has given rise to uncertainty over the timing and frequency of near-term rate hikes. Given such a scenario, investing in stocks benefiting from a soft interest rate environment may continue to be a prudent option.Low Core PCE Inflation Raises ConcernsAt the end of last month’s meeting, the Fed had opted to leave rates unchanged, a move that gladdened investors. But it now emerges that the decision was preceded by a long conversation on the recent dip in inflation levels. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the core PCE inflation index, was flat at 1.5% in June. May’s figure also experienced an upward revision, to 1.4%.But inflation still remains well below the Fed’s desired rate of 2% as well as the 1.8% pace achieved in February. The measure has slowly but steadily experienced a decline since then, which explains the concerns of a section of the Federal Reserve.Divide on Inflation EmergesContrary to the Fed Chair’s views on this issue, this section of policymakers thinks that inflation may languish below the target level for a period which exceeds current expectations. They also believe that inflation runs the risk of slipping lower in the near future.Views of such a nature have led to speculation that the central bank may reduce the pace of its projected rate hikes. Fed minutes show that a section of policymakers believe that the central bank should stay away from further rate increases until it receives conclusive proof that inflation is headed toward the targeted level.However, during the meeting, another section of policymakers stated that the Fed could not ignore a labor market near full employment. In July, unemployment once again declined to a 16-year low of 4.3%, identical to the pace hit in May. A reluctance to reduce rates at such a point could have costly implications, which may be difficult to deal with later, they said.  Inflation to Receive Additional AttentionComments made by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester on Wednesday are a good illustration of the Fed’s current dilemma. Mester clearly said that she was not in favor of waiting to raise rates until the inflation target had been achieved. At the same time, the Fed would have to take into consideration recent poor readings on inflation, she said. Such a view is a far cry from Janet Yellen’s recent protestations, depicting inflation weakness as a short term phenomenon. Yellen had attributed this softness to a decline in the cost of prescription medication and cellular fans.But July’s minutes revealed that Fed’s voting members have agreed to watch inflation more closely. A section of policymakers added that the central bank’s current mechanism for studying inflation was “not particularly useful.”Our ChoicesJuly’s Fed Minutes have conclusively proven that worries about inflation are growing within the central bank. This, in turn, is giving rise to a growing reluctance to raises rates in the near term.This is why investing in stocks from the utilities, and real estate sectors looks prudent at this point.

They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This is likely to hurt the utilities.On a brighter note, the U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement, which has further boosted growth prospects for these utilities as opposed to those that are engaged in expanding their renewable resources.   Let’s take a look at three utilities – The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report), Pattern Energy Group, Inc.

The announcement also included a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for EPS in the range of 10–11% and completion of 100 megawatts renewable projects, over the same period. Although the overall impact of these plans will be realized over the long term, the company most likely has started taking initiatives toward achieving them, which is expected to get reflected in the upcoming second-quarter results as well.During its first-quarter earnings call, Sempra Energy announced that its IEnova unit projects will complete three natural gas pipelines, worth $900 million by the end of the second quarter. Further updates on this project can be expected once Sempra Energy releases its second-quarter results.

109,AES,"Electric utility firm Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) is set to release its second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Wednesday, Aug 2.In the preceding three-month period, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider reported stronger-than-expected earnings due to robust performance by its wholesale unit.However, coming to earnings surprise history, Southern Company has a good record: its beaten estimates in 3 of the last four quarters.Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Southern Company (The) QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider This QuarterA leading utility holding entity in the U.S., Southern Company dominates the power business across the Southeast. With a strong rate base growth and constructive regulation, we expect the firm to generate steady earnings.Also, with operations in a stable and growing industry, Southern Company has a steady stream of cash flow. The utility’s history of consistent dividend payments indicates its confidence in itself.We further believe that the AGL Resources acquisition will be accretive to Southern Company earnings. However, with customer growth tepid and likely to remain so for some time, sales might be affected. This together with a large base, might make it difficult for Southern Company to manage rates. Higher operating and maintenance expenses is another concern.Moreover, the recent positive news regarding Toshiba’s financial guarantee to help complete the half-finished Vogtle project in Georgia, we remain skeptical regarding Southern Company’s $20 billion twin nuclear plants. The Vogtle project is being bankrolled with more than $8 billion in federal loans and loan guarantees.Georgia Power believes that the project has already exceeded the budget by $3 billion and is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2020. This will substantially increase Southern Company’s leverage and deteriorate its credit metrics. Additionally, the increasing capital intensity of its operations may result in reduced returns going forward.Southern Company’s much delayed clean coal power plant project Kemper in Mississippi recently suffered yet another setback with a postponement in the projected in-service date. The extension of the schedule, together with certain technical glitches, would also hike the overall cost of the plant by $186 million.As it is, the economics of the Kemper project is a major cause of concern for the company as the plant is not competitive at the current natural gas prices. Overall, the project has been a major overhang on Southern Company's stock owing to its poor execution, cost overruns and multiple delays.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Southern Company will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.43%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 71 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower, at 70 cents.Zacks Rank: However, Southern Company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), when combined with a positive ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Share Performance: Southern Company has lost 3.8% of its value during the second quarter versus the 0.03% growth of its industry.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company, here are some utilities you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:NiSource Inc. (NI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. The firm is expected to release earnings results on Aug 2.

110,AES,"The performance of utilities doesn’t usually fluctuate due to their traditional safe-investment appeal to investors. The regulated nature of their business gives their revenues a high level of certainty. Moreover, domestic orientation shields them from foreign currency translation headwinds.However, the sector underperformed the S&P 500 in the first half of 2017 on concerns over rising interest rates. The industry gained 4.7% during this period compared with the S&P 500’s rally of 8.3%.Historically, electric utilities have heavily relied on coal for a large part of power generation. This has become a big challenge for the utilities in these times of enhanced environmental awareness. However, President Trump’s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan and walk out of the Paris Agreement will definitely provide fresh life for the coal-based electricity units.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. The Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely affect the margins of the utilities.However, with the rising interest rates reducing the value of bonds, the appeal of stable regular dividend paying utilities will entice investors.  Q2 PerformanceGoing by our weekly Earnings Outlook, four out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline for Q2. The utility sector will likely see an earnings decline of 2.7%.How to Make a ChoiceGiven the plethora of players in the Utility space, picking the right stock is a daunting task. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One can narrow down the list with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, which is the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It helps in picking stocks that have high chances of delivering earnings surprises in their next earnings announcement. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The stocks mentioned below have a current ratio greater than 1, which means that these stocks have ample liquidity to meet its short-term obligation even with rising rates.Applying the above strategy, we have selected four utility stocks that have a greater possibility of posting an earnings beat in the coming days.IDACORP Inc.

111,AES,"JinkoSolar Holding Company Ltd. (JKS  -  Free Report) recently announced that will supply 86 megawatt (MW) of solar modules to Colombia’s largest Photovoltaic (PV) Plant. Per the terms of the deal, Jinko Solar’s 250,000 Monocrystalline Standard Modules with the capacity of 345 Watt – 1500 V will generate 176 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of clean energy on average every year.JinkoSolar as a Global Solar Module SupplierChina-based JinkoSolar offers solar modules, solar system integration services and photovoltaic products in the global market. Of late, the company has singed a few agreements with international companies to supply solar modules. In June , JinkoSolar’s U.S.-based subsidiary entered into a three-year agreement with sPower — an affiliate of AES Corp (AES  -  Free Report) — to supply 13 gigawatt (GW) high-efficiency solar modules.In March, JinkoSolar signed an agreement to supply 2.75 GW of modules to NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report).  It has also supplied 275.4 Megawatt-dc (MWdc) high-efficiency solar modules to Green Light Contractors Pty Ltd. for the Bungala solar project in Australia. These contracts along with the latest one indicate the growing popularity and acceptance of JinkoSolar’s modules in the global solar market.Prospects in ColombiaWith the world making a dramatic shift to adopting renewables as their desired source for energy generation in order to reduce carbon emission, Colombia is fast catching up. In this context it is imperative to mention that the Colombian government’s Generation and Transmission Expansion Plan 2015-2029 projects expansion of 4,208 to 6,675 MW in the nation’s renewable resources over the said period.Meanwhile solar, being the least expensive alternative power generation option combined with improved technology, has emerged as a key area in the renewable space. Considering Colombia’s renewables expansion plan for the next decade, we believe JinkoSolar has wider opportunities to sell modules in the country, which in turn should bolster growth.Price MovementJinkoSolar’s shares have gained 15.5% in the past month outperforming the industry’s rise of 5.6%. The upside can be attributed to the recent international module supply deals signed by the company. Zacks Rank & Another Key PickJinkoSolar currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another top-ranked stock in the same industry is SolarEdge Technologies, Inc (SEDG  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.SolarEdge Technologies delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 29.11% in the last four quarters.

112,AES,"As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged at the end of its two-day policy meeting. Instead, it shifted its focus to unwinding its massive balance sheet which currently amounts to $4.5 trillion. The central bank indicated that the process of offloading the bond holdings it had built up in the years immediately after the Great Recession will begin in September.Such a move also amounts to monetary tightening of another kind. But markets have chosen to focus on the Fed’s move to recognize that inflation has remained low, belying its earlier expectations. This development has given rise to speculation that another rate hike may not occur this year after all. Given such a scenario, investing in stocks benefiting from a soft interest rate environment may continue to be a prudent option.Focus Shifts to Balance Sheet TrimWith the Fed staying away from a rate hike at the end of its meeting, the spotlight is now squarely on the unwinding of the central bank’s massive balance sheet. The language of the Fed’s statement indicates that it will begin this process around September.The massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet consists of Treasury securities worth around $2.46 trillion and $1.77 trillion of mortgage backed securities. Most of these securities were accumulated as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in the years following the recession of 2008.Initially, the Fed plans to offload securities worth $10 billion a month which will increase within a quarter to $50 billion. Even after this cycle is completed, Fed officials project that the balance sheet will still be larger than $2 trillion. The Fed Chair and other key officials have repeatedly indicated that this process should not disrupt market activity. However, concerns that poor demand for such bonds could result in an increase in rates continue to linger.Inflation Concerns Take Center StageBut such concerns have been overshadowed by the Fed’s change in stance on inflation. The central bank’s statement dropped the word “somewhat” from its June statement instead choosing to directly state that inflation continues to remain under 2%. This only represents a slight shift but is significant because it acknowledges a negative perception about one of the Fed’s key objectives.Data released earlier has already raised such concerns on several occasions. Currently, average hourly wage growth refuses to rise above 2.5%. Meanwhile, the Price Consumption Expenditures index or PCE, also referred to as the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, remains at 1.4%. What is noteworthy is that the labor market continues to improve, and unemployment has declined to 4.4%.This is why investors have rightly chosen to focus on the Fed’s change in tone on inflation. There is a growing feeling that the Fed will not raise its rates in the near future. Following the release of the policy statement, the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool declined from 52% to 50%. This means that markets now believe that the likelihood of the Fed raising rates after its December meeting has declined. Our ChoicesThe Fed’s acknowledgement that inflation has failed to rise to its targeted levels has captured the attention of market watchers. Investors now believe that such concerns will hinder the Fed’s central bank’s attempts to raise rates in the near future.This is why investing in stocks from the utilities, telecom and real estate sectors looks prudent at this time. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM score comes in.

Notably, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 13.62%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCMS Energy’s regulated electric power operations in Michigan generate a relatively stable and growing earnings stream.

However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 3.38%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that PG&E Corp is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: PG&E Corp has an Earnings ESP of +5.06%.

Through the year, management expects the company to remain on track for achieving the target of offering affordable service to its customers. We may expect the soon-to-be released second-quarter results to duly reflect PG&E Corp’s progress in this initiative.On the flip side, to comply with the new gas-storage regulations, the company will need to invest more capital in its system. This, in turn, may get reflected in increased expenditure for the company’s second-quarter results and beyond.Lately, PG&E Corp has been engaged in investing heftily to modernize and upgrade its electric system. As a result, in the first quarter, more than 50 million customer outage minutes could be avoided. Going ahead, its customers are expected to enjoy even greater reliability benefits, as PG&E Corp. continues to install this upgraded technology. Such initiatives may add customers to the company’s portfolio in the second quarter and beyond.The company has hiked its quarterly common stock dividend by 4 cents to 53 cents per share, beginning with the to-be-reported quarter. On an annual basis, this has led to a dividend increase of 8%, from $1.96 to $2.12 per share. It indicates a stable financial position for the company, which, in turn, allows it to pay regular dividends. The decision can also be considered as a step toward achieving its target of attaining a payout ratio of 55–65% and about 60% by 2019.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 79 cents, reflecting a 19.70% year-over-year improvement.

123,AES,"JinkoSolar Holding Company Ltd. (JKS  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has supplied 275.4 Megawatt-dc (MWdc) high-efficiency solar modules to Green Light Contractors Pty Ltd. These modules will be installed in Australia’s Bungala solar project.Details of the ProjectThe Bungala solar photovoltaic (PV) plant, with a generation capacity of more than 200 MW, is one of the largest solar farms in Australia. The plant aims to generate 23.5% energy from renewable sources by 2020.The Bungala project has two phases, with total estimated cost of $315 million. While its first 137.7 MWdc phase has started production, the rest of the operations are projected to commence by the third quarter of 2018.Australian Government’s Initiatives for Clean EnergyRealizing the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the government of Australia has been undertaking various initiatives to expand renewable generation portfolio. The country’s Clean Energy Regulator, post the seventh Emissions Reduction Fund auction, allocated more than $2.29 billion fund toward renewable energy.Solar is the least expensive option for alternative power generation, courtesy of lower cost of installation compared with most fossil fuel-powered generators. This along with improved technology, large number of panel installations and government initiatives will boost the solar market in Australia. We believe that the latest deal will enable JinkoSolar to reap benefits from the expanding Australian solar market. Further, the company expects to receive more such orders from Australia.Prospects in Global Solar MarketThe global renewable energy industry has witnessed significant growth in the last several years. Realizing the need for a cleaner environment, consumers have rapidly adopted alternative energy sources. A key area of the renewable space is solar energy. With demand for solar energy rising, leading players are also expanding their contracts worldwide.JinkoSolar is following this similar trend. Recently, the company announced that its U.S.-based subsidiary has entered into a three-year agreement with sPower — an affiliate of AES Corp (AES  -  Free Report) — to supply 13 gigawatt (GW) high-efficiency solar modules. In March, JinkoSolar signed an agreement to supply 2.75 GW of modules to NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report). These contracts indicate the growing popularity of JinkoSolar’s modules in the global solar market.Price MovementJinkoSolar’s shares have lost 32.1% in a year against the industry’s rally of 21.3%. The downside might have been caused by stiff competition in the solar market. Zacks Rank & Key Pick    JinkoSolar currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is SolarEdge Technologies, Inc (SEDG  -  Free Report).

124,AES,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the sale of its 17% equity stake in Eletropaulo, the company’s utility unit in Brazil. The transaction came in at a total consideration of BRL 1.27 billion ($310 million approximately) and the proceeds are expected to be used for lower outstanding debts of the parent company within next 60 days.Reason for Sell-OffDuring the first half of 2016, the company had decided to undertake a strategic move to decrease its exposure to Brazilian utility distribution market. Last November, the company converted its preferred stock stake in Eletropaulo to equity share with 17% holding interest.The Brazilian distribution business has been persistently suffering loss for the past three years. As of 31 Dec, 2017, the company reported an after-tax loss of $611 million on deconsolidation. Of the total loss, $455 million was on account of cumulative translation loss and $243 million related to pension loss.AES’ Focus on RenewableWith the strategic move of selling its interest in Eletropaulo, the company exited the electric distribution business in Brazil. It is now poised to focus on the growing need for renewables and looking forward to bring in new technologies such as, energy storage, digitalization and drone applications to the Brazilian electric sector.As of May 8, 2018, the company had a generation mix consisting of 37% gas, 32% coal, 27% renewable and 4% oil, diesel & pet coke. In addition, the company had a gross megawatt (MW) in operation of 33,965 MW.The company is rapidly expanding its renewable footprint in overseas. In this context, the company’s subsidiary, AES Gener, entered into a new contract during the first quarter of 2018 with Strabag for its Chile-based Alto Maipo hydroelectric project.Also, due to increased electricity tariff by the Argentinian government, the company evaluates this transaction as an opportunity and is looking forward to take advantage of the same by expanding renewable energy in the country. Moreover, AES Argentina agreed to acquire a 100 MW wind development project with 20 years of U.S. dollar-denominated Power Purchase Agreement. The company expects to see more such contracts in days ahead.Importance of RenewableRenewable Energy source has been gaining momentum globally. Wind and solar power have been two of the fastest growing sources of electricity generation on the international front over the past decade. In 2017, global installed wind capacity grew by nearly 11%, thus bringing the global total to 540 GW.

125,AES,"JinkoSolar Holding Company Ltd. (JKS  -  Free Report) recently announced that its U.S.-based subsidiary has entered into a three-year agreement with sPower, an affiliate of AES Corp. (AES  -  Free Report). Per the terms, the subsidiary will supply 13 gigawatt (GW) of high-efficiency solar modules to sPower.Solar Prospects in the U.S.A key area of the renewable space in the United States is solar energy. Per an Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, solar electricity generation in 2017 was 211 gigawatt-hour/day (GWh/d), which is likely to increase to 246 GWh/d in 2018 and 294 GWh/d in 2019. In spite of the rapid uptake, solar contributed just 1.3% of the total U.S. utility-scale generation in 2017, indicating immense scope for growth in the days ahead.Interestingly, a sharp drop in the cost of solar energy hints at higher demand for alternative energy. Per a report by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), solar photovoltaic (PV) modules prices had dropped more than 80% in 2017 from 2009. This has further set the stage for solar power providers like sPower to expand their business by purchasing increased modules from suppliers like JinkoSolar, as is evident from the latest deal.Our ViewIn January 2018, President Trump implemented 30% tariff on import of solar panel components. The tariff slam subsequently led the non-U.S.-based solar companies to put up solar manufacturing facilities in the United States.In line with this, the company announced in March its intention to open its first U.S. factory in Florida. Such a strategic move will not only enable the company to avoid the import tariff on a whole but also provide increased flexibility to support its local partners in the days to come.Coming to JinkoSolar’s achievements in the United States, JinkoSolar has been able to acquire major solar module supply agreements in the country, of late. Evidently, in January 2018, the company sealed a deal to supply 1.75 GW of its high-efficiency solar modules, over approximately three years, to a U.S. counterparty.In March, JinkoSolar agreed to supply 2.75 GW of modules to NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report). Such deals reflect the huge demand for JinkoSolar’s modules in the United States and offer scope for more such contract wins.  The company already enjoys a solid relationship with sPower and till date has successfully supplied over 800 megawatt (MW) of solar modules for the latter’s PV projects. The latest agreement should further strengthen JinkoSolar's strategic relationship with sPower, which includes significant down payments, thereby helping the company expand manufacturing capacity in the United States.Price MovementJinkoSolar’s stock has lost 33.3% in a year compared with the industry’s gain of 37.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by stiff competition in the solar market.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    JinkoSolar currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ  -  Free Report) and SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (SEDG  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Canadian Solar delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 29.35% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has risen by 47.1% to $2.06 in the last 90 days.SolarEdge Technologies Holdings came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 29.11% in the last four quarters.

127,AES,"Making its debut on 10/21/2015, smart beta exchange traded fund SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD  -  Free Report) provides investors broad exposure to the Large Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexSPYD is managed by State Street Global Advisors, and this fund has amassed over $495.12 M, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 High Dividend Index.The S&P 500 High Dividend Index is designed to measure the performance of the top 80 dividend-paying securities listed on the S&P 500 Index, based on dividend yield.Cost & Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.07%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.02%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Real Estate sector - about 24.80% of the portfolio. Utilities and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.50% of the fund's total assets, followed by Macy's Inc (M  -  Free Report) and Aes Corporation (AES  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 14.36% of SPYD's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -2.57%, and is up roughly 9.73% in the last one year (as of 05/21/2018). SPYD has traded between $34.68 and $38.74 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.77 and standard deviation of 12.20% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium choice in the space. With about 82 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $36.53 B in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $36.14 B. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.20% and VTV charges 0.05%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Large Cap ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

128,AES,"The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD  -  Free Report) was launched on 10/21/2015, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.The fund is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors. It has amassed assets over $495.39 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.While value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.07%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.02%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund.

In the last reported quarter, the utility delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.71%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Ameren is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Ameren has the right combination of both the elements.Zacks ESP: Ameren has an Earnings ESP of +1.45%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter..Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ameren Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Ameren has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. The company’s positive rank combined with +1.45% ESP increases the possibility of a positive earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 earnings is pegged at 58 cents per share, reflecting 38% growth from the year-ago reported quarter.Ameren expects its first-quarter earnings to gain from an increase in Missouri electric service rates, return to normal weather, and absence of scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage. All these factors are likely to have a combined benefit of 28 cents on Ameren Missouri’s earnings compared with first-quarter 2017.  In addition, refinancing of debts at favorable terms will also boost its earnings by 4 cents in the quarter.However, other operation and maintenance expenses at Ameren Missouri will likely have an adverse impact of 14 cents on earnings compared with first-quarter 2017.Other Stocks to ConsiderIn addition to Ameren, investors can also consider some companies from the industry, as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter:Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on May 10.

136,AES,"The dual prospects of four Fed rate hikes this year and higher inflationary expectations thanks to a commodity market rebound (mainly crude oil) have sent shockwaves across the treasury market. The 10-year benchmark U.S. Treasury yield spiked to 3% on Apr 24 for the first time since January 2014.The Fed enacted a 25-bp hike in March, and two more are likely in June and September. But the fed funds futures market lately signaled a 50% chance of one more move in December. Plus, the likelihood of new government debt issuances has played its role in pushing the yields higher.In such a scenario, many will be cautious about their fixed income holdings with this prospect. But beyond that, stocks are also likely to face challenges on a gradual cease of cheap money inflows. After all, global stocks have attained heights amid ultra-easy monetary policy.Time to Buy High Dividend Stocks?Investors, who want to start preparing for an uptick in interest rates, may tap high dividend-paying stocks. After all, a high dividend provides investors avenues to make up for capital losses, if that happens at all.Also, dividend investing calls for value investing. If a broad-based selloff hits the market in a rising yield environment, value stocks may come to investors’ protection. The looming trade tension (which has eased a lot in recent times though) is another reason for which investors may be in search of dividend-paying stocks that offer benchmark-beating yields.Below we highlight five stocks that yield more than 3% annually.Tecnoglass Inc.

138,AES,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on July 27. Last quarter, this public utility company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe sign of economic improvement is prominent across Xcel Energy’s service territories, especially in Minnesota, compared with the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in the company’s service territory was 3.2% in Dec, 2016, lower than the nation’s average of 4.7%.The optimism in the market continues to drive the company’s sales and is likely to boost top line in the second quarter.Additionally, the company has seen a consistent rise in the number of customers over the last few quarters. We expect this trend to continue in second quarter as well boosting its earnings.However, rising debt level remains a matter of concern for the company. Xcel Energy’s debt/capital ratio stands at 55.3% compared with the industry’s average of 49.7% and the S&P 500’s level of 41.9%. Moreover, the company’s current ratio stands at 0.71, so the rising interest rates do not bode well for Xcel Energy. This is because the resulting increase in cost of capital will escalate cost of operations, thereby denting its margins.Xcel Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Xcel Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Xcel Energy Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter.
