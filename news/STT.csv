0,STT,"The Federal Reserve on Thursday restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and shot down the capital plan of a Deutsche Bank (DB) U.S. subsidiary in its second round of stress tests. But the central bank largely cleared the big banks to deliver payouts to shareholders. Bank stocks largely rose for much of the day, but closed mixed as the major market indexes slashed gains.The Fed, in ""conditionally"" passing Morgan and Goldman in the tests, said the banks would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years, which will allow them to build capital over the next year.""The central bank said those banks' capital ratios, under the plans they originally submitted and with a one-time reduction resulting from tax reform, fell below the Fed's required levels in the test.The second round of the tests — the one Wall Street cares more about — evaluates banks' dividend and buyback plans, and the strength of their risk management practices and other internal controls. Many of the banks that passed the second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, dialed up their shareholder returns.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a statement.All the banks tested passed the first round of the tests last week, although Morgan and Goldman came close to falling short on a key leverage ratio. Still, passing the annual industry health checkup, implemented after the financial crisis a decade ago, has become easier for the big banks, even as the Fed each year tries to add harsher, or at least different, ingredients to the mix.But even amid a surging economy and loosening regulations, bank stocks have wilted over the last few months on concerns over the economy longer-term.After the Fed expressed reservations, Morgan Stanley said it would boost its quarterly dividend to 30 cents per share, up from 25 cents, and buy back up to $4.7 billion in common stock. Morgan Stanley stock rose Friday but remained near six-month lows.Goldman said that its capital plan included a boost in its dividend to 85 cents per share, up from 80 cents. The bank also said its capital plan allowed up to $5 billion in stock buybacks. Goldman rose modestly and was near nine-month lows.Goldman said the Fed did not object to its capital plan, ""conditioned upon the firm returning not more than $6.3 billion of capital beginning in the third quarter of 2018 and ending in the second quarter of 2019.""The Fed said it objected to the capital plan from the Deutsche Bank subsidiary, DB USA Corp., citing ""material weaknesses in the firm's data capabilities and controls supporting its capital planning process, as well as weaknesses in its approaches and assumptions used to forecast revenues and losses under stress.""The Fed also gave State Street Corp. (STT) a conditional pass. The central bank said its evaluation revealed ""counterparty exposures that produced large losses.""""The firm will be required to take certain steps regarding the management and analysis of its counterparty exposures under stress,"" the Fed added.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said it intends to raise its quarterly common stock dividend to 80 cents a share, up from 56 cents a share, effective in Q3. The bank also OK'd share buybacks of up to $20.7 billion between July 1 and June 30, 2019.Citigroup (C), meanwhile, announced an increase in its dividend to 45 cents a share, up from 32 cents. It also announced a buyback program of up to $17.6 billion during the four quarters starting in the third quarter.Bank of America (BAC) said its board plans to raise its dividend by 25% to 15 cents a share, starting in Q3. BofA said it had also been cleared to buy back roughly $20.6 billion in common stock.JPMorgan Chase bumped retreated 0.7% in the stock market today, reversing from solid gains intraday. Bank of America retreated 1.6%. Citigroup picked up 0.1%. Goldman Sachs lost 1.3% while Morgan Stanley slipped 1.8%.In the first round of bank stress tests, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley nearly missed clearing the minimum for what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio. The ratio measures how much capital a bank needs in relation to its assets.Morgan Stanley, in a statement last week, said those results ""may not be indicative of the capital distributions that we will be permitted to make"" after the release of the second round of results. Goldman said essentially the same thing, with a statement that it expected to discuss the first-round test results with the Fed.Banks can resubmit their payout plans if the Fed's results are too pessimistic for a bank's liking.""Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a statement last Thursday.Under the bleakest economic scenario, the Fed last week concluded that the 35 banks subject to the tests would lose $578 billion total. The so-called ""severely adverse"" scenario, the harshest one laid out by the Fed each year, included a global recession and a six percentage-point rise in unemployment to 10%.The source of bank stocks' woes has been the tightening Treasury yield curve. The curve, which measures the difference between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, has narrowed sharply over the past several months to the flattest in years. The spread has narrowed further in the last few weeks.Rates on longer end of the curve tend to rise when expectations for the economy are brighter. The idea is that when the economy grows, prices rise, so investors demand a higher return on government debt to make up for the declining purchasing power of the dollar over that time. Borrowers are willing to pay up, because they expect a higher rate of return.But longer-term rates have waned. Meanwhile, the short end of the curve has risen, thanks to the Fed's recent hikes on overnight rates. That sluggish long-term yield reflects concerns that the Fed will raise rates too aggressively as the Trump tax cuts and fiscal stimulus boost economic growth in 2018 but then wear offBanks tend to borrow money according to short-term rates, while lending out money according to longer-term rates. The narrowing gap between short-term and long-term bond yields thus threatens to crimp banks' profits.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Blame The Fed For Dow, S&P Struggles, Not Just Trump Trade WarsThe Big Squeeze: New Risks For Fed Interest Rates, Recession And Yield CurveBanking Industry's Zelle Seen Outgrowing Square Cash, PayPal's VenmoBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis

BlackRock (BLK), for instance, said that half of U.S. investors will own an ETF by 2020 in a recent letter to shareholders. Jim Ross of State Street's (STT) State Street Global Advisors estimates that ETF assets will reach $25 trillion globally by the end of 2025.Today, the global ETP industry oversees about $6.8 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the U.S. alone, investors have poured $181 billion into passive products, a slower pace than last year, when they added $389 billion through June.In February, investors slammed the sell button amid the return of volatility, with the world's largest ETF — State Street's S&P 500 offering, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) — seeing a record outflow in the week ending Feb. 9, erasing the previous nine weeks' worth of accumulations.Still, flows into passive products this year dwarf the $3 billion that has poured into active funds, the data show.Among ETFs seeing the highest growth rates are those tracking thematic and factor-investing strategies, according to Andreetto.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:9 Ways To Profit From Trump's Cancellation Of North Korean SummitHow Investors Can Play High-Yield Sector Led By 3 Dow Stocks7 Key Ways To Play Chip Stocks As Micron Soars Again

4,STT,"Some of the nation's biggest airlines and financial institutions — including Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Bank of America (BAC) — over the weekend became the latest corporations to rethink their relationship with the gun industry after a shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school that left 17 dead.X In doing so, those companies join Symantec (SYMC), Hertz (HTZ), MetLife (MET) and others who have said they would end the discounts they offer to members of the National Rifle Association or otherwise re-evaluate their ties with the gun industry.The NRA, in a statement on Saturday, called the moves ""a shameful display of political and civic cowardice."" The companies' decisions follow a growing backlash, much of it led by students, against the gun lobby and lawmakers that have been reluctant to pass tougher firearm restrictions in the wake of the shooting, which took place on Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.Delta Air Lines on Saturday said it would end discounted rates through its group travel program. Similarly, United Airlines (UAL) on Saturday said it would no longer offer a discounted rate to the NRA's annual meeting Both airlines said they were asking to have their information removed from the NRA website.But in response to Delta's move, Georgia's senate blocked a bill that would've provided the airline a tax break on jet fuel.Bank of America, meanwhile, said in a statement to Axios over the weekend that it would ""examine what we can do to help end the tragedy of mass shootings"" and ""engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for nonmilitary use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility.""And the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Blackstone Group (BX) had asked outside fund managers to provide information about any ownership they have in companies that sell or manufacture guns.And State Street (STT) also said it would be ""engaging with weapons manufacturers and distributors"" to learn more about promoting ""safe and responsible use of their products,"" according to Reuters. The company is a big shareholder in American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), formerly known as Smith & Wesson Holdings, and Sturm Ruger (RGR).The NRA has more than 5 million members. How the decisions from the companies, many of which control a huge part of their overall markets, might affect business is unclear.""The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world,"" the group's statement said.Shares of firearm companies plunged after President Trump's election. Trump campaigned on a platform of lax gun restrictions. Wall Street was betting the absence of any regulatory threat would create less urgency to buy guns. Gun sales fell sharply in 2017.Sturm Ruger, during its Q4 earnings call last week, briefly commented on the Florida shooting.""Although this call is intended to focus on our business, like all Americans, we also struggle with the shock and sadness of these horrible events,"" Sturm Ruger said. ""We will continue to stand by our model as arms makers for responsible citizens but we are people too and are impacted when tragedies like this occur in our communities.""Sturm Ruger fell 2.1% on the stock market today. American Outdoor Brands slid 2.9% to its worst close in three years. It's unclear if the stocks are falling in reaction to corporate America cutting ties with the NRA, funds rethinking gun stock investments or if investors are betting against significant gun restrictions.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Gun Stocks Struggle After Florida School Shooting; Sturm Ruger Earnings Fall 44%Have Gun, Will Travel: Gun Stocks Jump On Trump PlanWhat Qualifies As An Emotional Support Animal?

7,STT,"Congress is set to give a bunch of banks more of what they want — which is to say, fewer regulators in their lives — with legislation making its way through the Senate this week.X The Senate on Tuesday voted to begin debate on a bill that would free some banks from taking stress tests, drafting plans to show how they'd wind down in a crisis, and being ""too big to fail.""The legislation has the backing of the GOP and some Democrats, and could pass the chamber this week. But how will it actually affect the biggest banks, like Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and others?""In a very limited way,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Gardner said.

8,STT,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowAs the bill stands now — and its language could change if the big banks' lobbying efforts are successful — the largest banks would still be subject to the Federal Reserve's stress tests. The dividend and buyback bonanza that comes after the banks typically pass those tests is unlikely to be affected. The rules would make it easier for big banks to buy municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal noted. But Gardner said that's ""not a needle mover.""However, analysts say that smaller banks — who may have been reluctant to expand out of fear of regulatory costs — could be encouraged to get bigger through mergers and acquisitions if the bill were passed.The Fed's annual evaluation of the financial system would no longer apply to banks with less than $100 billion in assets. After 18 months, those requirements would no longer apply to banks with assets ranging from $100 billion to $250 billion.The bill would also raise to $250 billion the amount of assets a bank has to have to be deemed systemically important to the financial system — a huge hike from the current $50 billion.""Let's say you and I are a regional bank, and we have a $100-$125 billion of assets,"" CFRA analyst Ken Leon said. ""Now all of a sudden I can look tactically at acquisitions of banks for $10 to $50 billion.""He added: ""There's been a five-year delay on M&A in the banking industry.""Smaller banks like BB&T (BBT), SunTrust (STI), People's United (PBCT), Signature Bank (SBNY) and East-West Bank (EWBC) are among those could benefit, Gardner said.The Senate debate comes as Wall Street awaits the next big boost for bank stocks, following the tax legislation President Trump signed into law in December. Those stocks have been trying to find support at their 50-day lines.Republicans have argued that the capital restraints on banks are unnecessary. Democrats have raised concerns that any easing of those restraints would encourage the behavior that landed the country in the financial crisis that occurred a decade ago.And JPMorgan and Citigroup have sought to squeeze other benefits from the bill that could meet resistance in Washington.In its current form, the bill appears to relax what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio for custodian banks — or a financial institution that protects assets like stocks and bonds for another financial firm and doesn't do retail banking. The supplementary leverage ratio gauges how big a bank's capital cushion needs to be in relation to its assets.Under the bill being debated by the Senate, banks would not have to factor in the deposits they hold at a central bank when calculating that ratio. Custodian banks, like Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), State Street (STT) and Northern Trust (NTRS) would be the likeliest to benefit.But JPMorgan and Citi, which also handle similar deposits, argue that provision should apply to them as well. Lobbyists for those banks have pressed legislators to modify the law accordingly. The Congressional Budget Office on Monday said the odds the banks would get their way stood at 50%, according to reports.The rule would also relieve many banks of the responsibility of putting together so-called ""living wills,"" or the plans that detail how a bank would dissolve, if it needed to, without dragging the economy down with it.Shares of JPMorgan closed up 0.1% in the stock market today. Bank of America dipped 0.1%, Citigroup lost 0.5%, Goldman Sachs rose 1.5%, Morgan Stanley gained 1.9%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) fell 0.9%%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Banks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And AnalysisAmazon Looking At Ways To Offer Branded Checking AccountJPMorgan Forecasts Q1 Trading Rebound After Sluggish 2017

The launch of the SPDR Portfolio ETFs provides a solution that meets this growing demand.""The SPDR Portfolio suite comprises 15 existing funds, of which three will track new proprietary indexes instead of the Russell indexes they used to track.SPDR Russell 3000 (THRK), now called SPDR Portfolio Total Stock Market (SPTM), will track the SSGA Total Stock Market Index. SPDR Russell 1000 (ONEK), now SPDR Portfolio Large Cap (SPLG), will be benchmarked to the SSGA Large Cap Index. And SPDR Portfolio Small Cap (SPSM), formerly SPDR Russell 2000 (TWOK), now tracks the SSGA Small Cap Index.IBD'S TAKE: On the hunt for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.""With its slashing of fees for a variety of ETFs, many tied to prominent indices, SSGA has aggressively crashed the low-fee ETF party consisting of iShares, Vanguard and Schwab,"" Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research, said in a note. ""However, while those firms have been bringing down expenses ratios by a basis point or two in recent years, some of the SSGA ETF cuts were by 10 basis points or more, including international equity ETFs trading under new tickers SPDW and SPEM.""Among the most drastic of its changes, SSGA cut the expense ratio on SPDR Portfolio Emerging Markets (SPEM) to 0.11% from 0.59% and SPDR Portfolio World ex-US (SPDW) to 0.04% from 0.34%.The SSGA launch will be offered commission-free on TD Ameritrade's (AMTD) ETF Market Center. Also on Monday, TD Ameritrade expanded its offerings in its commission-free ETF trading program to 296 from 100. Schwab offers more than 200 commission-free ETFs.TD Ameritrade added new providers to its commission-free lineup, but omitted ETFs from Vanguard, which doesn't pay brokers to offer its products. Vanguard funds will still be available through TD Ameritrade outside the commission-free program. This was first reported by the Wall Street Journal over the weekend.Vanguard ETFs can still be had elsewhere without paying a commission.""Investors seeking to purchase Vanguard ETFs on a commission-free basis can do so directly from Vanguard,"" Timothy Stokes, a Vanguard spokesman, told IBD. ""In addition to saving on commissions, investors enjoy best execution at Vanguard, along with all of the other benefits of investing with an industry leader beyond low-cost funds and ETFs.""Rosenbluth doesn't think Vanguard's policy of not paying placement fees is hurting the fund group.""Vanguard's ability to gather assets without having to pay to participate in a brokerage platform is impressive and helps justify their decisions,"" he told IBD. ""They have consistently gained market share in the last few years, even as commission free platforms have become more prominent and diverse. Additional costs to appear on a platform with priority shelf space would likely add to the expense ratio they charge.""Demand for low-cost ETFs has increased as advisors and investors replace mutual funds in asset allocation models or buy ETFs from commission-free platforms, Rosenbluth noted. SSGA has missed out on much of this trend because many of its expense ratios have been higher than iShares, Schwab and Vanguard, he says.But while investors may benefit from SSGA's lower fees, there could still be some questions.""However, while investors will be able to get exposure to the S&P 500 Growth and Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate indices for a lower expense ratio, the SSGA (funds) have historically traded less frequently than the iShares and Vanguard alternative and as such investors could incur higher trading costs,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, SSGA replacement of Russell indices with its own proprietary index will likely result in its shareholders ending up with a slightly different portfolio.""RELATED:IShares Cuts ETF Costs As New Rule Tied To Retirement Looms: One Hot TipHere's How Charles Schwab Is Waging Its War On Stock, ETF And Fund Fees

18,STT,"Given the explosive growth in exchange traded funds with their vast investment offerings, low cost and tax-efficiency, chances are your financial advisor has at least considered using them in part or all of your portfolio.X But what if he or she doesn't? It might be time to ask them why not. And if the answer is unsatisfactory, look for one that does.ETFs might not be right for every part of your portfolio, but they could be a good fit in various areas.For example, does your investment plan call for some exposure to the broad stock market? There are many ETFs that track the S&P 500 and broader indexes offered by the big ETF providers, BlackRock's (BLK) iShares, State Street (STT) Global Advisors' SPDRs and Vanguard. If your advisor chooses a more expensive way to gain exposure to the stock market, there might be a reason, but there should be an explanation.If you're unsatisfied with the answer or are just beginning your search for an advisor, where do you start?You can ask friends and family for referrals. You should also check out the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, or NAPFA. It's a professional association of fee-only financial advisors that started in 1983. They have a registry of advisors and chances are there are several near you.If you have at least $500,000 to invest, you can also try Schwab Advisor Network. Other brokerages can also help refer you to financial advisors.But if you start your conversation with an advisor by asking if he or she invests in ETFs, be prepared to get a question or two thrown back at you before you get an full answer. That's because advisors are trained to look at your investment goals and risk tolerance before choosing investments that fit your needs.Nik Schuurmans, the founder of Pure Portfolios, a registered investment advisor (RIA) in Portland, Ore., says to get an ETF-focused advisor you need to go with an independent RIA who doesn't have a relationship with a mutual fund family, so he or she doesn't have to push mutual funds. He says if you're willing to embrace technology you can also try a robo-advisor. NerdWallet's top 2017 robo-advisor picks include Betterment, Wealthfront, Wealthsimple, WiseBanyan, Charles Schwab and Fidelity Go.""I don't believe a consumer should use ETFs vs. other products as the criteria for using advisors,"" said Matthew S. Clement, president of Emerald Retirement Planning Group in Stony Point, N.Y., an RIA that uses ETFs in its client portfolios. ""I don't mean it shouldn't be part of the conversation. But it would be misguided to be the main reason. And it misses the fundamental issues for some hiring an advisor in the first place.""Clement said the fundamental question when choosing one advisor over another is: ""What do I expect this advisor to do for me?""IBD'S TAKE: On the lookout for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.""There's no book with the title 'Advisors That Use Only ETFs,' "" said Steve Dunn, executive director of ETF Securities, a specialist commodity exchange traded product provider. ""But, it's becoming much more common to find them. You have to find an advisor with a consistent philosophy of what you expect.""Dunn suggests a group of advisors called the Zero Alpha Group, or ZAG.""Their website lists firms that buy into this passive low-cost alternative."" But the best known resource is a site called the Paladin Research & Registry. Started in 2003, the site is run by founder Jack Waymire, the author of ""Who's Watching Your Money?: The 17 Paladin Principles for Selecting a Financial Advisor."" Advisors pay a membership fee to join the registry, which then vets them before they are listed in the registry.Paladin reviews and documents financial advisors' credentials, education, experience, ethics, business practices, services, certifications, associations and continuing education.""Most advisors present themselves in the form of sales pitches,"" said Waymire. ""We require transparency. If an advisor is telling people he's an expert, where did that expertise come from?""It looks at advisors' fiduciary status, license, registration and compliance record at finra.org.The registry lists what services advisors provide, how they are compensated, and how they communicate with clients. And for our person looking for an ETF-focused advisor, it lists a manager's strategy, whether passive or active.""Passive and ETFs are virtually synonymous,"" said Waymire.After checking the data, it rates the advisor's quality. An advisor needs to achieve a specific score to get into the registry.Waymire said investors could query Paladin for another level of detail such as ""I'm looking for an advisor that uses passive management with ETFs."" He said if they want to do research that goes one level deeper they need to go the advisor's website. He also recommends that investors check out the advisor on finra's brokercheck.

20,STT,"State Street (STT) set in motion the ETF juggernaut that revolutionized stock market investing in America and created a bright future for millions of ordinary citizens.XAs SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) approaches a milestone birthday — 25 on Jan. 22 — IBD caught up with Noel Archard, head of global SPDR product, to learn where both the company and the $3 trillion industry it spawned are headed to next.Archard joined State Street Global Advisors in May and previously helped to the build ETF businesses at BlackRock (BLK) iShares and Vanguard. As such, Archard has worked at each of the three largest providers of ETFs, which together manage more than 80% of all industry assets, making his a unique perspective on exchange traded funds.IBD: As an established and pioneering firm, how does State Street continue to innovate?Noel Archard: The SPDR ETF business is built on consistently opening or improving access to asset classes, strategies and managers. Our long list of first-to-market products includes the first sector ETFs; SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the first gold-backed exchange-traded security in the U.S.; SPDR Blackstone/GSO Senior Loan (SRLN), the first actively managed senior loan ETF; and SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free (SPYX), the first S&P 500 fossil-fuel-free ETF.Other Stories In Special ReportMaximize Your Investment Returns With These ETF StrategiesLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies3 Savvy Strategies You Can Use To Make More Money In ETFsHow To Invest In A Rising Rate EnvironmentMillennials Buy Low-Cost ETFs To Achieve Investment ObjectivesMore recently, we've partnered with other industry leaders like the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) to launch SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE) and with DoubleLine on a suite of actively managed bond ETFs that includes SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical (TOTL).With the total number of U.S.-listed ETFs now over 1,800, we strongly believe that responsible innovation is more important than ever before. To meet this obligation, we continue to tighten our criteria for launching ETFs and remain excited by the prospects of innovating with not only new products, but also new ways in which ETFs can be used to create long-term value for clients.IBD: What role has State Street played in the ETF industry's relentless march toward lower costs?Archard: Since democratizing access to broad market exposure with the launch of SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) nearly 25 years ago, we have continually looked for opportunities to make investing better.Lower expense ratios are a very important component to this commitment, but it's important to keep in mind that the total cost of ETF ownership is determined by more than a single data point.Variables including bid/ask spreads and premiums/discounts are often just as important as expense ratios when determining costs.That said, the median net expense ratio for our family of SPDR ETFs has long been significantly lower than the industry average, and we're always looking for opportunities to build upon this competitive advantage.IBD: What areas in ETFs are you targeting for growth — smart beta, actively managed ETFs, products for advisors such as managed portfolios?Archard: All three areas represent an opportunity for growth for SPDR ETFs, and in many ways, recent trends in fixed income help underscore this opportunity.The challenges of relying on the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index — known as the ""Agg"" — for core fixed-income exposure have been well documented.Despite the Agg's popularity, the index represents a relatively small portion of the $90 trillion global bond market.However, with product development strides made in fixed-income ETFs over the last five years, investors no longer have to default to the Agg. Instead, they could look to actively manage their fixed-income beta strategies using a wide range of ETFs that provide access to all corners of the fixed-income markets or rely on a well-regarded active manager like DoubleLine to minimize risk during the path of interest rate normalization.In just over two years since its launch, the SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF has attracted over $3.5 billion of assets while outperforming approximately 80% of its peers on a risk-adjusted basis.Given these results, it would be hard not to be optimistic on the future of fixed-income ETFs.IBD: What challenges face the ETF industry even as it undergoes rapid growth?Archard: ETFs are now a $3 trillion market in the U.S. and currently represent about 30% of all exchange trading. Despite this tremendous success and growth, they remain misunderstood by wide swathes of the financial services universe.Hardly a month goes by without someone trying to falsely assign blame on ETFs for an abnormality in the markets. While much of this criticism is being driven by those who are threatened by the rapid growth of ETFs, reactions to some of these criticisms suggest investor education could be the biggest challenge facing the ETF industry.In our view, the more the industry does to increase investors' knowledge and understanding of ETFs, the faster assets will grow.IBD: Which ETFs in your lineup have been most popular this year?Archard: Year-to-date, we have seen very strong demand for our SPDR EURO STOXX 50 (FEZ), which has attracted $1.5 billion of inflows amid some concern surrounding the valuations of U.S. stocks and very strong performance for eurozone stocks as the region's economy continues to recover.SPDR Blackstone/GSO Senior Loan ETF has also experienced strong inflows as investors look to generate additional income in this low-rate environment and guard against the negative effects of spread-widening.And despite relatively low levels of market volatility, this has been another strong year for SPDR Gold Shares ETF.  Year-to-date, GLD has attracted over $739 million, which can be attributed to a combination of safe-haven buying in response to heightened geopolitical tensions and strategic allocations with the price of gold on the rise.IBD: Have investors become complacent about risk? And what's your advice?Archard: The current bull market is now the second-longest in history, but one would be hard-pressed to find investors who are currently overly exuberant or complacent. Based on my own interactions with clients, most investors are focused on protecting their downside risk, controlling costs and remaining diversified.IBD: What are your best tips for choosing the right ETF?Archard: A good starting point is determining how the ETF will help you achieve your asset-allocation goals. From there, knowing exactly what you own is as important to choosing the right ETF as it is to picking a stock or mutual fund.For ETF investors, this means taking a close look at the underlying index — or investment strategy, if it's an actively managed ETF — to ensure it aligns with your objectives and risk tolerance. Examining the fund provider to ensure the firm is experienced and has a solid reputation in the ETF marketplace. And, familiarizing yourself with the ETF's structure to understand your total cost of ownership, as well as how closely it tracks its benchmark and trades on the exchanges.IBD: How can State Street improve its ETF market share in the face of stiff industry competition?Archard: Last year was the best year for inflows into SPDR ETFs since 2008, which has provided tremendous momentum for the business this year. To build on this success requires a relentless focus on making investing better for everyone.Despite the approaching 25th anniversary of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and the industry, ETFs are still in the early stages of growth, representing less than 5% of the total investable market.As awareness and understanding of the benefits of the ETF structure improves, the industry's growth rate will continue to defy expectations as assets grow exponentially.To capitalize on this growth and improve the firm's market share, we'll continue to identify enhancements to the SPDR offering that provide the greatest value to investors. With trillions in assets under management across the organization, SSGA's scale, global footprint and partnerships provide a unique opportunity to help clients succeed.RELATED:What Are Low-Cost Leader Schwab's ETF Milestones, Goals?Latest ETF News And Best ETFs Of 2017What Is Vanguard's Take On Global Growth, Active-Passive Debate?

22,STT,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among the nation's biggest banks that got the OK from the Federal Reserve to hike shareholder returns, the second round of the central bank's annual stress tests showed Wednesday.X All 34 banks tested were cleared to do so, but the Fed had reservations about Capital One (COF), which got a conditional pass. The credit card company and American Express (AXP) had to adjust their plans to pass muster.After the test results, banks started announcing richer payouts:The Fed said that it is requiring Capital One to ""to address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices."" Capital One has until Dec. 28 to resubmit its capital plan.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying the Fed did not object to its capital plan, but the bank did not provide specific figures for shareholder returns.""We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in the statement.Other lenders delivering more capital to shareholders:Shares of JPMorgan rallied 2% late after closing up 2% at 89.82 on the stock market today, breaking out past an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base. Bank of America rose 1.4% late after finishing up 2.6% at 23.88, resurfacing above its 50-day average and approaching a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley rose 1.3% late adding to its 0.2% gain to 44.32, still below a 46.08 entry. Citigroup surged 2.3% late, after rising 1.5% earlier. Wells Fargo added 1.4% to its 2.2% gain at the close, while Goldman Sachs edged up 1.2% late, on top of its 1.3% regular-session uptick.IBD'S TAKE: The stress-test results could give bank stocks a jolt after they've been idling in recent months in anticipation of tax reform and regulatory cuts from President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures and determines how much lenders can pay out to shareholders. Banks will likely begin announcing their dividend and buyback plans shortly after the Fed releases the CCAR results.The results come after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a bold vote of confidence for banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the kind seen in 2008 is unlikely ""in our lifetime.""""I think the public can see the capital positions of the major banks are very much stronger this year,"" Yellen said at a conference in London, noting that regulators are more proactive in detecting threats to financial stability than they were a decade ago.The Fed's confidence in the financial system could mean banks may see some relief in the future from the crisis-era measures designed to ensure stability — or at the very least, they may not face tougher rules. But this year's test results are based on economic scenarios the Fed outlined in February.The CCAR test also contains a quantitative portion as well as a qualitative portion, which looks at a bank's internal quality controls. Twenty-one smaller banks this year, however, were exempted from the qualitative part of the CCAR test.The Fed said Wednesday that most of the 13 banks subject to the qualitative portion this year ""have continued to strengthen their capital planning practices since last year."" But it also said that some banks, despite improvements, ""continue to have areas of weaknesses that fall short of meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.""Citigroup in 2014 failed the qualitative portion, and in recent years Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs received ""conditional passes"" and had to resubmit their capital plans. But banks have largely gotten used to the stress tests since they were first instituted in the wake of the financial crisis.They could become easier as the Trump administration looks to shred big parts of Dodd-Frank financial regulations and fill open positions at the Fed and regulatory agencies.The Fed over the years has tried to balance banks' demands for more testing transparency and its efforts to make the tests matter. The Fed worries that giving banks too much information would make the tests too easy to pass.Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, also floated the idea of requiring fewer banks to take the tests.""We believe that future stress tests will also become easier, and the possibility of banks being exempted from the process or not having qualitative reviews for all banks remains open and possible,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note dated Friday.RELATED:Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

25,STT,"The exchange traded fund universe is still in growth mode as the number of products proliferate and money keeps flowing into ETFs.Exchange traded fund assets grew 10% to nearly $2.8 trillion year over year in Q1, according to industry researcher Cerulli Associates, taking in a record $133 billion during the quarter.What began as a single offering in 1993, with State Street's (STT) SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), has blossomed into an industry with nearly 100 providers and some 2,000 ETFs, according to Morningstar Inc., an independent investment research firm.But most of the biggest players have been stable. The top four providers in terms of assets held the same spot in March as they did a year ago.BlackRock (BLK) iShares led with nearly $1.1 trillion in assets under management, Morningstar data show. Vanguard came in second with $681 billion, while State Street and PowerShares followed with respective AUMs of $537 billion and $121 billion. Charles Schwab (SCHW) rounded out the top five with $69 billion.BlackRock, which attracted $53.3 billion in Q1, boasts 336 U.S.-listed iShares funds. The first iShares ETFs, WEBS (World Equity Benchmark Shares), date back to 1993. Morgan Stanley and Barclays Global Investors launched the ETF series, later renamed iShares MSCI Series, in response to State Street's launch of SPDR S&P 500 the same year. BlackRock bought iShares in 2009.IShares began rolling out its Core series in 2012. ""IShares' lower cost Core Series has been highly popular as investors have sought moderately priced asset allocation products,"" Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research at CFRA, told IBD. ""In addition, they have a strong presence in the fixed-income ETF market and adoption of such products have been popular with retail and institutional investors.""Vanguard saw nearly $39.9 billion in inflow during the quarter. Though the Valley Forge, Pa.-based company didn't launch its first ETFs until 2001, it has quickly moved up the ranks. It now offers 55 ETFs.State Street Global Advisors took in $11.5 billion in Q1. PowerShares attracted $4.1 billion during the quarter.IBD'S TAKE: SPDR S&P 500, the first exchange traded fund listed in the U.S., remains the biggest to this day. Read this recent article for further details on the ""Spider"" ETF.Charles Schwab, which moved up a spot from Q1 2016, took in nearly $6.8 million in inflow. The online broker's ETF portfolio consists of 21 funds. Schwab has been coming on strong recently as it starts to gain ground on Vanguard, which has long been known as the key low-price leader.""Similar to iShares, Schwab has benefited from a shift to lower-cost passive allocation products,"" Rosenbluth said. ""While their lineup is smaller than others in the top 10, we think they will continue to gather assets. However, gaining share is a challenge as investors will see some similarities to their fees to what iShares and Vanguard are charging.""The top three players account for the lion's share of total assets, about 86%. BlackRock's market share was almost 39%, followed by Vanguard at 24% and State Street's 19%. PowerShares held a 4% share and Schwab, 2.5%.Not all of the top 10 ETF providers saw positive inflow in Q1. WisdomTree (WETF), the No. 7 player (down from No. 5 in March 2016), had $58 million in outflow during the quarter. It got hit with $7.15 million in outflow during the past year.""WisdomTree has a relatively high exposure to funds with a currency hedged international focus,"" said Rosenbluth. ""Investors have focused on more traditional international equity funds this year. The firm's other products are much smaller and thus are dwarfed by the flows to or away from WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ) and WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity (DXJ).""While the ETF industry is still in growth mode, there are some signs of maturity. More than 200 new U.S.-based ETFs launched in 2016, but the 128 closures was a record.That's a sign that the industry is growing in a rational manner, Rosenbluth says.Mature, maybe, but not moribund. After ETFs took in the record $133 billion in Q1, inflow continued in April, with equity ETFs pulling in $24.13 billion and fixed-income ETFs raking in $10.72 billion in new investments, according to State Street Global Advisors, citing Bloomberg Finance data.RELATED:S&P 500 ETFs Eye Record Highs As Earnings Fuel Health Sector's RiseDividend Growers To The Rescue As Stocks Retreat And Volatility Ticks Up

26,STT,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said on Wednesday that it will provide custody and fund services for more than $1 trillion in client assets from asset management giant BlackRock (BLK), a deal the bank described as one of the largest of its kind.BlackRock will be moving those services to JPMorgan from State Street (STT) in attempt to cut clients' costs, according to Bloomberg.JPMorgan said it would likely onboard those assets over the next two years. The bank's custody services include settling and holding onto clients' securities for safety purposes. It also provides accounting services and administration for funds.The deal with BlackRock comes after more recent investments in its custody banking business. JPMorgan said business done with its custody clients had grown by 10% over the past 12 months.JPMorgan shares gained 1.55% to 86.03 in the stock market today, continuing a rebound off its 50-day line as the broader market and bond yields rally.State Street, which also reported weaker-than-expected earnings Wednesday, fell 3.4% to 77.80, below its 50-day line. State Street sank as low as 74.45 intraday.BlackRock rose 1.8%, accelerating off support found in recent days at its own 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: BlackRock's deal with JPMorgan comes as many financial institutions seek to cut costs, often turning to technology to do so. Blockchain, one such technology, could save banks billions in the years to come. Bank stocks have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the so-called Trump rally, on hopes the new president and a GOP-controlled Congress would scale back regulations and grow the economy faster, leading to higher interest rates.Bank shares overall, however, have eased from their postelection run amid uncertainty of how any new policies might play out as they make their way through Congress. But, like JPMorgan, other banking giants shined Wednesday.Bank of America (BAC) shares rose 2% intraday, Citigroup (C) added 1.9%, and Wells Fargo (WFC) climbed 3.9%. Investment banking giants Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) edged up 1.4% and 2.6% respectively.RELATED:JPMorgan Cautious On Benefits From Tax Cuts, Fewer RegulationsWells Fargo To More Than Double Branch Closures In 2017; More In 2018

Earnings growth and sales are on the mend at the financial giant, helping it to estimate revisions on the plus side.For the year ahead, Good identified his main priority as helping investors understand the true drivers of risk and return in their allocations.""While the proliferation of ETFs has democratized asset allocation, there hasn't been enough focus on constructing portfolios,"" Good, the co-head of SSGA's global SPDR ETF business, told IBD.In the latter role, Good helps to oversee approximately $400 billion in ETF assets.The full interview — one in a series of IBD's interviews with top executives — follows.IBD: What were your biggest accomplishments last year?Good: 2016 was a strong year for our business. We rank third in net new assets, with nearly $50 billion of fund flows. Much of this is due to the success of our core heritage sector products, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), which investors sought out during a year marked by uncertainty.We also launched the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity (SHE), our first self-indexed ETF, and capitalized on the success of SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical (TOTL), now the second-largest active ETF, with the launch SPDR DoubleLine Short Duration Total Return Tactical (STOT) and SPDR DoubleLine Emerging Markets Fixed Income (EMTL).All three DoubleLine funds have outperformed their benchmark since inception.Additionally, we have been successful with our model (ETF managed portfolio strategies) business, which is now ranked third by Morningstar.IBD: What's planned for 2017?Good: Given that our clients need to more effectively manage risk, we will expand upon our existing process of portfolio analytics that deliver an under-the-hood view to clients' portfolios to analyze the true drivers of risk within an allocation.In 2017, we also will roll out an educational framework that guides more do-it-yourself clients through portfolio construction. For clients who want more direction, we will offer our Investment Solutions Groups Strategic Asset Allocation Portfolios, free of charge. These are paper portfolios that will be available for anyone to follow.IBD: What are the biggest challenges you foresee?Good: With new regulation on the horizon, investors will more likely focus their asset allocation decisions solely on price.In addition, while the proliferation of ETFs has democratized asset allocation, there hasn't been enough focus on constructing portfolios.We plan to address both challenges by providing investor education that explains why investors should look beyond a fund's expense ratio to ascertain how a blend of assets meets their return and risk objectives.IBD: Do you see regulatory constraints tightening or loosening ahead?Good: Given the President-elect (Donald Trump)'s position on regulatory reform and campaign trail promises to halt new regulation, we may find ourselves in a regulatory limbo with neither loosening nor tightening. However, should the DOL fiduciary rule be implemented, the emphasis on low-cost passive investments could benefit the SPDR ETF business.IBD: What investment trends are you seeing?Good: We are seeing increased adoption of thematic tilts through sectors or smart beta. This trend is underscored by nearly $15 billion of assets flowing into our sector-based solutions postelection. We also are seeing shifts toward investments that take low-cost core products and augment them with thematic exposures to generate more return or tailor portfolios for a specific outcome (growth, income, value, or ESG-oriented.)IBD: How are you responding to changes in trends?Good: Our investment teams continue to collaborate with clients to help solve a wide range of investment challenges. We worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council to develop the SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF (SPYX).And we launched a suite of smart beta ETFs in response to a client's desire to move toward factor-based portfolio construction.We have sought to improve our low-cost offerings and continue to tailor our product suite to meet the needs of investors. This allows us to focus on products and solutions that deliver the best value for investors.IBD: What should investors do differently in 2017 than the preceding year?Good: Investors should manage their risk budgets more effectively. Simply buying international equities and plain vanilla bonds for diversification is not an ideal investment strategy in this era.Given how Brexit and the presidential election have caused investors to re-evaluate portfolio foundations, they need to better manage risk by taking a deeper look at asset allocation. It's imperative to discern the true drivers of a portfolio's risk, return and macro sensitivities.Our 2017 Investment Outlook, available on spdrs.com, covers emerging trends and offers portfolio solutions.RELATED:VanEck's ETF Guru: 'We Are Well-Positioned For The Rotation To Equities'Schwab CEO: 'We Will Continue To Modernize And Disrupt The Industry'

28,STT,"The phrase ""shock and awe"" may very well describe the feelings of many ETF investors when they take stock of their portfolios as a tumultuous and challenging year winds down.The China scare in January, the Brexit pullback in June, the Fed's mixed signals and election anxiety — the markets withstood several curve balls. And for many investors, exchange traded funds paved the way to success as they seized opportunities and sidestepped risks.The past month brought cheer on a variety of fronts.Consumers grew more confident postelection, and hiring was brisk. Oil prices surged 8% the day major world producers achieved a long-elusive deal to cut production. A Fed rate hike, for the first time in 2016, buttressed views of an economy firmly on the mend.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016As the markets rallied amid these positive signals, six of the 10 largest ETFs in assets, including iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV), PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) and iShares Russell 2000 (IWM), made record highs.Most investors are now eyeing portfolio returns far different from the mid-single digits bandied about as 2016 dawned.IVV, which serves as a proxy for the U.S. stock market, climbed 3.9% in the month ended Dec. 15 to take its returns in 2016 to 13.1%.By comparison, iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), tracking foreign developed markets, and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) have advanced 1.0% and 10.6% so far this year, respectively.In the past month, the strongest returns for ETF investors came from asset classes that were already among the ETF winners of 2016.Smaller-cap and value companies excelled, with ProShares Russell 2000 Dividend Growers (SMDV) extending gains for the year to 34.4%.Industrial metals like copper shone as gold tanked, helping SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (XME) to increase its advance in 2016 to 116.9%.High-yielding bonds returned to favor amid rising rates, pushing VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond (ANGL) to a 25.1% year-to-date gain.But few ETFs had quite the month that iShares MSCI Russia Capped (ERUS) and VanEck Vectors Russia (RSX) did. They vaulted as much as 16% in the past month to take their returns for the year to more than 40% apiece.Shares in Russian equity markets spiked after Donald Trump's election win, on the strength of his more favorable stance on the country. The OPEC agreement on curbing oil output solidified gains for Russian stocks, many of which are in the energy sector.Looking ahead to 2017, some ETF investing pros have an optimistic outlook for global markets, but it's tinged with caution.That view is shared by three of the world's biggest investment management firms.Vanguard recently wrote that its outlook for global stocks and bonds remains the most guarded in 10 years, against a backdrop of high equity valuations and low interest rates.""This guarded but not bearish outlook is unlikely to change until we see a combination of higher short-term rates and more favorable valuation metrics,"" Joe Davis, Vanguard's global chief economist, wrote Dec. 1.""In some ways, the investment environment for the next five years may prove more challenging than the previous five, underscoring the need for discipline, reasonable return expectations, and low-cost strategies,"" he added.Strategists at BlackRock (BLK) also see low returns ahead, although they hold a more optimistic economic view after the presidential elections.""We see earnings growth and further rotation into big sectors such as financials underpinning a U.S. market advance in 2017, but are cautious in the short run after inflows surged and indexes set records,"" a BlackRock team wrote in their 2017 investment outlook.For the first quarter, they like U.S. regional banks, health care and companies that grow dividends over time.At State Street Global Advisors, strategists expect only modest economic growth in 2017 but see a positive shift in investor sentiment.The recent, clear risk-on tone of the markets ""could continue if the Trump administration continues to strike a more procyclical, pro-business tone,"" they wrote recently.State Street (STT) enters 2017 overweight U.S. equities and advises a tilt toward companies in sectors such as financials, materials and industrials.It sees downside risks in Europe and Japan, and is underweight international equities.While neutral on emerging markets, the firm suggests they may offer opportunities if countries such as Russia and Brazil continue to improve. They find attractive valuations in this asset class.A value-tilted portfolio may boost returns over the next few years and low-volatility strategies may offer the lowest returns, in their view.ETF investors may do best with multifactor strategies such as SPDR MSCI USA Strategic Factors (QUS), they added. This ETF holds stocks that offer value, quality and low volatility.RELATED:6 Best ETFs For When You're Both Bullish And Cautious About The Markets

29,STT,"A federal appeals court on Thursday declined to slap down the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule, which is intended to minimize conflicts of interest by brokers and financial advisors dealing with clients' retirement accounts.The court action was a setback for opponents of the DOL and Obama administration rule, which requires brokers and advisors to recommend investments that are in the best interests of clients, not merely suitable for them. As a result, the new rule will require brokers and advisors to put their clients' best interest before their own profit.Discount brokers like Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) are expected to benefit from the rule. A Goldman Sachs report said the rule will likely heighten investors' concern about fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs and passive mutual funds. That should benefit iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.IBD's TAKE: This IBD report analyzes the financial impact of the fiduciary rule on workers and on the financial services industry.In its Thursday ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied a request by the National Association for Fixed Annuities for an emergency injunction against the DOL and Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez.In their order, D.C. Circuit judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, David Tatel and Sri Srinivasan said NAFA ""has not satisfied the stringent requirements for an injunction pending appeal.""The Justice Department had asked the court to not enjoin regulations that had been issued after six years of public comment, which the government called essential to the nation's retirement security.The department had described NAFA's accusation that the new regulations will cause irreparable harm to members of the annuities group as speculative.Critics of the new rule say it will make some retirement investment advice unaffordable by middle-income families.More lawsuits against the fiduciary rule are still pending in Texas, Kansas and Minnesota federal district courts.How President-elect Donald Trump will deal with the fiduciary rule is a wild card. Trump and his intended Labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, are seen as advocates for reduced regulatory burdens.RELATED:New, Tighter Retirement-Advice Rule Raises Industry ConcernsNew DOL Rule Forces Investors To Weight Their Options

30,STT,"Wells Fargo (WFC) failed for the second time this year to persuade U.S. regulators that it could unwind its business in the event of a failure without wreaking havoc on the broader financial system.The rejection marks another setback for the lender still reeling from a scandal over phony customer accounts and means it's now banned from buying non-bank companies or setting up international units. While deeming Wells Fargo's so-called living will inadequate, the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also said Tuesday that JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and State Street (STT) had fixed deficiencies with their plans. The agencies had rejected all those banks' documents in April.Wells Fargo gets another shot at repairing its problems, the regulators said. But if it fails to do so by March 31, assets in its broker-dealer and non-bank units will be capped. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the lender will have another two years to convince the agencies it's on the right track before the regulators can step in and force it to break off pieces of its business.The San Francisco-based lender becomes the first institution to trigger the opening part of one of the most potent powers regulators were granted in Dodd-Frank: authorities that could eventually force a bank to restructure. The rejection adds to a difficult year for an embattled Wells Fargo, still trying to remedy a scandal over its employees setting up as many as 2 million accounts without customers' approval. The bank already faced restrictions on acquisitions as part of that settlement with regulators.Wells Fargo shares have climbed 2.7% this year, the worst performance in the 24-company KBW Bank Index. Shares fell about 1% in late trading on the stock market today after closing up 0.1% at 55.84.When its living will was first rejected earlier this year, Wells Fargo was hammered for ""material errors."" In a plan re-filed on Oct. 1, the bank detailed what it had done to fix its deficiencies. The publicly available section of the revised plan said it sold some non-core businesses to make the bank easier to handle in a failure. The lender also said it increased capital and liquid assets to be better able to absorb losses.In Tuesday's second failure, the bank didn't remedy problems with how it has organized its various ""legal entities"" and how it shares its services among units, according to the Fed and FDIC.The living-wills exercise was a key element of Dodd-Frank, the regulatory overhaul prompted by the 2008 financial crisis. The collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. that year showed what could happen when huge, complex financial firms go through a chaotic bankruptcy. The resolution plan process was meant to ensure big banks can be taken down quickly without threatening the economy. Large U.S. banks must persuade at least one of the banking agencies that their living wills are viable, and the industry has faced numerous setbacks in its submissions.The battle over the massive resolution plans has raged for years between regulators and the nation's biggest banks. It came to a head in April, when the five lenders were sent back to the drawing board. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley were both faulted by only one of the agencies nine months ago, while Citigroup Inc. got through largely unscathed.As the other big banks prepare for their next living-will deadline on July 1, the four cleared Tuesday by regulators can breathe a sigh of relief that they ""adequately remediated deficiencies.""

32,STT,"Federal Reserve stress tests of the nation's eight largest banks just became a bigger impediment to issuing dividends and buying back shares, but the first exam under the new rules won't hit until 2018.In a Monday speech, Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said that the eight U.S.-based banks important to the global financial system will face increased capital requirements under the new testing regime.Those eight banks are Bank of America (BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), State Street (STT) and Wells Fargo (WFC) (IBD).The biggest banks, with the highest capital requirements, will face the biggest impact from the change. Meanwhile, stress-testing and record-keeping will become somewhat less burdensome for banks with less than $250 billion in assets, Tarullo said.The changes to the stress-testing regime are consistent ""with the principle that financial regulation should be progressively more stringent for firms of greater importance, and thus potential risk, to the financial system,"" he said.Shares of Goldman Sachs sank 2.2% on the stock market today, piercing its 50-day moving average after back-to-back days of negative regulatory news. On Friday, the Fed released a proposed rule that would require Goldman, Morgan Stanley and other banks that take physical possession of commodities in metals and energy markets to hold more capital.Shares of JPMorgan fell 2.2%, closing pennies above their 50-day line after undercutting that support intraday. JPMorgan is still above a 65.08 buy point.Citigroup lost 2.7% and Bank of America 2.8%, both closing below their 50-day.Wells Fargo stock, which have been pummeled after disclosures it fraudulently opened millions of customer accounts, fell further on Monday, fell 1.9% to 44.88, its first close below 45 since February 2014.Morgan Stanley fell 2.8% and State Street 1.8%, but both remain above their 50-day averages.The Wells Fargo news increases the small but real political risk that Congress will seek to break up the big banks in 2017.""Large banks will lose additional political capital in the wake of the Wells Fargo headlines and will find it tougher to find allies in Congress to defend the banks,"" wrote Keefe, Bruyette & Woods' Washington analyst Brian Gardner.Another cloud for the banking sector comes from abroad, with Deutsche Bank (DB) shares sinking amid funding concerns as it girds for a legal battle with the U.S. Justice Department, which is seeking a $14 billion fine in connection with the German bank's financial-crisis-era mortgage bond sales.U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank were down 7.1% to 11.85, hitting a record-low 11.23 intraday following reports that it sought help from Berlin in its Justice Department fight. The bank denied the reports and said it doesn't plan to increase its capital.IBD'S TAKE: Some bank stocks have traded more tightly as Wall Street speculates whether the Federal Reserve will decide to hike rates this year. See more details about which bank stocks might be in buy range. Under a 2015 rule, the biggest banks already face a requirement that they hold bigger capital buffers against losses. Now the Fed will incorporate those capital surcharges when it determines whether banks, in high-stress economic and financial conditions, would have sufficient capital to pay dividends and buy back shares.Some banks have worked to reduce their capital surcharge by decreasing deposits or derivatives holdings, and the stress-test change could lead to more of the same.Tarullo also said that stress tests have previously only looked at a bank's health based on its direct exposures to recessionary conditions, but would in the future factor in indirect effects from financial markets. One such indirect effect would come from ""the reduction in portfolio values for one bank by other banks selling certain types of assets in order to enhance their own solvency,"" Tarullo noted.Tarullo said that the stress tests won't be updated until 2018, except to grant some relief to non-systemically important banks.RELATED:JPMorgan, Goldman, Citi Waver As Rates To Stay Lower For Longer Wells Fargo Stock Takes Hits, But Dividend, Earnings Still Intact Citigroup, Like BofA, Sets Sights Abroad, But Q3 View Mixed

33,STT,"The majority of ETFs in the IBD ETF Sector Rotation index at the time of the Brexit sell-off escaped without major damage -- in particular the ones with more metals exposure.Specifically, any ETF with exposure to gold prices came out better for the wear. Gold became more attractive as a store of wealth as the surprise Brexit vote sent global bond yields plunging.Global X Silver Miners (SIL) made a new high the past week. The price of silver closely tracks that of gold, and the fund's main holdings had a good week. Shares of metals miner Fresnillo, one of Global X's major holdings, surged about 30% on the London Stock Exchange following the Brexit vote. Silver Wheaton (SLW) broke out of an ascending base to a new high. Pan American Silver (PAAS) cleared a 16.59 buy point Friday.SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (XME), one of the most gold-heavy ETFs, broke out past the 25.66 buy point of a cup-with-handle pattern.The iShares MSCI All Peru (EPU) ETF has made up all its post-Brexit losses, which were minor to begin with. The ETF, profiled in this space last week, continues to work on a new base with a 31.52 buy point. Major mining holdings in the fund, Buenaventura (BVN) and the Canadian-traded shares of Fortuna Silver Mines (FSM), are near 52-week highs.First Trust Materials (FXZ) has recouped nearly all of a 6.7% two-day plunge.  First Trust Materials is largely a cyclical-stock play. Other major holdings include Steel Dynamics (STLD) and fertilizer giant Mosaic (MOS). One-third of the ETF is in chemical stocks, and about 16% is in mining.PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio (PEY) has only minor holdings in materials, yet the ETF weathered the Brexit slide quite well. Shares dipped just below the 50-day moving average, where they started to rebound and are now close to a new high.VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat (MOAT) tumbled 7% Monday and Tuesday. The ETF -- which targets companies that Morningstar considers undervalued and which have a competitive advantage -- was hurt mainly by financials with European exposure, such as CBRE Group (CBG), Visa (V), American Express (AXP) and State Street (STT).But many of its holdings (40 companies that are pretty evenly divided in weighting) have already recuperated from the two-day slide.                The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

34,STT,"General Electric's (GE) GE Digital business and Schindler Group announced a strategic alliance under which Swiss-based Schindler will use GE's Predix software for digital innovations in ""smart buildings.""Schindler will use GE's digital industrial operating system and software, including advanced analytics, to monitor and analyze data from its connected elevators and escalators, which it said are used by more than 1 billion people daily.Specifically, the Predix-based digital platform will enable Schindler personnel to identify, analyze and resolve possible service issues before they happen, reducing and eliminating downtime and improving the customer experience.The companies did not release financial details of the accord.GE Chief Digital Officer Bill Ruh said last month he sees the company's digital business, including software and its open-source Predix system, generating about $7 billion in revenue this year. It is positioning itself as a digital industrial firm that can compete head-on with software giant Microsoft (MSFT) and traditional rivals like Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON).GE said earlier that it's partnered with AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and about 30 others, and it expects its digital industrial revenue to more than double to $15 billion by 2020, up from an earlier estimate of about $10 billion.On June 29, GE said it had received approval of its request to the federal Financial Stability Oversight Council to removed its designation as a non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institution. Removing the too-big-to-fail designation means GE frees itself from the tight rules imposed on such institutions.The government removed the label after GE shed virtually all of its financial business. On July 1, the industrial conglomerate said it had completed the sale of GE Asset Management, its investment management arm, to State Street (STT), with the proceeds to be deposited into the GE Pension Trust to pay plan benefits.GE shares closed up 0.9% at 31.74 in the stock market today.

35,STT,"Big banks JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got through the second and final round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests unscathed, resulting in a shareholder-returns bonanza shortly after the test results were announced late Wednesday.But Morgan Stanley's (MS) capital plan only got conditional approval, and U.S. segments of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Santander (SAN) failed once againStill, Morgan Stanley said it will move forward with a 33% quarterly dividend hike to 20 cents and a $3.5 billion buyback. JPMorgan OK'd a $10.6 billion buyback but kept its dividend the same. Bank of America announced a $5 billion repurchase program and a 50% payout increase to 7.5 cents. Citigroup will buy back $8.6 billion in stock and raised its payout to 16 cents from 5 cents.Goldman Sachs (GS) didn't give specifics but said its plan included buybacks and a dividend hike. Wells Fargo (WFC)  kept its capital plans unchanged.Morgan Stanley stock were little changed in pre-market trading on the stock market today after rising late Wednesday JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup climbed 2.4%, Wells Fargo rose and Goldman Sachs all rose fractionally. Deutsche Bank, which the IMF said ""poses the greatest risk to the global financial system,"" sank nearly 4% while Santander fell 2%.Other banks also announced bigger returns to shareholders.The Fed only gave conditional approval to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, in which it projected how it would perform under difficult economic conditions for this year's stress tests. As a result, Morgan must resubmit its capital plan and address broader concerns from the Fed by Dec. 29. If Morgan can't deliver on those promises, the Fed said, its governors ""would expect to object"" to the resubmitted plan, potentially hindering Morgan's shareholder returns.While the Fed did not technically object to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, the central bank said the company ""exhibited material weaknesses in its capital planning process,"" including in governance, modeling and other safeguards.""These weaknesses warrant further near-term attention but do not undermine the quantitative results of the stress tests for the firm,"" the Fed said, referring to the portion of the tests that quantifies what banks' capital levels would look like under financial turmoil.The Fed said Deutsche Bank and Santander, both of which also had their plans rejected last year, had tightened up some aspects of their capital planning methodology but still struggled with ""material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine (the) capital planning process.""The results follow a pattern of stress-test one-upmanship between the banks, which have been shoring up capital since the financial crisis, and the Fed, which has tried harder each year to catch the banks off-guard in the scenarios posed in the tests.While the banks that passed can move forward with their dividend and buyback hikes, tougher standards on the horizon could keep payouts restrained this year. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo warned this month that banks in future tests might have to make a ""significant increase"" in the assets they set aside to cushion against a potential economic crisis.The final round of results from the stress tests -- known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR -- came after all 33 tested banks last week passed the first round of the evaluation, which quantifies how banks' finances would be affected against a barrage of market shocks.The Fed outlined the economic scenarios for both tests at the beginning of the year. In the weeks that followed, the banks submitted their capital plans, which this year forecast how they would do amid 10% unemployment, negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries -- among the conditions in the Fed's worst-case scenario.The first round of test results can serve as a preview of sorts to the second, in which the Fed actually indicates whether it accepted, rejected or had any reservations with the banks' capital plans. If it does have an issue, banks could have to temper plans to issue buybacks and boost dividends in order to pass.The second round of tests contains both a quantitative element and qualitative element. The quantitative element measures banks post-stress-test capital levels and whether they could sustain any new dividend and buyback plans. The qualitative element evaluates the soundness of the banks' capital plans and how they were developed.Analysts largely had not anticipated major problems with the banks' stress-test results.

36,STT,"General Electric (GE) said Wednesday it had agreed to sell its GE Asset Management business, including its in-house pension plan, to State Street (STT) for up to $485 million cash.Late Tuesday, the industrial conglomerate said it's selling its U.S. hotel franchise loan portfolio.GE continues to divest financial operations and focus on core manufacturing and services, transforming into what it calls the ""world’s digital industrial company.""With the acquisition of GE Asset Management -- which has been reviewed by Evercore Partners' (EVR) fiduciary unit, Evercore Trust -- State Street Global Advisors will assume responsibility for the GE pension plan currently managed by unit.State Street will also take on responsibility for managing GE Asset Management's other clients, adding about $100 billion in assets under management. Most employees in GE Asset Management will move over to State Street as part of the transaction.Net proceeds from the sale will be deposited into GE's pension plan, increasing trust assets used to pay plan benefits. The sale, which is expected to close in the third quarter, won't change any employee benefits or payouts, GE said.General Electric said last September that it planned to sell the business unit. In the back half of 2015, GE announced $157 billion in deals and closed $104 billion of them, as it sold off financial assets. In early November, it also completed the $10.6 billion purchase of the energy unit of Alstom, a France-based company.GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt said in a statement Wednesday that the sale to State Street ""meets all the criteria GE originally established for the firm that would acquire GE Asset Management, including considerable experience managing retirement assets.""GE on Tuesday said it reached a deal to sell its U.S. hotel franchise finance business, including about $1.4 billion in net investment, to Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL).

37,STT,"The financial services industry breathed a sigh of relief when the Department of Labor (DOL) issued its new rule last week. That rule aims to shield individual investors from retirement plan advice by brokers who put their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests.The sigh of relief was because the DOL's new restrictions on brokers' conflicts of interest was less onerous than the industry had expected. The DOL imposed a fiduciary standard, but provided exemptions and a slower implementation timetable.Still, the industry does stand to feel a megabuck impact. The rule could fuel as much as trillions of dollars in client asset shifts -- mainly from high-cost actively managed mutual funds -- with hefty losses of fees and commissions. It will also likely impose billions of dollars in upfront and subsequent annual compliance costs.In the $23 trillion U.S. retirement market, much of that impact will be in the $7.3 trillion IRA market, says a new report by Goldman Sachs. About $5 trillion of that will not be affected by the new rule. That's because that money was already subject to the fiduciary rule or is in self-directed accounts that don't use a financial advisor's recommendations or for some other reason, Goldman says.That leaves about $2.2 trillion in mutual funds where advisor-aided buy-sell decisions could change due to the new rule. And financial firms could be hurt by the loss of sales commissions -- also known as loads -- as well as by the loss of annual fees, as shareholder investments into those accounts slow or as assets are shifted into other, lower-cost types of assets such as index funds and ETFs, Goldman says.Mutual fund front-end loads -- commission paid when the fund is bought -- range from 0.50% to 5.75% of the value of the shares purchased, Morningstar Inc. says. Deferred loads, -- paid when shares are sold -- range from 1% to 4%.The average annual expense ratio, or percent of assets paid by the shareholder to the fund manager, is 1.18%. Stock funds bear an average annual cost of 1.25%. Bond-fund shareholders pay 0.96% on average.At 1.18%, $2.2 trillion in at-risk IRA assets would generate $39.6 billion in annual fees alone.Shareholders have been shifting to no-load share classes for years, says the Investment Company Institute, an industry group.And shareholders are already voting with their wallets against what is perceived to be higher cost mutual funds. Those $2 trillion in retail mutual funds that generate brokerage commissions account for 20% of active mutual fund assets under management. That's down from a 37% share in 2007.And where are those assets going? Individual investors are not putting them under their mattresses. They're shifting them into lower-fee ETFs and index mutual funds. Boosted by this rotation, ETF assets could mushroom to $7 trillion globally by 2020, up from $2.8 trillion today, Goldman says.In addition, the industry will also be hit by compliance costs: costs of revamping procedures to comply with the new rule, costs of retraining staff. Goldman says annual compliance costs will be more than $13 billion in upfront costs and more than $7 billion in annual costs.Retail brokers, asset managers and life insurers face swirling crosswinds of benefits and financial harm as shareholders shift existing assets and shift future asset allocation strategies, Goldman warns.""We see discount brokers like SCHW, AMTD and ETFC as relative gainers, likely gaining share as FAs"" -- financial advisors -- ""seek new platforms built for a fiduciary world and smaller accounts migrate to self-directed IRAs (and/or) auto-advisors,"" a Goldman report readers, referring to publicly traded brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).""Furthermore, we believe the end result will likely be further pressure on fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs/passive (mutual funds),"" Goldman's report added, citing iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.In addition, Goldman predicts that rollovers to IRAs from 401(k)s by retirees will slow. Because that process will be subject to the fiduciary rule, brokers will simply avoid it. Instead, financial advisors may advise their clients to leave assets in their 401(k) accounts. That should help a fund family like T. Rowe Price (TROW), Goldman says. T. Rowe Price does much more business running 401(k) accounts than it does as an IRA custodian, according to Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren.The largest players in the 401(k) business should gain, Goldman says. Among publicly traded companies, that includes BlackRock, State Street, Prudential Financial (PRU), Northern Trust (NTRS), Principal Financial Group (PFG) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK).T. Rowe Price and AllianceBernstein (AB) are also positioned to gain market share in the target-date fund business.Image provided by Shutterstock.

38,STT,"JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM) first-quarter earnings Wednesday pointed to the resilience of the U.S. consumer and economy amid recent stock market turmoil.Kicking off big banks' earnings season, the New York-based lender's Q1 earnings fell 7% to $1.35 a share, beating consensus estimates by 9 cents. Revenue slipped 3% to $24.1 billion, above forecasts of $23.4 billion.But while the top and bottom lines declined, net income at JPMorgan's consumer and community banking division rose 12% to $2.5 billion. Net revenue grew 4% to $11.1 billion.Shares jumped 4.2% and lifted stocks of other bank giants. Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC), which report results Thursday, added 3.9% and 2.6% respectively. Citigroup (C), which reports Friday, surged 5.6%. Investment banking heavyweight Morgan Stanley (MS) popped 5.3% and rival Goldman Sachs (GS) added 3.6%.JPMorgan's lending during the January-to-March period surged 11% to $847.3 billion, powered by strength in auto loans, credit cards and commercial lending. Excluding credit cards, consumer loans gained 16%, suggesting that the consumer's appetite for spending and borrowing was undeterred by a tumultuous equities markets.""Total loan growth was unbelievably strong,"" said Erik Oja, an equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""That bodes well for global banks.""Q1 usually is banks' strongest in terms of trading, but the horrific start to the year for stocks had Wall Street bracing for a disastrous quarter. In February, JPMorgan warned of a 20% plunge in trading revenue.But on Wednesday, the bank said fixed-income trading revenue notched a 13% drop, thanks to trading stabilizing in March.Still, there is room for caution as stocks have experienced two sharp downturns over the last 12 months. If the trading environment stabilizes, as JPMorgan has indicated, banks should do well enough through the remainder of 2016, analysts said. And the bank overall looks to continue building on its gains.""They’re still serving clients. They’re still growing loans. They’re still doing well in a number of segments,"" said Shannon Stemm, an equity analyst at Edward Jones.The Federal Reserve's decision last December to boost interest rates for the first time since 2006 also helped. JPMorgan's net interest income rose 1% to $11.7 billion, mostly driven by strong loan growth and the impact of higher interest rates on cash. Reported expenses fell 3% and head count declined 2% to 237,420 employees.On the downside, the bank nearly doubled its loan loss reserve to $1.8 billion, including $529 million for nonperforming energy loans and $162 million in mining and metal loans.Compared to other big banks such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo, JPMorgan is more exposed to those sectors. Though crude oil has rallied to $41 per barrel from February's low of $26 per barrel, natural gas, mining and metals remain subdued.Despite the mounting losses, big banks are considered large enough and sufficiently diversified to endure the energy bust.Meanwhile, regulators at the FDIC and the Fed ordered JPMorgan, BofA, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and State Street (STT) to make significant changes to their ""living wills,"" or their detailed bankruptcy plans required under the Dodd-Frank Act.For now, the regulators' findings are expected to be a speed bump and not much more.""We expect all these firms to aggressively address their short comings,"" wrote Jason Goldberg, a Barclays analyst, in a Wednesday note. ""We do not expect material changes to operations or costs.""

39,STT,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported first-quarter earnings Wednesday morning that fell less than expected as consumer gains mitigated investment banking trouble. The lifted shares of JPMorgan and rivals such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), which all release Q1 results later this week.JPMorgan Chase earned $1.35 a share, down 7% from $1.45 a year earlier and the first decline in five quarters. Revenue fell to $24.08 billion vs. $24.82 billion a year earlier.The largest U.S. bank was expected to report Q1 earnings per share of $1.26 a share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue was expected to fall about 5% to $23.4 billion.""We delivered solid results this quarter with strong underlying drivers,"" CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon said in a statement. ""The consumer businesses continue to grow loans and deposits impressively, attracting deposits faster than the industry. The U.S. consumer remains healthy and consumer credit trends are favorable.""The bank's consumer and community banking division reported a 12% rise in net income and 4% gain in revenue.JPMorgan shares rose 4.2% on the stock market today to a 3-month high.JPMorgan nearly doubled loan loss reserves to $1.8 billion from $959 million a year earlier. That included $529 million for energy loans and $162 million in metal and mining loans. It February the bank said  that it planned to boost reserves for potential loan losses by $500 million for energy companies and $100 million for mining and metals.Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup all have large outstanding loans, though most analysts have said banking giants have plenty of capital to absorb energy-related loan losses. Banks also have been cutting credit lines to oil and gas exploration and production companies to limit exposure, though that could create hardship in the oil patch.JPMorgan also said banking revenue fell 19%, with investment banking revenue down 24%. The bank had said previously that investment-banking fee revenue was likely to fall 25%, with trading revenue off 20%.But fixed-income trading revenue ended up down just 13% in Q1. JPMorgan said that trading stabilized in March and so far this month.Citigroup has said trading revenue would likely fall 15%.Separately, the Federal Reserve and FDIC said that JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, BofA, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and State Street (STT) must make significant changes to their ""living wills."" Major banks were required to submit detailed bankruptcy plans as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform. Meanwhile, the Fed on its own said that Goldman Sachs' (GS) living will fell short, while the FDIC on its own did not favor Morgan Stanley (MS). Citigroup did pass, despite ""shortcomings.""Bank of America stock popped 3.9%, Wells Fargo 2.6% and Citigroup 5.6%. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which report earnings early next week, climbed 3.6% and 5.3%, respectively.

40,STT,"Individual investors won some but not all of what was hoped from a sweeping new rule that tightens conflict-of-interest standards for brokers. Those brokers manage trillions of dollars in retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs, creating compliance headaches and liability issues for the financial industry.Still, the new rules are more lenient than the financial industry had feared they would be. And that leniency led investors to bid up stocks on Wednesday of many asset managers, brokers and insurers.Life insurer Primerica (PRI) soared nearly 7%. Broker and financial adviser Ameriprise Financial (AMP) rose 1.5%. T. Rowe Price (TROW) rose 1.4%. ""Several of these stocks are trading up today,"" said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. ""The rule impact is being seen as not as onerous as feared.""Despite industry relief, overall the rule is seen as a victory for individual investors.The final Labor Department (DOL) fiduciary rule, which follows months of public and industry views on its proposal, requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients when providing retirement advice. The Obama administration claims that will lower costs and boost returns for investors.""Today’s rule ensures that putting clients first is no longer a marketing slogan,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a conference with reporters. ""It is the law.""The fiduciary standard of behavior creates new grounds for complaints by investors who feel they have been short-changed by their broker. At the outset of a brokerage relationship, a broker can still require a client to agree to take any disputes to arbitration rather than to court. But now the broker has to meet a higher standard of professional behavior, says Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago securities-fraud attorney.""(The new rule) creates a strengthened cause of action for those suing their brokers,"" Stoltmann said. The new rule does not mean that DOL itself will become more active as a securities cop, Stoltmann added.The government made some concessions in its final rule after months of criticism from the financial industry.The Investment Company Institute, a group representing mutual funds, last summer called the proposal so complicated that it is unworkable. Brokerages charged that the requirement would add costs that make retirement advice unaffordable for many lower- and middle-income investors.Some financial firms will probably benefit, while others are expected to be hurt.Discount brokerages such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stand to be helped, Morningstar predicted. So are companies that sell a lot of index and exchange traded products, like State Street (STT), BlackRock (BLK) and Vanguard. And robo-advisors are also likely to gain business. Brokers would be compelled to use their low-cost products and services rather than high cost alternatives.T. Rowe Price stock was up because its funds are relatively good performers, meaning they are more likely to be acceptable investment recommendations by brokers, Warren said. Also, the firm has been bolstering its sales staff in recent months, to boost its IRA business, he added.In its new rule, the Labor Department addressed some industry concerns. The originally proposed eight-month deadline for compliance is gone, replaced by a longer, ""phased"" implementation timetable.Also modified is a requirement for new clients to sign a contract in which any broker conflicts are disclosed. These would include the broker disclosing that high-commission products might be offered even though lower-cost alternatives are available. The final rule says the contract does not have to be signed until a client actually opens an account. The proposed rule called for the contract to be signed when the client first had contact with a broker.Another item dropped from the final rule: a proposed list of acceptable assets that advisors can recommend instead of certain high-risk investments. And a widely expected prohibition of in-house investment products has been dropped.""I'm a little disappointed the DOL has caved on the issue of whether firms can recommend proprietary products like annuities,"" Stoltmann said. ""No real fiduciary could do this. I think the DOL caved on a very crucial issue.""The new rule basically extends a fiduciary standard mainly to brokers when they provide investment advice for retirement accounts. A fiduciary standard requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients. Registered investment advisors (RIAs) are already subject to the fiduciary standard, but a stricter version than imposed by the new rule on brokers, said Stoltmann.The new rule takes aim at IRAs -- particularly on money that is transferred or rolled over into IRAs from workplace retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, says Skip Schweiss, TD Ameritrade head of investor advocacy.Under the old rule, brokers could recommend investments that were merely suitable for clients. The DOL says that the old standard allowed brokers to base recommendations on what would generate commissions for them, even if a better-performing, lower-cost investment was available.The White House -- which supports the tighter standard -- said in February 2015 that investments made on the basis of conflicted advice under the old rule returned roughly 1 percentage point less a year on average than investments made on the advice of fiduciaries.With an estimated $1.7 trillion of IRA assets invested in the type of products that generate conflicts of interest, the White House estimated that the aggregate annual cost of conflicted advice is about $17 billion.""A retiree who receives conflicted advice when rolling over a 401(k) balance to an IRA at retirement will lose an estimated 12% of the value of his or her savings if drawn down over 30 years,"" read the White House report. ""If a retiree receiving conflicted advice takes withdrawals at the rate possible absent conflicted advice, his or her savings would run out more than five years earlier.""With a $100,000 rollover for people age 55 to 64 in 2012, a 12% loss would cost the average investor $12,000.Morningstar forecast a mixed impact for active asset managers, including AllianceBernstein (AB), Cohen & Steers (CNS), Eaton Vance (EV), Federated (FII), Janus Capital Group (JNS) and Legg Mason (LM). The same applies to full-service wealth managers, including Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Raymond James (RJF) and Wells Fargo (WFC).These companies have product lineups that include both higher and lower cost products.And some impact could differ from what's expected. Many full-service brokerages could replace commission-based IRA fund sales with IRAs that generate fees on assets. ""As fee-based accounts can have a revenue yield upwards of 60% higher than commission-based, this could translate to as much as an additional $13 billion of revenue for the industry,"" Morningstar reported.Also, full-service wealth managers could stop serving clients with low IRA account balances. Those clients could take an estimated $250 billion to $600 billion in assets to robo-advisors. That could push a number of robo-advisors above the $16 billion to $40 billion asset base that Morningstar estimated they need to become profitable.Even within groups that could be hurt by the new rule, like active asset managers and insurers, some companies could benefit. ""(Firms) with moats will gain market share from their less competitively advantaged peers or ... will be able to adjust their business model to offset the negative financial effects of the rule,"" Morningstar reported.

41,STT,"General Electric (GE) is reportedly nearing an agreement to sell its $115 billion asset management business to State Street (STT), as the conglomerate continues to shed its nonindustrial assets.A deal could come later this month and could value GE's asset management unit at as much as $500 million, sources told Reuters.State Street prevailed over Goldman Sachs (GS) for the business, and the negotiations are in their final stages, Reuters reported.GE Asset Management managed $115 billion in assets as of June 30, 2015, including the retirement plans for most of GE's 130,000 U.S. employees. It also manages assets for outside institutional investors.GE has been shedding much of its financial services units in order to refocus on its industrial roots and to avoid costly post-financial-crisis regulations. It has previously sold off chunks of its GE Capital unit to Wells Fargo (WFC) and Blackstone (BX).General Electric shares closed down 2.2% on the stock market today and have been trading between their 50- and 200-day moving averages since Jan. 7.State Street stock slipped 1.25%.

42,STT,"Target-date mutual funds are the Goliath of the 401(k) investing space, dominating the flow of new money into retirement plans.They're also yesterday's technology, with little to show in the way of innovation in the past 10 years, says Jud Doherty, CEO of Stadion Money Management, a $3.7 billion ETF-based investment firm based in Georgia.Stadion recently launched an ETF-based retirement solution for micro and small businesses -- which make up an overwhelming majority of 401(k) plan sponsors in the U.S. It gives these employers ""incredibly customized asset allocation solutions"" that they, unlike larger counterparts, may not otherwise have access to, Doherty said.""We believe this is a huge improvement over one-size-fits-all target-date strategies,"" he added.Target-date funds typically plug in a generic retirement year (say, 2035) and maybe risk profile to set an investor's glide path to retirement.Stadion's new offering begins by looking at a plan sponsor's overall membership profile to custom-tailor a default glide-path solution. Clients typically have a few hundred employees or less, and anywhere from zero to $50 million in assets.Then, plan participants may further define their investment paths by answering a questionnaire about their personal risk tolerance, non-401(k) assets, expectations and goals via a web-based platform.Stadion leverages technology to deliver low-cost asset-allocation solutions, much like a robo-advisor such as Betterment or Wealthfront.But it works actively with financial advisors to deliver what small and micro businesses need from a retirement offering.""We live in an advisor-sold world and work with the advisor in mind, from sales support to fiduciary services,"" Doherty told IBD in a phone call.Stadion's new 401(k) solution, called StoryLine, is built around roughly 160 SDPR ETFs from State Street (STT) Global Advisors.""It's very simple to build a customized asset-allocation portfolio with a line-up that comprehensive,"" Doherty said. The diversity of ETFs -- smart beta strategies, factor-based strategies and currency-hedged strategies, among others -- is a plus, too.""Those types of exposures would cost you far more in a traditional mutual fund,"" Doherty explained.He puts the average cost of Stadion's solutions at 0.70%, including the firm's own service fee. That's less than the expense ratio of the average target-date fund -- 0.78% in 2014, according to Morningstar.ETFs have struggled to make much headway in the 401(k) space, experts say. Some of their biggest advantages over mutual funds, such as low costs, intraday tradability and tax efficiency, are less meaningful in the context of employer-sponsored retirement accounts.""Large plans have access to very low-cost index (mutual) funds, which are as good or better than ETFs in the 401(k) setting,"" said Matt Hougan, CEO of Inside ETFs.With smaller plans too, ETFs face challenges that are hard to overcome.It costs money to run a 401(k) plan -- something neither employees nor companies like to pay for with a direct fee, Hougan said. That's resulted in a culture of revenue-sharing agreements with fund companies, typically for actively managed funds.Low-cost, index-tracking ETFs and mutual funds don't have enough revenue-sharing potential to cover those administrative costs, Hougan said.Charles Schwab (SCHW) was the first major firm to launch a full-service 401(k) program based on ETFs in February 2014, two years after the launch of a similar retirement offering based on index mutual funds.The ETF and mutual fund offerings combined now have 140 clients, 100,000 participants and $10 billion in assets, according to Steve Anderson, head of Schwab Retirement Plan Services.The firm didn't provide numbers for the growth of their all-ETF 401(k) platform since inception.

"
49,STT,"WisdomTree has grown much faster than that. It has been a magnet for investor dollars since it entered the ETF field in 2006. Rapid growth in its early years took assets under management to just under $10 billion by the end of 2010.
"
50,STT,"A Force In Funds
"
51,STT,"With its funds continuing to attract capital, by the end of last quarter it had more than $31 billion under management. That makes it the fifth-largest ETF sponsor in the U.S., according to Thind. In its third quarter, WisdomTree assets ballooned by 87% from a year earlier, CEO Jonathan Steinberg told analysts in late October.
"
52,STT,"Revenue, which closely tracks assets under management, grew by 83% to $39.6 million. After earning just a penny in each quarter of 2011, WisdomTree has strung together six quarters of improved sequential results. Last quarter, earnings came in at a record 11 cents, up 267% from a year earlier.
"
53,STT,"There are specific reasons WisdomTree has outpaced the rapidly growing ETF sector. Though ETFs are often seen as interchangeable, passively tracking benchmark indexes, WisdomTree often adds a twist to its products. ""They try to differentiate,"" Thind said.
"
54,STT,"Most indexes — the S&P 500, for example — are weighted by market cap. But WisdomTree often weights its indexes using fundamental operating metrics such as earnings and dividend payouts.
"
55,STT,"Market cap-weighted indexes tend to favor stocks with market momentum, according to WisdomTree. ""We believe this means that if a stock is overvalued, market capitalization weighted funds will give the overvalued stock greater weight as its price and market capitalization increases,"" WisdomTree said in its most recent 10K.
"
56,STT,"By contrast, WisdomTree's ""fundamentally weighted"" indexes weight operating performance over market momentum. In theory at least, such indexes hold fewer overvalued stocks and should be less vulnerable to downturns.
"
57,STT,"Big In Japan
"
58,STT,"WisdomTree's top fund, Japan Hedged Equity (DXJ), has two other twists that help make it an asset magnet. Unlike most Japan equity ETFs, DXJ is not based on the Nikkei 225 Index. Instead, it is weighted toward Japanese companies that are highly export-dependent. Such companies benefit from lower yen values. But betting on a lower yen — if it works — can penalize investors who then get paid in a less valuable currency. To protect against that, DXJ hedges with derivatives.
"
59,STT,"The timing of these features has been remarkably apt. Shinzo Abe took over as Japan's prime minister in late 2012 and soon announced a series of measures to stimulate the Japanese economy and help Japan's exporters by lowering the value of the yen.
"
60,STT,"Investors quickly saw that exporters in DXJ's index would benefit greatly from Abenomics. They also knew DXJ would protect against currency-translation losses from the yen's decline.
"
61,STT,"Investors poured money into DXJ. In the first nine months of 2013, the fund saw inflow of $8.8 billion. DXJ now accounts for roughly 35% of WisdomTree's assets under management, Thind notes.
"
62,STT,"Other funds have also contributed to asset growth. WisdomTree's second largest fund, the Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund (DEM), attracted assets with its unusual focus on emerging market dividend payers. This fund accounts for 15% of assets, Thind estimates.
"
63,STT,"WisdomTree keeps growing its international presence, recently introducing German and Korean hedged equity funds. It is also trying — with somewhat less success — to grow its presence in fixed income.
"
64,STT,"Even excluding the outsized success of DXJ, WisdomTree has been growing assets. One widely used metric is organic growth, which includes net fund inflows but does not include growth through share appreciation. Even without DXJ, annual organic growth ""has been above 25% since the company's founding,"" Thind said. ""Year to date in 2013, organic growth excluding DXJ is averaging 26%.""
"
65,STT,"It all sounds great. But WisdomTree's success is especially vulnerable to reversal.
"
66,STT,"Asset managers tend to be more volatile than the market as a whole, notes Sterne Agee analyst Jason Weyeneth. If the market falls, asset managers fall even more.
"
67,STT,"Beta is a measure of a security's volatility, or a portfolio's volatility, relative to the overall stock market. A beta above 1 indicates a tendency to outperform in bull markets and underperform when stocks are sinking. Asset managers tend to have betas in ""the 1.5 range,"" Weyeneth said. Analysts say WisdomTree is too young a company to have a precise beta as it has not gone through a full market cycle. But Thind estimates its beta at 1.5 to 2.
"
68,STT,"Market Moves
"
69,STT,"When stocks go south, high-beta asset managers can get hammered in two ways. For one thing, their revenue typically is based on assets under management. For every managed dollar, they get a predetermined fee. If the market falls, so does the value of their managed assets — and their revenue.
"
70,STT,"And there's another factor. ""A market decline could trigger outflows,"" notes Weyeneth. As investors sell their shares, funds like WisdomTree's must sell to raise cash. So the fund's assets decline as a function of both the market decline and fund outflows.
"
71,STT,"WisdomTree also faces strong competitive risk as rivals keep introducing ETFs with new twists.
"
72,STT,"The biggest publicly traded rivals include BlackRock (BLK) with its iShares ETF family; State Street (STT), sponsor of the SPDRs; Barclays (BCS) with iPath ETNs; Credit Suisse (CS) with Credit Suisse ETFs; Deutsche Bank (DB), provider of DB X-Trackers; UBS (UBS) with ETRACS; and Charles Schwab (SCHW) with Schwab ETFs.

Unlike most Japan equity ETFs, DXJ is not based on the Nikkei 225 Index. Instead, it is weighted toward Japanese companies that are highly export-dependent. Such companies benefit from lower yen values. But betting on a lower yen — if it works — can penalize investors who then get paid in a less valuable currency. To protect against that, DXJ hedges with derivatives.The timing of these features has been remarkably apt. Shinzo Abe took over as Japan's prime minister in late 2012 and soon announced a series of measures to stimulate the Japanese economy and help Japan's exporters by lowering the value of the yen.Investors quickly saw that exporters in DXJ's index would benefit greatly from Abenomics. They also knew DXJ would protect against currency-translation losses from the yen's decline.Investors poured money into DXJ. In the first nine months of 2013, the fund saw inflow of $8.8 billion. DXJ now accounts for roughly 35% of WisdomTree's assets under management, Thind notes.Other funds have also contributed to asset growth. WisdomTree's second largest fund, the Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund (DEM), attracted assets with its unusual focus on emerging market dividend payers. This fund accounts for 15% of assets, Thind estimates.WisdomTree keeps growing its international presence, recently introducing German and Korean hedged equity funds. It is also trying — with somewhat less success — to grow its presence in fixed income.Even excluding the outsized success of DXJ, WisdomTree has been growing assets. One widely used metric is organic growth, which includes net fund inflows but does not include growth through share appreciation. Even without DXJ, annual organic growth ""has been above 25% since the company's founding,"" Thind said. ""Year to date in 2013, organic growth excluding DXJ is averaging 26%.""It all sounds great. But WisdomTree's success is especially vulnerable to reversal.Asset managers tend to be more volatile than the market as a whole, notes Sterne Agee analyst Jason Weyeneth. If the market falls, asset managers fall even more.Beta is a measure of a security's volatility, or a portfolio's volatility, relative to the overall stock market. A beta above 1 indicates a tendency to outperform in bull markets and underperform when stocks are sinking. Asset managers tend to have betas in ""the 1.5 range,"" Weyeneth said. Analysts say WisdomTree is too young a company to have a precise beta as it has not gone through a full market cycle. But Thind estimates its beta at 1.5 to 2.Market MovesWhen stocks go south, high-beta asset managers can get hammered in two ways. For one thing, their revenue typically is based on assets under management. For every managed dollar, they get a predetermined fee. If the market falls, so does the value of their managed assets — and their revenue.And there's another factor. ""A market decline could trigger outflows,"" notes Weyeneth. As investors sell their shares, funds like WisdomTree's must sell to raise cash. So the fund's assets decline as a function of both the market decline and fund outflows.WisdomTree also faces strong competitive risk as rivals keep introducing ETFs with new twists.The biggest publicly traded rivals include BlackRock (BLK) with its iShares ETF family; State Street (STT), sponsor of the SPDRs; Barclays (BCS) with iPath ETNs; Credit Suisse (CS) with Credit Suisse ETFs; Deutsche Bank (DB), provider of DB X-Trackers; UBS (UBS) with ETRACS; and Charles Schwab (SCHW) with Schwab ETFs.""It's a highly competitive business,"" said Gabelli's Sykes. ""The potential for obsolescence is certainly there.""Those are all real risks. But as long as markets keep humming, WisdomTree is in enough of the right places to expect continued success.

119,STT,"ETF Investment Strategies: Tips On How To Buy The Best ETFs
"
120,STT,"Actively managed exchange traded funds are a small but fast-growing segment of the approximately $2 trillion ETF industry. But regulatory hurdles threaten to stunt their growth.
"
121,STT,"Like traditional mutual funds, actively managed ETFs harness the buy and sell ideas of professional money managers who aim to outperform a benchmark index. But, unlike mutual funds, the ETFs allow investors to manage short-term risks by trading intraday and using tools such as limit orders, which set maximum or minimum buy and sell prices. The ETFs also tend to have lower expenses than mutual funds.
"
122,STT,"The funds are a fairly new strategy in ETF investing, with most funds started in the last seven years. The active ETF industry has grown to 128 funds with some $19 billion in assets as of March 31, according to data provided by Morningstar. Nearly half of those funds have been launched since the start of 2014. New funds include the recently launched Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY), which invests in the 50 companies that make up the IBD 50 index.
"
123,STT,"""Because the active ETF space is still so small, I feel like there's so much more room for growth,"" said Noah Hamman, CEO of AdvisorShares, one of the industry's largest players with 23 funds totaling about $1.3 billion in assets.
"
124,STT,"AdvisorShares' active ETFs include high-yield bonds, international equities, global bonds and commodities. Last year, the company launched two currency-hedged gold funds that have allowed investors to buy the yellow metal in depreciating currencies such as the euro and yen.
"
125,STT,"""Instead of trading a strong dollar for gold, you can trade a weakening foreign currency for that gold exposure,"" Hamman said.

"
128,STT,"Though active ETFs are growing quickly, about 99% of the $2 trillion in ETF assets remain in passive index products, such as those that track the S&P 500. Both types of ETF are still dwarfed by the $16 trillion U.S. mutual fund industry.
"
129,STT,"While active ETFs tend to charge lower fees than mutual funds, their growth is hampered by requirements that managers disclose their holdings each day. The fear is that others will be able to buy a stock just before the ETF manager can execute a trade, a practice known as front-running.
"
130,STT,"Managers would ""essentially be sitting around the poker table not only showing their opponents their hand but also showing what they're doing on the flop every day,"" said Ben Johnson, global director of ETF research at Morningstar.

In poker, the flop is the first three cards dealt face-up on the board.As a result, he said, ""There's not much appetite on the part of equity managers to repackage their strategy in an ETF format.""Fidelity Investments recently jumped into the active ETF space with three bond ETFs launched in October: the Fidelity Corporate Bond ETF (FCOR), Fidelity Limited Term Bond ETF (FLTB) and Fidelity Total Bond ETF (FBND).""We felt that it was appropriate to do actively managed products in the fixed-income side"" because it's ""a lot harder"" for market participants to take advantage of moves as they occur, said Lee Sterne, an ETF strategist at Fidelity.Nevertheless, experts expressed optimism about the future of actively managed ETFs, especially if the Securities and Exchange Commission eases its disclosure requirements.Hamman of AdvisorShares downplayed concerns about the stricter disclosure rules for active equity ETFs, saying that it'll just take time for fund managers and investors to get comfortable with the investment vehicles.""We don't know if there's truly an issue with transparency,"" he said, adding that ""the arbitrage aspect of front-running is hard to implement if you don't know what is coming next.""Some active ETFs that disclose their holdings are having success.The Calamos Focus Growth ETF (CFGE), which was launched last July, is up 4% this year, while the ValueShares U.S. Quantitative Value ETF (QVAL) is up 6%. Both are easily outperforming the S&P 500's 1% rise. Like many actively managed ETFs, they're thinly traded, which could make it hard for investors to find buyers if they need to sell in a pinch.Yet analysts see the industry continuing to expand as the funds prove themselves over time.""I see growth across segments,"" Sterne said. ""There's going to be more products launched by more sponsors across both the equity and fixed-income universes.""

The arrangement allows prospective Vanguard buyers to avoid the $6.95 fee that E-Trade charges to trade funds that don't make the cut, the online brokerage said in a statement this week.E-Trade's decision flies in the face of other brokers that have balked at Vanguard's stance against paying to appear on their platforms. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) booted the firm from its commission-free platform last year, and Vanguard's funds are also absent from Charles Schwab's (SCHW) OneSource program.A spokesman for Vanguard confirmed that the firm hasn't changed its long-standing policy of not paying for distribution.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The no-fee offer won't include inverse and leveraged ETFs, which Vanguard considers speculative investments.""This is about giving investors access to more low-cost options,"" Karin Risi, managing director of Vanguard's retail investor group, said in a phone interview.

231,STT,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) were among all 35 banks that passed the Federal Reserve's stress test, clearing a major hurdle toward huge hikes in capital returns.The Federal Reserve said the nation's largest banks are strongly capitalized, though Goldman Sachs (GS) came the closest to missing the mark, posting a leverage ratio of 3.1% vs. the Fed's minimum requirement of 3%.""Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a press release.The Dodd-Frank stress test results detail whether banks' capital holdings passed or failed regulators' scenarios of economic downturns. This is the first of two tests. On June 28, the Federal Reserve will release the results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which determines how much capital the banks are allowed to return to shareholders.Some analysts see a majority of banks making payouts that exceed profits for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, with the likes of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo among them.""I don't think generally today's results, that everyone passed, are a big surprise to anybody. It was largely expected,"" Raymond James managing director Michael Rose said.Analysts expect banks to spend more on dividends and buybacks despite the Federal Reserve's stress test actually being stricter this year.Under 2018's stress test scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak. This is tougher than the 6.5% drop that was modeled last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's stress test outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Banks will be able to unveil their capital return plans for the coming year following the release of the second set of results next Thursday. Those tests determine how large a capital buffer that banks need to protect themselves from a financial crisis.But Wells Fargo is at an elevated risk to fail the June 28 test due to oversight issues related to its account-opening scandal and perhaps a lack of focus by management on the exam due to the scandal, Rose said.""Even if everybody passes quantitatively, (Fed regulators have) historically made an example out of one or more banks on the qualitative side,"" he told IBD. ""I wouldn't expect them to deviate from that historical pattern when we get next week's CCAR results.""Shares of JPMorgan closed essentially unchanged on the stock market today.

The likes of Barclays, Jefferies and Raymond James see the average payout approaching the 100% mark but not exceeding it.But this would still represent a bumper increase in payouts. In addition, analysts widely see the average dividend as coming out at around the 30% mark.Barclays has estimated that shareholders of 22 of the top banks will receive $170 billion in dividends and buybacks. This is around a quarter more than in 2017.""We look for the median bank's total payout ratio to approach 100%, while both dividends and share repurchase increase over 20% from CCAR 2017's level,"" Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a research note. ""We believe the pace of dividend increases could exceed that of share repurchase.""There are three main reasons cited for the increased payouts: large excess capital cushions, low payout ratios in 2017, and large positive earnings impacts from tax reform.Financial institutions have been raking in billions of dollars in additional profits thanks to lower taxes and rising interest rates.It had been expected when the stress-test guidelines were released in February that the GOP's new tax law would be a beneficial offset to the stricter demands.One fly in the ointment is the current flattening yield curve.

235,STT,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) signed an agreement with French manufacturing group Alstom, under which Alstom will exit three joint ventures, in return for a consideration of $3.1 billion. The transfer of all interests to GE will occur on Oct 2.The three joint ventures cover grid, nuclear, as well as renewable assets and were created as part of Alstom's €12.35-billion sale of its energy business to GE in November 2015. GE had acquired the French company’s energy business under former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt.Alstom stated that it intends to exercise options to sell its interests in the Renewables and Grid joint ventures. Per the original agreement, GE will then be deemed to have exercised option to acquire Alstom’s interest in the Nuclear joint venture.Alstom intended to exit the businesses to concentrate on the manufacturing of rail equipment. Separately, Siemens AG (SIEGY  -  Free Report) and Alstom agreed to merge their rail operations in September 2017.The 2015 acquisition of Alstom’s assets had fortified GE’s foothold in the business of servicing and maintaining gas turbines, while the joint ventures in renewable energy and electrical transmission businesses also added to its strength.However, since then, the market for gas turbines has weakened considerably. In fact, CEO John Flannery has commented that GE was late in recognizing the weakening demand. Both GE and Siemens are now overhauling their businesses and slashing jobs to endure the slump.GE Power is the biggest segment of the conglomerate in terms of corporate revenues. However, the unit has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters, as global demand increasingly favours renewable energy sources. Also, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages are other factors that are dampening demand. Industry experts opine that the acquisition of Alstom’s assets further compounded the problems for GE, as it increased operating costs and contracted margins.Nevertheless, in 2017, Flannery assured investors that energy, aviation and healthcare will continue to be the focal points of GE’s operations. It has been nearly five months since Flannery outlined his plan to divest more than $20 billion of assets.In April, GE inked an agreement to sell a trio of its health-care information technology businesses to private equity firm Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion. The deal marks one of the first notable portfolio-related moves since Flannery announced the plan to exit at least $20 billion of businesses. However, he has hinted at the possibility of the company’s disintegration into separately-traded businesses.The overhaul, along with cost cuts and cultural changes, encompass Flannery’s attempts to pull GE out of one of the deepest slumps in the company’s 126-year history. The company’s shares have lost 47.7% in the past year, wider than the industry’s decline of 12.2%.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderGeneral Electric presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

236,STT,"Q1 earnings season has thus far had a pronounced calming effect on market volatility this week; after more than a month of wild turbulence based on a host of external issues, impressive growth and positive surprises for companies so far reported have brought a welcome tepidness to daily trading. Even when markets are down like they were Thursday, there were no three- or four-digit spikes to strike fear into the hearts of investors.This quarterly good news continues into Friday’s pre-market, with beleaguered industrial major General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) posting a positive surprise on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of 16 cents per share outpaced the 11 cents expected, whereas quarterly sales of $28.7 billion surpassed the $27.9 billion in the Zacks consensus.CEO John Flannery had already described 2018 as a “reset year,” following a long duration of losses and underperforming segments under past leadership. Many analysts still expect GE to take some sort of different form in terms of business holdings down the road, but for now the market is pleased with the Q1 beat. Shares are up 6.5% in today’s pre-market, off the multi-year lows struck earlier this month. For more on GE’s earnings, click here.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) also topped quarterly estimates this morning, posting $1.00 per share on $16.3 billion in revenues — ahead of the expected 98 cents and $16.2 billion, respectively, as well as +4% year over year on both top and bottom lines. Though we saw some weakness in the company’s fiscal Q3 report, such as a dip in core gross margins, full-year earnings guidance was ratcheted up to 6-8%. For more on PG’s earnings, click here.Oilfield services major Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), however, saw an opposite fortune befall the company in its Q1 report: an earnings meet of 38 cents per share combined with a top-line miss of $7,829 million (versus $7,852 million expected) has caused a 1% pre-market sell-off at this hour. Yet revenues were up big from a year ago, with Drilling +28% and Production +98%. For more on SLB’s earnings, click here.Global financial services major State Street Corp. (STT  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 4 cents to $1.62 per share, on revenues in Q1 of $3.02 billion which met estimates exactly. This represents 13.2% year-over-year growth on the top line for the Zacks Rank #3-rated company. Shares had been pulling back a tad of late, but this is off all-time highs posted earlier this year. For more on STT’s earnings, click here.And Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with Zacks Style Score (Value, Growth, Momentum) of A, beat marginally on both top and bottom lines ahead of today’s opening bell. Earnings of $1.39 per share outperformed by 4 cents per share, whereas $3.2 billion eked by the $3.1 expected. Earnings guidance for the full year reached $8.30-8.50 per share. For more on SWK’s earnings, click here.

237,STT,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Jul 17. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last reported quarter.Comerica’s first-quarter 2018 results reflected rise in revenues. Also, a strong capital position and improving credit quality were the positives. However, higher expenses and a fall in deposits were the key headwinds.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.2%.Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteNow let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts for the to-be-reported quarter:Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Comerica is +1.60%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have been revised slightly downward over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.62 reflects growth of 43.4% year over year.Factors to Drive the ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Rise: Comerica’s net interest income is likely to improve in the to-be-reported quarter supported by expanding net interest margin and a pickup in loan growth, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer.These benefits might partially be offset by a fall in interest earning assets. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects a slight decline in average earnings assets balance to $66 billion on a year-over-year basis.Higher Fee Income: Investment banking performance is expected to be flat during the quarter. Strong equity issuances globally might have been boosted by IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are likely to show improvement. Also, increasing M&As will likely support advisory fees to some extent.Moreover, given the continued momentum in customer activity, in terms of using credit and debit cards, the company might have recorded higher related fees.Therefore, given expectations for rise in both NII and fee income, total revenues are likely to increase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the second quarter is $831.9 million, reflecting an improvement of 7.2% year over year.Lower Mortgage Banking Revenues: The company is likely to continue witnessing lower revenues from this division owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates.Credit Quality Might Improve: The quarter continued to witness strong credit quality trends. Also, the consensus estimate shows 34.9% and 33.3% decline in non-performing assets and non-performing loans, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BankUnited (BKU  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jul 24.

238,STT,"Following the release of the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results last week, the Federal Reserve approved the capital plans of 34 financial institutions out of the 35 participating (including the U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets) in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).However, the capital plan of the U.S. holding company of Germany-based Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) has been rejected by the Fed on qualitative reasons. Notably, the bank’s plan failed to receive consent on flaws in assumptions for forecast of revenues and losses.Moreover, the capital plans of Goldman GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) received conditional consent with their total dividend payouts and stock buybacks to be maintained at the current levels. Additionally, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) plan has been given a green signal with the clause of improving its hypothetical lending risks analysis with other big banks.The Fed’s nod for most of the major U.S. banks reflects stability in the banking system to a great extent.""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" said Fed’s vice chairman Randal Quarles.Root of the Capital RulesCurrently authorized under the Dodd-Frank financial-services law, these stress tests were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. During the economic downturn, big financial institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed, while several others were on the verge of a meltdown. Such a turbulent situation compelled the U.S. government to infuse billions of dollars into credit markets and save the entire financial system from crumbling. Stress tests have been annually conducted since 2009.These major banks, now, have the privilege to raise dividends and buy back shares. This year’s stress test was the toughest, with severe adverse scenario featuring a severe global recession and the U.S. unemployment rate increasing to 10%, along with a steepening Treasury yield curve. Further, changes in tax rates had an adverse impact on banks’ financials as the tax law eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that inclined to increase net income at the time of financial crisis.Under this hypothetical scenario, these banks will incur a loss of $578 million. Notably, the projected losses included $113 billion from credit card loans for the banks, at an equal level with trading and counterparty positions. Also, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio (in aggregate) would fall to 7.9% from an actual 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the figure is well above the 4.5% minimum mark set by regulators.This apart, the Fed requires the big banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 3% of their assets and certain other positions.Banks that AcedWells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) are among the major banks which received the Fed’s green light to raise their dividends or repurchase shares.Among these, M&T Bank currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while all other banks carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Since the first round of stress tests, there has been substantial increase in capitals of U.S. firms. The common equity capital ratio has also more than doubled from the 5.2% in first-quarter 2009 to 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017 of the 35 bank-holding companies which participated in the 2018 CCAR. Such positive results reflect rise in common equity capital from about $800 billion to more than $1.2 trillion during the same period.Recovery on the WayGiven the tax cuts and easing of stringent regulations, banks’ optimism has yielded results. With the capital plan approvals, banks keen to reward shareholders by enhancing the size of their capital-deployment plans (raising dividends and repurchasing shares) have announced respective dividend hikes and share repurchase plans.Nevertheless, the Fed’s approval to increase dividend payment and accelerate the share buyback program will definitely help banks attract more investments, moving ahead.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

239,STT,"The Federal Reserve released the first round of its annual stress test results, mandated by the Dodd-Frank regulation. The findings showed that the 35 largest U.S. banks are well positioned to put more money in dividends, share buybacks and business investments. The banks have sufficient capital balance to withstand severe recession.The results have been announced at a time when the Fed is forging ahead with rate hikes, reflecting an economy that is improving by the day. Banking on such positive developments, investing in sound bank stocks that have passed the litmus test will be judicious.What Are the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests?The Fed started testing banks in 2009, two years after the beginning of the financial crisis that resulted in a recession. The Fed had to test all U.S. bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets, per the Dodd-Frank law enacted by former president Obama in 2010.But the threshold was raised to $100 billion last month by President Trump. These banks are subject to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) that determines whether they can fund dividend payments and share buybacks amid economic turmoil.   Banks Clear First Round of Fed’s Toughest Annual Stress TestsAll 35 banks that underwent the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests showed that they have enough capital buffers to weather an economic meltdown and recessions modelled by the Fed. These banks can withstand a situation where unemployment rate rises to 10%, an almost 6% increase from the current level; the stock market tanks by two-thirds and home prices plunge by 30%.Banks’ capital scores remained comfortably above regulatory requirements in the first round of the stress tests, even though they had to bear losses due to higher credit card balances and one-time accounting challenges enacted by the recent congressional overhaul.Fed Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles added that “despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year’s test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession”.Banks Are Well Poised to Meet Financial ObligationsAll 35 banks stayed above the 4.5% minimum capital ratio in a severely stressed situation. When it comes to assessing the ability of a bank to meets its financial obligations, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) 5.3% capital ratio turned out to be the lowest, per Fed. Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report) topped the list with 17.6%, followed by UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) and Banco Santander, S.A. (SAN  -  Free Report) at 16.4% and 15.2%, respectively.The diagram shows all the 35 banks that have cleared the minimum capital ratio to satisfy the Fed’s concern. Fed Rate Hikes Bode Well for BanksWhile the stress test showed that the banks could withstand a downturn, it came at a time when the Fed lifted a key U.S. interest rate for the second time this year and signaled a slightly more aggressive plan to tighten monetary policy in the near term. Interest rates rose again as the U.S. economy gained strength and inflation crawled higher.The Fed, as widely expected, raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage points to a range of 1.75% to 2% this month and predicted two additional rate hikes this year. This will take the count to four increases instead of three as planned earlier.Needless to say, higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.5 Biggest GainersGiven the positive trends, we have selected five solid banks that have passed the first round of the stress test.

240,STT,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) plans to refund about $330 million to its credit card customers by the latter half of this year, after having confessed to charging higher interest rates to some of the defaulters, since 2011.Per the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, credit card issuing companies are required to review the accounts of customers whose interest rates had risen after a missed payment or bounced checks. The companies are to determine whether the customer has resumed making timely payments or has displayed some other creditworthy behavior.On being satisfied of the customer’s financial standing, the rates are supposed to be lowered.In one such review, Citigroup discovered to have kept overcharging about 1.75 million accounts. The bank said to have found flaws in the methodology it used to calculate the reduced rates in some accounts.Majority of the affected accounts witnessed smaller rate cuts than they were eligible to, while the rest did not get the reduction at all. The New York based lender will be making average refunds of $190.    Also, the bank disclosed to have found no wrongdoings on part of its employees. Further, it apologized for having delayed in identifying the issue and promised to make amends at the earliest.Previously in 2015, the financial regulators had made Citigroup pay nearly $700 million to credit card customers who were made to buy unnecessary add-on services. Per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s findings, seven million accounts had been targets of “deceptive” marketing.The recent disclosure is likely to have a little impact on the Citigroup’s reputation.

244,STT,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) has agreed to pay about $613 million in penalty to the U.S. regulators for deliberate violations of the Bank Secrecy Act by its subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association.Willful ViolationsThe bank has been slapped with charges of failing to put together proper anti-money laundering (AML) control programs along with intentionally not reporting suspicious activities to the authorities.For a period of nearly six years (ended 2014), U.S. Bancorp was found of using weak AML measures. The bank lowered the number of suspicious activities that could be identified by its monitoring systems due to limited number of employees present to track them.Also, the bank had hidden this fact from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Despite knowledge of these improper practices and repeated warnings from the reviewers of staff levels to be “stretched dangerously thin”, U.S. Bancorp chose to conceal facts from the minutes of internal meetings.Further, the regulators also noted the bank’s failure to properly track Western Union transactions made by non-customers at its branches. Suspicious transactions were allowed to go uninvestigated despite employees raising concerns.Second allegation on the bank was keeping the wrongdoings of Scott Tucker, a former professional race car driver, from the authorities until it received a subpoena from the U.S. attorney in Manhattan in 2013.The bank allowed Tucker to use accounts under tribal names to conduct fraudulent payday lending scheme. Since 2008, these sham companies had lent millions of loans to the customers and generated profits that he spent to fulfil his lavish needs.In 2011, investigators reported about these misdoings to which the bank responded by closing Tucker’s accounts in the names of the tribal companies but refrained from filing a suspicious report. Moreover, they allowed him to operate through non-tribal accounts letting millions from illegal payday business schemes to flow in.Penalties ImposedU.S. Bancorp has signed a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York and has agreed to pay a fine of $453 million.The bank is also liable to pay $75 million to the OCC, $70 million to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Federal Reserve will be paid $15 million.Apart from penalty, the bank will continue to undertake proper modifications of its AML program, only after which charges will be dismissed by the government.Our TakeThough this settlement might impact U.S. Bancorp’s financials to an extent, it still remains well poised for growth on the back of its solid business model and diverse revenue streams.Also, such incidents help instill investors’ confidence in regulating bodies and keep banks from engaging in illegal activities.Shares of U.S. Bancorp have gained 6.5% over the past six months, underperforming 20.5% rally for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

245,STT,"Friday, April 20, 2018Q1 earnings season has thus far had a pronounced calming effect on market volatility this week; after more than a month of wild turbulence based on a host of external issues, impressive growth and positive surprises for companies so far reported have brought a welcome tepidness to daily trading. Even when markets are down like they were Thursday, there were no three- or four-digit spikes to strike fear into the hearts of investors.This quarterly good news continues into Friday’s pre-market, with beleaguered industrial major General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) posting a positive surprise on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of 16 cents per share outpaced the 11 cents expected, whereas quarterly sales of $28.7 billion surpassed the $27.9 billion in the Zacks consensus.CEO John Flannery had already described 2018 as a “reset year,” following a long duration of losses and underperforming segments under past leadership. Many analysts still expect GE to take some sort of different form in terms of business holdings down the road, but for now the market is pleased with the Q1 beat. Shares are up 6.5% in today’s pre-market, off the multi-year lows struck earlier this month. For more on GE’s earnings, click here.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) also topped quarterly estimates this morning, posting $1.00 per share on $16.3 billion in revenues — ahead of the expected 98 cents and $16.2 billion, respectively, as well as +4% year over year on both top and bottom lines. Though we saw some weakness in the company’s fiscal Q3 report, such as a dip in core gross margins, full-year earnings guidance was ratcheted up to 6-8%. For more on PG’s earnings, click here.Oilfield services major Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), however, saw an opposite fortune befall the company in its Q1 report: an earnings meet of 38 cents per share combined with a top-line miss of $7,829 million (versus $7,852 million expected) has caused a 1% pre-market sell-off at this hour. Yet revenues were up big from a year ago, with Drilling +28% and Production +98%. For more on SLB’s earnings, click here.Global financial services major State Street Corp. (STT  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 4 cents to $1.62 per share, on revenues in Q1 of $3.02 billion which met estimates exactly. This represents 13.2% year-over-year growth on the top line for the Zacks Rank #3-rated company. Shares had been pulling back a tad of late, but this is off all-time highs posted earlier this year. For more on STT’s earnings, click here.And Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with Zacks Style Score (Value, Growth, Momentum) of A, beat marginally on both top and bottom lines ahead of today’s opening bell. Earnings of $1.39 per share outperformed by 4 cents per share, whereas $3.2 billion eked by the $3.1 expected. Earnings guidance for the full year reached $8.30-8.50 per share.

248,STT,"After reporting 20% year-over-year rise in investment banking revenues in 2017, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), expects further growth in this segment in 2018 on the back of improved activity in the emerging markets.In an interview with Reuters, Miguel Azevedo, head of investment banking in the Middle East and Africa said that bond sales, M&As and trading activities are likely to take an upswing in Nigeria, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, in turn spurring the bank’s investment banking revenues.Per growth projections made by the World Bank for 2018, the Middle East and North African regions are expected to witness a 3% growth rate. Improved condition of oil prices and expectations of development in economic reforms have made the region an attractive opportunity for the private banks to tap on.Notably, the region is undergoing a turnaround from traditional IPOs or debt rising toward private M&A deals and placements, which guarantees strong investment banking performance. This has increased competition among the several lenders present there.     In April 2017, Citigroup was granted the license to provide services like investment banking, debt and equity capital markets, securities and research capabilities to local and institutional clients in Saudi Arabia. Last month, the bank held its first board meeting in the country marking its return after 13 years of absence.Citigroup has been building upon its Saudi investment banking business with new hires.Also, Azevedo reflected views on growing opportunities in Nigeria, as the country is likely to return to the bond markets in 2018. In November 2017, a $3 billion two-part international bond issue was managed by Citigroup and Standard Chartered. He also added Egypt to the list on account of increase in number of IPOs.Citigroup, with its global footprint and attractive core business, seems to be well poised for growth. Also, improving domestic economy amid the rising rate environment, as well as anticipated potential ease of regulations under President Trump’s administration, the bank is likely to continue delivering strong results in quarters ahead.Shares of Citigroup have gained 30.9% over the past year, outperforming 20.2% rally for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some other stocks worth considering in the same space are Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bank of America has increased 8.8% for the current year, in the last 30 days. The company’s share price has increased 37.8% in the past year.State Street has witnessed 4.6% upward earnings estimate revision for 2018, in the last 30 days. Its share price has risen 33.8% in the past year.KeyCorp’s shares have gained 18.5% in a year and its earnings estimates for 2018 have moved up 5% in the last 30 days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

Though the deal is subject to regulatory approvals, the bank expects to close it in first-quarter 2018.Shares of Fifth Third fell 3.4% over last two trading sessions, reflecting investors’ reaction to the company’s declining fee income.However, the bank’s initiatives to build up fee income businesses are encouraging.

It also excluded the impact of certain other one-time items, including unrealized, mark-to-market gains /losses on derivatives, and goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization and impairment.Fourth-quarter results of Navient reflect higher non-interest income.

Asset recovery and other revenues rose while servicing revenues declined slightly.Provision for credit losses increased nearly 7% year over year to $109 million.Total expenses climbed 17.5% year over year to $289 million.Segment PerformanceFederally Guaranteed Student Loans (FFELP): The segment generated core earnings of $65 million, down 4.4% year over year. The underperformance was mainly due to lower NII owing to amortization of portfolio and decrease in net interest margin, partially offset by a decline in operating expenses.FFELP loan spread contracted 2 basis points (bps) year over year to 0.96%.During the quarter, Navient acquired FFELP loans of $463 million. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s FFELP loans were $81.7 billion, down 6.8% year over year.Private Education Loans: The segment reported core earnings of $43 million, up 4.9% year over year. Total delinquency rate came in at 5.8% compared with 7.4% in the year ago quarter.

This includes 6.1 million customers on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education.Source of Funding and LiquidityIn order to meet liquidity needs, Navient expects to utilize various sources, including cash and investment portfolio, issuance of additional unsecured debt, repayment of principal on unencumbered student loan assets and distributions from securitization trusts (including servicing fees). It may also issue term asset-backed securities (ABS).During the reported quarter, Navient issued $751 million in FFELP Loan ABS, $662 million in private education loan ABS and $250 million in unsecured debt. Also, the company retired or repurchased $95 million of senior unsecured debt during the quarter.Also, a new $750 million revolving credit facility was closed during the quarter to warehouse private education refinance loan originations.

However, the company has currently suspended its share repurchase program through 2018 in order to use available capital toward growing education lending business and build book value.Our TakeNavient’s strong fee income base helps to keep revenues afloat. Also, its efforts to enforce digitization are encouraging. However, its top-line continues to remain under pressure. Also, the company’s involvement in improper lending practices, is likely to hurt its reputation and keep legal expenses elevated.Navient carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

253,STT,"State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results before the market opens on Jan 23. Its quarterly earnings and revenues are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, an increase in revenues drove the company’s operating earnings growth. In fact, the number outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher expenses and a decline in trading servicing fees were the downsides.State Street boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 8.3%.State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteAlso, activities of the company during the fourth quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter increased 1.2% to $1.71 over the last 30 days. Also, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 15.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $2.98 billion for the quarter, reflecting 17.7% year-over-year growth.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsStable net interest income (NII): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $186.9 billion for the quarter represents a decline of 6.2% year over year. Further, overall lending activities were decent in the quarter. This, along with higher interest rates is expected to boost the company’s NII, but lower interest earning assets are likely to offset this gain to some extent.Notably, management expects NII to be relatively stable sequentially on the assumption of a slightly smaller balance sheet. Net interest margin is projected to increase a few basis points, driven by asset repricing and continued liability management.For 2017, management projects NII to be in the $2.43-$2.45 billion range. This takes into consideration interest rate expectations across the curve and currencies. Apart from this, NII growth will depend on the size of balance sheet, client deposit behavior, balance sheet management activity and the impact of FX swap costs.Balance sheet is expected to modestly decline in 2017, owing to lower client deposits and a fall in wholesale CD levels along with decrease in the average earning assets of roughly 0% to 5%.Muted fee revenue growth: Driven by the benefits of the acquired GE Asset Management business, management fees are likely to improve in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, on a sequential basis, management expects servicing fees to rise. However, lower market volatility is expected to lower trading revenues.In 2017, fee revenues (on an operating basis) are projected to increase above the 6-7% range. This was based on the assumptions of the market conditions as of October 2017, the U.S. dollar remaining stable relative to major currencies and benefits from GE Asset Management deal.Modest rise in expenses: Management expects operating expenses to rise slightly from the third-quarter level, mainly due to costs associated with new business activity. Expense level will also be dependent on the revenue backdrop in the quarter and the onboarding of new clients.For 2017, the company anticipates State Street Beacon expense savings of at least $140 million to partially offset expenses to support new business, continued business investments, and merit and depreciation increases.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:State Street does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for State Street is -0.15%.Zacks Rank: State Street has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Synovus Financial Corp.

254,STT,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) released its fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results. Adjusted earnings per share of 91 cents for the quarter came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure reflects improvement of 18.2% from the prior-year quarter tally.The quarter witnessed improvement in net interest revenues along with provision benefits. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, rise in expenses and lower fee income acted as headwinds. As a result, shares of the company declined nearly 4% in pre-market trading.After taking into consideration net benefit of 41 cents per share, related to the Tax Act and severance, litigation and other charges of 24 cents per share, net income applicable to common shareholders for the quarter came in at $1.13 billion or $1.08 per share.For 2017, the company reported net income applicable to common shareholders of $3.92 billion or $3.72 per share, up from $3.43 billion or $3.15 per share registered in 2016. Revenues Decrease, Costs RiseTotal revenues (GAAP basis) for the quarter decreased 2% year over year to $3.73 billion. The figure includes certain non-recurring items. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues was $3.98 billion.Total revenues for 2017 were $15.54 billion, up from $15.24 billion registered in 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues was $15.79 billion.Net interest revenues, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, were $862 million for the quarter, up 2% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates, partly offset by a fall in average deposits and loans.However, net interest margin decreased 1 basis points year over year to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues decreased nearly 3% from the prior-year quarter to $2.86 billion. The fall was primarily due to lower distribution and servicing fees. Also, the company witnessed investment and other losses of $198 million in the quarter.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) came in at $2.87 billion, increasing 12% year over year. This reflects an increase in all expense components, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, bank assessment charges and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, AUM was $1.9 trillion, up 15% year over year. This reflected higher market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $33.3 trillion were up 11% year over year. Higher market values, favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business largely drove the increase.Credit Quality ImprovesAs of Dec 31, 2017, non-performing assets came in at $90 million, down from $107 million registered in the prior-year quarter end. Also, allowance for loan losses decreased 5.9% year over year to $159 million. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million compared with provision of $7 million in the year-ago quarter.Capital PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, common equity Tier-1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) came in at 11.5% compared with 11.3% as of Dec 31, 2016. Leverage capital ratio was 6.6%, in line with the Dec 31, 2016 figure.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 12 million shares for $651 million. In 2017, the company repurchased a total of 55 million shares for $2.7 billion.Our ViewpointBNY Mellon’s restructuring initiatives and inorganic growth strategy will go a long way in supporting its bottom line. Further, its strong global reach and gradually easing margin pressure are expected to support profitability in the long run.However, concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee-based income remains a major concern for the company in the near term.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

255,STT,"The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 12, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for PNC Financial. The quarter witnessed a rise in consumer confidence, which led to growth in consumer loan portfolio. Also, the rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank. Though, flatter yield curves offset the benefits to some extent, pressure on PNC Financial’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017.Moreover, President Trump’s success in executing the tax overhaul boosted the stock market during the quarter, which would greatly support PNC Financial’s fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $4.17 billion indicates a 7.6% year-over-year improvement for the to-be-reported quarter.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s third-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and higher fee income. These factors also helped it in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses and provision for loan losses.Notably, PNC Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 4.6%.The earnings beat translated into improved price performance. Over the past year, shares of PNC Financial have gained 21.8%, outperforming the 18.8% growth recorded by the industry.PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to PNC Financial’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of PNC Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is +0.55%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Though, earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 have been revised slightly downward over the past 30 days, they reflect year-over-year growth of 11.7% and 15.5%, respectively.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: In addition to higher interest rates, moderate improvement in lending, mostly in the consumer front, is likely to perk up interest income. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest income is projected to be $2.39 billion, up 12.1% year over year.Management expects its net interest income for the to-be-reported quarter to increase in low-single digits on a sequential basis.Controlled Expenses: The company had a cost-saving program in place during the year to keep expenses under control. However, these efforts are likely to be partially offset by one-time restructuring expenses due to the tax reform.Muted Non-Interest Income: The fourth quarter was exceptionally good for the investment banking and underwriting business, which might support the company’s fee income.On the other hand, with overall low volumes of M&A during the quarter, the related fees are expected to be lower. Per the consensus estimate, total non-interest income is expected to be $1.75 billion, slightly up year over year.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

256,STT,"The projected decline in Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) mortgage business will likely impact its fourth-quarter earnings given significant dependence of its top line on this source. However, this might not lead the company to report dismal results on Jan 12. Benefits of higher rates and loan growth are anticipated to be positive factors.Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues are expected to be low resulting from seasonality that might be eased due to immaterial negative MSR valuation adjustments. Notably, expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment.Here are the other factors influencing Q4 results:Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are expected to be in line on a sequential basis during the fourth quarter. Particularly, weakness in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth will likely be offset by rising consumer loans. However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue into the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Also, the bank is cutting back its auto lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income. Notably, management projects NII to grow in low- to mid-single digits for 2017.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo may record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Wells Fargo anticipates the efficiency ratio to be around 61% in 2017, excluding the $1-billion discrete litigation accrual recorded in third-quarter 2017 and any other non-recurring expenses. Further, the company is targeting around $4 billion of cost savings by 2019. Of the total cost savings target, 21% is expected to be achieved in 2017.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Also, though the company has not providing any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.76%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged over the last seven days and is expected to grow 0.97% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $22.4 billion, up 3.9% year over year. Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 23.

257,STT,"Easing margin pressure, enhanced capital deployment and continued synergies from the acquisition of GE Asset Management make State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) a promising pick right now. Also, enhanced capital deployment activities reflect a strong balance sheet position.Further, analysts seem to be optimistic about the company’s prospects. Over the past 60 days, the stock has witnessed three upward estimate revisions for 2017 and four upward estimate revisions for 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $6.25 and $7.04 for 2017 and 2018 reflect 18.6% and 12.6% year-over-year growth, respectively.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 25.6% in 2017, outperforming the industry’s gain of 18.9%.What Makes State Street an Attractive Investment Option?Revenue Strength: State Street has been witnessing consistent improvement in revenues. Over the past five years (2012-2016), total revenues recorded a compound annual growth rate of nearly 2%. Continuous investment in new products, new business wins and the GE Asset Management acquisition will likely strengthen the company’s revenue generation in the quarters ahead.Additionally, its projected sales growth of 13.5% in 2017 and 5.4% in 2018 ensures continuation of the upward revenue trend.Earnings per Share Growth: State Street has recorded an earnings growth rate of 19.9% over the last three to five years. Further, this earnings momentum is likely to continue in the near term as reflected by the company’s projected earnings per share (EPS) growth of 18.6% for 2017 and 12.6% for 2018.Also, its long-term (three to five years) estimated EPS growth rate of 9.4% promises rewards for investors in the long run.Impressive Capital Deployment: State Street’s capital deployment plan is commendable. The company’s 2017 capital plan (approved by the Federal Reserve) included an 11% dividend hike and $1.4 billion share repurchase authorization. Given its solid liquidity position and earnings strength, the company is expected to be able to sustain improved capital deployments and continue enhancing shareholders’ value.Strong Leverage: State Street’s debt/equity ratio is 0.61 compared with the industry average of 0.88, indicating relatively lower debt burden. This reflects the financial stability of the company even in adverse economic conditions.Superior Return on Equity (ROE): State Street’s ROE of 13.03% compared with the industry average of 10.29%, mirrors the company’s strong position over its peers.Stock Looks Undervalued: State Street stock seems undervalued when compared with the broader industry.

259,STT,"On Tuesday, U.S. banking regulators — the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (“FDIC”) — passed eight largest domestic banking organizations on their ""living wills"" after completing the evaluation of the resolution plans. These banks include Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC  -  Free Report), The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and State Street Corp. (STT  -  Free Report).However, both regulatory agencies have found some shortcomings in the plans of four banks out of the eight firms, which can be improved in the next resolution plan. These four globally important banks include BofA, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.""While significant progress has been made... there are inherent challenges and uncertainties associated with the resolution of a systemically important financial institution,"" the regulators noted.Notably, regulators demand improvement in four particular areas, including the management of derivatives, payment, clearing and settlement activities.Previously, in April 2016, resolution plans of five banks out of these eight were deficient, per the agencies.The plan, better known as “living will,” lays out the strategy for a company’s fast resolution under bankruptcy in the event of failure of the company or severe financial stress. Under provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the banks (with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more) are required to submit living wills. The main objective behind the submission of living will is to avoid re-run of the 2008 financial crisis and reduce risks of further bailouts.A systemic resolution, maximizing the sale value of a failed bank and minimizing creditor losses would help in efficient handling of bank failures. Moreover, the FDIC will have the power to liquidate a bank if its collapse knocks down the country’s financial stability.Notably, all eight firms require their next resolution plans to be submitted by July 1, 2019.Among these banks, Morgan Stanley and Bank of New York Mellon carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The regulators are working to improvise the resolution planning process. Therefore, it is expected that the submissions of annual resolution plan can be modified to once in two years in order to extend the time to prepare and review the plans.Bottom LineHypothetically, it is easy to say that resolution plans should be made in a way such that these do not adversely affect the overall financial system. However, in practice, it is difficult to mitigate the harm, as banks depend considerably on mutual businesses.Nevertheless, we believe ""Living Wills"" will help the regulators wind up banks, in case of failures, to some extent. Most importantly, the advance precautions will surely entail into lesser involvement of taxpayers’ money for bailing out troubled financial institutions.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

260,STT,"The days of increased regulatory scrutiny are over for U.S. financial stocks. The Congress approved a plan on May 22 to scale down stringent banking regulations or the Dodd-Franck act undertaken in the height of the 2008 financial crisis.While the move sounds great for the entire banking industry, small-cap banks should actually jump in joy. SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) gained 0.6% on May 22 while SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE  -  Free Report) advanced 0.4%. Direxion Regional Banks Bull 3X (DPST  -  Free Report) gained about 1.53% on May 22.Inside the Dodd-Frank LawsThe Dodd-Frank Act is a U.S. federal law that entrusts the government with the regulation of the financial industry. The focus of the law was to cut back on uncontrolled lending and avoid the situation where tax-payers' money is needed to bail out large financial institutions. The Act increased the operating expenses of financial institutions given the rise in compliance costs. Further, stringent capital requirements led banks to curb investments.Why Is the New Rule Especially Beneficial for Small Banks?From his campaign days, President Trump addressed the Dodd-Frank regulatory revamp as needlessly strict on smaller banks.The bill lowers federal oversight of banks between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets, and “eases lending, capital and trading rules for smaller lenders,” per Reuters. Now, since the days of increased regulatory scrutiny seem to be phasing out, regional banking stocks are likely to be performing at peak levels.But big bank lobbyists and analysts are of the opinion that the latest easing will do little to comfort the stringency pertaining to the nation’s largest lenders. Large banks lobbied a lot to increase that oversight limit to $500 billion, or resort to a more lenient approach to big bank scrutiny, but small banks strived to cap the threshold at $250 billion, according to Reuters (read: Play Banking Bonanza with These ETFs in Trump World).Most importantly, the new bill relaxed capital, lending and trading rules of the banks on the basis of asset-size limits, not by firm type or activities. As a result, big banks, many of those that have size to tune of $10 billion, failed to qualify for the rule.Against this backdrop, investors can surely dip their toe in regional and community bank ETFs and stocks.ETFs to BuySPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report)The fund looks to track the S&P Regional Banks Select Industry Index.

261,STT,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.State Street Q3 Earnings Beat, Revenues Improve Y/YRise in interest income drove State Street’s third-quarter 2017 operating earnings of $1.71 per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Also, the figure was up 26.7% year over year.Higher net interest income (reflecting rise in interest rates) and fee income supported the results. Also, assets under custody and administration and assets under management (AUM) witnessed growth. However, an increase in operating expenses and lower trading servicing fees were the undermining factors.After considering certain non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders came in at $629 million or $1.66 per share compared with $507 million or $1.29 per share in the year-ago quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseRevenues, on a GAAP basis totaled $2.85 billion, increasing 8.6% from the prior-year quarter. However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.95 billion.Net interest revenues, on an operating basis, jumped 20.1% from the year-ago quarter to $645 million. The rise was mainly driven by higher interest rates, lower wholesale CD balances and disciplined liability pricing. Also, net interest margin increased 29 basis points year over year to 1.35%.Fee revenues grew 4.9% from the prior-year quarter to $2.32 billion. All components of fee income showed improvement except total trading services revenues.On an operating basis, non-interest expenses were $1.99 billion, up 4.1% on a year-over-year basis. All expense components, except other costs, increased during the quarter.As of Sep 30, 2017, total assets under custody and administration were $32.1 trillion, up 10% year over year. Moreover, AUM was $2.7 trillion, up 9.3% year over year.Strong Capital and Profitability RatiosUnder Basel III (Advanced approach), estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 12.6% as of Sep 30, 2017, up from 12% as of Jun 30, 2017.Return on common equity (on an operating basis) came in at 13.4% compared with 11.1% in the year-ago quarter.State Street BeaconGiven the continued challenging environment, State Street is accelerating its multi-year plan to further digitize its operating environment and create cost efficiencies. The company announced a multi-year plan to accelerate the next phase of its transformation program aimed at generating roughly $550 million in annualized pre-tax savings by the end of 2020.Moreover, State Street generated $175 million in annual pre-tax expense savings in 2016. The company remains on track to achieve at least $140 million in annual pre-tax net run rate expense savings in 2017.  Further, State Street Beacon will improve operating basis pre-tax profit margin to nearly 31% by 2018 and 33% by the end of 2020.In order to implement State Street Beacon, the company anticipates incurring aggregate pre-tax restructuring costs of roughly $300–$400 million over the 5-year period ending Dec 31, 2020.Fourth-Quarter 2017 OutlookManagement anticipates NIM expansion of a few basis points driven by asset repricing and continued liability management. NII is expected to be relatively stable from the prior quarter on the assumption of a slightly smaller balance sheet.On sequential basis, management expects servicing fees to rise, while trading revenues are expected to be muted due to less market volatility.Operating expenses are projected to increase marginally from the third quarter level, largely owing to costs associated with new business activity. Expenses will also be dependent on the revenue backdrop in the quarter and the onboarding of new clients.The company expects effective tax rate to increase relative to third quarter level.2017 GuidanceManagement anticipates NII to be in the $2.43-$2.45 billion range. This takes into consideration interest rate expectations across the curve and currencies, which include a rate hike later this year. Apart from this, NII growth will depend on the size of balance sheet, client deposit behavior, balance sheet management activity and the impact of FX swap costs.Fee revenues (on an operating basis) are projected to grow above the 6-7% range. This is based on the assumptions of the market conditions as of Oct 2017, the U.S. dollar remaining stable relative to major currencies and benefits from GE Asset Management deal.In addition, the company targets generating positive fee-based operating leverage at the upper end of 100-200 basis points range (excluding $249 million acceleration of compensation expense incurred in fourth-quarter of 2016). Management expects to see variability across quarters, with continued focus on expense management. This, however, is likely to be partially offset by continued regulatory pressure, expenses related to supporting new business wins, investments in strategic initiatives and the contributions of the GE Asset Management deal.On the cost front, management anticipates State Street Beacon expense savings to partly offset expenses to support new business, continued business investments, and merit and depreciation increases.Management expects balance sheet to modestly decline, owing to lower client deposits and lower wholesale CD levels along with decrease in the average earning assets of roughly 0% to 5%.In addition, operating-basis effective tax rate is estimated to be towards the lower end of the 30-32% range.Long Term GuidanceManagement targets revenue growth in the range of 8–12% along with the EPS growth of around 10–15%. Further, return on equity is expected to be in the range of 12–15%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.State Street Corporation Price and Consensus  State Street Corporation Price and Consensus | State Street Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, State Street's stock has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a C.

262,STT,"Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) has agreed to pay $2.5 million to the federal government to settle an investigation conducted by the United States into its trading activities, going by Charlotte Business Journal. The investigation, between 2009 and 2010 was led by the FBI’s Charlotte Division and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Region.There were claims that some of BofA’s traders on the swaps desk in New York had used insider information to trade ahead of block futures trades with counterparties.Upon investigating, the bank confessed that at least three of its traders overheard calls between large counterparties and its sales people about block futures trades that were going to be executed.However, without disclosing the same to the company, they used the information to hedge risks that were projected to arise from the respective block trades.Although the settlement between BofA and the United States was reached in 2015, it was announced on Friday, Sep 22, 2017, by Jill Westmoreland Rose, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.Along with this announcement, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also announced its settlement with Merrill Lynch regarding an investigation that it held to see how the latter failed to keep records of its trading activities.Rose said, “The settlement underscores the expectation that everyone, from Wall Street to main street, act honestly and ethically in their financial transactions.” She added, “The financial system depends on the integrity of everyone involved in it. The settlement reinforces our expectation that firms effectively monitor their employees and deal candidly with all regulators and law enforcement agencies.”While investigations are common in the banking universe, mentioned below are a few stocks from the space that are worth a look for some good reasons.M&T Bank Corporation’s (MTB  -  Free Report) shares have gained more than 30% in a year’s time.

263,STT,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has been witnessing growth in loans and deposits. Also, rising rates have led to an increase in revenues. Strategic acquisitions have consistently been helping the company expand its footprint and fuel profitability. However, escalating costs owing to acquisitions and subsequent integrations are expected to curb BB&T’s bottom-line growth. Also, the company’s exposure to risky loans continues to be a near-term concern.BB&T’s overall organic growth strategy remains impressive with continued rise in loans and non-interest bearing deposits. Over the last five years (2012-2016), loans and leases have witnessed a CAGR of 5.2%, while non-interest bearing deposits have seen a 3-year (2014-2016) CAGR of 14.3%. Both witnessed a rising trend in the first six months of 2017.The company acquired National Penn and Swett and Crawford in 2016, which continue to be accretive to its earnings. While it plans to expand its footprint further in Texas and Pennsylvania through acquisitions, its key focus is to increase revenues from insurance operations from the current 15% to 20% of total revenues over time. For this, the company intends to acquire more insurance agencies. Such strategic initiatives should support bottom-line growth.Driven by such initiatives, analysts are optimistic about the earnings prospects of the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has increased nearly 1% over the last 30 days.On the flip side, mounting operating expenses have been curbing BB&T’s bottom-line growth. Total operating expenses have been showing a persistent rise with a five-year (2012-2016) CAGR of 3.6%, largely attributable to acquisitions and subsequent integrations.The company holds a large amount of risky loans that could pose a problem in case of further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions because of its exposure to commercial, direct retail lending and residential mortgage loan portfolios which were more than 77% of total loans and leases.Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 22.1% in the past 12 months, compared with 40.1% rise for the industry. Stocks to ConsiderStocks in the finance industry worth considering include State Street Corp.

264,STT,"After the Federal Reserve signaled a likely rate hike by the end of this year, hopes were renewed among investors targeting bank stocks. The Fed announced that it would raise the interest rates four more times by the end of next year. This came as a sweet surprise for investors, as they were not expecting any update on rate hike this time around.The news led to an increase in SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) by 1.6% in the past two days as against a 0.2% decline recorded by the S&P 500 index.As the current inflation rate remains below the Fed’s target level, chances of an interest rate hike were low this time around among market participants. However, investors were waiting for another important decision that is likely to significantly benefit banks.Putting all speculation to rest, the Fed finally announced that it will begin reducing its balance sheet starting next month. The Fed’s balance sheet stands currently at a staggering $4.5 trillion, thanks to its efforts to increase liquidity by large-scale purchases of assets during the last financial crisis. The decision to unwind was the result of months of vigilant research and hard work put in by the central bank to tighten the monetary policy.Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, said in the meeting that the economy was strong enough to survive further rate increases and the reduction in the balance sheet.Why Are Banks Likely to Profit?Anticipation of Rate Hike: Banks typically benefit from rising interest rates. The benefit primarily comes from a steep yield curve, i.e. when the spread between long-term and short-term rates is wide. Deposits usually carry short-term rates while loans are often tied to long-term rates.Accordingly, a rise in rates enables banks to charge more for loans, leading to an increase in their spread income. Also, rising rates reflect an improving domestic economy that boosts banking business.Downsizing of Balance Sheet: Balance sheet reduction is also going to profit banks. That’s because if the Fed decides to buy back some or all short-term duration securities, the yield curve will be steeper. This means that the yield on long-term bonds will increase. This will also lead to improved margin spreads for banks.Choosing the Winning StocksWhile the Fed’s moves will likely benefit the entire banking sector, stocks that been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a favorable Zacks Rank should generate solid returns.  BancFirst Corporation (BANF  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

265,STT,"Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) can be a solid bet now on the back of its leading global position in completed mergers and acquisitions in 2017. The company’s strong client activity amid volatile markets is anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.Organic growth, cost management and steady capital-deployment activities continue to drive Goldman’s growth. However, litigation issues remain concerns.Expense management and business diversification aided the company to gain 6.3% compared with 32.3% growth of the industry.Further, the company’s earnings estimates moved 6.6% upward, for the current year, over the past 60 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the past few years, Goldman has been benefiting from its successful expense-reduction initiatives. Though expenses have been volatile, the figure declined significantly in 2016, but increased 3% in 2017 and 21% in first-quarter 2018. The company is focused on improving efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. Notably, Goldman’s $5 billion of growth initiatives is expected to drive an incremental $2.5 billion in annual pre-tax earnings, at a 30% marginal ROE.While overall revenues have been affected by unfavorable market conditions over the last few quarters, Goldman remains well positioned for growth, given its strong investment banking operations and solid client franchise. These, in turn, are likely to help the company leverage on the improving environment.Furthermore, the key source of the company’s earnings stability is its business diversification. Within traditional banking, a diversified product portfolio has higher chances of sustaining growth than many other banks, which have exited some of these areas.Driven by a solid capital position, Goldman has consistently enhanced shareholders’ value with steady capital-deployment activities. Its 2017 capital plan won regulatory approval that includes share buybacks and an increase in quarterly common stock dividend, along with issuance and redemption of other capital securities. In April 2018, the company increased its common stock dividend by 6.7%.Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

266,STT,"The long-time demand of banks to scale back stringent regulations is finally a reality. The House passed a crucial bill easing some provisions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that were put in place as safeguard against repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.The House passed the bill on Tuesday backed by majority voting of 258 to 159, promising it to be beneficial for small and mid-sized banks. It would now be presented to President Donald Trump for signing, with the Senate already having passed the legislation in March.Highlights of the BillPerhaps the most significant relief from the bill is the reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill will eventually raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.Banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later. This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 38.Therefore, banks including SunTrust (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief. These banks will not be required to undergo annual stress tests or submit so-called ‘living wills,’ both necessitated as measures to plan for financial disaster. So, this will eventually lower regulatory compliance costs.Further, the move will likely lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Other than this, the bill will lower the amount of capital required to be held by the custodian banks. The bill will allow these companies to set aside the money they received from clients and immediately send it to the Fed or some other central bank for safety. Thus, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) custodian banks — State Street (STT  -  Free Report), BNY Mellon and Northern Trust (NTRS  -  Free Report) — will be the major gainers.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further, banks with less than $10 billion in assets will be exempted from complying with the Volker Rule, which prohibits proprietary trading. The bill also eases mortgage loan data reporting requirements for several banks and credit unions as well as relaxes rules on what type of real estate loans smaller community banks can make.Additionally, the legislation will add new safeguards for student loan borrowers and necessitate credit reporting companies like Equifax and TransUnion to provide free credit monitoring services.Is Dodd-Frank Hurting Banks’ Financials?The Dodd-Frank Act has been criticized by small and medium banks for tougher rules that have made it difficult of them to do business and remain profitable. But in reality, did the law actually hurt their profitability?Well, if we go by the figures, banks have continued to earn significant profits. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported record earnings of $56 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 27.5% year over year. Notably, community banks, constituting 92% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported net income of $6.1 billion, 17.7% above the prior-year quarter level.While one can say that improving economy and higher interest rates have supported banks, strict rules have also played their part to some extent in aiding the financials.Monitoring by regulatory bodies has helped banks to keep a check on their operations and maintain sufficient capital cushion to avoid another financial crisis. By establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to oversee credit cards, mortgages and other financial products as well as other regulatory bodies to check for signs of instability, the Dodd-Frank Act provided stability to the banking industry.Road AheadThe bill is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations. Still, it is the most important step to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth (as seen by many) and lending activities.But the legislation is of little help to some of the nation’s biggest banks (in term of assets) like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), PNC Financial, Goldman and Wells Fargo. Notably, further discussions seem to be going on about lowering capital requirements and easing other restrictions on these banks.Later this month, the banking regulators are expected to release a proposal to weaken the Volker Rule for big banks. Further, the CFPB interim head has significantly scaled back the agency’s activities and stopped probes into finance companies.Thus, in the coming days, more regulatory easing is expected. These will definitely help the banks to further improve profitability. Also, shareholders might expect more returns in the form of buybacks and dividends.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

267,STT,"Investors often overlook sales growth while picking stocks, as a company’s stock price is generally sensitive to its earnings momentum. However, earnings are quite vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily cooked and inflated. That’s why sales must always be taken into consideration while making any investment decision.Sales growth is actually an important indicator of a company's health and ability to sustain its business. It provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power. The main advantage is that the sales figure is generally not manipulated and is less volatile than earnings.Without some top-line growth, the bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable in the long term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires sales growth.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks but it does not ensure profits. Therefore, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

268,STT,"State Street (STT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the market opens on Apr 20. Its quarterly earnings and revenues are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, an increase in revenues drove the company’s operating earnings growth. In fact, the figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, a decline in trading servicing fees was on the downside.State Street boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.4%.Also, activities of the company during the first quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter moved nearly 1% upward to $1.58 over the last 30 days. Also, the figure represents a year-over-year jump of 30.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $3.01 billion for the quarter, reflecting 8.3% year-over-year growth.State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayHigher fee revenues to lend support: Driven by the benefits of the acquired GE Asset Management business, State Street’s management fees are likely to improve. Further, management fees as well as servicing fees are anticipated to witness modest increase, driven by decent equity markets performance, new business wins and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar during the first quarter.Also, significant market volatility is expected support trading revenues. Specifically, foreign exchange trading revenues are likely to improve, given the higher foreign exchange trading volumes and increased volatility.Additionally, with the expansion in the spread between three-month LIBOR and the Fed funds rate, along with an increase in trading volumes, securities lending revenues are expected to trend higher during the quarter. Thus, State Street’s fee revenues are expected to rise in the to-be-reported quarter.Stable net interest income (NII): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $190.3 billion for the quarter represents a decline of 13.2% year over year. Nonetheless, overall lending activities were decent during the first quarter. This, along with higher interest rates will likely boost State Street’s NII. However, lower interest earning assets are likely to offset this gain to some extent.Modest rise in operating expenses: State Street expects operating expenses to rise slightly as compensation benefit expenses will be seasonally higher in the quarter owing to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation from retirement eligible employees as well as payroll taxes.Moreover, the expense level will also be dependent on the revenue backdrop in the quarter and the onboarding of new clients. Nonetheless, State Street Beacon expense savings will offset the rise to some extent during the first quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:State Street does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for State Street is -0.37%.Zacks Rank: State Street has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

269,STT,"During the last earnings season, the Finance sector was one of the best performers. Despite inflation-related issues and rising chances of political uncertainty, we can add some banking stocks to our portfolio based on the banks’ strong fundamentals and solid long-term prospects.With organic and inorganic growth strategies, as well as a strong capital position, M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) appears to be one such stock. The company’s focus on the most attractive business mixes in the banking industry to tackle macroeconomic headwinds and strategic priorities, including core technology infrastructure, is anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.M& T Bank not only beat estimates in Q2, but also has been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its future prospects.

Also, M&T Bank recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 4.66%, over the trailing four quarters.Inorganic Growth Routes: Given its robust liquidity position, M&T Bank is well positioned to grow on the back of acquisitions. The growth has been reflected in the company’s accomplishment of several major acquisitions in and out of the United States, in the last several years. The completion of the merger with Hudson City in November 2015 expanded the company’s retail branch network in the Eastern United States, with access to 135 Hudson branches, situated primarily in New Jersey. Further, product and balance-sheet diversification, stemming from the acquisition, will likely support the company’s top line.Steady Capital Deployment: M&T Bank’s capital deployment activities remain impressive. The company’s 2017 capital plan was approved by the Fed. The plan included share buyback of up to $900 million over the four-quarter period, effective July 2017.

272,STT,"The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $2.43 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Moreover, the bottom line reflected a 24% increase from the prior-year quarter.Continued easing of pressure on net interest margin helped the company earn higher net interest income during the quarter. Though mortgage banking revenues declined, overall non-interest income witnessed year-over-year growth. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent. Further, the results were partially offset by higher provisions. The company’s net income for the quarter was $1.24 billion, up 15.4% from the prior-year quarter.Segment wise, on a year-over-year basis, quarterly net income at Corporate & Institutional Banking and Asset Management improved 20.1% and 44.7%, respectively. Also, net income for the Retail Banking segment increased 3.6%. However, Other, including the BlackRock segment’s net income declined 11.8% from the prior-year quarter.Revenue Growth Offsets Higher ExpensesTotal revenues for the quarter came in at $4.11 billion, rising 6% year over year. However, the reported figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.15 billion.Net interest income was up 9% year over year to $2.36 billion. Also, net interest margin increased 14 basis points to 2.91%.Non-interest income was up 2% year over year to $1.75 billion, driven by higher asset management income, consumer services income, service charges on deposits and other income, partially offset by lower income from residential mortgage.PNC Financial’s non-interest expenses were $2.53 billion, increasing 5% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily due to higher personnel costs.As of Mar 31, 2018, total loans rose 1% sequentially to $221.6 billion. However, total deposits declined slightly to $264.7 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAllowance for loan and lease losses increased 2% year over year to $2.60 billion.

273,STT,"Troubles for Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) seems to have no end. This time they come from a teacher’s union — The American Federation of Teachers (“AFT”) — demanding the bank to restrain itself from providing finance to gun dealers and the National Rifle Association (“NRA”).After the recent tragic incident at a high school that took lives of innocent students and educators, AFT’s President Randi Weingarten raised concerns over Wells Fargo’s connections with the gunmakers and NRA.In a release issued on Apr 7, the union disclosed plans to discontinue the Wells Fargo mortgage program offering to members, if the bank fails to take an appropriate action. The union said, “We’re issuing Wells Fargo an ultimatum—they can have a mortgage market that includes America’s teachers, or they can continue to do business with the NRA and gun manufacturers. They can’t do both.”Exchange Between AFT and Wells Fargo So FarOn Mar 29, Weingarten had sent a letter to the San Francisco-based lender reflecting disappointment over the bank being one of the largest backer to gun companies. Also, she questioned the bank if it provided NRA with a line of credit of $28 million and helped two of the largest gun companies in United States access $431.1 million in loans and bonds.In response, Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer, Tim Sloan, said that the correct way to address these issues would be through political and legislative procedure. Also, he reiterated the bank’s efforts in assisting about 1600 AFT families with home financing in 2017.Further, Sloan extended an invitation to Weingarten for further discussion and added, ""I do not believe that the American public wants banks to decide which legal products consumers can and cannot buy.""Finally, Weingarten reminded Wells Fargo of the steps taken by Dick's Sporting Goods, REI, LL Bean and Kroger against sales of guns. Also, she raised strong oppositions to gun violence and people involved with it by saying, “But no conversation will dissuade us from our view that the NRA and the gun manufacturers need to value people over profits.”Reactions From Other BanksIn March 2018, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) announced changes in the manner the bank would conduct business with gun retailers. In an email statement, it said that new policy retailers must sell firearms only to customers above 21 years of age and they must have passed a background check. Also, these retailers should not sell ""bump stocks"" or high-capacity magazines.Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) are among the banks that have spoken against the gun culture, but so far haven't come out with similar plans.Our ViewpointThe fake accounts fallout had marked the beginning of the bank’s troubles. Despite efforts to maintain financial health, Wells Fargo’s expense base is likely to continue affect its financials for some time, primarily due to high legal costs. Further, this news is likely to negatively impact the sentiments of the bank’s customers and might slightly hurt its revenues.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 4.8% over the past six months against the industry’s rally of 4.4%.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

274,STT,"Joseph L. Hooley, chairman and CEO of State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report), received $16 million as total compensation for 2017, according to a proxy filing. While the amount marks a 26% rise from his pay in 2016, it is also the highest that Hooley has ever earned since becoming CEO in 2010.Per the securities filing, the $16 million includes his salary, stock awards and other incentives. However, it does not include a change in the value of his pension and certain other deferred compensation earnings.Of the total amount that Hooley received, $4.8 million was in the form of non-equity incentive, up from $2.6 million received in 2016. Also, $10.5 million was earned through the exercise and vesting of previously-issued stock options and awards.Some of the other perks that Hooley received as CEO were $37,993 for a car and driver, and $10,000 for home security, per the filing.Notably, as mentioned in the filing, the median compensation of workers of State Street was $82,760. If the change in the value of Hooley’s pension and other deferred compensation earnings are included, his compensation will be 236 times higher than the pay of the median State Street worker.However, as announced by the company, Hooley, who will continue as State Street chairman in 2019, is expected to retire as CEO by the end of this year. Ron O’Hanley, head of the company’s asset management unit will be taking over Hooley’s position as CEO.In the filing, Hooley’s pay package was justified by the fact that, till now, the company has been performing well under his reign and thus, his compensation is well deserved. In fact, under his supervision, the company was able to achieve $150 million in annual pre-tax expense savings in 2017 through its cost-saving initiative, State Street Beacon.Among other banking giants, BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) chairman and CEO, Kelly Stuart King received total $12.67 million as annual compensation for 2017, reflecting a 9.1% rise on a year-over-year basis.

275,STT,"Of the two major pre-election promises made by President Donald Trump, his supporters are on a roll to ease some provisions of an important financial regulation — the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. This follows the achievement of a major milestone in late 2017 in the form of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.The Senate passed the bill on Tuesday backed by majority voting of 67 to 32, promising it to be beneficial for smaller banks. It would now be presented to the House for its requisite approval.Recapitulation of the Dodd-Frank ActAs a response to the 2008 financial crisis, caused partly by improper lending activities and investments by big banks, strict regulations were imposed on them through this law. Banks with assets of more than $50 billion were placed under stricter regulatory scrutiny, which included an annual stress test to prove that they could survive another financial meltdown.Further, a new regulatory board, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was established in order to safeguard consumers against predatory practices by companies offering mortgages, credit cards, student loans and payday loans.Such heightened regulations have kept compliance costs elevated for the banks so far. Also, higher capital requirements might have dampened investment to some extent. Moreover, some large institutions moved operations overseas to less regulated jurisdictions in order to avoid high regulatory costs.How Custody Banks Stand to Benefit From the Proposed Bill?The Dodd-Frank Act contained a provision that required banks to calculate supplementary leverage ratio, considering cash or customer deposits held with the Federal Reserve at the same level of risk as assets like subprime mortgages or junk bonds. It was aimed at keeping banks from taking big risks without proper plans to handle any downturn.However, this rule had a major adverse impact on the custody banks like State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report), Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report). Custody banks safeguard assets and securities of large asset managers, hedge funds and other banks rather than conducting traditional banking activities. Despite sending these deposits to the Fed for safekeeping, these financial institutions had to factor them in while calculating the amount capital it requires to hold.The bill proposed by Senate makes an exception to this rule. It allows the custodian banks to set aside the money they received from clients and immediately sent to the Fed or some other central bank for safety. Thus, it would lead to a comparable reduction in the amount of capital they would require to hold.On the other hand, major banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) that perform custodial functions as part of their business have put forth objections. They want the exception to include all those banks that accept custodial deposits. However, this demand has some lawmakers worrying that these tweaks might be used by banks for their own purposes.Other Key Points in the Bank Deregulation BillThe most controversial change is uplifting of the SIFI threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion. This would result in a reduction in the number of banks considered “too big to fail” that are closely looked after by the Fed, to 12 from 38. Further, it frees banks with less than $10 billion in total assets from the Volcker rule. This rule was made to prevent banks from placing bets with their own money.While some Democrats regard the bill to be compatible with the tax act, some consider it to be “extraordinarily dangerous”. Further, the bill along with the changes made so far have to be approved by the House and Senate once again, before being presented to the President.ConclusionWith this exemption, the custody banks will be able to utilize the excess capital toward expanding their businesses and diversify the product offerings. Also, shareholders of these banks might expect more returns in the form of buybacks and dividends.Of the above-mentioned companies, Citigroup and Northern Trust hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while JPMorgan, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

276,STT,"The Financial Stability Board (FSB) recently issued a list of 30 global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The list comprises names of large banks with extensive global presence whose failure can rattle the global economy.These banks are required to meet the board’s total loss-absorbing capacity standard, which is a measure of the capital these banks need to hold in order to avoid the need for bailouts. They are also segregated into buckets, depending on the extra capital required.Per the list, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) has been regarded as the most dangerous of the 30 banks and is required to hold an extra 2.5% capital. It is the sole bank in the second most critical bucket, with no bank in the top tier.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) moved down to join Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) and HSBC Holdings (HSBC  -  Free Report) which remain in the third bucket. This implies that these banks need to hold 2% extra capital.The next level, which needs banks to have a capital buffer of 1.5%, consists of eight banks. While Credit Suisse (CS  -  Free Report) has been moved down from this bucket, two Chinese banks — Bank of China  and China Construction Bank  have been raised to this rank.The final bucket consists of names such as Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and UBS Group (UBS  -  Free Report).

278,STT,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.8% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is STT due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.State Street Beats on Q1 Earnings as Revenues ImproveState Street’s first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per share handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58. Also, it was 40.9% above the prior-year quarter.Higher net interest income (reflecting rise in interest rates) and fee income (indicating higher trading services income) supported top-line growth. Also, improvement in assets under custody and administration and assets under management (AUM) acted as a tailwind. However, increase in non-interest expenses was an undermining factor.Net income available to common shareholders came in at $605 million, up 35.7% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal revenues were $3.02 billion, increasing 13.2% from the prior-year quarter. Further, the top line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Net interest revenues jumped 29% from the year-ago quarter to $658 million. The rise was mainly driven by higher interest rates, loan growth and increase in client balances. Also, net interest margin increased 26 basis points year over year to 1.43%.Fee revenues grew 7.5% from the prior-year quarter to $2.37 billion. All components of fee income showed improvement except processing fees and other revenues.During the reported quarter, new asset servicing mandates totaled $1.3 trillion.Non-interest expenses were $2.26 billion, up 8.1% on a year-over-year basis. The rise was due to increase in other expense components.As of Mar 31, 2018, total assets under custody and administration were $33.3 trillion, up 11.6% year over year. Moreover, AUM was $2.7 trillion, up 6.6%.Strong Capital and Profitability RatiosUnder Basel III (Advanced approach), estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 12.1% as of Mar 31, 2018, up from 12.0% as of Dec 31, 2017.Return on common equity came in at 12.8% compared with 9.9% in the year-ago quarter.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the reported quarter, State Street repurchased shares worth $350 million. This was part of the company’s 2017 capital plan.State Street BeaconGiven the continued challenging environment, State Street is accelerating its multi-year plan to further digitize its operating environment and create cost efficiencies. The company announced a multi-year plan to accelerate the next phase of its transformation program aimed at generating roughly $550 million in annualized pre-tax savings (from the prior target date of 2020-end) and improve operating basis pre-tax profit margin to 33% by 2020.Moreover, State Street generated $58 million, $150 million and $175 million in pre-tax expense savings in first quarter 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The company now targets to achieve $150 million in annual pre-tax net run rate expense savings in 2018. Also, the company reached its operating basis pre-tax profit margin target of 31% in 2017 (ahead of scheduled 2018-end).In order to implement State Street Beacon, the company anticipates incurring aggregate pre-tax restructuring costs of approximately $300–$400 million.Outlook2018 State Street will be providing financials primarily on GAAP basis this year, while presenting certain non-GAAP measures such as pre-tax margin as well as additional notable items including acquisition restructuring costs in line with industry practice.Starting 2018 on a perspective basis, the new FASI revenue recognition standard takes effect, under which certain costs previously presented on a net basis will now be represented on a gross basis. Hence, management expects revenues and expenses to increase nearly $225 million.Considering the gains on sale, management expects fee revenues to rise in the range of 7-8%, attributable to decent equity market growth and continued low volatility trading divisions.The company anticipates swap cost to moderate as following the changes in the currency mix of balance sheet. Therefore, processing fees and other revenue will be in the range of $35-45 million on a quarterly basis.Further, the company projects positive fee operating leverage in the 75 to 150 basis points range and reflects focus on both investments and expense management. Management expects to see variability across quarters, with continued focus on expense management.NII is anticipated to grow within a range of 10% to 13%, reflecting higher expected interest rates. Further, balance sheet growth will mainly depend on new business and related client deposit activity.In addition, on a GAAP basis effective tax rate is estimated to be in the 15-17% range.Second-Quarter 2018The company expects momentum in NII growth to continue, driven by higher rates.Management expects securities finance, which includes the agency and enhanced custody businesses, to witness seasonal uptick sequentially, albeit at muted levels compared with the year-ago quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter compared to four lower.State Street Corporation Price and Consensus  State Street Corporation Price and Consensus | State Street Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, STT has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for growth and momentum investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

279,STT,"Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) has recently been fined $7.3 million by Hong Kong’s securities regulator. The Securities and Futures Commission said that the bank failed to discharge its duties of conducting proper due diligence as a sponsor for China-based Real Gold Mining Ltd.’s initial public offering (IPO) in 2009.The mining company was banned from trading since 2011 after irregularities were found in its accounting system.Yesterday, the SFC said that the bank “failed to conduct adequate and reasonable due diligence on Real Gold’s customers and properly supervise its staff when carrying out the sponsor work on Real Gold’s listing application”.While conducting interviews with the customers of the mining company, Citigroup -- without verifying their identities -- discussed the numbers that were given by the company.Notably, in case any untrue or misleading statements are found in the offer documents during an IPO, the sponsor is held accountable.Being concerned about poor and insufficient advisory work and the lack of proper due diligence, the SFC conducted investigations on almost 15 firms that acted as sponsors for IPOs in Hong Kong.The SFC stated that Real Gold’s IPO was the only listing application that Citigroup sponsored in Hong Kong. It also noted that the breaches made by the bank were not deliberate.James Griffith, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Citigroup said, “The resolution announced by the SFC does not involve any license suspension and does not place any constraints on Citi’s business activities or on any individual in Hong Kong or elsewhere.”Notably, in March, UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) was banned from sponsoring IPOs in Hong Kong for almost 1.5 years for a sponsor work that it conducted on an IPO in 2009.Citigroup continues to encounter many investigations and lawsuits from investors and regulators. Though the company resolved certain litigations related to the sale of risky mortgage-backed securities and other issues, many of the cases are yet to be resolved.While a diversified business model, focus on core operations, streamlining of international businesses and strategic investments are expected to continue supporting Citigroup’s growth, such legal issues might lead to increased expenses, thereby hurting bottom-line growth.Shares of the company have gained 17.1% in the past year, underperforming 20.4% growth of the industry.Currently, Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks from the same space are Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) and State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report). Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Comerica’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings moved 5.2% upward over the past 60 days.

280,STT,"Year 2018 so far has been marked by increased government borrowing costs. This is especially true as growing inflationary pressure is building up the case for aggressive rate hikes, pushing yields higher. According to CME, there is 51% chance of four interest rates hike this year.The 10-year Treasury yields, which are a key driver of global borrowing costs, jumped to a 7-year high of 3.12%. The latest spike came on the heels of higher oil price, which is back to $80 per barrel level, and upbeat April retail sales. Worries about growing supply of government debt are also causing the spike in yields (read: ETF Strategies to Play the 7-Year High Benchmark Yield).Pros and ConsA rising rate environment is highly beneficial for cyclical sectors like financial, technology, industrials and consumer discretionary. Banks are at the most advantageous position as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. If interest rates rise, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits. Also, insurance companies are able to earn higher returns on their investment portfolio of longer-duration bonds.Higher interest rates usually indicate a healthy economy, which in turn leads to greater consumer power. An improving economy coupled with higher consumer confidence is making the consumer discretionary sector tempting to investors amid higher yields. The technology sector should benefit as rising interest rates usually correlate with an economy that is gaining strength and is expected to grow at a faster pace, leading to increased IT spending (read: 5 Niche Tech ETFs Hitting All-Time Highs).Although higher rates would attract more capital to the country, boosting the U.S. dollar against the basket of other currencies, it would have a huge impact on commodity-linked investments, implying that a rising rate environment will hurt a number of segments. In particular, high dividend paying sectors such as utilities and real estate would be the worst hit, given their higher sensitivity to rising interest rates. Additionally, securities in capital-intensive sectors like telecom would also be impacted by higher rates.Further, higher rates would also result in tighter lending conditions and curtail consumer spending on a wide range of products like cars and houses. This will in turn dent profitability across various segments. Further, businesses will also face higher loan rates over time.Given this, we have highlighted ETFs & stocks from the sectors that will benefit from higher rates and the ones that will be badly impacted.Sectors to WinFinancialsThe ultra-popular Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report), with AUM of $32.9 billion and average daily volume of 61.6 million shares, offers broad exposure to the sector with banks making up for 44.9% of the portfolio.

281,STT,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) recently made an undisclosed investment in Bill.com, the largest business-to-business (B2B) payments network in the U.S. The move is part of the company’s efforts toward enabling its business clients do away with paper checks, and instead make and receive payments electronically.Bill.com’s technology is likely to be integrated into JPMorgan’s digital system by early 2018. The association will benefit the banks’ customers by allowing them to have access to Bill.com’s network comprising almost 2.5 million users.Notably, according to Stephen Markwell, a product strategy head for JPMorgan, though various customers have started making use of electronic payment tools, there is still a huge amount of business payments that are made using checks. In fact, around $4 is spent by companies for printing and handling each check.Hence, once businesses start making and receiving payments electronically, it will save a lot of their time, money and effort, which goes into managing bills manually.Markwell says, “Bill payment is a huge source of pain for businesses,” adding, “Every step of that process is manual, inefficient, error-prone, and ripe for electronification.”However, this is not the first time that JPMorgan is using the expertise of another firm to better serve its clients. In order to make auto purchases easier and to simplify small business lending and mortgage origination, the bank had in the past announced partnerships with firms like Truecar, On Deck Capital Inc. and Roostify.The company’s price performance looks impressive. Its shares have gained 40.6% in a year’s time, outperforming the 34.3% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

282,STT,"Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS  -  Free Report) has received the European Commission’s (EC) consent for an alternative remedy package it had put forth in July 2017, which promises to make U.K.’s small and medium-sized banking market more competitive.The package had been proposed as an alternative to the sale of Williams & Glyn. This divesture was part of the conditions that the EC had imposed on the bank for the £45.5 billion bailout it received during the crisis.What the Remedy Plan EntailsUnder the package, Royal Bank of Scotland would establish a “Capability and Innovation Fund” with £425 million, which would be granted to challenger banks in the U.K. banking and financial technology sectors in order to encourage them to improve their financial stability.Further, the bank will also provide another £350 million to “Incentivized Switching Scheme” which shall grant funds to eligible challenger banks to help them incentivize small business customers to move their accounts and loans from RBS, paid in the form of “dowries” to the receiving bank.Also, if the uptake among customers looking to switch banks is not enough, the bank will provide £50 million more.In order to administer both the funds, an “Independent Body” will be established that would also coordinate activities between the Royal Bank of Scotland and the challenger banks. A contribution of £20 million would be made to meet the operational expenses.The package is expected to be launched in the first half of 2018.The British bank also disclosed that the package is consistent with the £800 million provision it had built in relation to the expected costs.Our ViewpointThe bank would now be able to put behind the bailout and look forward to developing its business. Also, it would be able to distribute excess capital to its shareholders, thus enhancing their value.Shares of Royal Bank of Scotland have gained 24.6% year to date, outperforming the 18.1% rally for the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report), State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and FB Financial Corporation (FBK  -  Free Report).

283,STT,"On Sep 12, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) increased 1.1%, leading gains for the markets on a day when benchmarks hit record highs. Gains for financials and banks in particular were powered by rising Treasury yields. These gains came on the back of a strong selloff in Treasurys on Monday, which occurred after the impact of Hurricane Irma was much lower than feared. Additionally, a widely anticipated North Korean missile test failed to materialize. Replacing these lingering concerns was a couple of encouraging developments. U.S. job openings surged to a record level and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin provided encouraging comments on tax reforms. This indicates that investors’ appetite for risk will only rise in the days to come, leading to a further spike in yields. Adding select bank stocks to your portfolios looks like a profitable option at this time.Geopolitical Fears Subside, Irma Impact Less than FearedUltimately, the impact of Hurricane Irma was less than feared earlier. Also, after a widely anticipated missile test from North Korea failed to materialize, geopolitical tensions subsided substantially. As a result, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note increased by 4.5 basis points to 2.171%, a level not witnessed since August. Yields on the 30-year and 2-year Treasury notes also increased to 2.774% and 1.335%, respectively.Tuesday’s spike in yields followed a strong selloff in Treasurys on Monday. On this occasion, a sharp selloff in bonds ensued with investors forsaking safe-haven assets for riskier investment options. Consequently, the 10-year yield increased to 2.125%, marking the largest single day gain since Jul 25.Tuesday’s increase takes the weekly increase for the 10-year Treasury note to more than 11 basis points. The rise in yields boosted the likes of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) which gained 2.2% and 1.2%, respectively. Since banks lend over the long term and borrow for shorter periods, an increase in the long-term yield is beneficial for them. This boosts net interest margin, an important profitability metric for the banking sector.Job Openings Data, Mnuchin Interview Raises OptimismAn increase in rates and better prospects for the banking sector are generally accepted as a sign of economic strength. Data released on Sep 12 seemed to back such an inference, with U.S. job openings hitting a record level in July. With the metric increasing from 6.12 million to 6.17 million in July, job openings have now exceeded the 6 million mark for two successive months. This is first such occurrence since the inception of this particular Department of Labor report. Additionally, data from the Census Bureau has revealed a significant year-over-year increase in income levels.Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has offered encouraging comments about tax reform efforts. Speaking at an investment conference in New York, Mnuchin said he was hoping that the Republican Party would be able to push tax reforms through Congress within this year.Further, he revealed that the Trump administration may seek to backdate the benefits of such reform to the beginning of the current year. Such comments provide a firm basis for a further rise in yields.Our ChoicesWith the abatement of geopolitical and weather related tensions, investors are looking to reap stronger profits from relatively riskier assets. Encouraging developments regarding the economy are also helping to stoke such optimism.A selloff in bonds is resulting in a spike in yields, which bodes well for banks. Picking up banking stocks looks like a smart option at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) offers a wide variety of commercial and retail banking and mortgage-lending financial services.Zions Bancorp has expected earnings growth of 41.3% for the current year.

284,STT,"State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) is well poised for growth, given its global network, wide range of innovative products and services, sturdy capital position and easing margin pressure. Shares of the company have gained 18.2% so far this year, outperforming the 8.9% rally for the industry it belongs to.However, the company’s expenses have been increasing for the last few years. Elevated expenses are likely to hurt bottom-line growth in the near term.Notably, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has remained stable in the last seven days. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at the fundamentals, State Street’s revenues have increased at a CAGR of 1.5% over the past five years (2012–2016), primarily driven by higher management fees and securities finance income. Moreover, revenues are expected to continue rising, given the company’s continued investment in new products and the acquisition of GE Asset Management.Also, with the economic recovery and the gradual change in rate environment, pressure on State Street’s net interest margin (NIM) seems to be easing. Given the optimistic view on future rate hikes, the company’s margin is expected to improve further, thereby supporting top-line growth.Moreover, with a stable capital position and impressive earnings strength, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, continuously rising expenses remain a major concern for the company. Expenses have witnessed at a five-year (2012–2016) CAGR of 4.1%, primarily due to an increase in compensation, and acquisition and restructuring costs.

285,STT,"The long wait for relief of regulatory burden may finally be over. While the Trump administration continues to push for the reversal the Dodd Frank Act, a bipartisan agreement announced on Monday came as a breather. This is expected to pave the way for significant changes and bring major relief to banks.Highlights of the AgreementThe major relief from the plan, unveiled by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, is likely to come in the form of reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill aims to raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 40. Thus, the banks including SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief.The move is expected to not only lower regulatory compliance costs but also lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Per the plan put forward under the bipartisan deal, banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief once the bill is enacted while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later.Further, the bill gives authority to the Federal Reserve to fast-track the exemption. Notably, the Fed will be required to conduct stress test for banks in the $100-$250 billion range periodically.For several regional banks with more than $250 million in assets, the bill is not so important. Some of these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) banks like The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp, though functioning as community banks, will stay subjected to stricter regulations. This will put them in a disadvantageous position to some extent in terms of lower costs.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other BenefitsThe bill also has something to offer to the smaller community banks and credit unions with total assets of less than $10 billion. These will be exempted from implementing Volcker Rule (prevents proprietary trading) and from following stringent capital and liquidity rules as long as leverage ratio is in the range of 8-10%. Also, it aims to ease mortgage rules for small banks.Moreover, the bill is expected to be beneficial to trust and custodial banks like State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report). There is a provision that prevents deposits held at the Fed by such banks to be included in calculating the supplementary leverage ratio. This will aid these companies in clearing the annual stress tests.Reactions & Road AheadBankers and the overall banking industry cheered the deal. The KBW Regional Banking Index closed the day 1.3% higher.Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association in a statement said, “While this legislation could go much further, ABA still views this bipartisan bill as an important first step in right-sizing the rules for America’s banks.”Further, Crapo said, “The bipartisan proposals on which we have agreed will significantly improve our financial regulatory framework and foster economic growth by right-sizing regulation, particularly for smaller financial institutions and community banks.”Nonetheless, the road ahead is expected to be bumpy. The deal is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations.Still, it is the most important step taken by the Senate to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth. Also, it is critical in securing the support that was lacking from the earlier efforts to lessen undue regulatory burden.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

286,STT,"On Nov 13, we issued an updated research report on Sallie Mae (SLM  -  Free Report). The company continues to benefit from its dominant position in the student lending market. Also, its focus on strengthening Private Education Loan assets and revenues bodes well. However, escalating expenses remain a headwind.The student lender reported in-line earnings in third-quarter 2017. The results reflected higher net interest income along with considerable growth in loans and deposit balance. However, higher expenses and lower non-interest income were on the downside.Sallie Mae shares have gained 4.2% over the past year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 6.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-year earnings have remained stable at 72 cents over the past 60 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Loan originations have increased 8% in 2016, with the trend continuing in the first six months of 2017. Thus, the company seems on track to achieve originations of about $4.9 billion in 2017. Also, management expects to improve efficiency ratio through prudent expense management and growth in service portfolio loans.Modest growth in demand for educational loans comes as a tailwind for the lender. However, with the economic recovery, Sallie Mae should be able to maintain a leading position in the student lending market.Sallie Mae’s expenses have witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 12.1% over a period of five years (ended 2016).Also, the company remains highly dependent on the broker deposits as a major source of financing. Moreover, the generation of deposits from non-brokered channels takes time. Thus, this significant exposure to just one source of funding remains a concern.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report),Washington Federal (WAFD  -  Free Report) and FB Financial Corporation (FBK  -  Free Report).

287,STT,"Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) CEO Tim Sloan announced plans to regain trust the bank has lost due to its involvement in several malpractices lately, at the global conference held by Barclays (BCS  -  Free Report) last Tuesday. Also, he disclosed that the bank is planning to achieve an additional $2 billion reduction in expenses by the end of 2019.The bank is in the process of achieving its previous savings goal of $2 billion by year-end 2018. It seeks to achieve the target majorly by streamlining human resource, marketing, technology and operations departments. Further, it aims to close about 450 branches by 2018.For 2017, the bank expects third party expenses, including those related to sales practices, to remain high in the third quarter, while decline in fourth quarter. Also, efficiency ratio is expected to be below last three-quarter level.Regarding lending activities, Sloan said the bank is expected to witness continued decline in auto loans along with run off of the junior lien mortgage portfolio. Further, the lending is to be impacted by a slow and increasingly competitive commercial and commercial real estate lending environment. The decline in loans is to be partially offset by growth in non-conforming residential first mortgage.The revelation of fake account scandal that marked the starting point for the several problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in auto insurance business and online bill pay services.Tim Sloan reiterated several structural and strategic remedial measures undertaken by the bank. Elimination of sales goals, a layer of management and introduction of training for retail bank managers on acceptable sales practices were some of the steps taken.We expect Wells Fargo’s focus on managing its business and efforts to remediate the wrong doings in the past to uplift its reputation. Also, its expense saving initiatives are likely to support its financials.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 6.4% year to date, versus the industry’s rally of 4.1%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same space are State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

288,STT,"With strong fundamentals and organic growth prospects, Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) appears to be an attractive pick now. In addition, interest rate hikes and improving economy are anticipated to further improve profitability.Analysts seem to be optimistic about the company’s prospects as the stock has been witnessing upward estimate revisions. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has risen nearly 7.5% to $23.27. Backed by these upward estimate revisions, the company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Additionally, Goldman’s shares have rallied 12% over the past year compared with 35.7% growth recorded by the industry.With $974 billion in assets as of Mar 31, 2018, Goldman’s strengths include effective cost management, business diversification and steady capital-deployment activities.6 Reasons Why Goldman is a Golden Egg  Revenue Growth: Goldman continues to make steady progress toward improving its top line. The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 9.18% (as against 5.35% industry average) indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Earnings Per Share Strength: Earnings are anticipated to display an upswing in the near term, as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 17.77%. In addition to this, Goldman recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 18.13%, over the trailing four quarters.Prudent Expense Management: Goldman has been benefiting from its successful expense-reduction initiatives for the past several years. Though expenses have witnessed a volatile trend in the last few years, the figure declined significantly in 2016, but increased 3% in 2017 and 21% in first-quarter 2018. Notably, the company carried out an expense initiative during the first half of 2016, which translated into run-rate expense savings of around $700 million. It continued this initiative in the second half of 2016 as well, and generated nearly $900 million of run-rate savings. Notably, Goldman’s $5 billion of growth initiatives is expected to drive an incremental $2.5 billion in annual pre-tax earnings, at a 30% marginal ROE.Diversification: While overall revenues have been affected by unfavorable market conditions in the last few quarters, Goldman remains well positioned for growth, backed by its sound investment banking operations and solid client franchise. In traditional banking, a diversified product portfolio has higher chances of sustaining growth than many other banks.Notably, Goldman has been undertaking initiatives to fortify the GS Bank’s business by acquiring the online deposit platform of GE Capital Bank in April 2016. It also launched a digital consumer lending platform — Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Additionally, the company is likely to benefit from its exposure to the fast growing exchange-traded funds (ETF) market.Steady Capital Deployment: Goldman remains focused on managing its capital levels efficiently and has consistently enhanced shareholders’ value with steady capital-deployment activities. The company’s 2017 capital plan won regulatory approval that includes share buybacks and an increase in its quarterly common stock dividend, along with the issuance and redemption of other capital securities. In April 2018, the company increased its common stock dividend by 6.7%.Stock is Undervalued: Goldman has a P/E ratio of 10.38 compared to the industry average of 15.66. Further, the company has a P/B ratio of 1.26 compared to the industry average of 1.87. Based on these ratios, the stock seems undervalued.Bottom LineOrganic growth, expense management, robust capital position and steady capital-deployment activities continue to support Goldman’s growth opportunities. Furthermore, business diversification remains a key strength for earnings stability.Other Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

289,STT,"As part of its 2017 capital plan (approved by the Federal Reserve), M&T Bank Corporation’s (MTB  -  Free Report) board of directors announced a 7% hike in the company’s quarterly common stock dividend. The revised quarterly dividend now comes in at 80 cents per share compared with the previous figure of 75 cents. This dividend will be paid on Jun 29 to shareholders of record as of Jun 1, 2018.Since the financial crisis, M&T Bank has raised its dividend twice. From paying 70 cents a share as quarterly dividend during the financial crisis, the company has come a long way in displaying its capital strength. Prior to this hike, the company had raised its dividend by 7% (from 70 cents to 75 cents per share) in February 2017.Considering Tuesday’s closing price of $184.39 per share, the dividend yield is currently valued at 1.74%.Alongside, the company has an impressive share-repurchase plan. The company’s 2017 capital plan included share buyback of up to $900 million, over the four-quarter period, effective July 2017. Notably, the company recently announced an additional share-buyback plan of up to $745 million as well.Investors interested in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock can have a look at the bank’s fundamentals and growth opportunities.Revenue Growth: M&T Bank continues to make steady progress toward bolstering its revenues. Since 2008, the company has recorded a consistent rise in net interest income. Over the last five years (ended 2017), it has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 9%, with the trend continuing into first-quarter 2018 as well.The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 4.47% indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Earnings Per Share Strength: Earnings are anticipated to display an upswing in the near term, as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 33.9% compared to the industry average rate of 30%. Also, M&T Bank recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.96%, over the trailing four quarters.Inorganic Growth Routes: Given its robust liquidity position, M&T Bank is well positioned to grow on the back of acquisitions. The company’s accomplishment of several major acquisitions in and out of the United States, in the last several years, indicates its impressive growth momentum.  Completion of the merger with Hudson City in November 2015 expanded the company’s retail branch network in the Eastern United States, with access to 135 Hudson branches, situated primarily in New Jersey. Further, product and balance-sheet diversification, stemming from the acquisition, will likely support the company’s top line.Strong Leverage: M&T Bank’s debt/equity ratio is valued at 0.59 compared to the industry average of 0.92, indicating relatively lower debt burden. It highlights the financial stability of the company even in adverse economic conditions.Impressive Price Performance: Shares of M&T Bank have jumped 15.3% in the last six months, outperforming the 9.5% gain of the industry.Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 30 days.

290,STT,"On May 15, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note jumped to touch its highest point since 2011. The immediate trigger for this jump was an increase in April retail sales. Data of this nature was indicative of the U.S. consumer’s strong purchasing power. Further, reports emerged that trade tensions between the United States and China were likely to continue. Trade-related tensions are likely to boost prices higher, which would depress bonds and boost yields. Though such an occurrence could weigh on broader markets, financials stocks, particularly banks would be benefited. This is because a spike in rates increases the yield spread for banks. Adding banking stocks to your portfolios looks like a smart option at this point. Benchmark Yield Climbs as Retail Sales IncreaseOn Tuesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note increased by 7.5 basis points to 3.070%. This is the highest level achieved since July 2011. It also marks the biggest single-day increase since March 1. Further, the yield also hit an intra-day peak of 3.093%. Notably, the day’s gains lifted the yield spread between the 10-year and 2-year rate to 48.5 basis points.The immediate trigger for the jump in the benchmark yield was bullish retail sales data for April. Retail sales increased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.3% in April from March, according to the Commerce Department. March sales were, in fact, revised to show a 0.8% advance instead of 0.6%.Trade Tensions Likely to Remain High, Banks to GainAlso boosting the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was the resurgence of trade-related tensions.  Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China commented on Tuesday the United States and China remain “very far apart” on settling trade-related disputes. Branstad’s views were in line with comments made by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on May 14.Tensions emanating from such a dispute can boost inflation levels and erode the value of fixed-income securities, thus pushing up yields higher. A sector which could immediately benefit from higher yield levels is banking.Shares of banks are bolstered by higher interest rates in the form of an uptick in bond yields. Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. (Read: Resurgence of 10-Year Bond Yield: Winners & Losers)Our ChoicesThe rise in benchmark yield levels is primarily an outcome of encouraging retail sales numbers and the resurfacing of trade-related tensions. While unemployment is at a record low, a quick resolution to the trade dispute looking increasingly. This is why such inflationary pressures are unlikely to dissipate in the near-term.Adding banking stocks to your portfolios looks like a profitable option at this time. This is because they are likely to benefit from the widening of the yield spread.

291,STT,"Expected slump in trading business is likely to adversely affect The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (GS  -  Free Report) third-quarter earnings, to be reported on Oct 17. Moreover, the bank is anticipated to record year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues.Goldman’s second-quarter 2017 results recorded a positive earnings surprise of 17.6%, driven by higher equities revenues and low expenses. However, lower fixed income revenues thwarted the bottom line. Notably, the quarter witnessed challenging market-making environment, reduced levels of volatility and low client activity levels.This earnings beat translated into impressive price movement for the company. During the three-month period ended Sep 30, shares of Goldman gained 6.9%.Will the upswing in stock price continue post third-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to beat on earnings this time. Notably, Goldman recorded positive earnings surprise in three of the last four trailing quarters as depicted below:Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t call for an earnings beat this time around. A stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at $4.31. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Goldman’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsMarket Volatility: Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. Therefore, the company is likely to be affected by the subdued volatility experienced during the quarter.Top-line Pressure: Reduction in equity issuance and feeble equity trading volumes are expected to negatively influence fee revenue growth this time around. Nevertheless, persistent rise in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) will likely provide some respite. Though continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support the bottom-line numbers, Goldman might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the to-be-reported quarter.Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As globally increased during the quarter. Notably, in the third quarter, Goldman acted as an advisor and helped closed M&A deals worth over $300 billion. Therefore, M&A advisory fees for the bank are expected to lend support to revenues.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $7.64 billion, down 6.5% year over year.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to elevated interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, as well as consumer — might perk up interest income.Strong Expense Management: Goldman completed an expense initiative during the first half of 2016 which translated into run-rate expense savings of around $1.6 billion in 2016. The bank is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. Thus, continuation of expense management is likely to aid bottom-line expansion in the coming quarters.Notably, this banking giant’s performance was inadequate to win analysts’ confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate decreased slightly to $4.31, over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

292,STT,"The matter of Janet Yellen’s succession has been troubling experts and individual investors alike over the past few weeks. With President Trump nearly certain to nominate Fed governor Jerome Powell as the central bank’s next Chairman, it is important to consider what his approach toward heading this crucial institution would be like.Such considerations gain greater importance when you reckon that he is an outsider of sorts, yet largely likely to follow in Yellen’s footsteps on policy matters.Powell Likely to Continue on Yellen’s PathAn establishment insider for an extended period and a lawyer by training, Powell would be the first Fed Chair since the legendary Paul Volcker not to possess a doctorate in economics. However, he tends to focus on the details, having the reputation of walking into meetings with a mass of material.The former under-secretary has also had the opportunity to oversee all of the Fed’s 12 regional banks. Such vast administrative experience will stand him in good stead when he takes over the most coveted job in the world of economics.Powell is largely expected to stick to the policy path which Yellen has taken. Though he has not taken on a very public role during his tenure at the Fed, he has largely backed Yellen’s strategy of gradually raising rates. This is the approach that he is likely to maintain as the Fed Chair.Predictable but Good for Business?And yet, market watchers and industry experts at large believe that he will be good for the United States’ business environment. His predilection for deregulation has been known for some time now with Powell often emerging as the only voice opposing excessive regulation. Powell has stressed on several occasions that excessive regulations, however well intentioned, may end up preventing the economy from achieving its full potential.So the former private equity executive will likely emerge as a voice of moderation given Trump’s continuous assaults on allegedly burdensome regulations holding back much needed credit flow. What is likely to ultimately emerge is a Fed Chair who sticks to Yellen’s path on monetary stimulus yet loosens banking regulations.In fact one criticism of Powell is that he has more experience on regulation than on monetary policy. But this could actually work to his advantage in the Trump era where regulations are viewed as an unnecessary encumbrance to progress. In the past Powell has said that he is in favor of making changes to regulations. Such an approach is likely to favor financial stocks, in particular, banks.Bank Stocks to WatchWith Trump already having taken several steps to loosen regulations, the appointment of Powell could be another shot in the arm for the financial industry.

294,STT,"On Aug 23, we issued an updated research report on Sallie Mae (SLM  -  Free Report). The company’s profitability continues to be curbed by escalating expenses. Also, it faces concentration risk due to over dependence on broker deposits as a key source of funding.  The student lender reported in-line earnings in second-quarter 2017. The results reflected higher net interest income along with improved loans and deposit balance. However, higher expenses and lower non-interest income were on the downside.Sallie Mae shares have lost 6.4% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 6.2%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-year earnings have been revised 1.4% downward over the past 60 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Sallie Mae’s expenses have witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 12.1% over a period of five years (ended 2016).The company remains dependent on the broker deposits as a major source of financing.

Thus, this significant exposure to a source of funding remains a concern.Nevertheless, the loan originations have increased 8% in 2016, with the trend continuing in the first six months of 2017.

295,STT,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) remains well positioned for organic growth, supported by a rise in loan and deposit balances. Also, easing margin pressure should aid its top-line growth in the upcoming quarters.However, the company’s expenses remain elevated, which might curb profitability growth. Also, its significant exposure to risky loan portfolios remains a concern.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings has been revised 1.4% downward over the past 30 days. The stock currently carries just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at the fundamentals, the company’s loans and leases have increased at a CAGR of 5.2% in the last five years (2012–2016). Also, non-interest bearing deposits have increased at a three-year (2014-2016) CAGR of 14.3%.Moreover, the company has also been relying on a number of strategic acquisitions to grow inorganically.The company has an efficient share repurchase and dividend payment policy in place. Supported by a solid capital position, it should continue to enhance shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.Further, with the interest rate environment improving gradually, BB&T’s margin pressure seems to be easing. This is expected to aid its top-line growth. Notably, following the latest Fed rate hike, the company raised its prime lending rate to 4.25%.However, the company’s expenses have increased at a CAGR of 3.6% over the last five years (as of the end of 2016). Given that it plans to continue with its acquisitions and mergers in the future, expenses are expected to remain elevated, thereby hurting bottom-line growth.Also, the company’s significant exposure to commercial, direct retail lending and residential mortgage loan portfolios pose risks. Although it has been successfully disposing assets, it still holds a large amount of risky loans that could pose a problem in case of further deterioration in macro-economic conditions.BB&T’s shares have gained 21.2% in a year’s time, underperforming the 30.8% growth for the industry it belongs to. Given these concerns, the stock’s movement is expected to be range-bound in the near term.Mentioned below are a few better-ranked stocks from the finance space:Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 8.9% for the current year over the past 30 days.

296,STT,"On Sep 11, we issued an updated research report on Hercules Capital, Inc. (HTGC  -  Free Report). The company has been benefiting from increasing loan originations and a solid liquidity position. Also, its capital deployment activities are encouraging. However, mounting expenses remain a major concern.Shares of Hercules Capital have lost 14.3% year to date compared with the industry’s marginal decline.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings have remained stable at $1.18 over the last 30 days. Thus, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Growth DriversWith the improving economic conditions, Hercules Capital is likely to witness growth in demand for financing from private equity firms and venture capitalists in the near term. The company originated nearly $397 million of debt and equity commitments to new and existing portfolio companies in the first half of 2017. Such robust loan originations position it well for growth.Further, Hercules Capital’s steady capital deployment activities continue to enhance investors’ confidence. Back in 2009, its board of directors adopted a policy to distribute four quarterly dividends in an amount approximating 90-100% of the company’s taxable income. Also, management revisits its dividend policy at the end of every quarter in order to ensure if any special dividend needs to be paid or not. Moreover, the company’s favorable debt/equity ratio when compared to the broader industry makes these activities sustainable.Higher Costs a DragHowever, increasing operating expenses is a matter of concern for the company. Costs have risen at a CAGR of 7.5% over the last four years (ended 2016). Continued increase in compensation costs is mainly attributable to this rise. Also, the company’s aim to expand originations is likely to keep expenses elevated in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

297,STT,"At the Barclays Plc Investors Conference in New York on Monday, Citigroup Inc.’s (C  -  Free Report) chief financial officer, John Gerspach, announced the company’s latest outlook for the third quarter. The bank expects third-quarter 2017 trading revenues to fall 15% year over year, affected by low volatility in markets.Volatility remains “somewhat subdued,” noted Gerspach at the conference. “For the whole third quarter you really don’t know what happens until you figure out what the operating environment is in September,” he further added.In the second quarter also, trading revenues suffered due to low volatility (down 5% year over year). Last year’s trading results had improved on higher client activity levels, as investors bet on prospects of the U.S. election and the Brexit vote. However, the last three weeks of the current quarter are expected to report a turnaround.Further, in August, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) CFO Martin Chavez and in July, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) hinted the same view.Other ExpectationsCitigroup expects net credit-card losses to worsen in 2017 from its prior expectations. Rate in the branded-cards business is likely to be 285 basis points (bps), up from the previous projection of 280 bps. Also, in the retail-services business, rate is expected to rise to 470 bps from the prior projection of 460 bps. “Very, very small increases in the NCL rates, but obviously even small increases in the NCL rate do have an impact on our reserving actions,” Gerspach said.Our ViewpointAn improving economic backdrop and optimism surrounding the interest-rate hike are supporting banks’ financials. Though banks are expected to remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities in the near term, cost containment efforts are noticeable.Currently, Citigroup carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).

298,STT,"Recently, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) marked its presence in the U.K. consumer lending market by making an investment of £100 million in Neyber, a start-up loan provider. The loans the company provides are repaid through the borrowers’ salaries. The news was reported by Financial Times.Brief on NeyberFounded in 2014, by two former employees of Goldman Sachs, Neyber collaborates with companies in order to offer loans at rates lower than other lenders. Per the article, Neyber is in business with companies such as City Airport, Anglian Water, Bupa, some National Health Service trusts and is also in talks with some of the retailers and professional services firms.The company remains confident of its structure and expects low default rate, as the repayments are made directly out of salaries of the borrowers. Neyber is said to have provided about 7000 loans of up to £25,000 each, and has faced nearly 30 defaulters as of now. Further, it claims to have saved borrowers nearly £14 million in interest payments.Goldman Sachs Investment in NeyberGoldman Sachs provided £100 million of debt and equity financing to Neyber through its private capital unit, which seeks to finance medium-sized companies. This resulted in Goldman Sachs becoming a minority investor in Neyber.Other Venture Plans in UKGoldman Sachs is planning to expand throughout the U.K. by launching an online deposit business in mid-2018.

299,STT,"On Sep 8, we issued an updated research report on BankUnited, Inc. (BKU  -  Free Report). The company remains committed to boost its top line by increasing the proportion of low-cost deposits. Also, it has a geographically well-diversified loan portfolio. However, increasing expenses and pressure on margins are major concerns.Shares of BankUnited have lost 17.5% year to date, versus the industry’s marginal growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings have remained stable at $2.40 over the last 30 days. Thus, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In order to ease pressure on the top line, BankUnited has been concentrating on increasing the proportion of non-interest bearing demand deposits. These low-cost deposits have witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% over the last three years (ended 2016).BankUnited’s loan portfolio is geographically well diversified. Further, it continues to take initiatives to maintain a healthy loan portfolio by reducing the concentration of risky residential loans, which are affected by volatility in the housing sector.However, BankUnited’s mounting expenses remain a key concern. It witnessed a five-year (ended 2016) CAGR of 17.7%. Expenses are likely to remain high in the near term, on expectations of a rise in funding costs and M&A activities. Further, management expects operating expenses to rise at the high single-digit rate in 2017.Also, the company’s net interest margin (NIM) continues to decline despite three rate hikes by the Fed since December 2016, because of its liability sensitive balance sheet. NIM declined to 3.73% in 2016 from 6.21% in 2011, with the trend continuing in first half of 2017. The company expects NIM to remain under pressure in 2017 due to run-off of the covered loans, rising deposits cost and a flatter yield curve.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report), State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and FB Financial Corporation (FBK  -  Free Report).

Also, the figure was up 26.7% year over year.Higher net interest income (reflecting rise in interest rates) and fee income supported the results.

302,STT,"State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Oct 23. Its earnings and revenues are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, an increase in revenues drove the company’s operating earnings growth. In fact, the number outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher expenses were the downside.State Street boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 8.7%.Moreover, activities of the company during the third quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter increased 1.3% over the last 30 days. Also, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 19.4%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $2.95 billion for the quarter, reflecting 12.7%  year-over-year growth.State Street’s fundamental strength has supported a 25.5% year-to-date rally of the stock, significantly outperforming the 9.8% growth of the industry it belongs to.State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q3 earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of State Street beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for State Street is +0.27%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.62 is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61.Zacks Rank: State Street has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsImprovement in Net Interest Income (NII): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earnings assets of $194.5 billion for the quarter represents a decline of nearly 3.8% year over year. Nevertheless, overall lending witnessed modest improvement in the quarter. Thus, loan growth coupled with higher interest rates is expected to boost the company’s NII.Moreover, the company expects net interest margin (NIM) in the quarter to expand 3-5 basis points, given the Fed rate hike in June. Thus, higher NIM should further lead to an improvement in interest income.Muted Fee Revenue Growth: In the last quarter, the company witnessed an improvement in management fees on a year-over-year basis, driven by the benefits of the acquired GE Asset Management business. We expect a similar trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, due to seasonality, the company expects growth in trading services revenue to remain muted. Further, securities finance revenue is anticipated to decrease sequentially. Thus, overall fee revenue is not expected to witness much improvement in the quarter.Expenses to Remain Stable: Although the benefits of the company’s cost-saving initiatives through State Street Beacon are not expected to be realized much in the quarter, the same is likely to partly offset expenses to support new business, continued business investments, and merit and depreciation increases.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Legg Mason, Inc.

304,STT,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 13, before the opening bell. Its earnings are likely to improve year over year, but revenues might decline.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been much in the news following the sales scam that came into light in September 2016. The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business and online bill pay services.Therefore, the bank has been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.Wells Fargo has undertaken a number of steps to restore its reputation, post scandal. Recently, at a heated senator meeting, Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer — Timothy Sloan — vigorously tried defending America’s third-largest bank for its past wrongdoings amid a volley of questions raised by the senators.Sloan apologized for causing its customers trouble and promised to take appropriate steps to make it a better bank in the times to come. The bank still has a long way to go before it can put all these troubles behind and focus on improving its performance.Amid such adversities, shares of Wells Fargo have gained just around 1% so far, this year, significantly lagging 10.5% growth recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release exert more pressure on the stock? Notably, Wells Fargo delivered an earnings beat in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.99%. However, our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat in the third quarter.Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteA stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.06. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsExpenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo may record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Notably, management projects technology costs to remain at an elevated level in the third quarter, before declining in the fourth quarter. Wells Fargo anticipates the efficiency ratio to be in the range of 60-61%, but the company is targeting around $4 billion of cost savings by year-end 2019.Notably, legal costs related to sales scam scandal might also escalate expenses for the bank.Mortgage Business to Surge:  Wells Fargo — one of the largest mortgage lenders in the nation — might record rise in mortgage banking revenues. Higher mortgage banking is expected on stronger origination volumes. However, the bank projects decline in the auto portfolio to reflect lower origination volumes. Management tightened credit underwriting standards in response to early signs of rising delinquencies in the industry and declining used car values. As a result, the quality of originations has improved and the company expects the size of the auto portfolio to decline persistently in 2017.Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment.Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter. Particularly, growth in commercial and consumer loans, with slowdown in commercial real estate loans is expected. However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue in the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Notably, the bank is cutting back its auto lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

305,STT,"The Q3 earnings season is just around the corner and investors are eagerly awaiting the results of banks that have been in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons.While investors’ optimism over the Fed’s plans to unwind its giant balance sheet and keep raising interest rates should drive bank stocks higher in the upcoming months, Q3 results are not expected to be overwhelming.This is because, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance Sector's total earnings) are expected to witness 5.1% year-over-year decline in earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This compares with 10% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article).Reduction in equity issuance, feeble equity trading volumes and subdued volumes of M&A’s are expected to negatively impact fee income growth for banks this time around. However, a persistent rise in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) and stability of fixed income trading flows will likely provide some respite.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer might energize interest income for banks.Credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards. Though a continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support the bottom-line numbers, banks might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the third quarter.On the cost front, while the absence of considerable legal expenses is positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Selecting the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are unlikely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. Therefore, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.5 Major Banks Set for Earnings SurprisesHere are five major regional bank stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming announcements:Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

309,STT,"On Sep 4, we issued an updated research report on M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report). The bank currently displays strength in top-line and capital position. However, increasing cost base remains a woe.M&T Bank’s net interest income has been rising consistently, recording a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 7.7% over the last six years (ended 2016). Reduced margin pressure on the back of rate hikes will also benefit the bank.  M&T Bank continues to enhance shareholders’ value through steady capital deployment activities. It raised the common stock dividend by 7% in February 2017 and plans another hike in second-quarter 2018 in the range of 5 cents to 80 cents per share. The bank also has a share repurchase program of up to $900 million underway. These activities look impressive due to M&T Bank’s favorable debt/equity ratio when compared to the broader industry.However, M&T Bank’s consistently rising cost base remains a major concern.

(SAN  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) are already involved with UBS on the development of this digital currency. The project has reached that period of development, in which the banksare working on strengthening their data privacy and cyber security protections. Discussions with the central bank and regulators are on and are expected to continue over the next 12 months, after which it is expected to “go live” at the end of 2018.The main intention behind launching this is to allow financial groups to exchange money without waiting for physical money transfers, which takes a lot more time. Digital coins could be exchanged for cash at central banks and thus help in cutting costs for the banks.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

312,STT,"An appeal has been made by the AFL-CIO to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to look for possible insider trading in a particular transaction. This transaction involved trading of Navient Corporation (NAVI  -  Free Report) shares just before the U.S. Department of Education’s resolve to end all decision-sharing agreements with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) was made public.On Aug 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Education had sent a letter to the CFPB, informing them that the Education Department would no longer provide them with any information that they needed to supervise student loan companies.This announcement was beneficial for all student loan contractors, especially Navient, which has continuously been the CFPB’s target for abusive student lending practices. The CFPB had filed a lawsuit against the company in January for “cheating many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans.”Once the decision-sharing bond between the Education Department and the CFPB is cut, it could put this lawsuit in risk. This in turn would benefit Navient in the future.The Congress made the news public only on Sep 1. However, in the hours between the CFPB being informed about the policy change and the Congress making the news public, nearly 900,000 shares of Navient were purchased.The letter sent by the labor union to the SEC mentions that the trades were carried out in three large blocks. The 900,000 shares that were purchased by some unknown investors at or after the close of the markets on Aug 31 represented nearly 24% of the day’s total trading volume. Per the AFL-CIO, each share was purchased at $13.20. Once the trading was complete, just before the public disclosure of the news, shares of the company had risen more than 4%.The AFL-CIO said in the letter, “News that the U.S. Department of Education had terminated its [memorandum of understanding] with the CFPB should have been considered material, non-public information until the House Committee on Education and the Workforce issued its press release on Sept. 1.”However, the SEC has declined to make any comments regarding the appeal made by the AFL-CIO, while Patricia Christel, a spokeswoman for Navient said that the company did not have any prior information about the policy shift before it was made public.Shares of the company have lost 11.6% over the past year compared with 20% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the finance space are The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD  -  Free Report), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

313,STT,"The projected decline in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) trading revenue will likely deal a major blow to its third-quarter earnings given significant dependence of its top line on this source. But this might not lead the company to report dismal results on Oct 12. Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — particularly investment banking — may overshadow the trading gloom.The stock, which recently showed strength on investors’ optimism over potential tax reforms as well as the Fed’s plans to unwind its giant balance sheet and keep increasing interest rates, may not take a hit due to the damage caused by the slump in trading revenue. This is because the bad news has already been factored out.Moreover, though market volatility has not improved much since last quarter, the huge year-over-year decline in trading revenue — highest since 2011 — will primarily be attributable to comparison with a quarter, which had witnessed higher-than-usual volatility due to the Brexit aftermath and the impending U.S. presidential election.While the momentum in investment banking business is likely to continue, growth in commercial and industrial loans as well as consumer lending should lend support to revenues.However, we do not expect major support from lower expenses to the bottom line this time around, as JPMorgan doesn’t have enough scope to reduce expenses further. If fact, there were some legal expenses in the quarter.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has not been revised over the last seven days, the trend over the last 30 days depict pessimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has been revised 1.2% downward over the last 30 days to $1.67, with four out of eight estimates moving lower and one moving higher. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 5.6%.Decreasing earnings estimates increase the chance of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:JPMorgan doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is -0.53%. Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, but this alone isn’t enough to increase the chance of an earnings beat.JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and Consensus JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and Consensus | JPMorgan Chase & Co. QuoteHere is what should be at play:Major slump in trading revenue: Third quarter appears to be more disappointing for JPMorgan in terms of trading business than the past several quarters, as indicated by CEO Jamie Dimon with his projection of about a 20% year-over-year decline in trading revenue. Similar to last quarter, a slump in fixed-income revenue is primarily responsible for this decline.While this decline is primarily attributable to higher-than-usual volatility in the year-ago quarter, trading activities remained sluggish in the to-be-reported quarter in the absence of any tangible development on the reforms proposed by the Trump administration and lesser geopolitical tensions. Also, an unchanged monetary policy standpoint of the Fed did not contribute to volatility for the major part of the quarter.Likely continuation of investment banking strength: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees might have continued in the to-be-reported quarter primarily on the back of higher debt origination. As the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees, this has been leading to strong gains for JPMorgan and the other largest U.S. investment banks.On the other hand, with overall low volumes of M&A and equity issuance during the quarter, the related fees are expected to be lower for the largest U.S. investment banks. However, JPMorgan’s top ranking in this space is expected to be a saving grace.Some improvement in mortgage banking: Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment.Overall mortgage revenue might see some improvement, as fresh origination of loans was expected to increase during the quarter.However, unlike Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp, JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession. So, the contribution of mortgage revenue gains to total revenues will not be extraordinary.Betterment in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer — might perk up interest income.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction may not be a major support. JPMorgan was supposed to pay $4.6 million to the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) civil penalty fund, as it failed to provide accurate screening reports. However, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements that might impact the firm’s earnings unusually in the to-be-reported quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few bank stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements for an earnings beat this time around:Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report), scheduled to report results on Oct 17, has an Earnings ESP of +1.16% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

314,STT,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s (BK  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 94 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. The figure also came in 4.4% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Results benefitted from an improvement in both net interest revenues and fee revenues. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, a marginal rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders came in at $983 million, increasing nearly 1% year over year. Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenues (non-GAAP) for the quarter increased 2.1% year over year to $4.01 billion. The figure marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99 billion.Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was $851 million, up 8% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates, partly offset by a fall in average deposits and loans.Additionally, net interest margin grew 10 basis points year over year to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues increased nearly 1% from the prior-year quarter to $3.17 billion. The rise was primarily driven by higher total investment services fees, and investment management and performance fees.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) came in at $2.60 billion, increasing 1% year over year. This reflects an increase in all expense components, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, bank assessment charges and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, AUM was $1.82 trillion, up 6% year over year. This reflected higher market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $32.2 trillion were up 6% year over year. Higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar largely drove the rise.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Sep 30, 2017, non-performing assets came in at $94 million, down from $109 million registered in the prior-year quarter.However, allowance for loan losses increased 8.8% year over year to $161 million. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million compared with $19 million in the year-ago quarter.Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Sep 30, 2017, common equity Tier-1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) came in at 11.9% compared with 11.3% as of Dec 31, 2016. Leverage capital ratio was 6.8%, up from 6.6% as of Dec 31, 2016.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 12 million shares for $650 million.Our ViewpointBNY Mellon’s restructuring initiatives and inorganic growth strategy will go a long way in supporting its bottom line. Further, its strong global reach and gradually easing margin pressure are expected to support profitability in the long run.However, concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee-based income remains a major concern for the company in the near term.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

315,STT,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19. While revenues and earnings are anticipated to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions, People's United reported a positive earnings surprise of 4.4% in second-quarter 2017. Further, elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses and decline in profitability ratios were the undermining factors.Notably, People's United delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 3.26%.People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | People's United Financial, Inc. QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 2.7% for the three-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, underperforming growth of 4.7% recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward a likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:People's United doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is -0.28%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: People's United’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter. Particularly, growth in commercial and consumer loans, with slowdown in commercial real estate loans is expected. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 11-13%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the influence of rise in interest rates, People's United should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII to grow in the range of 12-14% is likely to show impact in the third quarter as well.Fee Income to Escalate: On strong retail banking, fee income might escalate for the bank. In addition, the company projects non-interest income to rise in the range of 5-7% in 2017, the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, escalating expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

316,STT,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, before the opening bell. The bank’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that U.S. Bancorp is likely to beat on earnings in the third quarter. This is because the company has the combination of the two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for the stock is currently pegged at +0.26%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of U.S. Bancorp’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement.Notably, U.S. Bancorp delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.23% as depicted in the chart below:U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 3.2% for the three-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, underperforming growth of 3.9% recorded by the industry.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsExpenses Might Trend Higher: While the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on modest loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during the to-be-reported quarter will likely support the company’s NII.Consumer Revenue Growth: It is anticipated that an improving economy will spur consumer activity, which will help both payments businesses and consumer lending businesses. An improved economic backdrop will also lead to a rise in business spending on development and capital investments.Mortgage Banking Likely to Improve:  Higher mortgage banking is projected on stronger origination volumes. Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment. So, the contribution of mortgage revenues to total revenues will not be much. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenue is $215 billion, relatively stable year over year.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 88 cents over the last seven days. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $5.6 billion, up 4.9% year over year.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T.

Earnings per share of $2.16 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13. Moreover, the bottom line reflects a 17.4% increase from the prior-year quarter.Continued growth in loans helped the company earn higher net interest income during the quarter. Also, non-interest income witnessed a year-over-year growth. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent. Further, rise in provision for credit losses was a headwind.The company reported net income of $1.13 billion in the reported quarter, reflecting an increase of 11.9% year over year.Segment wise, on a year-over-year basis, quarterly net income in Corporate & Institutional Banking and Other, including BlackRock, improved 3.1% and 50%, respectively.

318,STT,"The recent disclosures by the Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has raised skepticism over the mega bank’s existence. It revealed to have identified an additional 1.4 million fake accounts apart from the 2.1 million accounts disclosed last September.After being pressured by the legislators for expanding the review period from the beginning of 2009 instead of 2011, the new discovery was made. Investigation of about 165 million deposit and credit-card accounts found that the employees had been conducting illegal sales practices for an even longer period.Wells Fargo stated that of the total unauthorized accounts that were opened, about 190,000 had incurred fees and other charges compared with 130,000 disclosed earlier. The bank is now expected to pay $10.7 million in compensation to its customers, which includes refunds of about $7 million, up from $3.3 million previously.It has been almost a year since the news of Wells Fargo’s involvement in unfair sales practices had spread in the market. Apart from being penalized by the regulators with a fine of about $185 million, Wells Fargo had to go through a lot of restructuring. Its executives faced pay cuts and about 5000 employees were fired.Further, the repercussions of this new disclosure keep us anxious.The review also revealed issues with the online bill pay service that the bank provides to its customers. It was uncovered that about 528,000 unauthorized online bill-pay enrollments were made without customers’ knowledge. The reviewers found those accounts to have only one transaction of a nominal amount. The bank has promised to refund $910,000 to the affected customers.Currently, Wells Fargo is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for the bank till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s performance over the past year reflects investors’ disappointment.

319,STT,"Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, speaking in Jackson Hole, WY last Friday, said that regulations of the central bank sanctioned after the 2008 market meltdown have made the financial system resilient to economic upheavals. These regulations have compelled banks to hold much higher levels of capital to cushion against losses from bad loans; the adequate capital cushion can also be used for paying out dividends and repurchasing stocks.Big banks have enough capital buffers to keep on trading through an economic meltdown, thanks to the positive annual “stress test” results. Such a promising outcome comes at a time when the Fed is forging ahead with the 25-basis point rate hike amid inflation worries. Given such positive trends, investing in sound bank stocks seems judicious.Yellen Defends Bank-Reform Efforts, Open to Easing Volcker RuleYellen emphasized that the sweeping regulations enacted in the past decade have helped restore the financial system. In particular, she noted that the U.S. financial systems were “in a dangerous place 10 years ago,” plagued by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the government taking over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and taxpayers bailing out large banks. During that crisis, Americans lost around 9 million jobs.However, the Dodd-Frank Act produced a safer banking system and insisted higher capital requirements that promoted loan growth. She defended the financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and said that any rollback of such reforms should be “modest,” and the Trump administration shouldn’t flip-flop on such reforms.However, she agreed that “there may be benefits to simplifying” the Volcker rule that restricts big banks’ ability to trade with their own money. She also believes that regulations should be closely scrutinized to ensure that they do not harm community and regional banks.The Republican bill, better known as the Financial Choice Act, also repeals certain sections of the Dodd-Frank law, including the Volcker Rule. Such a rule is believed to have prevented the net accumulation of new assets, which didn’t sit well with banks. Needless to say, now with more capital in hand, businesses are more likely to innovate and take higher risks.Banks Pass Annual Stress TestsIn addition to higher capital requirements, Yellen said that the financial system is protected by regulations requiring the banks to undergo annual stress tests. These tests ensure that banks have enough capital to bear any severe U.S. and global recession.All of the 34 large U.S. banks have already made it through the Fed’s stress test this year. The Fed figured out that all these banks have the minimum capital requirement and leverage ratio under severe adverse situations. In a hypothetical severely adverse situation, where the jobless rate is at 10%, home prices have tanked 25%, and the equity market has plummeted around 40%, these banks will have to bear a combined loss of $383 billion. But, that’s way below the $526 billion loss tested for last year.Yellen’s Brief Reference to the EconomyYellen remained mum on interest rate plans but mentioned that “substantial progress has been made toward the Federal Reserve’s economic objectives of maximum employment and price stability.” Headway in both these criteria is essential for further rate hikes. While the labor market remains ultra-tight and the unemployment rate sits at a 16-year low, inflation remains below the Fed’s preferred target level of 2%.Nevertheless, higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. Lenders have increased the interest charge for borrowers from 3.5% a year ago to 4.25%, while depositors have been pressed. On average, the rate on savings accounts are a meager 0.08%. This has helped the net interest rate margin (NIM) improve, especially after it had hit a 60-year low last year.5 Best Bank Stocks to Buy NowThe post-crisis financial reforms have made the banking system safer and more resilient to downturns.

320,STT,"On Aug 24, we issued an updated research report on Regions Financial Corporation (RF  -  Free Report). The company’s cost control measures are impressive. Further, its initiatives to generate new sources of revenues are supported by its strong capital position. However, pending legal issues remain a woe.The Birmingham-based lender reported an earnings beat in second-quarter 2017. Results reflected increased revenues and loan balances. However, rise in adjusted operating expenses and a decline in non-interest income were the undermining factors.Shares of Regions Financial have gained nearly 1% year to date versus the industry’s decline of 6.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings have remained stable at $1.00 over the last 30 days. Thus, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Regions Financial’s expense control initiatives are encouraging. Though costs increased slightly in the last completed quarter due to investments in enhanced online banking platform and other technology initiatives, the company remains on track to achieve $300 million expense reduction by 2018 through branch consolidations. Regions Financial’s efforts to reduce expenses along with generating new sources of revenues are commendable.Also, Regions Financial’s efforts are supported by its strong capital position. As part of its 2017 capital plan, it raised the common stock dividend by 28.6% and plans to repurchase up to $1.47 billion common stock. Further, the company’s consistently improving financial performance is indicative of the sustainability of these activities.However, the company’s fee income has witnessed a declining trend over the last few years mainly due to lower securities gains and insurance proceeds. Though Regions Financial’s is undertaking initiatives to increase revenues, volatile trend in non-interest income has been weighing on its top line.Also, Regions Financial is yet to solve some pending lawsuits from the investors and regulators for violation of rules and forgery. This is likely to impact its financials in the near term.  Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the finance space are JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Carolina Financial Corporation (CARO  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

321,STT,"(0:45) - ETF Trends In The Industry(6:40) – Index Tracking the Market: Toroso ETF Industry Index(12:15) - Weighting For the Index: Who Is On Top?(18:10) - How Important Are ETFs to Index Providers Like MSCI?(21:30) – How Does the ETF Industry Fit in Your Portfolio?(22:40) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comAs you might guess from the fact that I host a podcast on ETFs, I am pretty bullish on the future of the Exchange-Traded Fund industry. This is especially true when you compare its growth prospects to the rest of the investing and finance world, as ETF asset growth and fund creation has been quite impressive, and looks to continue down that path in the near term too.But how can you invest in this growth?After all, many companies in the ETF world—such as Vanguard, the #2 asset manager—are not publicly traded. And others that dominate the space, such as Blackrock’s (BLK  -  Free Report) iShares or State Street’s (STT  -  Free Report) SPDRs, are not the entire business for their massive parents. So, what’s an investor to do?Well, if you are looking to invest in the world of ETFs, Mike Venuto, the CIO of Toroso Investments, has some insights. Mike is behind the Toroso ETF Industry Index, the benchmark behind the first fund to offer direct and focused exposure to the ETF industry, the ETF Industry Exposure & Financial Services ETF (TETF  -  Free Report).We discuss this benchmark, and investing in the ETF industry in general, in this week’s edition of the Dutram Report.Industry in FocusIn the podcast, Mike and I address talk of an ‘ETF bubble’ and why we have seen such incredible growth in ETFs over the past few years. We also talk about hurdles to future growth in the market, and the possibility of moving past mutual funds in terms of assets at some point down the line too.We also discuss some of the key players in the ETF world, and what to do with companies that have exposure to ETFs, but aren’t pure plays. I admit that I was a bit skeptical about this aspect, but Mike makes a case for why some of the giants are more tied to ETFs than you might think, and how you can access some of the private companies with service providers too.What’s in the Index?While it shouldn’t be a surprise that a company like WisdomTree (WETF  -  Free Report) is in the benchmark, considering it is the only pure play ETF sponsor that is a public company, there are others that might be more of a surprise to some investors out there. This includes SEI Investments and CBOE Holdings (CBOE  -  Free Report) just to name a few.Mike also discusses the role that index providers play in the world of ETFs, and how important this business is to companies like MSCI Inc. (MSCI  -  Free Report) and S&P Global (SPGI) as well. Clearly, the ETF world is a bit more diverse than you (and I) initially thought, and it is also more than just a higher growth replacement for XLF. In fact, Mike notes that the benchmark has just a 20% overlap with the index underlying the SPDR financial sector ETF, meaning that this is definitely giving exposure to a unique subset of companies.So, if you’re an ETF ‘nerd’—like both Mike and I are—definitely check out this week’s podcast for more information on the industry and how to invest in its surging growth prospects too!Bottom LineBut what do you think about investing in the ETF industry?

323,STT,"Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (CFR  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.29, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the reported figure was up from $1.11 in the year-ago quarter.The company’s quarterly results reflect higher revenues. Further, increase in loans and a strong balance sheet position were the positives. However, elevated expenses remained an undermining factor.Net income available to common shareholders came in at $83.5 million, exceeding the year-ago quarter figure by approximately 20.2%.Revenue Growth Offsets Escalated ExpensesThe company’s total revenue was $295.9 million, up 10.2% from the prior-year quarter. However, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $316.4 million.Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis increased 12.1% year over year to $258 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a rise in earning assets in loans and securities, higher yields on loans and increase in cash balances. Moreover, net interest margin increased 13 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.70%, as the Fed’s interest rate hikes led to higher yielding assets.Non-interest income totaled $81.1 million, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was mainly due to rise in trust and investment management fees.Non-interest expenses of $188.1 million rose 4.8% year over year. Increase in all the cost components led to higher expenses in the reported quarter.Strong Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, total loans were $12.5 billion, up 2.7% from the previous quarter. Total deposits amounted to $25.6 billion, down 2% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, provision for loan losses declined 72% year over year to $8.3 million. Also, net charge-offs, annualized as a percentage of average loans contracted 35 bps year over year to 0.39%. Allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, was 1.20%, down 9 bps from the prior-year quarter.However, non-performing assets were $90.2 million, up slightly from the year-ago quarter.Profitability and Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Jun 30, 2017, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 13.59% compared with 12.73% at the end of the prior-year quarter. Total risk-based capital ratio was 15.65%, up from 14.36% as of Jun 30, 2016. Further, leverage ratio increased to 8.61% from 8.13% as of Jun 30, 2016.Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.11% and 11.07%, respectively, compared with 0.99% and 9.70% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointCullen/Frost reported decent performance in second quarter. Growth in loan balance indicates continued organic growth. Further, the company remains well poised to benefit from easing margin pressure. However, escalating expenses may continue to curb the company’s bottom-line growth. In addition, significant exposure to the risky real estate loans raises concerns.Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Also, the figure was up 14.4% year over year.Higher net interest income (reflecting rise in interest rates) and fee income supported the results.

However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.84 billion.Net interest revenues, on an operating basis, increased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $617 million.

326,STT,"State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Jul 26. Its earnings and revenues are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, an increase in fee revenues drove the company’s operating earnings growth. In fact, the number handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher expenses was the downside.State Street boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.1%.These earnings beats supported a 17.1% year-to-date rally of the stock, significantly outperforming the 4.7% growth of the industry it belongs to.State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post second-quarter earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.According to our quantitative model, chances of State Street beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are low. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. But, this is not the case here as is elaborated below(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for State Street is -0.64%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.56 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57.Zacks Rank: State Street’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Moreover, State Street’s activities during the quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable over the last seven days.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsNet Interest Margin (NIM) Improvement: The Mar 2017 rate hike should support the company’s NIM expansion in the to-be-reported quarter. The company expects NIM to grow in the mid single-digits.Revenues to Increase Modestly: Although, trading services activity is likely to remain muted in the second-quarter, the company expects servicing fees to improve, driven by client flows and net new business.Additionally, with moderate growth in loans witnessed in the quarter and improving rate scenario, net interest income (NII) is expected to increase modestly. In fact, management expects the NIM growth to offset the modest decline in balance sheet, leading to an increase in NII.Expenses to Remain Stable: Although the benefits of the company’s cost-saving initiatives through State Street Beacon are not expected to be realized much in the quarter, the same is likely to partly offset expenses to support new business, continued business investments, and merit and depreciation increases.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some finance stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Banc of California, Inc. (BANC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Jul 26. It has an Earnings ESP of +8.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.Hilltop Holdings Inc. (HTH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.33% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is slated to release results on Jul 27.Franklin Resources, Inc.

The figure also came 17% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Better-than-expected results were driven by higher revenues and benefit from provisions. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, a slight rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders came in at $926 million, up 12% year over year. Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenue (non-GAAP) for the quarter increased 5% year over year to $3.95 billion. Further, the figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.85 billion.Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was $838 million, up 7% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates and lower premium amortization, partly offset by a fall in average interest-earning assets and higher average long-term debt.Additionally, net interest margin grew 18 basis points to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues increased 4% from the prior-year quarter to $3.12 billion. The rise was mainly driven by higher total investment services fees, and investment management and performance fees.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) amounted to $2.59 billion, up 1% year over year. This reflects a rise in expenses in nearly all categories, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, sub-custodian costs and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, AUM was $1.77 trillion, up 6% year over year. This reflected higher market values and net inflows, partly offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $31.1 trillion were up 5% year over year. Higher market values largely drove the rise.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNon-performing assets declined 6.5% year over year to $100 million. Further, provision for credit losses was a benefit of $7 million compared with benefit of $9 million in the year-ago quarter.However, allowance for loan losses increased 4% year over year to $164 million.Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Jun 30, 2017, common equity Tier-1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) came in at 11.4% compared with 11.3% as of Dec 31, 2016. Leverage capital ratio was 6.7%, up from 6.6% in the prior-quarter level.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 11 million shares for $506 million.Dividend HikeConcurrently, BNY Mellon announced quarterly dividend of 24 cents per share, representing 26% increase from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid on Aug 11 to shareholders on record as of Aug 1.Our ViewpointBNY Mellon’s restructuring initiatives and inorganic growth strategy will go a long way in supporting its bottom line. Further, its efficient expense management, strong global reach and gradually easing margin pressure are expected to support profitability in the long run.However, concentration risks arising from significant dependence on fee-based income along with regulatory restrictions remain matters of concern for the company in the near term.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
