Can the space climb higher still this year?

In another blow to Express Scripts that month, health insurer Anthem (ATHM) said it will tie up with CVS on pharmacy benefit management in 2020, after its current contract with Express Scripts ends.Express Scripts stock has since recovered amid speculation that Amazon may be hunting for a pharmacy benefits manager to gain a foothold in the $300 billion business.On Nov. 30, Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said he would be open to a deal at the right price, though he wasn't actively looking for one, telling Bloomberg that, ""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have.""He added that a partnership with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement is also possible.But CVS, which is a major pharmacy benefits manager in its own right, said earlier this month that it will buy health insurer Aetna for $69 billion, with the deal coming as it braces for Amazon to enter the retail prescription business.Some analysts also say the deal would give the combined company an edge over rivals, with stronger negotiating leverage vs. drug manufacturers.RELATED:Amazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

13,ESRX,"X Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly mulling an entry into the pharmacy market, but the e-commerce giant may be less of a threat to established players than Wall Street fears, according to one equity analyst.Amazon's strength amid ongoing retail carnage is linked to innovations, such as its Prime Now home delivery service, that have made shopping either cheaper or more convenient for consumers.However, Amazon is unlikely to garner generic discounts greater than what CVS or Walgreens already offer, and Americans already enjoy mail-order drug delivery through the major pharmacy benefit managers, Mizuho Securities' Ann Hynes said in a note Wednesday.""Amazon certainly has the financial means to make the investment,"" Hynes wrote. ""The question we have is whether or not the investment would garner enough return on invested capital that Amazon typically enjoys and, for that matter, expects.""She added that Amazon would face a daunting task expanding its delivery service stateside to include drug sales. The retail pharmacy industry ""is significantly more regulated in the U.S. than in foreign markets, and we anticipate this would be a significant barrier to entry,"" she said.""We would be buyers of CVS and WBA on today's weakness,"" Hynes wrote.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the largest U.S. drugstore chain, gave up 3.4% in afternoon trade on the stock market today. CVS Health (CVS) lost 3.2%, and Rite Aid (RAD) shed 2.9%. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) dipped 0.2%, and drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) fell 2.8%. Amazon slid 1.7% amid a broad market retreat as President Trump's string of crises weigh on investors.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon's pharmacy ambitions, like its consumer electronics initiative, show the company continues to innovate. The Leaderboard stock is extended well above an 843.94 buy point.The rise of high-deductible plans, with consumers assuming more of their own health care costs, is seen as a catalyst for the online retail giant's pharmacy ambitions.Amazon has reportedly hired a general manager with the multibillion-dollar pharmacy market in view, but its entry into the business has not been finalized.""I think Amazon would introduce a lot of transparency to what drugs really cost,"" Stephen Buck — co-founder of GoodRx, a service for cost-conscious prescription-drug consumers — told CNBC, which first reported the news.Buck estimated Amazon could get $25 billion to $50 billion of the roughly $300 billion spent on prescription drugs in the U.S. a year.Amazon's Japanese site has expanded the Prime Now service to include drug sales. That could be a prelude to a similar U.S. move, because the retailer often tests new initiatives in foreign markets before rolling them out domestically, CNBC said.Amazon has toyed with the idea of an online retail pharmacy business before. It backed Drugstore.com's bid nearly two decades ago to take on brick-and-mortal rivals. That deal soon fizzled.

19,ESRX,"Cigna (CI) just made a bid to join an elite group of health care industry titans with its $67 billion deal to buy drug-benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX).X Yet the takeover, which includes $15 billion in assumed debt, comes as something of a shock because Express Scripts and pharmacy benefit managers, in general, have been under fire and unloved on Wall Street. To some extent, Cigna may be jumping into the frying pan.Cigna will pay $48.75 plus 0.2434 share for each Express Scripts share. At Wednesday's close that was equal to 96.03, a 31% premium for Express Scripts.Wall Street's initial reaction to the deal was skeptical.

Among competitors, UnitedHealth (UNH) dipped 0.8%, CVS Health rose 1.3%, while Humana (HUM) lost 1.4%.Cigna sees the combination as giving it the scale and skill sets to deliver value to customers, hold down health costs and compete in a world in which its competitors like UnitedHealth and CVS, after it completes its merger with Aetna, own an increasingly formidable array of health care assets.Cigna told analysts on Thursday that the deal would immediately add to earnings and provide a significant boost in the intermediate term. The company raised its EPS target for 2021 to $20-$21 per share from $18.Yet some industry analysts worry that Amazon.com (AMZN) will disrupt the prescription industry. Amazon has flirted with entering the retail drug business and just launched a venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) aimed at lowering health care costs. Washington has amped up the rhetoric on the lack of transparency in drug pricing, and PBMs are seen as a prime suspect.

25,ESRX,"XDrugstore chain Rite Aid (RAD) reported fiscal fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that topped views, while its takeover by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) remains in doubt.Estimates: Wall Street expected a 2-cent per-share loss, down from a profit of 6 cents a share a year ago. Revenue was seen as roughly flat, at $8.265 billion.Results: Rite Aid reported break-even results on an adjusted basis, with revenue up 3.3% to $8.5 billion. Same-store sales slid 3%.Stock: Shares climbed 6.4% to 3.97 on the stock market today after hitting a 3-1/2-year low on Monday. Walgreens Boots Alliance rose nearly 2%, moving above its 50-day line.Fred's (FRED) climbed 4.6%, after naming new board members late Monday. CVS Health (CVS) rose 2.65%, due to CVS' pharmacy benefits manager side possibly benefiting from Express Scripts (ESRX) likely to lose Anthem (ANTM) as a key customer.IBD'S TAKE: Deutsche Bank believes that Rite Aid's stock could dive more than 50% if Rite Aid's merger with Walgreens doesn't go through.Walgreens originally agreed to pay $9 per share for Rite Aid in 2015 in a deal worth $9.4 billion at the time. It came amid a wave of health-industry moves to consolidate and keep expenses in check as the Affordable Care Act brought insurance to more people.When the agreement was struck, Bloomberg noted that Walgreens would modernize Rite Aid's stores and gear them more toward beauty and wellness, while Walgreens would gain access to the drug-benefit management market for employers and insurers where CVS Health competes.To pass antitrust muster, Walgreens planned to sell 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred's but that still wasn't enough to ease regulators' concerns that that tie-up could hurt competition.So earlier this year, Walgreens slashed its takeover to $6.50-$7, with the new price dependent on how many stores Rite Aid had to divest, as the Federal Trade Commission reportedly considered blocking the deal.The potential number of Rite Aid stores that could be sold has since been bumped up to as many as 1,200. But regulators' doubts have grown about Fred's ability to absorb that many stores.Early this month, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said he was ""still optimistic that we will bring this deal to a successful conclusion. But there is no doubt that the process of getting clear for the transaction is taking longer than we expected.""Last week, Bloomberg, citing a report from the trade publication Capitol Forum, said that the Federal Trade Commission was considering suing to block Walgreens' attempt to buy the company.An merger expiration extension suggests Walgreens will keep fighting to win over the FTC, perhaps after President Trump gets new commissioners to fill empty seats.RELATED:Walgreens CEO On Rite Aid: 'I Am Still Positive On This Deal'New Walgreens Report Sends Rite Aid Stock Plunging Again

26,ESRX,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) will use UnitedHealth (UNH) OptumRx for its pharmacy benefit needs, which could save companies and consumers billions.The pact likely negates the need for Walgreens making an expensive purchase of a large pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) like Express Scripts (ESRX), as some on Wall Street had speculated. Express Scripts shares fell 3.5% to 67.61 after falling as low as 65.97, near a 52-week low.Walgreens' agreement with UnitedHealth OptumRx will give it the ability to provide similar services and cost savings as arch-rival CVS Health (CVS), a combined drugstore and PBM.The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association separately launched an ad campaign Thursday touting savings from PBMs. The trade group said in a statement that PBMs, which negotiate prices and other terms between pharmacies and drugmakers/distributors, are projected to save employers, unions, government programs and consumers a combined $654 billion on drug benefit costs over the next decade.Currently the No. 2 drugstore chain by revenue, Walgreens is buying No. 3 Rite Aid (RAD), which has its own PBM, for an estimated $17.2 billion. If that deal goes through, Walgreens could choose to expand use of that PBM for the combined company.Walgreens said in a statement that the UnitedHealth OptumRx agreement includes a 90-day prescription option at Walgreens' nearly 8,200 pharmacies in the U.S., OptumRx home delivery, and 24/7 access to pharmacists.The drugstore company plans to integrate OptumRx's pharmacy care services with Walgreens' current drugstore services. The agreement will go into effect starting on Jan. 1, 2017.Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance, which operates nearly 13,000 locations in 11 countries, rose 1.5% to 83.30 in the stock market today. Walgreens stock has been in a first-stage consolidation for more than five months, with a 97.40 buy point. It's risen 16% from the 71.50 low point of the trough.Shares of CVS, which have also been in a more-than-five-month first-stage consolidation, were up 0.1% Thursday. Rite-Aid, a distant third in annual revenue behind CVS and Walgreens, rose 0.1% too. UnitedHealth slid 0.1% but closed well off intraday lows.

45,ESRX,"With U.S. companies headed for a record year of share repurchases, experts are split over whether buybacks are the logical result of excess capital, or if they come at the expense of growth initiatives.
"
46,ESRX,"A number of high-profile companies have implemented aggressive buyback programs in recent quarters, spanning all sectors of the economy.
"
47,ESRX,"They include tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), health care leaders like Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), manufacturers like Boeing (BA) and General Motors (GM), financial leaders like Wells Fargo (WFC), and consumer stocks such as Nike (NKE) and Wendy's (WEN).
"
48,ESRX,"Nike announced a $12 billion buyback program on Thursday, along with a 14% dividend hike.
"
49,ESRX,"Apple bought back $36 billion in shares in fiscal 2015 after buying $45 billion in stock in 2014.
"
50,ESRX,"Not surprisingly, buybacks have become the focus of intense media coverage in recent weeks.
"
51,ESRX,"Critics say more of that money should be reinvested into research and development initiatives as well as new products, technologies and services. This would contribute to long-term growth and feed economic expansion, they say. Critics also say that executives use buybacks to flatter financial results.
"
52,ESRX,"But defenders say returning money to shareholders is a good use of money that's left over after capital has already been allocated to normal business expenses.
"
53,ESRX,"In today's environment, many companies are ""still left with a large amount of excess capital,"" even after investing in growth initiatives, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors' U.S. Intermediary Business Group.
"
54,ESRX,"""They are choosing to redeploy the money to investors,"" he told IBD. ""When done the right way, buybacks are a good capital allocation. There are a lot of misperceptions around share buybacks.""
"
55,ESRX,"Record Buyback Pace
"
56,ESRX,"What's certain is this: A whole lot of money is going toward buybacks and dividends lately.
"
57,ESRX,"The total dollar amount of dividends and stock buybacks is on track to reach a new high this year and could soar above $1 trillion for the first time, according to industry estimates.
"
58,ESRX,"The percentage of operating cash flow used to buy back shares is at its highest level since 2007, Arone says. He calls that a ""watershed year"" for buybacks. That was also just before the U.S. fell into a sharp recession and bear market.
"
59,ESRX,"""Some look at 2007 as a kind of peak year,"" he said. ""This year's percentage of operating cash flow used for buybacks is still below 2007. But (2015) would be the largest year of all time in absolute dollar terms.""
"
60,ESRX,"A recent investigative report from Reuters noted that nearly 60% of the 3,297 publicly traded non-financial U.S. companies it examined have bought back shares since 2010.
"
61,ESRX,"In fiscal 2014, spending on buybacks and dividends surpassed the companies' combined net income for the first time outside of a recessionary period, Reuters said. Spending kept climbing higher for the 613 companies that have already reported for fiscal 2015. That suggests that corporations are relying more heavily on cheap interest rates to use debt to fund buybacks and dividends.
"
62,ESRX,"FactSet Research reports that 75% of all companies in the S&P 500 bought back shares and paid dividends in the trailing 12 months at the end of the second quarter, the most recent data available. About $555 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms on share repurchases in the same period.
"
63,ESRX,"The information technology sector spent the most money on buybacks in the second quarter, FactSet said, led by Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Oracle (ORCL).
"
64,ESRX,"Meanwhile, U.S. companies issued $107.9 billion in dividends during Q3. That was up 23% from Q2 and established a new record, according to data from Henderson Global Investors.
"
65,ESRX,"Why is all this money going toward buybacks and dividends?
"
66,ESRX,"The most basic answer is that the money is there, and something has to be done with it.
"
67,ESRX,"""You have low interest rates and record profits,"" Arone said. ""This has resulted in corporations at peak levels in terms of having a lot of cash on hand.""
"
68,ESRX,"In some cases, activist investors are pressuring companies to reward investors with that money, analysts say. In others, executives are simply gun-shy about investing in products and services that might not pay off over the long term.
"
69,ESRX,"Another reason some companies are buying back outstanding shares is that doing so fattens up per-share earnings.
"
70,ESRX,"Innovation Shortchanged?
"
71,ESRX,"The worry in some quarters is that buybacks come at the expense of product development, innovation and long-term growth.
"
72,ESRX,"""The U.S. is behind on production of everything from flat-panel TVs to semiconductors and solar photovoltaic cells,"" Gary Pisano, a professor at Harvard Business School, told Reuters. He's also the author of ""Producing Prosperity: Why America Needs a Manufacturing Renaissance.""
"
73,ESRX,"Reuters reported that among the 1,000 or so firms it tracked that buy back shares and report R&D spending, the share of net income spent on innovation has averaged less than 50% since 2009. That com pares to over 60% during the 1990s.
"
74,ESRX,"But not all data show such a grim view, Arone said. ""There's a bunch of data showing R&D growing at its fastest level in 50 years. There's this misperception that companies are not reinvesting or spending on business growth. But many companies do continue to reinvest in their businesses.""
"
75,ESRX,"He also says that while buybacks can boost a company's EPS, research from S&P Dow Jones Indices shows that on a weighted basis, recent S&P 500 EPS gains ""are built on profits — not buybacks.""
"
76,ESRX,"A recent report from Deutsche Bank found that S&P 500 per-share profits since 2012 have risen by 6.2% annually on average, of which just 1.6 percentage points are from buybacks. That fell to 1.2 points in Q3.
"
77,ESRX,"Misperceptions about buybacks are due to a couple of factors, Arone says.
"
78,ESRX,"""Global economic growth has been sluggish, and therefore folks equate that sluggishness with a lack of business investment,"" he said. ""There's also been a lack of any meaningful wage growth. There's this view that we would be accelerating much more quickly had businesses been investing more, but I'm not convinced that's accurate.""
"
79,ESRX,"If economic growth is sluggish, the return on capital may be low, so returning cash to shareholders may be a sound decision.
"
80,ESRX,"That's not to say there aren't cases where companies issue buybacks and dividends at their detriment.
"
81,ESRX,"""If a company is borrowing aggressively or levering its balance sheet to buy back stock, that is not necessarily a good strategy,"" Arone said. ""Or if a company buys back its stock to offset the dilutive effects of stock-based compensation of employees, that's not a good strategy, either.""
"
82,ESRX,"But those are the exceptions rather than the rule, he said.

Start NowIn the U.S., Thursday's economic news opened with the monthly Job Cuts Report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing U.S. employers announced 35,369 layoffs in February. That was down 20% from January's levels, and 4% below the number of layoffs announced a year ago.The number of layoffs has now remained below 50,000 for 22 consecutive months, the longest in the gauge's history. ""The economy is almost at full employment, and companies are holding on to their workforces,"" the report noted.Weekly unemployment claims rebounded in the week ended March 3, the Labor Department estimated, rising to 231,000.

AMD is testing resistance at its 200-day moving average, ending just below that level after paring its early 9% gain Wednesday.Express Scripts opened 14% higher after health insurer Cigna (CI) confirmed it would pay $67 billion to acquire the pharmacy benefits manager. Cigna said it expects the deal, which includes $15 billion in debt, to close by the end of the year. A year ago, the courts blocked a proposed $48 billion merger between Cigna and fellow health insurer Anthem (ANTM).Still, the move continues a recent round of massive reorganization in the sector, which included CVS Health's (CVS) $68 billion purchase of Aetna (AET), the launch of Apple (AAPL) health clinics for its employees and a joint venture between Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan (JPM) to more efficiently provide healthcare services to their 1 million employees.Cigna shares dropped 7% in opening trade.In earnings news, Burlington Stores buttoned up an early 9% gain. The New Jersey-based retailer reported late Wednesday fourth-quarter sales, earnings and same-store-sales above consensus projections. Burlington Stores also raised its full-year earnings guidance above analyst targets. The early gain hauled shares back above their 10-week moving average in the sixth week of a consolidation.Thor Industries' (THO)  fiscal second-quarter sales beat analyst estimates, while earnings apparently came up short of views. The company said the industry was benefiting from healthy lending standards and credit availability, and from a low rate of charge-offs. Thor shares rose 6% at Thursday's open, then reversed to a slight loss to trade still 24% below their January high, and just below resistance at their 40-week moving average.RELATED:The Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?Stocks Bounce As White House Says Tariffs May Exempt Canada, MexicoApple iPhone X Sales Bitten By Year Of The Dog In China

165,ESRX,"Biotech stocks and pharmaceutical companies added to recent market gains Monday after Trump's top health aide delivered a speech that largely spared them the brunt of drug-pricing reform.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar delivered his speech on drug-pricing reform Monday. Like Trump, his speech was light on its impact for biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies. Instead, the White House is considering changes to Medicare and caps on out-of-pocket spending.Most proposals will impact so-called middlemen including pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs and drug distributors. They include the likes of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC). But Azar was critical of pharmaceutical companies' high list prices and a lack of transparency in direct-to-consumer advertising.""We look forward to working with industry to build a better system,"" he said. ""But if industry isn't willing to work with us to lower prices, President Trump and his administration will keep turning up the pressure — until the system finally puts American patients first.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseShares of pharmaceutical companies had rallied but ultimately slipped marginally at the close while biotech company stocks gained 1.2% on the stock market today following the speech. The Nasdaq Biotechnology (NBI) was flat while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) index rose 1%.Among the proposals, RBC analysts see changes to Medicare Part B and Part D as having the biggest impact on biotech stocks. Still, they wrote in a note to clients even that will still be ""relatively benign overall.""Part B covers physician-administered drugs whereas Part D covers prescription drugs. Under the proposal, negotiation from some Part B drugs would be more similar to Part D negotiation. More broadly, the president is calling for Part B to merge into Part D, Azar said.""Inflation-capped price increases in Part B is likely most impactful proposal in biotech, as well as out-of-pocket transparency for Part B vs. Part D drugs (infusions vs. self-injectables) and unifying Part B billing codes,"" RBC analysts said.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) has the largest exposure among large-cap biotechs to Part B through its eye disease drug called Eylea. Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Amgen (AMGN) also are exposed. Further, Sage Therapeutics (SAGE), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Dynavax (DVAX) face difficulties.Azar also suggested changes to how PBMs issue and negotiate rebates. He proposed an end so-called ""gag clauses"" on pharmacists. These prevent pharmacists from telling consumers when they'd actually save money by paying out of pocket for their medicines.""Right now, we're asking a pretty straightforward question: What if, instead of the current system where drug companies get paid rebates and middlemen take a cut, we just had fixed-price discounts?"" Azar said. ""This would fix the situation where even the pharmacy benefit manager, who is hired to help keep prices low, makes money from higher list prices.""He also suggested pharmaceutical companies include their list prices in advertising that goes out directly to consumers. Further, Azar said he and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are developing incentives to lower list prices.But most of these changes are long-term ""further actions,"" Raymond James analyst Michael Baker said in a note. Changes to Part D contracts that prevent pharmacists from explaining when out-of-pocket costs are cheaper ""will likely not have a meaningful impact.""RELATED:Biotech Stocks Fly As Trump Speech Seen As 'More Bark Than Bite'Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

166,ESRX,"CVS Health (CVS) said it's making progress in the regulatory review of its $68 billion deal to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) after first-quarter earnings came in higher than analysts anticipated.Both CVS and rival Express Scripts (ESRX) are trying to get their mega mergers approved by regulators, as drug middlemen combine with large insurers in the U.S. to offer a larger suite of medical services under one roof. The two deals are being reviewed by the Justice Department.""We are moving forward on both the regulatory and integration planning fronts in support of a close in the second half of this year and a smooth, efficient integration of operations,"" CVS Health Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said in a statement Wednesday.Earnings were were $1.48 a share, excluding some items, CVS Health said, compared with the $1.41 average of 20 analysts' predictions compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 2.6% to $45.7 billion, in line with the $45.8 billion average of estimates.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe shares gained 2% to 69.33 in stock market trading.CVS's proposed takeover of Aetna would bring together around 10,000 CVS stores and the health insurer's 22 million customers. A central plank of the deal is transforming the stores into health hubs where consumers can get care, pick up their drugs, buy some cosmetics, and stay out of the hospital. In a sign of its ambition, last month, CVS hired a senior executive from a startup that specializes in primary-care clinics to oversee expanded health-care services across the company.Aetna reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed estimates Tuesday.""Aetna is firing on all cylinders, validating that CVS would gain pristine health insurance assets should the deal go through,"" wrote Jason McGorman, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Concerns that Amazon.com (AMZN) may start directly competing with CVS by selling prescription drugs have receded recently, following a CNBC report in April that the internet retailer had shelved plans too sell drugs to hospitals and other businesses.

167,ESRX,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) tumbled to a four-year low Tuesday — prodding rival Amgen (AMGN) to also dip — after announcing a deal with Express Scripts (ESRX) to cut the net price of cholesterol drug Praluent.Express Scripts will list Praluent as its exclusive PSCK9 inhibitor on its national formulary as of July 1. In exchange, it will pay a lower price for the drug. PCSK9 inhibitors, like Praluent and Amgen's Repatha, work to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood. They also benefit cardiovascular outcomes.The move is in an effort to expand access to cholesterol drug Praluent, Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY) said. Some reports suggest 70% of prescription requests are rejected by insurers. That could be, in part, due to price. Praluent and Repatha go for north of $14,000 per year.Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer praised the deal in a written statement. He sees the agreement as setting a new standard model for medicines like Praluent.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This paradigm-shifting agreement is designed to break the gridlock so that Praluent is finally able to reach patients most in need,"" he said. ""U.S. cardiologists have experienced unprecedented challenges in securing access for Praluent for patients who were clearly appropriate, but were denied coverage.""But investors weren't as keen on the deal. In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Regeneron slipped 0.8% to 301.22. Amgen dropped 3% to 169.28. Sanofi lost a fraction to 39.13.The agreement significantly reduces the documentation necessary to secure Express Scripts insurance coverage for the cholesterol drug, Regeneron and Sanofi said in a press release. Physicians will submit a simplified attestation form to confirm the patient is appropriate for Praluent.Express Scripts also agreed to pass a portion of the savings onto patients enrolled in other plans. Those patients should see lower out-of-pocket costs for their Praluent prescriptions, the companies said.Analysts were largely positive on the deal, though note the specifics of the price cut aren't public. It's likely Praluent will be priced in line with a recent report that suggested it would be cost effective for higher risk patients at $4,500-$8,000 annually, RBC analyst Brian Williams said in a note.The ""price for volume"" announcement leaves a lot of the financial benefit up in the air, Williams said. The PCSK9 market is particularly attractive given its massive size. But this type of deal could further incentivize insurers to implement complicated utilization processes, he said.Further, if the deal prices the cholesterol drug closer to the $4,500 annual target, it would represent a 50%-plus cut to the net price, Williams said.""Despite this, we do not view this as a pricing 'race to the bottom' given potential for annual compounding and lifetime treatment creating distinct differences vs. the 'price for volume' contracts in the curative one-time-treatment hepatitis C space,"" he added.Now, it's a battle for the other insurers, Williams said. Amgen is in negotiations with payers and will likely leverage its ""expertise in winning contracting agreements"" to seek deals with United Health (UNH), CVS Health (CVS), Anthem (ANTM), Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) or Humana (HUM), he said.Amgen estimates the Express Scripts formulary decision will impact 2,000, or 6%, of Repatha patients, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a report to clients. But he kept his model on Praluent intact until after the first-quarter earnings conference call on Thursday.""Just doing some back-of-the-envelope math, if all 2,000 Repatha patients switched to Praluent on July 1, this would be an $8 million tailwind for Praluent in the second half of 2018 on the formulary decision alone,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

Both were off session highs.Among drug distributors, McKesson (MCK) rose 3.5%, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 2.25% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 3.1%.Amazon shares didn't react negatively to the news, rising 0.75% on Monday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe report seemed to have the most direct connection to the trio of major drug distributors that handle logistics for major drug manufacturers, a big revenue but low-margin business. Complexity, such as handling temperature-sensitive products, and the lack of interest among hospitals in switching purchasing relationships, will keep Amazon out of the business.Investors seemed to interpret the move as decreasing the likelihood that Amazon will enter the retail prescription business, giving a boost to CVS and Walgreens. If so, then Amazon investors apparently don't think the internet retail giant needs prescription drugs to win over and keep customer loyalty.Amazon could still enter the prescription business, such as via an acquisition of Walgreens. Or it could start small with just online pharmacy.Meanwhile, Walmart (WMT) appears to be increasingly focused on health care and pharmacy as a key to boost sales and loyalty. Walmart is reportedly in talks to merge or deepen its partnership with Humana (HUM), whose managed care businesses is focused on the Medicare population.Shares of Walmart climbed about 1%, but didn't see much of an uptick after the Amazon news broke.Cigna (CI), the managed care provider that is buying pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX), rose 2%.Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care provider, rose 2.7%.

171,ESRX,"Recent weeks have not been friendly to the pharmaceutical industry, with some stocks in the sector such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Horizon Pharma (HZNP) withering amid criticism over the industry's drug-pricing practices and fears of greater regulation.But two biotechs with top fundamentals — Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), the focus of the Screen of the Day — have maintained strong ratings and held up in the stock market despite the furor. Companies with top fundamentals, by IBD's definition, have three-year EPS and sales growth rates of at least 25%.Gilead Sciences, which has faced a raft of criticism over the price of its hepatitis C wonder drug, Sovaldi, has a three-year EPS growth rate of 106% and a three-year sales growth rate of 60%. The company handily beat Q3 estimates last month, raising full-year sales guidance that was just shy of expectations.Gilead, like other pharma stocks, fell on Sept. 21, when Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said she would introduce a plan to crack down on what she called ""price gouging"" in the industry. Clinton's announcement came after Turing Pharmaceuticals was harshly criticized for its decision to buy a six-decade-old drug and quickly raise its price by more than 5,000%.Gilead breached its 200-day line that day and sank further for a month before clearing its 50-day and 200-day line. The stock has found support at its 200-day moving average since.Shares closed down 2.8% in the stock market today.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), which makes the cholesterol fighter Praluent with Sanofi (SNY), has a three-year EPS growth rate of 46% and a three-year sales growth rate of 45%. But sales of Praluent, seen as a possible blockbuster, were less than half of what analysts expected in Q3. EPS and overall sales beat forecasts.Regeneron fell the day of Clinton's announcement, finished higher the next two days, then descended below its 200-day line on Sept. 28. But the stock has since climbed above its 50-day line.Regeneron stock dipped 2.5% Thursday as the stock formed a handle on a three-month consolidation.While Regeneron and Gilead have turned in stronger showings recently, stocks such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Horizon Pharma have been hit hard. Short-seller Citron Research last month accused Valeant of shady sales practices and criticized the drugmaker for price-hikes in its acquired drugs. And Citron this month attacked Mallinckrodt, saying sales of its drug Acthar had lagged and questioned the gel's effectiveness.And Express Scripts (ESRX) on Wednesday sued Horizon Pharma, saying it owed millions in unpaid drug rebates, and cut from its network a specialty pharmacy that Horizon was using. Valeant also has been hammered over its specialty pharmacy ties.Mallinckrodt, Valeant and Horizon are all trading their 50-day and 200-day lines.Valeant shares ended down 6.5% Thursday, Horizon lost 2%, while Mallinckrodt fell 6.5%.

251,ESRX,"Sector Fund Returns
"
252,ESRX,"For December, financial services, up 11.63%, booked its biggest one-month gain since April 2009. Basic materials, up 10.58%, and commodities, up 10.17%, were the only others to post double-digit returns in the last month of 2010. Consumer services, up 3.94%, were the laggard.
"
253,ESRX,"For the quarter, natural resources, up 21.16%, and basic materials, up 18.49%, led all sectors.
"
254,ESRX,"Rising most for the year were precious metals, up 43.57%, consumer services (27.83%) and real estate (27.60%). The only sectors not reaching double digits were utilities, up 7.83%, and health/biotech, up 9.87%.
"
255,ESRX,"Oliver Pursche, portfolio manager of GMG Defensive Beta , says he's cutting back on basic materials and agricultural commodities because of their run-up. He's buying health care names such as Abbott Labs (ABT), CVS (CVS), Express Scripts (ESRX), Novartis (NVS) and Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA).

264,ESRX,"Contrary to popular sentiment, Gerald Jordan, manager of Jordan Opportunity Fund , believes emerging-market returns in 2011 will fall behind Europe and the U.S. He thinks food inflation will prompt governments to raise interest rates to control their economies.

268,ESRX,"A year-end rally gave the average stock fund its best December return, 6.43%, since 1999, adding more than one-third of the 2010 total return of 16.57%.World stock funds, up 7.12% in December, barely edged out domestic funds, which rose 6.10%. But world stock funds' 7.83% Q4 gain trailed considerably U.S. equity's 11.41%.In the final month of the year, small-cap value funds, up 8.26%, outpaced all sizes and styles of funds, while large-cap growth, up 5.22%, was the laggard.Small-cap value also led the quarter with a 15.91% gain, while large-cap value, up 10.55%, trailed.For the year, small-cap growth, up 27.62%, overshadowed all categories, while large-cap value, 12.96%, brought up the rear.Investors who missed the small-cap ride should look before they leap into the sector in 2011, since the group that outperforms one year is unlikely to do it again the next year.Outsize returns in small caps will be unsustainable in the new year, said Dave Winters, manager of the $1.3 billion Wintergreen Fund , because large-cap valuations are cheap and small caps' are at speculative levels.

364,ESRX,"Every Amazon (AMZN) flirtation toward the health care industry has sent hearts racing on Wall Street. Yet Amazon appears to be having commitment issues, and others have leapt while Jeff Bezos hesitated. Now comes a possible Walmart (WMT)-Humana (HUM) merger. A Walmart acquisition of the insurer could fundamentally reshape health care delivery in ways that Amazon may have trouble matching.A Walmart-Humana deal could potentially transform the health care market for seniors, a demographic that is critical for both companies.Walmart already operates about 4,500 in-store pharmacies and 2,900 vision centers, but a Humana deal would likely accelerate its efforts in developing in-store clinics. The clinics haven't been a knockout success, but Walmart has been learning, wrote Tracy Watts, U.S. health reform leader at Mercer, in a blog post. ""This partnership could foster new ways to bring people what they want and need,"" she wrote, highlighting health care access in rural areas.CVS Health (CVS), which is in the process of acquiring Aetna (AET), is planning to revamp its drugstores to provide more health services. Walmart has greater financial wherewithal to execute the strategy and its supercenters may be a more natural fit for health services.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA Walmart-Humana tie-up has strategic merits for the retail giant, wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan. He expects it would drive greater store traffic and produce health care cost savings, helping the discounter to keep investing to fend off Amazon.Savings would come from closer ties to Humana, the largest remaining independent pharmacy benefits manager. That would help to reduce drug prices for Walmart's 1.5 million U.S. employees, Astrachan wrote.Humana recently purchased a major stake in the home health care business of Kindred Healthcare, a natural fit for Walmart's home delivery business.Still, there would be challenges. Piper Jaffray analyst Sarah James sees hurdles to staffing up clinics amid a nursing shortage that's pushing up wages. She also questioned how attractive a merger would be for Humana. Humana has an enviable Medicare position while Walmart has a smaller store base compared to CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).Still, Humana shares rose 4.4% on the stock market today, even as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all lost about 2% or more. Meanwhile, shares of Walmart lost 3.8% and Amazon skidded 5.2%.So far Amazon's disruptive impact on health care has been all about what others are doing. Since reports last summer that Amazon might enter the retail prescription industry, the shockwaves have set in motion one deal after another. First it was CVS buying Aetna and beginning to offer same-day delivery in major markets, and next-day nationwide. Albertsons grabbed the Rite Aid (RAD) stores not bought by Walgreens. Last month, Cigna (CI) announced the purchase of Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest of the pharmacy benefit managers.Options to enter the prescription drug business have narrowed for Amazon but haven't been closed off entirely. One potential avenue would be acquiring Walgreens.In January, Amazon announced a health care venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). Health care stocks tumbled amid fear that Amazon would use the same formula that slayed book sellers and department stores. The scariest part: The companies say they have no intent to earn a profit from the effort. Yet they also confessed to a lack of any coherent plan for putting still-to-be-formed cost-saving ideas to work.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Trump Tariffs: China Trade War Just Took This Surprise TurnIs FANG Stock Trade Dead As Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google Lead Tech Weakness?The Big Picture: Stocks Do Some Damage Repair, As Patience Now Becomes KeyThe Best Growth Stocks To Watch And BuyHere's What You Need To Know About Spotify's IPO, Due Tuesday

372,ESRX,"The FDA approved Amgen's (AMGN) cholesterol drug Repatha late Thursday, giving it a similar label to a recently approved rival from Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), but a slightly lower price.The agency said it had cleared Repatha, one of the new PCSK9 inhibitor class of drugs, for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and patients with heart disease who need more cholesterol-busting power than the standard treatment of statins.This is essentially the same as the label given to Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent when it was approved last month, although Praluent was not approved in HoFH since the companies did not seek approval for that group. Some had hoped for a broader label that included patients who don't yet have heart disease, i.e. primary prevention, but after Praluent was approved Wall Street generally expected a similar label.""We believe FDA will adopt class labeling for Repatha, making a primary prevention claim unlikely,"" Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote in a July 30 research note. ""However, we believe a label that includes secondary prevention in statin-intolerant patients should be sufficiently broad to support our current $2.5 billion peak sales estimate as we estimate the PCSK9 class must capture 24% share of this patient segment.""The FDA's press release didn't specifically mention statin intolerance, a much-disputed condition that Regeneron and Sanofi had been hoping to include on Praluent's label. Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) has also been targeting this group with a cholesterol-lowering drug candidate from a different class, leading to much stock volatility as the PCSK9 drama has unfolded.Amgen's press release said the drug will cost $14,100 a year, a bit below Praluent's at $14,600 a year. Since Praluent and Repatha are basically similar the arrival of the new drug has been widely expected to apply pricing pressure, but it wasn't clear how much. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) has signaled its intention to spark a price war between the two to keep its costs down. Amgen's price only modestly undercut that, but ""real world"" pricing often involves a great deal of rebating.Consensus calls for Repatha to bring in $10 million to $15 million in revenue in the third quarter and $42 million in Q4, according to RBC Capital Markets.Amgen rose a fraction in after-hours trading Thursday, after climbing 1.1% in regular trade to close at 155.72.

In a July 30 research note, Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote that Amgen's drug will probably also get a similar label, which doesn't cover quite as many patients as some had hoped but ""should be sufficiently broad to support our $2.5 billion peak sales estimate.""
"
388,ESRX,"What will be especially interesting to investors will be the pricing dynamics that come with two drugs appearing on the market. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) has said it hopes to start a price war between the two, similar to what happened when AbbVie (ABBV) launched a rival hepatitis C regimen to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Harvoni late last year. Gilead has maintained dominant market share, but only by rebating near half the drug's list price.
"
389,ESRX,"""We believe rebating may drive access, as Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen will be directly competing for formulary position,"" Somaiya wrote.

391,ESRX,"By Aug. 18, the FDA is due to decide on a label expansion for Adcetris, the sole marketed drug from Seattle Genetics (SGEN). Adcetris, marketed by partner Takeda, is already approved for patients with Hodgkins lymphoma who've relapsed after receiving a stem-cell transplant or after two chemotherapy treatments. The current filing followed a study of patients who'd received a transplant but hadn't relapsed, and found a significant improvement in progression-free survival.
"
392,ESRX,"In a July 16 research note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt wrote that the chances of approval looked good since the FDA didn't convene an advisory committee before the approval date, which it normally does when it has issues with a drug.
"
393,ESRX,"""The market opportunity in the post-transplant Hodgkins lymphoma setting could take Adcetris from $200 million to $250 million (a year) to $250 million to $350 million or higher in sales potentially,"" Butt wrote.
"
394,ESRX,"Getting new indications for Adcetris is a key part of Seattle Genetics' strategy, because even though the drug launched four years ago it still hasn't made the company profitable. Adcetris is also being tested in T cell lymphoma and in the front-line setting in both kinds of lymphoma. In January, the company also announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to test Bristol's hot new cancer drug Opdivo along with Adcetris in various kinds of lymphomas.

396,ESRX,"The FDA has an Aug. 22 deadline for deciding on Aristada, a schizophrenia drug from Alkermes (ALKS). Alkermes created the drug by taking aripiprazole, which under the brand name Abilify was a best-seller for Otsuka and Bristol-Myers before it went off patent this year, and adding its own technology that turns the dosing regimen from daily pill to a monthly injection. Since patient compliance is one of the biggest problems faced by anti-psychotic medicines, generally the less frequent dosing the better.

While it was a leading stock in 2012 and 2013, last year it sacrificed profit growth to invest in R&D and marketing its new drug Vivitrol, while in the most recent quarter revenue also flatlined.

"
401,ESRX,"Connect with Amy Reeves: @IBD_Areeves and Facebook.The second half of August is usually a desert for business news, but the FDA schedule is year-round. Several important drugs are up for approval decisions this month, which could provide some upside for three biotech stocks that have recently been suffering.Getting the most attention will likely be Repatha, Amgen's (AMGN) cholesterol drug. It's expected to be approved by Aug. 27. Repatha is a PCSK9 inhibitor similar to Praluent, the drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) that was approved with much fanfare last month.Given the resemblance between the two drugs, Repatha is widely expected to be approved. In a July 30 research note, Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote that Amgen's drug will probably also get a similar label, which doesn't cover quite as many patients as some had hoped but ""should be sufficiently broad to support our $2.5 billion peak sales estimate.""What will be especially interesting to investors will be the pricing dynamics that come with two drugs appearing on the market. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) has said it hopes to start a price war between the two, similar to what happened when AbbVie (ABBV) launched a rival hepatitis C regimen to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Harvoni late last year. Gilead has maintained dominant market share, but only by rebating near half the drug's list price.""We believe rebating may drive access, as Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen will be directly competing for formulary position,"" Somaiya wrote.

402,ESRX,"Gilead Sciences has been on a winning streak in recent years. But competition and price pressure may push the biotech pace-setter to go for acquisitions to continue the momentum.Gilead's (GILD) Q1 revenue climbed 52 percent from the year-earlier period, while the company's per-share earnings more than doubled. The Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead's annual sales total more than $27 billion, and through the past three years, market value has risen more than fivefold to reach an impressive $177 billion. The stock earns the best possible IBD Composite Rating, 99, which means that the stock has outperformed 99% of all other stocks in a combination of factors including Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings.Gilead has flourished by focusing on treating HIV and hepatitis patients. Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni have chalked up more than half of the company's product sales.But a backlash has been building about Sovaldi, because Gilead has priced the drug at $1,000 per pill or $84,000 for the 12-week life of the treatment.""Any time you get a major move like that one, it's very hard for people to completely forget about it,"" said Michael Holland, head of New York money management firm Holland & Co. ""Management has the task of showing people that the biotech boom isn't ready to end yet — and that Gilead will continue to be a major player in the industry. They have to show the world that they have a strong and long-lasting growth strategy, just in case this kind of bad news surfaces again.""""Consumerism is growing in health care, and Gilead will surely feel pressure because of the prices it charges,"" said Paul Carroll, a partner with Devil's Advocate Group, a consulting firm for CEOs. ""This pressure will take some time to build, because any attempt to deny the use of medicine based on the cost brings people out of the woodwork shouting, 'Death panels!' Gilead needs to be preparing a 'doomsday scenario' to imagine what life will be like in a world when it can no longer charge $1,000 per pill.""Not everyone agrees. ""Despite the rhetoric surrounding Sovaldi, Gilead is in a very strong position strategically,"" says Dan Mendelson, CEO of health business advisor Avalere Health. ""It's in a strong position globally because Hep C is one of the big public health issues of our time.""As Dr. Barnett Mennen, a physician of long experience with the pharmaceutical industry, has said, Sovaldi ""has changed the game for many patients. They've offered a cure. How much is that worth to someone who is suffering?""Where Gilead Is VulnerableFactors other than price may put pressure on Gilead. The company's shares plunged about 15 percent last Dec. 22, reaching a four-month low, after the FDA approved rival AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis-C product.Around the same time, AbbVie forged an agreement with Express Scripts (ESRX) to offer its drug at a lower price. It became the only hepatitis-C product that the big pharmacy-benefit entity sanctioned.Industry observers say that Gilead can handle the pressure. ""It may be looking at a few acquisition targets"" as a way to lock in its continued solid growth, Brian Skorney, an analyst with Baird in Milwaukee, told IBD.Jacob Plieth, senior editorial analyst at EPVantage, also expects Gilead to pursue acquisitions. ""It's hard to know how else they can proceed. ... when you have a competitor coming in.""In a recent earnings conference call, Gilead COO and President John Milligan said, ""We typically like (acquiring companies) where we can have impact on phase three (drug trials) and where we can accelerate those products either into the approval process or integrator indications after the approval process. And I tend to think still we're looking for things where we feel we can catalyze the development of those products and have a greater utility over them overall.""Acquisition TargetsIn early May, Gilead acquired Danish drugmaker EpiTherapeutics. But which other companies would Gilead buy?Skorney is eyeing such potential takeover targets as South Boston, Mass.-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), a global biotech entity that has drawn praise for its work in cystic fibrosis.Vertex could ""fit in nicely with Gilead,"" Skorney said, pointing out that Vertex has put its stamp on treating cystic fibrosis, much as Gilead has focused on hepatitis C. Also, Vertex has more than a dozen continuing programs targeted at other life-threatening diseases.Acquisitions are nothing new to Gilead. In 2011, the company announced an $11 billion acquisition of Pharmasset, giving it further range in treating hepatitis sufferers. The acquisition turned out to be a huge success.But not all acquisitions succeed. ""M&A remains dicey, and there is a long history of bad acquisitions in the pharmaceutical world,"" noted Carroll of Devil's Advocate.Nevertheless, EPVantage's Plieth said, ""Gilead is in a very strong position right now. It has been one of the most amazing biotech stocks, looking back over the past 10-12 years.""

"
423,ESRX,"McKesson (MCK), the biggest in a trio of major distributors that dominate the U.S. market, partners with pharmacy chain Rite Aid (RAD) to deliver drugs from manufacturers to consumers at retail outlets and medical centers.
"
424,ESRX,"Last year the two companies announced a new five-year agreement designed to create drug purchasing and distribution efficiencies. Under that deal, which runs through March 2019, McKesson assumed responsibility for sourcing both branded and generic medications.
"
425,ESRX,"Top-Line Lift
"
426,ESRX,"The agreement helped McKesson post its biggest revenue gain in years during fiscal 2015, which ended in March. The company logged a little more than $179 billion in revenue for the year, up 30% from fiscal 2014.
"
427,ESRX,"McKesson, along with AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) — which partner with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS), respectively — control roughly fourth-fifths of the U.S. drug distribution market.
"
428,ESRX,"The Rite Aid partnership provides McKesson massive scale and purchasing power, analysts say. This in turn gives it both sales volume and pricing advantages, enabling it to grow revenue and maintain favorable profit margins.
"
429,ESRX,"""McKesson is one of the best-positioned firms in the health care industry,"" Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj told IBD. ""They've been a very good performer.""
"
430,ESRX,"The company also has a partnership with Omnicare (OCR), which provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities. However, Bloomberg News has reported that Omnicare has attracted recent buyout interest from Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) and CVS Health, which could threaten the McKesson relationship.
"
431,ESRX,"During its fiscal fourth quarter, McKesson's wholesale drug distribution business drove its sales to grow 19% from a year earlier to $44.9 billion. Excluding one-time items, its earnings from continuing operations climbed 15% to $2.94 a share.
"
432,ESRX,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 13% this fiscal year and another 15% in fiscal 2017.
"
433,ESRX,"McKesson's stock price touched a high of 243.61 on May 19 and currently trades near 231. The stock is up more than 10% in 2015.
"
434,ESRX,"A McKesson spokeswoman said that executives were not available to comment for this article. At a conference in May, Chief Financial Officer James Beer offered a bullish outlook on the fiscal year ahead.
"
435,ESRX,"""We are calling for continued growth and strength right across the distribution solutions business,"" he said.
"
436,ESRX,"Beer pointed to solid generic-drug price increases in fiscal 2015, saying that higher prices were an ""increasingly important factor"" and that this positive trend ""will be the case again in 2016.""
"
437,ESRX,"It's too soon to gauge if the current fiscal year will be as strong on that front as last year, he said. But generic prices are still expected to rise amid heightening demand for drugs to treat a wide array of ailments.
"
438,ESRX,"On the branded drug front, Beer said, McKesson anticipates steady pricing and volume growth in the year ahead as several drugs, including some that treat hepatitis C with high cure rates, are increasingly prescribed.
"
439,ESRX,"Strong prices and volume are both important for drug distributors, which buy medications from manufacturers, store them and then sell them to retail pharmacies and other outlets.
"
440,ESRX,"The distributors profit on the spread between the wholesale price charged by the manufacturer and the retail price that pharmacies set in conjunction with insurers.
"
441,ESRX,"Even if drug prices taper off, distributors can still generate solid profit margins by selling drugs and other products in high volume.
"
442,ESRX,"The majority of McKesson's pharmaceutical distribution business is in North America, but it is pushing for growth internationally. Its 2014 buyout of German drug distributor Celesio helped McKesson grow its sales outside North America by 3% in its latest completed quarter.
"
443,ESRX,"""We continue to view McKesson as one of the best-positioned companies in the pharma supply chain and believe generic drug purchasing, Celesio synergies, and capital deployment could drive upside"" to the stock, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill noted in a June research report.
"
444,ESRX,"CFO Beer said at the May conference that more buyouts could be in the offing ""if we can find attractive opportunities at sensible prices.""
"
445,ESRX,"In a June report, Barclays Capital analyst Eric Percher said that, based on his talks with McKesson management, ""M&A is a clear priority."" Percher suggested that McKesson is most likely to build off of the Celesio deal and make Europe its international priority.
"
446,ESRX,"Similarly, Morningstar's Lekraj said that acquisitions — particularly international ones along the lines of Celesio — would give McKesson added ""global purchasing power"" and complement its U.S. distribution operation.
"
447,ESRX,"Boomer Boost
"
448,ESRX,"Sam Pappas, CEO of Mystic Asset Management and a long-time health care industry investor, told IBD that as populations age in developed parts of the world, including Europe, demand for prescription drugs increases.
"
449,ESRX,"This is particularly evident in the U.S. with the massive baby boomer generation, he said. That, coupled with more Americans now covered by health insurance in the wake of the ObamaCare rollout, means that more people will not only need medications, but more Americans will be able to afford them.
"
450,ESRX,"""The need for health care, including medications, is only going to continue increasing,"" Pappas said.
"
451,ESRX,"Roughly 75 million Americans belong to the baby boomer generation born between 1946 and 1964, according to U.S. Census data.
"
452,ESRX,"As many of them have moved into retirement, Pappas says, they have shown a propensity to seek out medications early and often to treat ailments caused by aging. They do it to remain active, and it drives up overall demand for prescription drugs.
"
453,ESRX,"All of that points to sales growth for prominent prescription-drug distributors such as McKesson, which Lekraj says ""should be one of the better beneficiaries of the trends in health care overall.""With seven straight quarters of double-digit sales growth and five straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth, prescription drug and medical supplies distributor McKesson is in its strongest financial run in years.The company should continue generating robust sales, thanks to a key retail partnership and favorable secular trends in health care, including increasing demand for medications from an aging baby boomer generation.McKesson (MCK), the biggest in a trio of major distributors that dominate the U.S. market, partners with pharmacy chain Rite Aid (RAD) to deliver drugs from manufacturers to consumers at retail outlets and medical centers.Last year the two companies announced a new five-year agreement designed to create drug purchasing and distribution efficiencies.

Its 2014 buyout of German drug distributor Celesio helped McKesson grow its sales outside North America by 3% in its latest completed quarter.""We continue to view McKesson as one of the best-positioned companies in the pharma supply chain and believe generic drug purchasing, Celesio synergies, and capital deployment could drive upside"" to the stock, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill noted in a June research report.CFO Beer said at the May conference that more buyouts could be in the offing ""if we can find attractive opportunities at sensible prices.""In a June report, Barclays Capital analyst Eric Percher said that, based on his talks with McKesson management, ""M&A is a clear priority."" Percher suggested that McKesson is most likely to build off of the Celesio deal and make Europe its international priority.Similarly, Morningstar's Lekraj said that acquisitions — particularly international ones along the lines of Celesio — would give McKesson added ""global purchasing power"" and complement its U.S. distribution operation.Boomer BoostSam Pappas, CEO of Mystic Asset Management and a long-time health care industry investor, told IBD that as populations age in developed parts of the world, including Europe, demand for prescription drugs increases.This is particularly evident in the U.S. with the massive baby boomer generation, he said. That, coupled with more Americans now covered by health insurance in the wake of the ObamaCare rollout, means that more people will not only need medications, but more Americans will be able to afford them.""The need for health care, including medications, is only going to continue increasing,"" Pappas said.Roughly 75 million Americans belong to the baby boomer generation born between 1946 and 1964, according to U.S. Census data.As many of them have moved into retirement, Pappas says, they have shown a propensity to seek out medications early and often to treat ailments caused by aging. They do it to remain active, and it drives up overall demand for prescription drugs.All of that points to sales growth for prominent prescription-drug distributors such as McKesson, which Lekraj says ""should be one of the better beneficiaries of the trends in health care overall.""

464,ESRX,"Among leading big-cap stocks, the medical sector is still king of the hill.Nearly a third of today's members of the IBD Big Cap 20 come from one of the biggest and fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. economy.In IBD's stock research tables, the medical sector is ranked 9th among 33 sectors as of Monday's IBD.That's not great, but still good.Growth investors are more likely to find outstanding gains by homing in on the most dynamic and exciting companies in health care than, say, Utility (currently ranked No. 1), Food/Beverage (No. 4) or Alcohol/Tobacco (No. 5).Of course, these defensive sectors can feature stocks with the muscle to produce gains of 20% to 25% or more from a proper buy point. These days, dividends are looming largely in investor's minds. These industries attract buyers by paying quarterly dividends.But few of these companies are able to produce a blockbuster product the way Amgen (AMGN) did in the 1980s and 1990s with its Epogen and Neupogen treatments for anemia and other cancer-related blood conditions.Today, 29 years after going public on June 17, 1983, Amgen is a mature large cap. It has 778 million shares outstanding, quadruple the number of outstanding shares for Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). Amgen's market value of $64 billion is edging closer to Cisco Systems' (CSCO) $89 billion. It has the largest market value in IBD's biotech group.But Amgen is still showing growth. In July, the Thousand Oaks, Calif., firm completed the buy of KAI Pharmaceuticals, which is developing a treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis.In June, Amgen acquired the Turkish company Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals in order to ""provide a platform for growth in Turkey and the surrounding region.""Amgen CEO Bob Bradway pointed out in a July 26 news release on Q2 results that the biologic AMG 145 for hypercholesterolemia is another exciting prospect in the company's experimental drug pipeline.Amgen's stock has climbed 14% since clearing a flat base-on-base pattern past 72.10 in late June. At this point, it's key to patiently wait for secondary buy opportunities.Elsewhere in the Big Cap 20, HIV specialist Gilead Sciences (GILD) is a recent new breakout, closing Monday 5.1% past a 54.85 entry.Celgene (CELG) has been developing a cup base since peaking at 80.42 on April 3. The stock on Monday returned above the 200-day long-term moving average, a good sign. The specialist in cancer and inflammatory disease-fighting medicines has grown earnings per share 29% to 46% vs. year-ago levels for six quarters in a row.Express Scripts (ESRX) is building a long base-on-base pattern. It tested a 59.08 entry, then retreated 6.6%.

467,ESRX,"U.S. antitrust regulators are weighing whether to scuttle Express Scripts' (ESRX) $29.1 billion buyout of rival pharmacy benefits manager Medco Health Solutions (MHS) as opposition mounts.Reuters reported Monday that key officials within the Federal Trade Commission believe the deal should be stopped, but want to ensure they have enough evidence to stop the deal in court.Reuters also reported that the Food Marketing Institute, which represents the biggest grocery chains, asked the FTC to step in, fearing the merged company could cut payment to supermarket pharmacies that already operate on tight margins.An FTC spokesman declined to comment on the reports or the status of its review. The Food Marketing Institute did not respond to requests for comment.A decision on whether to challenge the acquisition is expected by the end of February or early March, Reuters reported, citing a source closely watching the deal.The report sent both company's shares lower. Express Scripts fell more than 4% in late afternoon trading while Medco lost over 6%. Both had suffered heavier intraday losses. Update: Express Scripts closed down 4.6%. Medco lost 8.1%.Walgreen (WAG), which announced Friday a sharp drop in January prescription sales after losing its business with Express Scripts at the start of the year, rose nearly 2% at the close.Pharmacy benefits managers are hired by insurance companies to handle prescription drug plans. CVS Caremark (CVS) is the latest in that space by revenue, followed by Medco and Express Scripts. CVS reports on Wednesday. Its shares edged lower.Medco and Express Scripts first announced the deal in July and said they expected it to close in the first half of 2012. If it goes through, the merger would give them about a third of the market.A coalition of consumer groups have been urging regulators to block the deal, and a group of state attorneys general have been considering whether to launch their own challenges.The Food Marketing Institute, which includes Wal-Mart (WMT) and Safeway (SWY), joined that opposition with a letter to the FTC earlier this month, Reuters reported. It said the letter noted that ""seven of the largest supermarket chains"" had met with FTC officials to ask that the deal be stopped. It did not identify those chains.Express Scripts says the acquisition will bring efficiencies into the drug-distribution chain and serve as a bulwark against rising prescription drug costs.""We will lower drug costs that are far too high and improve health outcomes for consumers,"" Express Scripts CEO George Paz said in testimony to a U.S. Senate subcommittee in December. ""As the big drug companies merge, as large chain drug stores buy up their competition and demand higher prices, we must become more effective representing the interests of plan sponsors and consumers.""The Obama administration has been wary of big industry mergers.

473,ESRX,"Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) are pricing the world's first approved gene therapies at figures approaching $1 million apiece, but some expected even higher charges, reports said Wednesday.X Spark's Luxturna treats a rare eye disease that causes blindness. Its $425,000 price tag per eye puts it at a total cost of $850,000 for both eyes — yet that was still below many analysts' views that Spark could price its gene therapy above $1 million.Glaxo's drug, Strimvelis, is approved in Europe to treat an immunodeficiency disease often referred to as ""bubble-boy disease"" in children. It costs about $714,000. On Wednesday, a U.K. institute recommended Strimvelis as cost effective, Bloomberg said.Gene therapies are meant to be one-time treatments, which makes the question of pricing tricky. Both therapies from Spark and Glaxo treat small patient populations.Spark outlined its thinking on Luxturna pricing in an email to Investor's Business Daily.""The price reflects the stakeholder considerations we have learned about these past months, including access concerns of patients, families, health care providers and treatment centers; budgetary concerns of public and private payers; and our need to build a sustainable company that addresses the unmet needs of patients with genetic diseases,"" Spark said.IBD'S TAKE: Spark has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 11 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it trails nearly nine in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at stronger stock contenders in the biotech group.In addition to unveiling the price for Luxturna, Spark also detailed a series of payer models and programs to help patients access the drug including an outcomes-based rebate arrangement with Harvard Pilgrim and a contracting model with Express Scripts (ESRX).The contracting model aims to reduce costs to payers. Commercial payers or their pharmacies purchase Luxturna — rather than the treatment centers — and agree to cover treatment for their members, expedite benefits processing and cap out-of-pocket amounts at in-network limits.Under the arrangement, Spark assumes all drug in-transit, storage and handling risks.Spark is also in discussions with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on a proposal that would enable the company to offer payers the option to spread payment for Luxturna out over multiple years, which provides flexibility for greater outcomes-based rebates.Spark also created a support system to help patients navigate the insurance process, provide travel and accommodation help, and assist with other out-of-pocket costs related to treatment.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Spark jumped 4.6% to close at 55.76. Glaxo slipped fractionally to 36.79.RELATED:Biotech Gains First-Ever Approval For Gene Therapy To Treat Eye DiseaseWhy This Biotech Stock Is Defying A Hematology-Related PitfallHow Spark's Gene Therapy Win Could Also Be A Boon For These Biotechs

474,ESRX,"The Phillips curve theory at the heart of the Federal Reserve's approach to raising interest rates as the economic expansion marches ahead is that lower unemployment gives rise to faster wage growth.X Fed policymakers figure that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.Yet those assumptions central to proactive monetary policy — the steady diet of Fed rate hikes even when inflation remains below the Fed's 2% target — have taken some knocks lately.With the jobless rate expected to sink below 4% this year and fall to 3.5% or lower in 2019, one of the biggest questions for financial markets is how much the link between unemployment, wages and inflation will finally assert itself?Soon after tax reform passed in December, dozens of major companies — including Walmart (WMT), CVS Health (CVS), Bank of America (BAC) and Starbucks (SBUX) — announced wage hikes, a reflection of a tightening labor market. It's a good bet that wage growth is heading higher, but how much pricing power will companies really have?Here are five keys to understanding the outlook for inflation and Fed rate-hike policy:To understand why the link between wages and inflation isn't as clear as it once was, Target (TGT) is a good place to start. In September 2017, the discount retailer announced a big wage hike and broad-based price cuts just three weeks apart.The price cuts on thousands of items came shortly after Amazon.com (AMZN) celebrated the close of its Whole Foods acquisition by cutting the upscale natural foods grocer's prices as much as 43% on select items like avocados and kale.Then, in a bid to limit employee turnover and attract 100,000 seasonal workers in a tight labor market, Target hiked its minimum wage from $10 to $11 an hour and committed to a $15 hourly wage by the end of 2020.Higher wages may not feed through to higher prices in the near term when a few huge companies have significant market power and incentives to put market share over profit. Amazon has been rewarded with a massive valuation because of sales growth and the growing reach of its Prime membership, even when its profits disappointed.Internet-enabled transparency also keeps a lid on prices, and that's not just true of retail. Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson has explained that the hotel group doesn't have as much ability to raise prices as it had in past cycles. While home-sharing via Airbnb has some impact on leisure travelers, he sees the bigger issue as ""radical transparency in pricing.""IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. With just a few relatively modest trend reversals, inflation has been moving in only one direction since 1980: lower.After sinking from more than 10% in 1980, core consumer price inflation, which excludes the sometimes-volatile food and energy categories, hasn't touched 3% since 1995. Aggressive Fed rate hikes under Paul Volcker pushed back inflation in the early 1980s, while pre-emptive Fed rate increases in the mid-1990s under Alan Greenspan ushered in the current low-inflation environment.Amid technological advances that empower the consumer and the globalization of manufacturing supply chains, in part to capitalize on lower-wage labor, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index hasn't even touched 2.5% in decades and sat at 1.5% at the end of 2017.Even if tight labor markets and near-3% GDP growth foster a bit more inflation, perspective is in order: Neither investors nor Fed policymakers are likely to get overly concerned.You might guess that the Apple (AAPL) iPhone X, which raised eyebrows with its near-$1,000 starting price when it was released in November 2017, sent the price index for phone equipment surging after its release, and you'd be right — to a point. The Labor Department, which adjusts price changes to account for technological advances, said that phone equipment costs fell 2.6% in January 2018 vs. a year earlier, which was the smallest decline since 2011.The combination of quality improvements, productivity gains in manufacturing and global competition goes a long way to explaining why most inflation is in services. In the year through January, services inflation was running at 2.6%, while goods inflation was just 1.2%. Excluding food and energy, goods inflation was -0.7%.An exception in the goods category is prescription drugs, whose prices always rise, bringing political scrutiny. But prescription-drug prices rose just 2.4% in January vs. a year earlier, roughly half the increase seen in the prior three years. Prescription benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) said average per-member prescription costs of the employer plans it serves rose 1.5%, the lowest since 1993. One key: Generic fill rates rose 86% over the prior year. That likely reflects, in part, the FDA's new expedited generics approval approach, so the gains may be sustained.Likewise, health care services prices rose a historically tame 2% in January. In regulated industries like health care, where prices are rarely transparent and government plays an especially large role, the power to raise prices is limited by the regulator.The Fed's favored PCE price index, unlike the CPI, reflects prices that individuals pay, both directly and indirectly, such as for health care that is subsidized by government and employers. Health care accounts for just over 20% of the PCE index vs. about 9% of the CPI's weight. Meanwhile, housing accounts for a similar 20% of the PCE index, but more than 30% of the CPI. With shelter costs rising 3.2% from a year ago in January, that difference goes a long way to explaining why core CPI inflation typically exceeds core PCE inflation.As labor markets tighten and workers have more opportunity to quit and find greener pastures, companies pressured to raise wages have three possibilities for dealing with their higher compensation costs: increase prices, accept lower profits or offset the higher wage bill by increasing worker output or finding other efficiencies.To some extent, the earnings boost from the Trump tax cuts, which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21%, could make companies more willing to swallow higher wages without passing those costs on to customers. Incentives in the tax bill allowing for immediate expensing of equipment purchases could increase investment to make workers more productive.A key question will be whether heightened wage pressures and bigger investment incentives can combine to get the U.S. out of the productivity rut it's been in for much of the past decade. If so, that could raise the growth ceiling on the economy without stoking inflation.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeChart-Reading Basics: How To Find The Correct Buy Point For Leading StocksBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetWhy A Bull Market Rally Is The Time To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsAI News: Artificial Intelligence Trends And Leading Stocks

""Q4 Invisalign volume was up 34.2% year-over-year reflecting strong international growth from increased utilization and expansion of our customer base which included over 4,000 new customers for the third consecutive quarter.""Stock: Shares for the maker of clear dental aligner devices initially skyrocketed in late trade, then quickly reversed lower to trade down 3.5%. That's after sliding 2.4% to 270.08 in the stock market today. Earlier on Tuesday shares had tumbled as much as 11.5% and briefly sank below their 50-day moving average.Align's intraday breach of the key level violated the previous 266.51 buy point. However, since the stock regained support at the 50-day intraday, a show of strength in the wake of earnings results would have potentially translated to a fresh buying opportunity. Align has rallied more than 300% since its first stage breakout.

477,ESRX,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views. Shares hit a record high intraday Thursday.AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) offered investors positive financial news. AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. The defense giant guided 2018 EPS views higher.Boeing shares rose 1.7% this week and Lockheed 2.25%, both hitting new highs.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) saw its stock surge to a record high after reporting big gains in online services associated with its sports game franchises FIFA and Madden NFL. The boost in Live Services was revealed as part of EA's in-line December-quarter earnings report. Video game hardware and software firm Nintendo (NTDOY) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results thanks to the continued success of its Switch console and related software. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share. Vertex reported sales of $651.6 million and adjusted profit of 61 cents per share. AstraZeneca reported core earnings of $1.30 per share and $5.78 billion in sales. Merck's results were mixed with $10.43 billion on the top line missing views, but adjusted income of 98 cents per share beat by 4 cents. Amgen (AMGN) reported $5.8 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share, lagging the consensus. In merger news, Sanofi (SNY) announced it would acquire Ablynx (ABLX) for $4.8 billion.Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell well short of consensus while fellow Dow industrials component Chevron (CVX) also missed EPS views. Both shares plunged below their 50-day lines, with Chevron undercutting a recent buy point. Separately, U.S. crude production continues to hit fresh longtime highs, while crude supplies rose for the first time in 11 weeks. Crude futures remain near three-year highs.Ferrari (RACE) gapped into a buy zone after reporting strong earnings Thursday. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales slumped in January, with big declines from Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). GM (GM) sales edged higher, but missed views. Toyota (TM) sales skyrocketed on strong truck sales.

478,ESRX,"Despite the sell-off in health stocks Tuesday, a joint venture by Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to wring out cost savings from the health care system appears very unlikely to impact industry earnings over the next couple of years, according to analysts.X Figuring out how to rein in health costs without the participation of big health care players looks like a near-impossible task, Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo said. ""We note that the cost to implement systems, adjudicate patient data, and partner with hospitals, doctors, pharmacies on a national basis is onerous.""Caliendo adds that the scale of the big three new partners wouldn't be big enough to squeeze discounts out of providers by steering patients their way, compared to the purchasing power of UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). ""The new company will have to align itself with all these other providers in some way to provide the best care for its employees,"" Caliendo concludes.In fact, Caliendo gave CVS a big vote of confidence earlier Tuesday, saying its planned combination with Aetna positions it to create savings for the government and private employers. Needham raised its rating on CVS to strong buy with a 100 target.Caliendo does think that ""profits in the industry, especially at the underwriting level, are excessive,"" and there are improvements to the current care delivery model that can be made. He sees that as a prime reason behind the CVS-Aetna deal.CVS is looking to shift more health care services to the lowest-cost location: its in-store clinics. That's a different take on UnitedHealth's playbook of expanding into urgent care and other outpatient locales to drive savings for customers.But no such path forward was evident in the announcement from Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire. The plan to establish an independent company ""is in its early planning stages,"" according to a statement by the trio.""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" acknowledged Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett.""Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation,"" said Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Yet it's unclear at this point who any of those talented experts will be.As Wall Street weighed the long-term nature of the effort and the dearth of substantive details, the initial shock wave that rippled across Wall Street subsided. Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer, sank 4.35% to 236.65 on the stock market today, after diving as much as 6.2% earlier. CVS Health, which is in the process of buying Aetna, pared losses to a 4.1% drop.Drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) were down 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Prescription benefit management firm Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.2%, but had tumbled 11.4% earlier. Both CVS and UnitedHealth also operate PBMs, which manage the prescription side of health insurance contracts.Pharmaceuticals and biotech stocks also lost ground, though the hit didn't look much worse than the broader market downdraft on Tuesday. Merck (MRK) shed 1.6%, Allergan (AGN) 1.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) 1.7% Pfizer (PFE) lost 3.1% despite topping earnings views and offering bullish guidance.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Insurers have been solid performers, ranked No. 43 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The knee-jerk reaction among investors is surely a reflection of the unsustainably high cost of health care in the U.S., and the fact that Amazon, which has been itching to disrupt the retail prescription business, is attached to the effort.Traditionally, the fear among health care investors has been that government — not the private sector — will impose cost controls to get a handle on runaway budget deficits, thinning out industry profits in the process. Medicare negotiating drug costs is one such fear, but industry experts say that the government is unlikely to produce much in the way of savings unless it is willing to deny patients access to certain drugs, which could create a political backlash.But Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire aren't the first big employers to join forces to attack health costs. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte noted on Tuesday that the Health Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 large self-insured employers that launched last year, also hopes to find savings and improve employee satisfaction, though it's working with CVS and UnitedHealth to achieve its aims. Initial reports indicated that alliance members expected to save a combined $600 million in prescription costs over three years.Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire say their initial focus will be on ""technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost."" The new corporate entity, they say, will be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""Just what form those technology solutions would take is far from clear. Caliendo supposes that ""Berkshire might bring some underwriting skills (although they've never underwritten healthcare) and AMZN might make pharmacy and medical procurement contributions and provide IT expertise.""Leerkink's Gupte says she's unclear whether Amazon wading deeper into solving the health care mess will accelerate its move into the supply chain of the prescription industry.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why Trump's State Of The Union Might Move Markets Up — Or DownStocks Fall As Market Shows 3 Signs It May Be Ready For A BreakGrubhub, Redhat Lead These Three IBD 50 Stocks In Buy RangeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

481,ESRX,"Invest in the disruptors.That's the advice from Wall Street, as giant biotech companies and the incumbents of Big Pharma are bracing to get crushed by more innovative — and cheaper — new drugs.X What started in 2017 will continue in 2018, analysts say. Generic drug approvals are rising and interesting new medicines are starting to take market share from the legacy makers of medications that consumers use frequently, including both Big Pharma and biotech companies.Blockbuster drugs representing an estimated $17 billion in annual sales are set to lose patent protection over the next decade, analysts say. Disruption will come as generic drugs and innovative new biologic alternatives come on the market.""It will be brutal,"" JMP Securities analyst Mike King told Investor's Business Daily. ""It will be a knife fight.""In the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs, King expects Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) to feel the heat from the likes of Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR), The Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).Meanwhile, in anti-inflammatory treatments, Celgene's (CELG) Otezla, which gained blockbuster status in 2016, missed sales forecasts by a wide cut in the third quarter. Analysts say newly approved drugs to treat the same conditions from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS) are taking market share.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still feeling the pain from the maturing of its hepatitis C drug unit in the U.S. and Europe. The rapid pace of Gilead's hepatitis C sales decline is expected to slow down somewhat, but newer medicines like AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret are likely to swipe some of its sales.Big Pharma isn't getting any help from regulators either. Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb will continue to increase approvals for copycat drugs, stoking competition for both branded and generic drugs facing new rivals as firms try to undercut one another in price.Among the Big Pharma companies, Pfizer (PFE) will be at the forefront feeling the sting of generics taking sales. Earlier this month, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) was allowed to launch a generic copy of the blockbuster erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.Generic drugs tend to be cheaper than their branded counterparts and Viagra is a pricey drug at about $70 per tablet, according to AccessRX. In 2013, after Pfizer lost exclusivity for Viagra in Canada and Europe, worldwide sales fell 8% to $1.88 billion.Today, generics in Europe have slashed the price of drugs containing the same active ingredient as Viagra by about 90%. Generic versions of Viagra cost about a third of the price in Canada. U.S. Viagra prices could also fall if the trend repeats itself with a generic on the market.Teva, meanwhile, is struggling with $34.7 billion in debt as of the end of the third quarter. On Thursday, Teva announced a plan to cut its workforce by more than a quarter, close several manufacturing facilities and suspend its dividend on ordinary shares.The firm is also planning to review its generic drug portfolio, most specifically in the U.S., to change prices or discontinue products.IBD'S TAKE: See how giant biotechs fared vs. smaller players in the third quarter by visiting the Industry Snapshot. Hint: The quarter was classified as ""alarming"" for one large-cap biotech which could be in trouble as they see more competition for their traditional moneymakers.Across the board, spending on prescription drugs in 2016 increased by just 3.8% per person, according to a report from Express Scripts (ESRX). That's down from a 5.2% rise in 2015, representing a 27% drop in the growth rate.That trend is likely to continue in 2018, FBB Capital Partners analyst Mike Bailey told IBD. He credits Gottlieb for the decline in generic prices. Gottlieb is running the FDA like a business, which allows for a cycle of more approvals, more competition and lower prices.Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could use their tools to influence pricing, it's unlikely President Trump will use his executive powers to enact sweeping drug-pricing reform such as allowing Medicare to negotiate prices or enacting outright pricing controls, Bailey says.""I wouldn't expect any major changes out of the Trump administration in pricing,"" he said. ""I think mechanically and politically it's difficult to get pricing law through the system. It's politically more acceptable to just get more generic drug approvals. It's a win-win.""JMP's King counts drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis as among those in the ""crowded areas."" In 2016, drugs in this class cost an average $3,588 per prescription and benefited from increases in utilization and unit cost, according to Express Scripts.But in the third quarter of 2017, things began to look dour for the likes of Celgene, which missed expectations for its inflammation drug Otezla by 26%. In the U.S., the lag was even sharper at 28%. One analyst suggested Celgene was forced to take a price concession.Celgene also cut its guidance for 2020 after terminating trials of a drug to treat Crohn's disease, a condition that results from chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. It now sees inflammation and immunology drugs bringing in a combined $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in 2020, down from the $4 billion outlook it issued in 2015.Biotech companies and Big Pharma will need to ""get realistic"" on their pricing in these competitive arenas, King says. The same could be said for companies making treatments for hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and high cholesterol. All are highly saturated markets.To the latter point, he expects prices for drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha from Amgen and Praluent from Regeneron and Sanofi to be under the microscope. These drugs lower bad LDL cholesterol in the blood. Evidence shows they also have a benefit on some cardiovascular outcomes.Repatha is listed at $14,100 per year, while Praluent costs $14,600. But rivals are closing in. Medicines Co. and Alnylam are working on another cholesterol drug, known as inclisiran. Meanwhile, analysts expect bempedoic acid from Esperion to be cheaper.Some of these Big Pharma and biotech companies ""are probably going to get their arms twisted a lot,"" King said. ""The pricing umbrella has created opportunities for new companies to come in and scale market share. Be careful if you own incumbents. Invest in the disruptors.""Other areas are seemingly immune to pricing pressure, analysts say.In 2016, the price of multiple sclerosis drugs rose an average 7.4%. That's a continuing trend, FBB's Bailey said. The price increases have been so egregious that House Democrats launched an investigation in August, noting that many of these drugs carry price tags north of $85,000 per year.The investigation was launched by Reps. Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch and centers on Bayer (BAYRY), Biogen (BIIB), EMD Sereno, Novartis, Roche (RHHBY), Sanofi and Teva.Among those pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Teva's 20-milligram dose of Copaxone has increased the most, rising 1,002% since its approval in 1996 to an annual price of $91,401 today, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Novartis' Gilenya, approved in 2010, is the highest priced at $91,836.The investigation is ""10 years too late,"" he said. ""It's more difficult to push price control for specialty markets. Multiple sclerosis is a massive market now, but stakeholders view it as a specialty market.""Rare disease and innovative cancer therapies also seem immune to pricing controls, analysts say. For example, earlier this year Novartis and Gilead — via its acquisition of Kite Pharma — gained approval for CAR-T drugs known as Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.CAR-T drugs are developed using a patient's own immune system cells. They are trained to seek out and destroy cancer cells. Kymriah goes for $475,000 per year and Yescarta is listed at $373,000, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy wrote in a recent post.""While gene therapies are beginning to cure cancer, they come at a price that can cause sticker stock,"" she said. ""That said, compared to traditional therapies that suppress, but do not cure cancer, the cost benefit analysis of gene therapy is compelling.""Pricing shock tends to tamp down on excitement for really compelling drugs, Bailey says. The prime example is Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, the first spinal muscular atrophy drug approved. It costs $750,000 in its first year and $375,000 in subsequent years.But sentiment for the biotech companies' shares is already down, he said. So drug pricing concerns shouldn't be a big stock killer in 2018.""In the past when biotech stocks go up quickly, they get new drugs and people are excited, a lot of times someone will throw in a grenade: 'What about drug pricing?'"" Bailey said. ""But sentiment is already down. Even if there's a concern about drug pricing, I see a little less downside.""IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group is now ranked No. 34 out of 197 groups tracked, and has fallen from first just two months ago. Shares collectively neared a two-year high in October, but have since shucked almost 7% from that point.Over that same time, Amgen and Celgene — among the biggest biotechs — have seen their share prices dive 9% and 26%, respectively. Regeneron has taken a 19% hit and Gilead has tumbled 14%.Meanwhile, Alnylam and Esperion, which look likely to rival PSCK9 inhibitor drugmakers like Amgen and Regeneron, have lifted 7% and 5%, respectively. AbbVie, which recently launched a rival to Gilead's hepatitis C franchise, is up 5%.But Novartis and Lilly, which are competing against Celgene to treat inflammatory conditions, have seen their shares retreat, though to a smaller degree. Respectively, their share prices are down 1% and 2%, matching a 1% dip in IBD's 42-company Ethical Drugs industry group.Generic drug stocks, ranked No. 105 out of 197 groups, have actually broadly risen 2% since mid-October. But that's against respective 8% and 5% dips for Teva and Mylan (MYL), its two biggest names.RELATED:Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tTop 6 Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New Awards

482,ESRX,"Aetna (AET) easily topped Wall Street's third-quarter earnings estimates Tuesday even as it fell short on revenue. But the health insurer said it won't comment on reports that it is in talks to be acquired by CVS Health (CVS). The drugstore giant and pharmacy benefit manger is mulling a reported $66 billion as tries to position itself for the entry of Amazon.com (AMZN) into the retail prescription business.XMeanwhile, rival health insurer WellCare Health (WCG) soared back into a buy zone on its blowout earnings.Aetna earnings per share rose 18% to $2.45 as revenue fell 5% to $14.99 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of $2.08 and revenue of $15.11 billion. Aetna raised its full-year 2017 EPS guidance to $9.75 from the $9.45 to $9.55 range offered in early August and the $9.49 analyst consensus. But given the 27-cent beat in Q3, that implies Q4 EPS roughly in line.WellCare Health earned $4.08 a share, up 150% vs. a year earlier and more than doubled the expected $1.90. Revenue grew 25% to $4.403 billion though that was just below the consensus for $4.411 billion.Aetna shares fell 0.7% to 170.05 on the stock market today, continuing to slip from Thursday's 11.5% spike to 180.70 when news of CVS merger talks hit.WellCare shares jumped 9.1% to 197.67, hitting a record high and retaking a 184.98 buy point.Meanwhile, CVS shares rose 0.1%, but that's after tumbling more than 9% over the prior three sessions to their lowest levels since early 2014 on the buzz that it was offering $66 billion for Aetna.Amazon shares, which surged Friday on better-than-expected earnings, edged higher early, continuing to rally after  surging 13.2% Friday on its blowout Q3 earnings.Aetna highlighted Medicare as the company's primary growth driver, with 23,000 new members added in the quarter and plans to expand its geographic footprint in 2018. Aetna ended the period with 22.2 million insured members.The revenue decline reflected a one-year suspension of the Affordable Care Act health insurer fee that is tacked on to premiums, a pullback from the ObamaCare individual market and Medicaid contract losses.Management said the restoration of the health insurance fee would knock 25 cents off of 2018 EPS.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,400 on Friday, up more than 1,500 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Analysts have been somewhat divided over the benefits of a CVS-Aetna deal, with some saying it would provide negotiating leverage with drug manufacturers and others warning that other health plans might distance themselves from CVS. Antitrust also may be an issue.A CVS-Aetna deal is seen as a challenge to the dominance of UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which spearheaded the combination of managed care and prescription benefit management with its 2015 acquisition of Catamaran, now OptumRx. UnitedHealth shares slipped 1.5% on Monday. UnitedHealth is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, revenue, margin and stock performance trends.Express Scripts (ESRX), as a stand-alone prescription benefit manager, is seen as increasingly vulnerable and a potential takeover target. Shares of Express Scripts dipped 0.1% after a 1.4% loss Monday.RELATED:CVS Health Looks To Buy Aetna As Amazon Threat Gets RealAmazon Blows Past Earnings Views, Beats On Sales; Shares SoarAnthem Jumps Into Prescription Business As Amazon Speculation SwirlsAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

483,ESRX,"CVS Health (CVS) will buy Aetna (AET) for about $67.5 billion, creating a health-care giant that will have a hand in everything from insurance to the corner drugstore.X CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, with $145 a share in cash and the rest in stock, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That's a 29% premium to Aetna's share price on Oct. 25, the day before the companies were reported to be in talks.The deal is among the biggest health-care mergers of the past decade, combining the largest U.S. drugstore chain with the third-biggest health insurer. CVS also manages drug-benefits plans for employers and insurers, a business that could help steer some of Aetna's 22 million customers into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription. The deal will give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.Including CVS's assumption of Aetna's debt, the deal will be valued at $78 billion. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said.In a joint interview, CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said combining the companies would help CVS expand a variety of retail medical services, from vision care to nutrition advice to audiology, making basic care more convenient and less costly for consumers. Aetna will be operated as a separate business unit, and any new services will be designed to appeal broadly to customers of other insurance companies as well, the executives said.The immediate financial benefits of the deal are projected to be relatively modest. The companies said they expect $750 million in synergies, and profit improvements in the low-to-mid single digits the second full year after the merger is completed. The companies are betting on longer-term profit from reshaping how their customers get care, by creating what the executives are calling ""10,000 new front doors for the health-care system'' at CVS's stores and clinics.""Think of these stores as a hub of a new way of accessing health-care services across America,'' Merlo said in the joint interview. ""We're bringing health care to where people live and work.''s into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription through CVS's drug plans. It will also give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.The deal will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. Barclays, Goldman Sachs. and Bank of America have committed to provide $49 billion of financing, the person said. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018 and create cost savings of about $750 million, said the person.After the deal closes, Aetna will operate as a separate unit run by members of the current management. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini will join the CVS board, along with two other Aetna directors.It comes as the health sector is looking over the horizon at Amazon.com (AMZN), and how the company could shake up the business of buying, distributing and selling drugs and medical products if it gets into health care. The retail industry has been battered by the online giant. Amazon hasn't revealed its plans.""One of the problems with the health-care system is it's so fragmented and there's so little coordination,"" said Steve Kraus, who invests in health firms at Bessemer Venture Partners. ""A better vertically integrated less-siloed system is a good thing in my mind.""It could also set off a new round of takeovers as CVS and Aetna's competitors look at the reshaped landscape. On Nov. 30, the CEO of Express Scripts (ESRX) said the pure-play pharmacy benefits manager would be open to a deal at the right price, though wasn't actively looking for one.""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview. He also mentioned the possibility of partnering with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement.Express Scripts is just one company in a universe of independent drug plans, insurers and supply-chain middlemen. WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Humana (HUM) and Centene (CNC) could become merger targets after the CVS-Aetna deal, according to Matthew Borsch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Drug distributors like Cardinal Health (CAH) or McKesson (MCK), and retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) could also face pressure to find partners.CVS, which operates about 9,700 retail stores and 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, has been moving beyond it drugstore roots for years. In 2007, it bought pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx — a business that made up almost half of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company's operating profit in the third quarter. In 2014, CVS stopped selling cigarettes and added ""Health"" to its name.""Aetna has emphasized its desire to move care closer to the consumer,"" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst at Jefferies, said on Oct. 26. ""CVS's capabilities, including Minute Clinic and the Coram home infusion business, could enable the health plan to improve health outcomes and reduce cost trend.""Consolidation is picking up among health-care suppliers and administrators, as insurers seek more control over how their consumers get care. But two proposed megamergers among insurers — including a deal between Aetna and Humana — were blocked this year on antitrust grounds, leading the companies to look beyond rival insurers to different types of health-care companies for potential deals.The CVS-Aetna deal antitrust prospects may depend on which U.S. regulator is tasked with reviewing it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. The Federal Trade Commission has been less critical of consolidation among companies in adjacent businesses, known as vertical consolidation. The Justice Department, on the other hand, last month sued to block the merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), a vertical deal.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said the DOJ effort to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal does raises concerns but a CVS-Aetna deal does have a path forward. Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug plan business, he said.The biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), is also the most diversified. United owns doctor clinics and an outpatient surgery chain, and also has a pharmacy-benefits management, called OptumRx, built on the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in 2015
"
484,ESRX,"Anthem (ANTM), the second-largest U.S. health insurer, said on Wednesday that it will launch its own pharmacy-benefit management business, relying heavily on CVS Health (CVS) for both back-end processing and retail distribution.The five-year Anthem-CVS deal will take effect in 2020, after Anthem's current contract with Express Scripts (ESRX) expires.Anthem's move brings it closer to resembling the model established by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which bought pharmacy-benefits manager Catamaran for $12.8 billion in 2015. Cigna (CI) also has established its own pharmacy-benefits management business.Amazon.com (AMZN) reportedly is close to entering the prescription-dispensing field, with several analysts speculating that Amazon might acquire a PBM to gain entry into the $300 billion business.CVS Health, the No. 2 U.S. drugstore operator, has served as a PBM since its 2006 acquisition of Caremark.Shares of Anthem closed up 2.4% at 191.79 on the stock market today, rising earlier to 199.23, briefly topping a 199.08 buy point. CVS Health gained 2% to 74.07.Express Scripts, which expressed disappointment at losing Anthem's business, opened lower but reversed higher, settling with a 1% gain at 57.77. The reason for the rebound wasn't immediately clear, though analysts have speculated that Express Scripts could be a target for Amazon.Cigna rose 1.1%, while UnitedHealth added 0.7% after hitting a record high on Tuesday following release of strong third-quarter earnings. Amazon dipped 1.2% to 997, back below the 1,000 level.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem are closing in on a buy point at 199.08. That's the point at which investors have the best odds of seeing near-term gains. Anthem is ranked No. 8 among IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see who the leaders are and find out how your stocks rank in each of 197 industry groups.A PBM essentially does for prescription benefits what managed-care companies do in managing nonprescription health benefits and claims. PBMs seek to lower the costs of pharmacy benefits by using their expertise and buying power to direct the most appropriate medicines to patients at the lowest cost.While Amazon wants to get into the retail prescription business, it faces a big challenge in dealing with the regulatory-compliance and claims-processing aspects of the business. That's where a PBM's expertise and processing systems come in. However, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes has said that the most logical path forward for Amazon would be to form a partnership with UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer.When asked, on UnitedHealth's earnings call on Tuesday, about the potential for Amazon to enter the prescription-dispensing business, management said they are ""willing to partner with anybody that drives value"" with the goal of meeting consumers ""how and where they want.""RELATED:UnitedHealth Signals Openness To Amazon Partnership; Earnings BeatAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

485,ESRX,"Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) toppled Monday along with retailers Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS), continuing to slide on the potential that Amazon.com (AMZN) could disrupt the pharma world by venturing into online prescription drug sales, prodding an analyst to downgrade Express Scripts.XOn the stock market today, Express Scripts dove 5% to 59.22, touching a six-month low intraday. CVS fell 3.4% to an 11-month low. Walgreens sank 3.2% to its lowest in nearly three years. On Friday, Express Scripts lost 2.6% while CVS and Walgreens plunged 4.9%.Raymond James analyst Michael Baker downgraded Express Scripts to underperform from a market perform rating, citing ""escalating competitive pressures"" given its pure-play model as a pharmacy benefits manager and the possibility that ""wild card"" Amazon could enter the market.""The 2019 selling season is shaping up to be more competitive than 2018,"" Baker wrote in a note to clients. ""Commentary suggests that some opportunities were pushed from 2018 to 2019 with about $1.5 billion scripts 'in play' for 2019-20 combined.""Competitor Prime Therapeutics is unlikely to win a contract with Anthem (ANTM), meaning it will likely go after Blue Cross Blue Shield contracts held by Express Scripts totaling $10 billion to $12.5 billion in total drug spending, Baker said.IBD'S TAKE: The medtech space has been less affected in 2017 by drug-pricing worries than the pharma and biotech spaces. Can the space climb higher still this year? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at the group and strong performers within it.Express Scripts also has four Blue Cross Blue Shield contracts up for bid in 2019, worth about $8.5 billion in drug spending, he estimated.Adding to that pressure, web giant Amazon is rumored to be considering an entrance into the online prescription drug sales market with a decision expected before Thanksgiving. In an email on Friday, Amazon declined to comment to Investor's Business Daily.""We see two potential routes if it decided to enter: Team up with a distributor to target the cash-pay market, or make a bigger splash by going after the insured market,"" Baker said. ""There are two different ways to penetrate the insured market: Partner with existing PBMs or purchase a PBM.""Baker trimmed his adjusted earnings per share view to $7.55 from $7.60 for Express Scripts in 2018. He kept his $7 estimate for 2017 and issued a $8.33 model for 2019. The latter forecast is 23 cents below the consensus.RELATED:Amazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

"
486,ESRX,"Even though CVS Health (CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) have repeatedly thrown cold water on the idea that Amazon.com (AMZN) will take on the $300 billion prescription dispensing industry, the idea just won't die.XOn Thursday, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes seemed to up the ante on Amazon's rumored interest in the sector, saying he expects it to happen. According to a write up from TheFly.com, Wilkes sees Amazon either buying or partnering with a pharmacy benefit management company, which would help drive volume and navigate industry regulations.Wilkes has been working in and covering the health care services arena for a quarter century, so his perspective that Amazon is well positioned to disrupt the industry may carry weight with investors. He noted his concern that Amazon's entry could negative effect PBM industry earnings.The report about Amazon is likely a longer run concern for investors, so the pharmacy focus Thursday was on weak sales from Rite Aid (RAD), which cited ""a challenging reimbursement rate environment"" and new generics holding down prescription prices as it reported earnings.Amazon shares added 0.6%, heading back toward its 50-day moving average. Rite Aid shares tumbled 11% to 2.03, hitting a four-year low on the stock market today. CVS, which is both drugstore and PBM, slipped 0.3%, while Walgreens lost 0.8%. Walgreens this month won FTC approval to buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores after a long battle to buy all of its smaller rival fell apart due to regulatory objections.Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which operates the OptumRx pharmacy benefit management company, rose 0.8% but lagged behind the solid gains seen by other managed care players. Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest pure-play PBM, was 0.2% higher.The health care group suffering the most on Thursday were drug distributors. McKesson (MCK) fell 1.4%, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 1.75% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 1.7%.If Amazon were to enter the pharmaceutical industry, some industry watchers have speculated that it might cut out distributors and deal directly with drug manufacturers.IBD'S TAKE: IBD premium features are free through Oct. 8.

You can also read The Big Picture, a daily update of the underlying market trend. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market-trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green.  During its Q2 earnings call on Aug. 8, CVS CEO Larry Merlo discussed a host of reasons why the industry might not play to Amazon's strong suit.In addition to being a distribution point, ""pharmacy is also about the clinical outcomes that are provided,"" Merlo said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript. ""In an environment where there's a migration to more value-based care, those clinical capabilities are going to continue to grow in importance.""Merlo said the ""highly regulated"" industry has high barriers to entry, and noted all the work required between pharmacists, payers and physicians. He added that patients put trust in their retail pharmacists, adding that mail-order pharmacy has declined in recent years.Some have speculated that Amazon could use Whole Foods locations as a place for in-store pharmacy pickups.RELATED:This $300 Billion Market Could Be Amazon's Next Casualty — Or NotRite Aid Stock Crashes On Same-Store DeclineStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

535,ESRX,"Allergan (AGN), Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) stocks fell Wednesday after the U.S. Department of Justice accused two former pharmaceutical executives of colluding to fix generic drug prices.Former Heritage Pharmaceuticals CEO Jeffrey Glazer and Jason Malek, an ex-president, were charged Wednesday in Philadelphia with conspiring to fix prices for an antibiotic and a diabetes med, all felonies, the DOJ said in a release.Both were fired from Heritage in August, according to a Bloomberg report, citing a lawsuit filed last month in New Jersey. Heritage accused Glazer and Malek of stealing tens of millions of dollars by siphoning profits in various racketeering schemes.The FBI is prepared to go after pharma companies that violate antitrust laws, said Special Agent in Charge Michael Harpster, in a statement after filing the charges. Drug price collusion ""skews the market and flouts common decency,"" he said.""It's a sad state of affairs when these pharmaceutical executives are determined to further pad their profits on the backs of people whose health depends on the company's drugs,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have nearly returned to their pre-election levels on recent commentary by Donald Trump that he would work to cut down on drug prices.On Wednesday, Teva stock fell 1.8%, Mylan 1.6% and Allergan 0.48%. IBD's 17-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group fell 0.81%.The charges are the first in a two-year investigation of generic drugmakers, including Allergan, Mylan, Teva, Lannett (LCI), Impax Laboratories (IPXL), Covis Pharma, Sun Pharmaceutical, Mayne Pharma, Taro Pharmaceuticals (TARO) and Endo International (ENDP).In an emailed statement, Edison, N.J.-based Heritage Pharma said: ""In August 2016, following an internal investigation that revealed a variety of serious misconduct by the individuals charged today, Heritage Pharmaceuticals terminated them.  We are fully cooperating with all aspects of the Department of Justice's continuing investigation.""Recently Heritage initiated its own legal action against these same individuals to seek redress for an elaborate embezzlement and self-dealing scheme.  We are deeply disappointed by the misconduct and are committed to ensuring it does not happen again.""Last month, Allergan and Sun Pharma declined to comment to IBD. Mylan said it had disclosed a subpoena regarding antibiotic doxycycline. But there's been no subpoena for information on the pricing tactics of digoxin, a blood pressure med.CEOs across the drug and biotech market have commented on rising drug prices in light of recent commentary by President-elect Donald Trump that he's ""going to bring down drug prices."" Hillary Clinton was often seen as tougher on drug prices.Earlier Wednesday, Express Scripts (ESRX) CEO Timothy Wentworth joined the fracas, saying he doesn't see a major impact to business if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. But, he said on a guidance call with analysts, the overarching drug price conversation isn't going away.""There is no question in my mind that conversation is not going to go away, and that we need to demonstrate using both our tools, but our clients' voice as well to demonstrate that,"" he said, according to MarketWatch.Shares of the pharmacy benefit management company tanked as much as 6.5% Wednesday and ended the day down 3.6% at 70.52, when below their 50-day line.

536,ESRX,"CVS Health (CVS) on Tuesday said that a measure of growth in its pharmacy benefit clients' prescription-drug spending slowed to 5% last year from 11.8% in 2014.But ""(price) inflation in non-specialty brands outweighed all other trend drivers,"" the company said in a statement. Specialty drugs, as well as new launches and rising costs, ""had less impact than inflation of brands in high-volume categories such as drugs used to treat diabetes.""The announcement follows two years in which the price of specialty drugs has been under increased scrutiny.""The double-digit drug trend increases we were experiencing in 2014 resulted in a call to action from our clients to help them ensure their plan members could access the medications they need to stay healthy, at an affordable price,"" CVS Health Executive Vice President Jonathan Roberts said.CVS shares finished 0.7% lower in the stock market today. Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) fell 0.1% and Rite Aid (RAD), which Walgreens is buying, eased 0.1%.In 2014, the price of specialty drugs, exemplified by the near six-digit treatment price of hepatitis drugs from Gilead Sciences (GILD), became a lightning rod for criticism. Pharmacy benefit managers such as CVS and Express Scripts (ESRX) have since negotiated discounts from drugmakers in exchange for coverage.In 2015, the lightning rod became the practice of some companies, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals, which bought obscure drugs on the cheap and hiked their prices.CVS has tried to curb usage of Valeant's Jublia, a toenail fungus drug that reportedly has a retail price of around $1,000 for an 8-milliliter bottle. On Monday, according to Bloomberg, CVS said it would launch an optional program in April intended to steer patients toward cheaper treatments.CVS clients' spending on Jublia soared 950% last year, Bloomberg said, adding that Express Scripts said it would also try to bring down the price of toenail fungus treatments.Gilead Sciences shares dipped 0.8%, Express Scripts closed down 0.6%, and Valeant climbed 4.4%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

537,ESRX,"Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) on Tuesday issued 2016 earnings-per-share guidance of $6.08 to $6.28, solidly above views for $6.04, but analysts expressed concerns about the company's contract with health insurer Anthem (ANTM).Express Scripts shares settled 0.6% lower in the stock market today, after rising as much as 2% earlier. Anthem closed up 0.5%.In a conference call discussing the outlook, Express Scripts said it was reviewing the pricing of its contract with Anthem, its largest client, and expected the companies to reach a ""mutually beneficial"" agreement, according to Reuters. But it was unclear when an agreement would be struck and what it would look like.Given the absence of an agreement, the guidance issued Tuesday did not reflect any potential changes to Express' contract with Anthem. The terms of 10-year agreement, which began in 2009, allow the companies to re-evaluate pricing occasionally, Reuters said.""Questions regarding its long-term relationship with Anthem will continue to be a concern for investors,"" FBR said in a note.Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said the review presented ""a number of variables that prevent clarity on timing or financial ramifications.""And contracts aside, BMO analyst Jennifer Lynch said in a note Tuesday that she did ""not view the newly issued guidance as a game-changer to the story.""Express held to its EPS guidance this year of $5.51 to $5.55. Analysts expect $5.53. The company sees 2016 adjusted claims of 1.255 billion to 1.295 billion, roughly in line with guidance this year.Still, management during the call said it was happy with initial results from the selling season, Muken said.""Our focused model of alignment has positioned us uniquely in the health care services landscape to improve health outcomes and lower costs for our clients and patients,"" CEO George Paz said in a statement.Most recently, Express Scripts this month said it would partner with Imprimis Pharmaceuticals (IMMY) to promote what it called a cheaper alternative to Daraprim, the toxoplasmosis drug that became some 5,000% more expensive this year after it was acquired by Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals.CVS Health (CVS), which bought pharmacy benefits manager Caremark in 2007, finished up 2.4%.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

538,ESRX,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) signaled openness to partnering with Amazon (AMZN), which is reportedly considering a push into the prescription-dispensing business, after beating Q3 earnings forecasts.XThe insurer's Optum business, a provider of health services, prescription benefit management and technology services, has been a growth driver and helps the company stand apart from the rest of the managed-care market.Asked about the potential for Amazon to enter the prescription-dispensing business, OptumRx unit CEO John Prince said that the company is ""willing to partner with anybody that drives value"" with the goal of meeting consumers ""how and where they want.""Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes wrote earlier in October that he sees a partnership with UnitedHealth as the most logical path forward for Amazon as it targets the prescription business.Shares of UnitedHealth jumped 5.5% to close at a record high of 203.89 on the stock market today, bouncing off support at their 50-day average and helping the Dow Jones industrial average climb toward 23,000. Amazon edged up 0.3%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) rose 0.7%, and drug distributor McKesson (MCK) dipped 0.1%. CVS Health (CVS), which also has a PHM unit, added 0.3%.UnitedHealth is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, behind Centene (CNC) and Cigna (CI), based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Centene rose 3.2% and Cigna 1.2% Tuesday, helped by a bipartisan deal to fund ObamaCare subsidies for insurers.IBD'S TAKE: Get ready for each earnings season day by reading IBD's daily Investing Action Plan, which highlights stocks that are in buy range or close to it. UnitedHealth's EPS surged 23% to $2.66, beating views for $2.57, as revenue climbed 8.7% to $50.322 billion, matching forecasts. Optum revenue rose 8.4% to $22.89 billion.The company raised its guidance for full-year earnings to about $10 per share vs. its prior range for $9.75-$9.90. Analysts had expected $9.87.Because the insurer has extricated itself from the ObamaCare exchanges and GOP efforts to target Medicaid have run into trouble, it's well positioned to deal with shifting political winds.In fact, UnitedHealth markets the type of short-term medical plans that Trump wants to make widely available as a less-costly alternative to ObamaCare plans.Management noted on the earnings call that they'll consult with the Trump administration as officials write rules governing short-term plans and other areas targeted by Trump's executive order last week.RELATED:Trump Executive Order Hits ObamaCare InsurersAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

AT&T actually lost 390,000 pay-TV customers, but added 300,000 internet video subscribers, partially offsetting the loss. UBS estimated that the pay-TV industry will lose about 1 million subscribers in the third quarter compared with 325,000 in the same quarter last year.

540,ESRX,"The $13.7 billion Amazon (AMZN) acquisition of natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) Friday stunned the market, clobbered grocery stocks, and spurred jokes and jibes in Twitterverse. One wag tweeted ""@jeffbezos this wasn't exactly the wealth redistribution we had in mind when you'd asked yesterday.""Bezos to Alexa: ""I need some groceries.""Alexa: ""I bought you Whole Foods.""🙃😋🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍕📈📊— Samppa Lahtinen (@SamppaSOS) June 16, 2017So where could Amazon go next? Here are five potential industries for the e-commerce giant.XAmazon already was said to be considering an entry into the pharmaceuticals market. While speculation had centered on online drug deliveries, Amazon also could conceivably add pharmacies to Whole Foods locations, several analysts noted Friday, creating further synergies between food and drugs and online orders and in-store purchases.If Amazon enters the field, it could send tremors across the pharmaceutical food chain, from drugstore chains such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) to pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts (ESRX) and distributors such as Amerisource Bergen (ABC).Amazon did have a finger in this pie once. It backed Drugstore.com before that online retail pharmacy was acquired by Walgreens, which then shut it down.Walgreens shares fell 5% and CVS Health 3.8%, though that reflected at least in part the immediate investor concern about the impact on their food sales. Express Scripts and Amerisource Bergen also were lower.Amazon Business, its B2B or business-to-business unit launched in 2015, sold over $1 billion worth of lab equipment, deep fryers and other gear sought by business owners in the first year of operations.If the division continues to grow at such a torrid pace, it could eat the lunch of W.W. Grainger (GWW), HD Supply (HDS) and other firms in the industrial supplies sector. That market is extremely fragmented, with some 5,000 estimated players and a value of about $75 billion per year. Amazon could disrupt it with a streamlined marketplace.While HD Supply fell 1% Friday, Grainger rose 2%.Meanwhile home improvement stores Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Floor & Decor (FND) have been Amazon-proof so far, but that may not always stay true.Amazon has automotive ambitions too. That is, it is rumored to want to move aggressively auto parts, carving out a slice of the $50 billion DIY aftermarket parts market.News that it is eyeing the auto-parts retail sector sent brick-and-mortar retailers such as AutoZone (AZO), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sharply lower in January. One report at that time said the online juggernaut already has contracts with Dorman Products (DORM) and other parts makers.Shares of auto-parts retailers are still mired near 52-week lows, with AutoZone 3.1%, O'Reilly Auto 1.1% and Advance Auto Parts 0.75% all falling Friday.Messaging service Slack Technologies targets the corporate chat room. That is said to make the Silicon Valley startup attractive to Amazon, which is a big player in the enterprise services market alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and others.Having a messaging service could help win corporate business for Amazon Web Services. Microsoft and Google, which have their own cloud-computing businesses, have Slack-like messaging features.AWS has been key to the internet giant's streak of stellar earnings. In fact, Whole Foods could switch allegiance to Amazon Web Services from its current status as a Microsoft cloud customer given Friday's news.Slack is said to have a value of at least $9 billion, so it would be the biggest-ever acquisition for Amazon, surpassing Whole Foods.Amazon issued $1 billion in small loans in the past year to merchants on its online platform, Bloomberg reported June 7. It issues loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan and has plans to expand to key markets such as China.As its lending business gains momentum, Amazon could weigh on online lenders such as Lending Club (LC) as well as payment processors such as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), who also offer credit to users. Banks that lend heavily to small businesses could also take a hit.The lending program could also keep customers loyal to Amazon, which is seeing rivals such as eBay (EBAY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) step up their e-commerce strategy.Amazon's lending program, launched in 2011, allows it to profit both directly and indirectly — through interest rates and from more transaction fees as merchants grow sales.Shares of Amazon were rising 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above Amazon's 42 offer price.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesNew Flooring Retailer Manages To Sidestep The Amazon Squeeze

541,ESRX,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite signaled modest gains early Tuesday as the major market averages look set to hold and extend Monday's big gains.Dow components McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) report earnings before the open, along with Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Pulte Group (PHM). All are in buy range as of Monday's close except for Caterpillar, which took a big step Monday toward its own entry point.Meanwhile, look for Express Scripts (ESRX) to sell off at Tuesday's open on bad news. Express Scripts announced that it was likely to lose its top customer, Anthem (ANTM), sending shares of the pharmacy benefit manager down 15% late Monday. (CVS Health (CVS), which is a major PBM in addition to its drugstore operations, was up 3% late, perhaps on hopes that it will win the Anthem business.)On Monday, the Nasdaq composite soared 1.2%, hitting an all-time high. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 index rose 1.1%, both retaking their 50-day moving averages. Markets rallied worldwide following Sunday's first round of France's presidential election. Emmanuel Macron, a pro-reform, pro-EU centrist and nationalist Marine Le Pen will move on to a runoff in May. Polls show Macron easily beating the anti-immigrant, populist Le Pen.Dow futures are up nearly 0.3% above fair value, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures are 0.2% higher.IBD'S TAKE: Thanks to strong gains in the major market averages and several new breakouts by leading stocks, the market is now back in a confirmed uptrend. For quick and thorough analysis of the market, read The Big Picture every day.But while stocks closed near session highs, the vast majority of Monday's gains were at the open. What will push the market higher from here? How about the four leading stocks at or near buy range that are reporting earnings Tuesday morning?The burger giant is currently in buy range from a 130.10 entry, rising for the past six sessions to 134.23 as of Monday. Analysts expect a 6% sales decline, to $5.53 billion, with earnings per share up 8%, to $1.33. U.S. same-store sales will be watched closely.Beyond Q1 results and guidance, analysts will look for McDonald's clues about when it will roll out its mobile order-and-pay system, as well as any further talk of deliveries. Investors also will want to know how McDonald's big McCafe promotions are working, which could impact Starbucks (SBUX). Starbucks has broken out of its own consolidation ahead of earnings on Thursday.Analysts expect the maker of heavy construction and mining equipment to report a 7.5% EPS decline, to 62 cents, with sales off 2%, to $9.27 billion. On Monday, Caterpillar reported that equipment sales by retailers rose 1% in the three months to March vs. a year earlier, the first such gain since November 2012.Caterpillar shares rose 2.6%, to 96.81, on Monday, retaking their 50-day line and approaching a 99.56 flat-base buy point.The defense contractor should report an 8% revenue rise to $1.24 billion with EPS also up 8%, to $2.79. Lockheed Martin rose 1.1%, to 276.21, on Monday, still in range from a 270 buy point retaken last week.Defense stocks have rallied on hopes for higher U.S. military spending and increased geopolitical tensions with Syria and North Korea. Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) as well as Boeing (BA) report later this week. All of those stocks are in or near buy points as well.The homebuilder is expected to report a 21% EPS rise to 29 cents on a 22% revenue rise. Shares are technically in buy range, but only because of three high-volume declines in a row, sparked by concerns over guidance from fellow builder D.R.

542,ESRX,"XStocks thundered to a second day of strong gains Tuesday as big-name earnings reports powered weighty moves across the market.The Dow Jones industrial average brought home a 1.1% gain, gaining some breathing room above its 50-day moving average and closing within 1% of its March 1 peak. The Nasdaq cleared the 6000 level, rising 0.7% to another fresh high. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, ending just below its March 1 high.Alcoa (AA) surged 9%. Miner Freeport McMoRan (FCX) rattled off a 6% gain. Whirlpool (WHR), Biogen (BIIB) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU) rose 4% apiece.Caterpillar (CAT) was a prime mover, powering up 8% — easily leading the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 — and pushing the stock's two-day gain to 11%, marking its best week since the Nov. 8 presidential election. The heavy-equipment maker reported a 100% gain in Q1 earnings and a 4% rise in revenue, its first revenue advance in ten quarters.The stock move cleared two buy points, a traditional flat-base entry of 99.46 and a more-aggressive entry of 97.99, leaving shares at their highest level since November 2014.Netflix (NFLX) streamed 6% higher to top the Nasdaq 100 on news that the company landed an agreement with iQiyi, owned by internet search giant Baidu (BIDU), to begin offering content in China. Chinese regulators have barred Netflix from offering content directly to consumers in the country. Netflix also announced Monday it would issue a $1.08 billion bond offering to investors outside the U.S. to fund new content and strategic acquisitions. The gain sent Netflix shares past a 148.39 buy point in a three-weeks tight pattern. Baidu shares rose 4% Tuesday, to just below a cup-base buy point of 188.64. Earnings from Baidu are due Thursday after the close.Steel alloys specialist Allegheny Technologies (ATI) forged a 10% gain after reporting that earnings growth accelerated to 128% and revenue popped 14% in the first quarter. Shares ended the session up 16% so far this week, beginning up the right side of a three-month consolidation.On the downside, weak quarterly results sent Ryder Systems (R) down 13% and ExpressScripts (ESRX) to an 11% loss.Verizon (VZ) marked the Dow's worst loss, down 0.6% after news reports said Verizon offered $1.8 billion for Straight Path Communications (STRP), outsizing AT&T's (T) earlier $1.6 billion offer. Straight Path bolted 15% higher. AT&T eased 0.2%.Earnings reports scheduled after the close include  AT&T, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Illumina (ILMN), Cree (CREE) and Macon Technology Solutions (MTSI), among many others.RELATED:Caterpillar Breaks Out, Steamrolls Earnings EstimatesNetflix Enters China - And A New Buy Zone

543,ESRX,"Stocks opened sharply higher Tuesday, riding a wave of early earnings news and positive sentiment following Monday's solid performance.The Dow Jones industrial average powered up 1%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed 0.5%.Among the moves spurred by the cavalcade of early earnings reports: Gannett (GCI) surged 8%, Biogen (BIIB) leapt 4.5% and Express Scripts (ESRX) dived 12%.A busy morning of reports from Dow industrials names included DuPont (DD), which rose nearly 3% following its report, and Coca-Cola (KO), down 0.2% after reporting a mixed first-quarter performance.Caterpillar (CAT) plowed an early 7% gain after doubling its first-quarter earnings on a 4% rise in revenue. The company said higher sales, especially in after-market parts, drove the beat.  Shares broke out past the 99.56 buy point of a flat base, although 97.99 could be viewed as an alternative entry.Adhesives leader 3M (MMM) was down a fraction, despite reporting an across-the-board beat in its first quarter. Shares are slightly below a 193.60 flat base buy point.Alcoa (AA) polished up 6%, despite a mixed first-quarter report after Monday's close. Results were strong, however, with a 202% rise in earnings and a 25% revenue gain. The company reported also pricing strength, and raised its forecast for growth in 2017 aluminum demand to 4.5% to 5%, up from its prior estimate of 4% demand growth. Shares are climbing off the bottom of a two-month consolidation.Lockheed Martin (LMT) slumped 1% after turning in a mixed first-quarter performance. Earnings topped views but a 7% revenue gain stopped short of expectations, and management lowered its full-year earnings guidance to below consensus views. The stock cleared a 274.67 buy point in a flat base Monday, and is also just above an earlier buy point of 270.Diversified operator Crane (CR) hoisted a 4% gain. The Stamford, Conn.-based company reported first-quarter results late Monday that were above forecasts. That earned an upgrade to outperform from market perform from William Blair on Tuesday. The stock broke out past a 79.03 flat base buy point.Homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) slumped nearly 7% after reporting adjusted first-quarter earnings just above analyst targets, but weaker-than-forecast revenue growth. The stock plunged below the 50-day line and erased all gains from a 22.09 buy point, triggering a sell signal.Amazon.com (AMZN) was flat at the starting bell, after a downgrade to market perform from outperform by Raymond James. The stock is extended above an 860.96 buy point in a four-weeks tight pattern.Two home and housing price indexes are due at 9 a.m. ET: from the Federal Housing Finance Agency and Case-Shiller. At 10 a.m. ET, March new homes sales data are expected from the Commerce Department, and the Conference Board releases April consumer confidence numbers.Europe's markets remained positive after a Monday rally spurred the first round presidential election in France on Sunday. In afternoon trade, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.4%, Frankfurt's DAX held a 0.2% gain and London's FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%.Asia's markets picked up the France-fueled rally on Tuesday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumping 1.3% and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 logging a 1.1% advance.RELATED:Top Stocks In Buy Zone Ahead Of Results: Investing Action PlanBulls Are Back: These 4 Leaders' Earnings Could Keep Stocks Running
"
544,ESRX,"XA powerful rebound Monday that left the Nasdaq at a new high and hefted the Dow industrials and S&P 500 back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since April 11 was only the start of the action.The Nasdaq vaulted 1.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.1%. Small caps slightly outpaced the general action, with the Russell 2000 notching a 1.3% gain.Up next is an after-hours reporting session with earnings reports from Whirlpool (WHR), Barrick Gold (ABX) and Range Resources (RRC), setting the tone for a week jammed with economic and political news, and in which more than 190 S&P 500 and a dozen Dow-listed stocks are set to report earnings. Alcoa (AA) was up 1% in extended trading following its results. Express Scripts (ESRX) also announced results and was unchanged.The first-round presidential vote in France on Sunday set up a second round between far-right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen and centrist challenger Emmanuel Macron, scheduled for May 7.  Macron's victory and his strength in polls ahead of the second-round vote eased some investor concerns that France was headed for an exit from the European Union, a move that could threaten the union.Stocks also received a boost from the White House, where news reports said President Trump had called for a tax plan by Wednesday that prioritized trimming the corporate tax rate to 15% over holding down the deficit.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn are scheduled to meet with key GOP congressional leaders to discuss the plan on Tuesday, according to the Wall Street Journal.The combined result sent steel makers, banks and miners soaring. JPMorgan (JPM) led the Dow Jones industrial average with a  nearly 4% gain. Goldman Sachs (GS) jumped 3% and Caterpillar (CAT) climbed nearly 3%.Fiber-optic telecom stocks also outpaced the general market, led by Infinera (INFN) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI). Both stocks are not near valid buy points.C.R. Bard (BCR) easily topped the S&P 500, spiking 20% after reporting first-quarter earnings as news broke that the company would be acquired by Becton Dickinson (BDX) in a deal valued at $24 billion. Becton slumped 4%, hurt by a downgrade to credit watch negative, due to financial risk associated with the Bard deal, from Standard & Poor's.Hasbro (HAS) thrashed out a 6% gain following strong first-quarter results, seizing a new high and narrowly topping a 101.18 buy point in a flat base. Shares remained in a buy range.Dell Technologies (DVMT) popped 3% in strong trade, enough to take a new high and clear a flat-base buy point of 65.88.  The IBD Leaderboard and Swing Trader Stock is up 31% since its breakout from a cup-with-handle base in November.Oil and gold both dropped almost 1% during the session, but miners and energy stocks fared reasonably well. Among Nasdaq stocks, Biomarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) and Xylinx (XLNX) led, up more than 5% each. Xylinx ended just below a double-bottom base buy point of 60.91.Micron Technology (MU) took the Nasdaq's hardest hit, down a bit less than 3% in strong trade. The memory-chip maker ended 11% below its late-March high and is still holding support at its 10-week moving average.RELATED:Top Stocks In Buy Zone Ahead Of Results: Investing Action PlanThese Three Stocks Break Out As Nasdaq Nears New High

545,ESRX,"If President-elect Trump wants to crack down on drug pricing, he might start with pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX), short-seller Citron Research suggested Thursday on Twitter (TWTR).Citron called Express Scripts the ""Philidor of the pharma industry,"" referring to the specialty pharmacy that Bloomberg reported last year was said to have changed doctors' orders to boost reimbursements from insurers and juice sales for Valeant Pharamacueticals (VRX), which last year said it was cutting ties with Philidor.Express Scripts, along with CVS Health (CVS) last year also cut Philidor from their networks.In an email to IBD, a spokesman for Express Scripts, pointed to that decision in response to Citron's comments, saying that ""we're nothing like Philidor. As you may recall, we removed Philidor from our network more than a year ago.""The company added that, while it hadn't seen any report from Citron, Express Scripts was ""a market force that uniquely puts medicine within reach by driving down cost of care and improving health outcomes.""The remarks from Citron, below, come after Time this week published a story on Trump in which he said that he was ""going to bring down drug prices,"" adding, ""I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""$ESRX is Philidor of the pharma industry. @therealdonaldtrump promises to fix drug pricing?

"
546,ESRX,"Talk about a rebound. The $2.6 billion Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund slogged through a tough 2011. Its 3.03% loss lagged 59% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
547,ESRX,"So far this year, the fund was up 18.87%, going into Wednesday. That topped 95% of its direct rivals.
"
548,ESRX,"What made the difference? Doubling down on high-quality companies, say the fund's managers.
"
549,ESRX,"Over the past three years Large Cap Growth's average annual return is 14.23%, ranking in the top 24% of its category, whose average is 12.68%. The S&P 500 averaged 13.72%.
"
550,ESRX,"Lead manager John Wilson, 49 years old, and manager Peter Deininger, 41, talked shop with IBD from their offices in Boston.
"
551,ESRX,"IBD: Why has your performance improved so much this year?
"
552,ESRX,"Wilson: We increased our bias for quality names, coming into this year. We added some weight to our highest conviction names. In some cases, they had lagging earnings and/or revenues growth in the second half of 2011. And we reduced some of the lower end of our large-cap spectrum names. We pruned some midcap names where our investment thesis was not as crisp.
"
553,ESRX,"And we have not ignored the market's interest in dividend yield as an exponent of total return. When we think about a market operating in uncertain times, to the extent you can find high-quality names with a nice income component, that bolsters your overall return case.
"
554,ESRX,"IBD: Would you add to that, Peter?
"
555,ESRX,"Deininger: Another thing that's different this year is that, especially in the latter part of 2011, there's been a different efficacy in a strategy like ours that's more focused on stock selection. That plays into keeping our sector weights within a tight band vs. our benchmark (Russell 1000 Growth index). And we try to keep a majority of our risk budget emphasized toward individual stock selection.
"
556,ESRX,"Last year, especially late in the year, you had some broader factors driving overall performance. You had a market characterized by high correlations. This year there is lower correlation, which makes stock selection more important. That's our wheelhouse.
"
557,ESRX,"IBD: Yet one of your risk controls is to limit bets on individual names, right?
"
558,ESRX,"Wilson: We run a diversified portfolio. We have 70 to 90 names. We're not overly reliant on any one name. We limit our sector bets to within 3 percentage points plus or minus of our index's weightings.
"
559,ESRX,"IBD: What's your take on Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI)? You've built your stake for two straight disclosure periods.
"
560,ESRX,"Wilson: They launched a significant acquisition (earlier this year) of Actavis. Together, that will create the third-largest global generic pharmaceuticals company in the world. It will allow them to operate more on a global scale, have access to new markets like Russia and Eastern Europe.
"
561,ESRX,"Health care cost containment is a powerful theme around the world, not just in the U.S. Watson benefits. And the merger provides significant accretion in earnings for the next several years. We expect their earnings growth to be in excess of 15% annually for the next couple of years.
"
562,ESRX,"IBD: Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) is another cost containment play, right?
"
563,ESRX,"Wilson: Right. Their merger with Medco Health Solutions will allow additional synergies and allow relatively powerful economies in purchasing and dispensing of drugs. It's a cost containment scenario, regardless of macro economics or who ends up in the White House.
"
564,ESRX,"IBD: Biogen Idec's (BIIB) quarterly earnings per share rebounded, growing 34% after falling by 2% the prior quarter. What's your view?
"
565,ESRX,"Wilson: It's a local company here for us in Boston. After a period of maturity the past several years, they're entering a new phase of growth. That's led by their new oral drug (BG-12) for multiple sclerosis. It is likely to be approved this year. It will be a powerful engine of growth. Patient compliance with oral drugs is much stronger than with injectables.
"
566,ESRX,"IBD: You got back into Edwards Lifesciences (EW) two disclosure periods ago, after having exited this stock. What's your thesis?
"
567,ESRX,"Wilson: This is a health care company with a revolutionary product to treat heart valve replacements. The typical heart valve replacement is invasive and expensive. Edwards has come up with a product and delivery system (via a catheter inserted in a patient's thigh) to avoid cracking open a patient's chest.
"
568,ESRX,"This is a tremendous advance, especially for older patients where this product is approved. Some of these patients could not withstand an invasive open-chest procedure. This will materially expand the market, both in the U.S. and Europe.
"
569,ESRX,"IBD: What's your view on Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), which was profitable from product sales for the first time in Q1? You opened a position two disclosures ago.
"
570,ESRX,"Wilson: It's a rapidly growing biotech company. Their lead product is Eylea, which is used to treat macular degeneration. That's a serious condition, which increases with age. And the aging U.S. and international population is growing.
"
571,ESRX,"Eylea met strong consumer acceptance. Revenue and earnings growth in 2012 has been faster than initially expected. We have a lot of conviction in this product.
"
572,ESRX,"IBD: Apple (AAPL) has had a great run, of course. Why should any shareholder expect that run to continue?
"
573,ESRX,"Deininger: In the near term, with several major product cycles in front of them, the case can be made for momentum in the company's business.
"
574,ESRX,"Another thing that plays to their advantage is their products are not just shiny new toys that come and go. They've created an ecosystem that keeps the customer coming back for incremental products instead of drifting to a glitzier phone or product from a competitor.
"
575,ESRX,"But going forward, there are few high volume markets left for them. Finding or making new high volume markets will be their greatest challenge.
"
576,ESRX,"IBD: What is driving Google's (GOOG) run this quarter?
"
577,ESRX,"Wilson: Google still has the dominant position in search. They're doing better at monetizing things like YouTube, which is heavily trafficked. But the company has not yet delivered a lot of revenue and earnings growth from that product. Still, we think it is coming down the road. Its valuation is in line with the market from a P/E (ratio) standpoint.
"
578,ESRX,"IBD: Peter, tech is your bailiwick. What would you add, please?
"
579,ESRX,"Deininger: One thing that helps is that Google has a strategy for monetizing the shift to more mobile Internet usage. There has been growing skepticism about some social media Internet companies' transition to mobile use. But Google has shown a steep trajectory of ability to monetize them.
"
580,ESRX,"IBD: What's driving eBay (EBAY), which is also on a run?
"
581,ESRX,"Wilson: This story has been in transformation. EBay had gotten stale and suffered from a loss of innovation. Management embarked on a series of changes, which resulted in improved traffic and purchase volume.
"
582,ESRX,"Second — and a powerful point more responsible for the stock's performance — is the evolution of PayPal. The payment ecosystem started in eBay. It has spread broadly online. And it's being tested in a couple of real world offline opportunities.
"
583,ESRX,"That growth, plus the core eBay operation, led to the stock performance. We think it will continue to deliver solid results.
"
584,ESRX,"IBD: Teradata (TDC) has four straight quarters of earnings-per-share growth in the mid- to high 20 percentages. What's your play?
"
585,ESRX,"Deininger: This is one of the few pure plays that addresses an increasingly important area of spending in technology, and that is data analytics.
"
586,ESRX,"They have a number of systems, ranging from appliances to very high-powered systems that serve as repositories and analysis tools for companies' data. There is data growth at companies from traditional parts of their businesses as well as an increasing amount from Internet interactions. So there's growing need to manage that and analyze it.
"
587,ESRX,"Companies talk about Big Data, which is this explosive amount of information that is coming into companies. Teradata has some of the best technology for dealing with that. They are growing their share.
"
588,ESRX,"IBD: Why did you double your stake in Avago Technologies (AVGO) in your latest disclosure?
"
589,ESRX,"Deininger: Avago is a semiconductor company that is part of the supply chain that is enabling the radio frequency technology within the handset market. It is a growing portion of this business. And they have been levered to higher-end smartphones.
"
590,ESRX,"As you develop phones that operate as world phones in greater geographies and take advantage of new network technologies and still handle legacy networks, there is a growing need for the radio frequency products that Avago produces.
"
591,ESRX,"IBD: How do you see Alliance Data (ADS), whose earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for two quarters?
"
592,ESRX,"Deininger: It's comprised of three portions. One is private label credit cards. That's been a growing business. They've gained share and acquired an attractive portfolio of retailers. That produces a tailwind of growth.
"
593,ESRX,"The second part is called Epsilon. It does a lot of marketing solutions.
"
594,ESRX,"The third part is built around loyalty programs. It's traditionally based in Canada, but is expanding into Brazil, a large new market for them.
"
595,ESRX,"All of these segments working together now is a dynamic we have not seen for a number of years. The nature of their business gives them visibility. So the three pillars give them a pipeline of business, giving them earnings growth. We expect that to continue.
"
596,ESRX,"IBD: Is TJX Cos. (TJX) a play on sluggish U.S. GDP growth?
"
597,ESRX,"Wilson: You hit it. TJ Maxx appeals to value-conscious shoppers. It has executed well. Given slow wage growth and high unemployment, value rings through to a lot of consumers. Comp store sales and their overall top line have done well the past couple of years. We expect them to sustain that.
"
598,ESRX,"IBD: Why did you begin a stake in Discovery (DISC) two disclosures ago?
"
599,ESRX,"Wilson: It's a well run cable network, with global operations, executing well for several years. Their programming is relatively economical to produce. They don't have to do a lot to convert programs from U.S. viewing format to international , so their marketing is strong. Most people see cable as a good entertainment value. So within the world of consumer discretionary, cable TV represents pretty stable revenue and cash flow streams.
"
600,ESRX,"IBD: Which brings us to Comcast (CMCSA). Why did you build your stake in your latest disclosure?
"
601,ESRX,"Wilson: Comcast is the leading cable programming provider. It has executed well in the last several years.
"
602,ESRX,"They are gaining share from some satellite and telephone companies. They've done a nice job of laying on additional products. And their high-speed Internet business performs quite well.
"
603,ESRX,"The company is pretty resilient to changes in macro economic demand.
"
604,ESRX,"So their profile is one of consistent growth, with little potential for economic disruption.
"
605,ESRX,"And they are trying to introduce products and services that reduce your dependence on being in your living room to watch Comcast.
"
606,ESRX,"IBD: Is Anheuser-Busch InBev a play on big international beer makers' growth in emerging markets?
"
607,ESRX,"Wilson: That's pretty much exactly it. This is a leadership name. It is a dominant beer franchise around the world. The company has been put together by a series of mergers in the last 10 years. They benefit from consolidation and geography and steady end consumption.Talk about a rebound. The $2.6 billion Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund slogged through a tough 2011.

There is data growth at companies from traditional parts of their businesses as well as an increasing amount from Internet interactions. So there's growing need to manage that and analyze it.Companies talk about Big Data, which is this explosive amount of information that is coming into companies. Teradata has some of the best technology for dealing with that. They are growing their share.IBD: Why did you double your stake in Avago Technologies (AVGO) in your latest disclosure?Deininger: Avago is a semiconductor company that is part of the supply chain that is enabling the radio frequency technology within the handset market. It is a growing portion of this business. And they have been levered to higher-end smartphones.As you develop phones that operate as world phones in greater geographies and take advantage of new network technologies and still handle legacy networks, there is a growing need for the radio frequency products that Avago produces.IBD: How do you see Alliance Data (ADS), whose earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for two quarters?Deininger: It's comprised of three portions. One is private label credit cards. That's been a growing business. They've gained share and acquired an attractive portfolio of retailers. That produces a tailwind of growth.The second part is called Epsilon. It does a lot of marketing solutions.The third part is built around loyalty programs. It's traditionally based in Canada, but is expanding into Brazil, a large new market for them.All of these segments working together now is a dynamic we have not seen for a number of years. The nature of their business gives them visibility. So the three pillars give them a pipeline of business, giving them earnings growth. We expect that to continue.IBD: Is TJX Cos. (TJX) a play on sluggish U.S. GDP growth?Wilson: You hit it. TJ Maxx appeals to value-conscious shoppers. It has executed well. Given slow wage growth and high unemployment, value rings through to a lot of consumers. Comp store sales and their overall top line have done well the past couple of years. We expect them to sustain that.IBD: Why did you begin a stake in Discovery (DISC) two disclosures ago?Wilson: It's a well run cable network, with global operations, executing well for several years. Their programming is relatively economical to produce. They don't have to do a lot to convert programs from U.S. viewing format to international , so their marketing is strong. Most people see cable as a good entertainment value. So within the world of consumer discretionary, cable TV represents pretty stable revenue and cash flow streams.IBD: Which brings us to Comcast (CMCSA). Why did you build your stake in your latest disclosure?Wilson: Comcast is the leading cable programming provider. It has executed well in the last several years.They are gaining share from some satellite and telephone companies. They've done a nice job of laying on additional products. And their high-speed Internet business performs quite well.The company is pretty resilient to changes in macro economic demand.So their profile is one of consistent growth, with little potential for economic disruption.And they are trying to introduce products and services that reduce your dependence on being in your living room to watch Comcast.IBD: Is Anheuser-Busch InBev a play on big international beer makers' growth in emerging markets?Wilson: That's pretty much exactly it. This is a leadership name. It is a dominant beer franchise around the world. The company has been put together by a series of mergers in the last 10 years. They benefit from consolidation and geography and steady end consumption.

608,ESRX,"Healthcare exchange traded funds defied the market's weakness Monday on news that health-insurance giant WellPoint (WLP) agreed to buy out Amerigroup (AGP). The deal valued one of the largest players in Medicaid at $4.9 billion or about $92 a share. Amerigroup shares shot up 38% to close at 88.79.IShares Dow Jones U.S. Healthcare Provider (IHF) gapped up 2.14% to 65.02. The ETF appears to be forming a cup-with-handle pattern with a 66.18 potential buy point.It has a middle-of-the-road IBD Relative Strength Rating of 57 but a strong Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-. That means its price performance is outpacing 57% of the market and institutions are buying more shares than selling.IHF has 7% of its assets invested in WellPoint and 2% in Amerigroup. Its largest holdings are UnitedHealth Group (UNH), accounting for 14% of assets, and Express Scripts Holdings (ESRX), with 12%.The deal is estimated to save WellPoint and Amerigroup $50 million in 2013 from combined operations and up to $125 million by 2016.The buyout is set to close in the first quarter next year, pending regulatory approval. Upon completion, WellP oint will be the largest Medicaid managed-care provider, with 4.5 million subscribers in 19 states.As the largest health insurer, it covers 33.5 million members under UniCare, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. UnitedHealth, the largest-Medicaid provider currently, covers 3.6 million people.Medicaid serves low-income families and some disabled people and is jointly covered by states and the federal government.The buyout will expand WellPoint's reach in the fast-growing Medicaid market, analysts said.""WellPoint has not had much success on its own in the past when it comes to winning Medicaid contracts,"" Jefferies equity analyst David Windley and his colleagues wrote in a client note. ""Amerigroup's experience in this arena should elevate this success rate."" They rated WellPoint shares as ""hold.""WellPoint ""recognizes the growth opportunity in the government space, as states continue to face significant budget challenges, while managed care is still underpenetrated,"" Raymond James analysts Michael Baker and Cathy Chen wrote to clients. ""WellPoint expects spending on managed care in Medicaid to grow by about $100 billion by the end of 2014.""Amerigroup's membership grew an average of 4% annually between 2007 and 2011 while revenues grew 13% over the same period.Other government-sponsored healthcare program providers, WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Molina Healthcare (MOH) and  Centene (CNC), jumped 18% to 20% on speculation they could be the next buyout targets. Potential suitors include large, diversified providers with a small reach in Medicaid such as Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) and Humana (HUM), say Baker and Chen.Medicaid managed-care providers will likely to be among the biggest beneficiaries of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), says David Kremp, an analyst at Morningstar.Informally known as Obama-Care, the law passed in March 2010 requires adults not covered by an employer- or government-sponsored health plan to buy insurance or pay a tax. Kremp estimates that most of the 17 million new Medicaid enrollees will end up in private Medicaid plans.

609,ESRX,"Bank of America (BAC), which usually trades at high volume, led the list of the top five stocks by trading volume Thursday afternoon, followed by Finnish mobile phone maker Nokia (NOK), drugstore chain Walgreen (WAG), financial services company Morgan Stanley (MS) and Chinese provider of language training and test preparation New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU). BofA was trading down…
"
610,ESRX,"Thomas Marsico is one of the fund industry's marquee managers.
"
611,ESRX,"He ran Janus Twenty Fund from March 1988 through July 1997. In that time the fund's average annual gain of 22.59% outpaced 97% of its large-cap growth peers, according to Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 averaged 17.88%.
"
612,ESRX,"Now he is chairman and CEO of Marsico Capital, where he runs or co-runs 20 funds for his firm and as a subadviser.
"
613,ESRX,"The $1.8 billion Columbia Marsico Focused Equities Fund , with 31 holdings as of Aug. 31, reflects the concentrated portfolio style for which Marsico is well-known. Coralie Witter, 41 years old, is co-manager.
"
614,ESRX,"Marsico, 57, talked shop from his office in Denver.
"
615,ESRX,"IBD: Why do you like a concentrated portfolio?
"
616,ESRX,"Marsico: We have a variety of companies, representing a lot of industries. This gives us a lot of best-of-breed companies.
"
617,ESRX,"IBD: When you say best-of-breed, what do you mean?
"
618,ESRX,"Marsico: We like companies that have strong market position, that are not dependent on capital markets to fund growth, that generate lots of free cash and have opportunities to invest it back in themselves. And when they don't, we like to see steady growth of dividends and share repurchases.
"
619,ESRX,"IBD: How are you allocating between the U.S. and the rest of the world now?
"
620,ESRX,"Marsico: Throughout my history of managing money for about 30 plus years, I've always owned what I thought were dominant franchises wherever they are in the world. You'll see a number of international names in the portfolio. There's Baidu (BIDU), obviously the dominant search company in China. Accenture (ACN) (headquartered in Ireland) is another dominant firm in data services and consulting. Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) (based in Belgium) is basically a big consolidation in brewing.
"
621,ESRX,"So about 6% of the portfolio was in companies deemed to be international as of Aug. 31 (and the same weighting now), but companies like Accenture and InBev get a lot of their revenue in the U.S.
"
622,ESRX,"IBD: With 23% of your assets, consumer cyclicals are your largest sector as of July 31. But your health care weighting has soared over the past four quarters. Why is that?
"
623,ESRX,"Marsico: With the passage of health care laws in the U.S., we've started to increase our position in health care companies. That's a change over the last few years when we didn't know what the rules and regulations would be and what the new health care paradigm would be.
"
624,ESRX,"As a result of the Supreme Court judging ObamaCare constitutional and that the fee (imposed on individuals who don't buy coverage) is more of a tax, the day after that ruling there was an acquisition by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) (of Amylin Pharmaceuticals (AMLN). The following Monday an HMO (WellPoint (WLP) bought a different one (Amerigroup (AGP). So health care providers were waiting for that decision, ready to make moves.
"
625,ESRX,"We own some health care companies coming up with new treatments for unmet medical needs. We've taken that weighting up this year. It acted as a pretty defensive group through the rally we saw this summer. Now we're seeing strength in that group, given the backdrop of a very difficult economic environment. So health care companies should be defensive, but now should also provide moderate growth plus pretty good dividend yield plus share repurchases.
"
626,ESRX,"We think share repurchase is important because there seems to be some unwillingness (by investors) to put money into stocks. We've seen more money go into bond funds and surrogates even with their low interest rates.
"
627,ESRX,"IBD: You've got Biogen Idec (BIIB) as well. I gather their new drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis looks promising.
"
628,ESRX,"Marsico: They have a tremendous franchise in rheumatoid arthritis. And they're developing BG-12 for multiple sclerosis. It is taken orally, whereas their other drug for this is taken by infusion — a patient must go to a facility. The BG-12 treatment profile is better, so the outcome profile is better.
"
629,ESRX,"IBD: You opened your current position in Express Scripts (ESRX) in April. What's your thesis?
"
630,ESRX,"Marsico: With the acquisition of Medco, they are the dominant player in the pharmacy benefit management industry. Now they are at a size and scale to get significant cost savings. Also, they should see new opportunities of moving into specialty pharma, biologics, that generate a lot of cash flow. And they are growing their share repurchase program.
"
631,ESRX,"IBD: You began your current stake in Home Depot (HD) last December and have built it. Do you like housing?
"
632,ESRX,"Marsico: Housing is another area we like. If you look at homebuilders, it's not an industry where there is great franchise value.
"
633,ESRX,"So we've had a large position in Home Depot, which has been successful for us. They went through changes in leadership. Current leadership is strong at operating the business at a very high level. We think they are better positioned than Lowe's (LOW) for the do-it-yourself customer. They think only a small portion of their business, 15% to 20%, is related to new-home construction.
"
634,ESRX,"IBD: How are they impacted by rising existing home prices?
"
635,ESRX,"Marsico: We've seen data in the last couple of weeks that the median price for existing homes is moving up. So people are seeing some equity returning to the value of their home. So at the margin people are likely to invest in their homes again. They will build a new bath or remodel a kitchen. And that helps Home Depot.
"
636,ESRX,"IBD: Is the housing situation why you've been generally building stakes in recent quarters in big banks like Wells Fargo (WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB)?
"
637,ESRX,"Marsico: At some point, rising home prices also translate into banking, where we have positions in Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp, two of the largest mortgage origination companies.
"
638,ESRX,"Wells Fargo is currently originating loans on close to 30% of new homes.
"
639,ESRX,"There's been tremendous consolidation in the mortgage industry as a result of the collapse in 2006 through 2008.
"
640,ESRX,"IBD: The fund is sector agnostic — it can have whatever sector weightings it wants. And technology is your second-largest weighting, with 22% of assets. Why not a larger weighting in a sector that many managers see as a mother lode of innovation?
"
641,ESRX,"Marsico: We in general are lightly weighted in tech. Few companies have proprietary exclusive type products that are difficult to duplicate. The lifecycle of a product can be as long as a couple of years but as short as maybe three months.
"
642,ESRX,"So it's an area we haven't aggressively invested in. We do like companies using technology to improve either their information about customers or their ability to produce or their logistics. Companies we've invested in are well aware of where their customers are spending money.
"
643,ESRX,"IBD: You've got Apple (AAPL). Why do you think it still has legs?
"
644,ESRX,"Marsico: It's our largest position. We've owned it a long time. Our cost basis is 125. (Now it's trading in the mid-600s.) It's a position that at different times we've cut back. We think the leadership under Tim Cook is very strong. Their pipeline of new innovative ideas is strong. They have executed at a very high level. Also, they've implemented a basically 1.5% dividend and now a significant share repurchase. We expect them to grow their dividend and the amount of stock repurchase.
"
645,ESRX,"IBD: What other holdings use technology in ways you like?
"
646,ESRX,"Marsico: We own Equinix (EQIX). It is a data center company. It will convert to REIT status in early 2015 (to take advantage of tax benefits). The considerable moat they have is the locations of their data centers. They are at the nexus of where telephone trunks come together as well as cable systems, generally at the intersection of where the most digital traffic is.
"
647,ESRX,"The use of digital data continues to grow. Now voice is being converted to data. Over radio, voice is being converted to data so these are all new IP packets, especially when you go to an LTE network, which are being switched to with all the new smartphone products.
"
648,ESRX,"So in Equinix's business, you must colocate your services close to the on-ramps for the Internet and to these telephone networks, and that's where Equinix has located their data centers.
"
649,ESRX,"IBD: Is Monsanto (MON) another creative user of technology?
"
650,ESRX,"Marsico: Monsanto has proprietary positions finding hybrids and finding technology to improve yields for farmers.
"
651,ESRX,"Their next product is a drought-tolerant corn. With severe drought in the U.S., demand will be high. Even in normal conditions, this product will extend (corn) farming into high plains arid areas like Colorado, where there's a lot of land but not a lot of water.
"
652,ESRX,"They've expanded their business in Brazil and Argentina. As their GMO (genetically modified organism) products become more accepted in Europe, farmers there are using it more. And it's being used more in Eastern Europe.
"
653,ESRX,"IBD: Priceline (PCLN) is also an innovative tech user rather than tech creator, right? But you've been trimming.
"
654,ESRX,"Marsico: Before they announced their quarter, we cut the position in half. We were concerned about travel activity in Europe.
"
655,ESRX,"But actually the stock has performed well after the adjustment downward, reflecting new estimates for the quarter. So this is not a company we want to be completely out of it.
"
656,ESRX,"Our cost basis is low, around 200. The stock is trading around 620.
"
657,ESRX,"Priceline lets small hotels add exposure on the Internet. This gives Priceline more destinations than other travel services. They dominate Europe. They are in the process of dominating Asia with their Agoda service.
"
658,ESRX,"Europe could fall into recession, although things should not get significantly worse. But the savings a traveler can get by booking through Priceline is significant. Priceline's comps vs. last year will get easier.
"
659,ESRX,"IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for two quarters. How much growth is in front of them?
"
660,ESRX,"Marsico: You can watch your meal prepared in front of your own eyes. It's an easy model to execute. But their focus on natural products makes them unique.
"
661,ESRX,"They have a tremendous opportunity to expand their number of stores. Their penetration on the East Coast is low. And they have the ability to take the company international. They're just starting to take advantage of that with a couple of stores in the U.K.
"
662,ESRX,"And they're introducing a second concept: Thai food. The palate of people has gotten broader.
"
663,ESRX,"They have a proprietary product. They have a good value proposition. They can double the size of their footprint just with Chipotle, and more than that with their new food concept.
"
664,ESRX,"IBD: Why are you finding so many promising names in consumer discretionary, which has 32% of your assets by your in-house weightings?
"
665,ESRX,"Marsico: We don't think they all sell discretionary products.
"
666,ESRX,"Dollar General (GD) is one of the dollar chains. It sells basic goods and convenience at a low price.
"
667,ESRX,"The average ticket at Dollar General is around $10 per trip. Pricing is similar to Wal-Mart (WMT), but Dollar is more convenient.
"
668,ESRX,"Also, they are expanding into California. They have only one store there now. They see an opportunity to grow their store base there dramatically in the next five years.
"
669,ESRX,"They are well run. They buy back a lot of their own stock. Their margin profile is improving quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.
"
670,ESRX,"IBD: Tom, you ran Janus Twenty Fund from March 1988 through July 1997. What are the differences between that fund and this one?
"
671,ESRX,"Marsico: I would say there are no differences. Except now I might be more experienced. It's the same fundamental research, same concentration, and we're benchmark agnostic. We don't need indexes. We don't follow them. They say you can't change your stripes. We're not an organization where we change our stripes.
"
672,ESRX,"We're fundamental investors looking for high-quality companies at the right price.
"
673,ESRX,"I'm a large shareholder in all of our funds at Marsico Capital.

701,ESRX,"Payers like Anthem (ANTM), Humana (HUM) and United Healthcare (UNH) are either broadly denying or in UNH's case restricting coverage of Sarepta Therapies' (SRPT) FDA-approved Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, Jefferies analyst Gena Wang said Wednesday.Wang slashed her price target on Sarepta Therapies stock to 32 from 46. She has a hold rating on Sarepta stock, which crashed 5.8% to close at 29.98 on Wednesday. Shares are down 17% this year and have traded under their 50-day moving average since late October.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Sarepta's Exondys 51 in September. The drug targets 13% of the DMD population with confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping.But the drug is costly. Sarepta estimates average annual cost at about $300,000 per patient. The majority of patients would be covered by Medicaid and benefit from a 23.1% discount. Private plans would likely get the same discount, Wang said.""There appears to be no legal consequence, according to KOLs (key opinion leaders) for payers (Medicaid and private) to restrict/deny coverage, citing clinical benefit as No. 1 criteria for coverage decisions and FDA approval status as secondary,"" she wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Sarepta might be diving, but fellow biotech Regeneron has a bright future ahead on eczema drug dupilumab, an analyst said Tuesday. What takeaways are there for the broader biotech sector. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the bigger picture.Outside the Medicaid and private arenas, though, Wang says three of five national and eight of 15 regional managed care organizations (MCOs) have said they would largely deny coverage of Exondys 51.Anthem denies coverage of Exondys 51, saying the drug ""failed to show it improves health outcomes."" Humana has said it would cover Exondys 51 on ambulatory patients provided they remain able to walk. The drug will be approved every six months or as determined through clinical review.Wang notes that it's ""largely unprecendented"" for an FDA-approved drug to be denied or restricted.Aetna (AET) requires the drug be initiated before age 14 and patients be able to average a six-minute walking distance.United Healthcare is mostly unrestricted, but will only cover the drug for the initial four weeks and likely require monitoring after the first month, Wang said.Only certain Cigna (CI) plans cover Exondys 51, she wrote. CVS Health's (CVS) Caremark would cover the drug for 12 months, but then look for improvement in dystrophin levels or a six-minute walking distance before renewal. Express Scripts (ESRX) hasn't disclosed its plans for Exondys 51.Most pediatric hospitals and clinics administering Exondys 51 would be eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, Wang said. Home infusion could potentially cut down on costs, but Wang sees that as a long shot outside of private insurance plans.Editor's Note: Clarifies first paragraph to note the United Healthcare restricts, but does not deny, coverage of the Sarepta DMD drug. Sixth-to-last graph corrects to show that Anthem does not cover Exondys 51 and explains why, and clarifies Humana's coverage of Exondys 51.RELATED:Sarepta Muscular Dystrophy Drug Interrupts 5-Day Biotech Slump'Blockbuster Franchises' Spark M&A Fever For Sarepta, Ariad, Biotechs

702,ESRX,"Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Mylan (MYL), Endo Pharmaceuticals (ENDP), Lannett (LCI) and other generic-drug makers tumbled Thursday afternoon after Bloomberg reported that the Justice Department is investigating possible price collusion, with charges likely by year-end.The DOJ is probing more than a dozen generic-drug makers over whether they colluded on pricing, according to Bloomberg.Mylan issued the following statement: ""Mylan is and has always been committed to cooperating with the Antitrust Division's investigation.  To date,  we know of no evidence that Mylan participated in price fixing.""Teva Pharmaceuticals has disclosed subpoenas and is cooperating, Bloomberg added. Lannett also has received a subpoena, the Wall Street Journal said.The antitrust probe is about two years old and covers some two dozen drugs, Bloomberg said, citing sources. A grand jury is examining if executives agreed to raise prices.Teva shares plunged 9.6% to 39.17 on the stock market today, falling to its lowest levels since November 2013. Mylan lost 6.7%. Lannett crashed 26.6%, Endo Pharmaceuticals 19.5% and Akorn (AKRX) 18.1%. Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO) fell 7.3%.The DOJ collusion probe news is the latest sign that the drug industry face increasing regulatory and political pressure over prices. Hillary Clinton has vowed to crack down on drug prices, while her former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders has hit specific drug stocks with negative tweets.And the latest report hit more than just drugmakers. CVS Health (CVS), drug store giant and pharmacy benefit manager, lost 2.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.7%.Drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (ABC), McKesson (MCK) and Cardinal Health (CAH) all fell nearly 5%. And that followed huge losses for all three on Oct. 28, when McKesson missed and warned, citing competitive pressure on prices. McKesson lost nearly 23% that day, with Cardinal down nearly 10% and AmerisourceBergen 13%.Diplomat Pharmacy (DPLO) crashed 42% after a huge Q3 miss late Wednesday amid price concessions and lower demand for hepatitis C drugs.

703,ESRX,"Shares of generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) rebounded in early trading Thursday, then lost steam, after the company said it would expand patient assistance for its controversially priced drug EpiPen.The move hit shares of pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) Express Scripts (ESRX) and pharmacy chain CVS Health (CVS).Mylan stock had been falling all week as members of Congress called for an investigation into its pricing of the emergency anti-allergy drug, which has gone up 400% in the last few years. On Wednesday, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also criticized the company and promised to act against high drug prices as president, statements that demolished the drug stock rally of the last few days.On Thursday, Mylan issued a press release saying it was doubling the eligibility of its patient-assistance program for EpiPen to 400% of the poverty level, meaning that a family of four making $97,200 a year would pay nothing for it. It also offered a savings card of up to $300 to defray out-of-pocket costs for those on frugal insurance plans.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan's troubles were foreseen by some in the industry, and it's not alone — see our June article These 6 Drugmakers Could Be The Next Price War Casualties.Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat roughly estimated that the new programs would have, at most, an annual $100 million impact on Mylan, or 10% of EpiPen sales. Earlier in the week he noted that there was evidence of heavy rebating already going on with EpiPen, which provides about 12% of Mylan's revenue.""Notice that in 2015, net sales increase vs. 2014 was roughly zero despite volumes up 7% and price up 31% year-over-year,"" Raffat wrote in an email to clients. ""This speaks to the contractual arrangements around EpiPen.""Mylan CEO Heather Bresch made a similar point in an interview with CNBC late Wednesday, saying that the middlemen that Mylan has to go through strip off large chunks of the price for themselves. Leerink analyst David Larsen wrote in a research note that this is likely why Express Scripts and CVS Health were both selling off Thursday.""This obviously implies that CVS and Express Scripts, as the PBMs, are reaping significant profits from EpiPen,"" Larsen wrote. Therefore, any reduction in EpiPen's price would presumably be felt by them as well, he said.Express Scripts stock fell 6% to 71.74 Thursday, hitting a 4-month low intraday. CVS stock was down 3.5% to 93.78.Larsen also noted that fellow generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) has an EpiPen competitor that could hit the U.S. market in 2018.""Since a generic launch is pending, we believe Mylan may have been getting slightly more aggressive about pricing,"" he wrote.Mylan rose as much as 4.5% in early trading on the stock market today, after having lost more than 11% the previous three days. But the stock closed down 0.7% to 42.85.RELATED:AstraZeneca Sells Antibiotics Business; Mallinckrodt Sheds Imaging Unit

704,ESRX,"Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the case for a rate hike is stronger now, but investors weren't sure what to make of that. Pfizer (PFE) paid $14 billion for a one-drug biotech, but shares of drugs and pharma supply chain companies sold off as Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen price hikes drew outrage. Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%. The major averages are still in sideways action. Drug stocks were big movers on Pfizer's Medivation (MDVN) deal and Mylan's EpiPen furor. Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened in recent months."" That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-upNew-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders. Existing-home sales fell more than expected in July, though that was from June's cycle high. But applications for loans to buy a home fell to a six-month low. Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average.The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well.Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target. On Wednesday, Pfizer agreed to buy the antibiotics business of AstraZeneca (AZN) for $725 million plus possible future milestone and sales payments and royalties that could amount to $850 million.Oil prices may be settling into a trading range in the mid to high $40 range. OPEC members gave conflicting signals over whether they might support a production freeze, while Goldman Sachs said such a move would not ""be sufficient to support prices much further."" Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.5 million barrels vs. expectations for a small drop. Domestic production fell slightly.The road to self-driving cars got a little more crowded as Mobileye (MBLY) announced it will partner with General Motors (GM) supplier Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to jointly develop off-the-shelf autonomous driving technology for automakers. The two companies will co-develop ""the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution."" Mobileye already has deal with BMW (BMWYY) and Intel (INTC) to bring an autonomous vehicle to market by 2021.Mobileye shares spiked Tuesday on the Delphi news, briefly topping a buy point. Shares rose 2.3% for the week.Tesla Motors (TSLA), which is ending its business relationship with Mobileye, introduced new versions of its Model S and X that boosts speeds and driving range, powered by an updated battery technology. Tesla said its upgraded Model S is now the fastest-accelerating car in commercial production. Tesla shares fell 2.2%, closing below the 50-day line and just above the 200-day line.Tesla partner Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled a new processor for autonomous driving, saying it's 50%-100% more powerful than other mobile processors.The beauty products retailer reported better-than-expected earnings and sales, with yet another quarter of double-digit same-stores growth. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average.Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss. But it topped on some key metrics, including revenue, which rose 34% to $377.7 million. But shares of the cloud-based human resources software maker rose 2.5%, hitting a 2016 high on Thursday.July IPO Talend (TLND) lost an adjusted $1.84 a share, according to its late Thursday release, but the French Big Data firm later clarified that the bottom line actually met estimates for a loss of 31 cents a share after adjusting for the share count following its initial offering. Revenue rose 38% to $25.4 million, just beating. Talend sees Q3 losses in line with views, but it guided revenue slightly higher. Shares fell 4% after much bigger intraday losses.Best Buy (BBY) stock jumped 21% for the week to a 17-month high on better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter, including a surprise increase in same-store sales. The consumer electronics retailer credited rising demand for wearable technology, appliances and home-theater systems for the increase. Video game and electronics retailer GameStop (GME) disappointed investors with in-line EPS and below-forecast sales.Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) suffered double-digit share price losses, as both reported second-quarter results that came up short of Wall Street expectations, with falling grocery prices and tougher competition hurting sales. Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending.Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties ""in the energy-dependent regions."" Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities.HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views. For the current quarter, the printer and PC maker sees non-GAAP EPS of 34-37 cents, vs. consensus for 41 cents. HP is reducing its printing supplies inventory and is deeply discounting printers to expand its installed base. Shares closed little changed after a brief Thursday morning sell-off.

It's Boyd Gaming's second Las Vegas acquisition in a week after announcing that it'll buy Aliante Casino Hotel & Spa last week. Boyd Gaming will release earnings on Tuesday after the market close. Shares rose fractionally late after closing up 0.85% to 20.20. Boyd Gaming hit a record high of 21.42 on April 13, but you could say it's still in a consolidation going back to early November.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) continues to report improved — though not yet strong — results. For Q1 the Irving, Texas-based oil and gas company recorded a 64-cent loss, vs. a 3-cent loss in Q1 2015, better than the expected 78-cent loss. It was the fourth quarter in a row that Pioneer Natural Resources has topped earnings estimates. Revenue fell 21% to $685 million amid the continuing oil industry slump. Analysts expected $737 million.Notably,  Pioneer Natural Resources was producing 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 55% was oil, and production grew by 3% or 7 million barrels a day compared to the prior quarter and was significantly above Pioneer’s Q1 guidance of 211-216 million barrels.Shares climbed 3% late after closing up 0.2%. Its stock rose above a 3-1/2 month cup-with-handle base with a 145.97 buy point on April 8 and it’s risen about 8% in just over two weeks.Canadian National Railway (CNI) said diluted earnings -- in local Canadian currency -- rose 16% in its fiscal second quarter, as revenue declined 4%. In U.S. dollars, per-share profit came in at 79 cents, topping views by 6 cents, while revenue of $2.34 billion fell short of views for $2.43 billion.The company cut 2016 EPS guidance to $3.50, flat from the prior year, vs. current views for $3.66, citing ""weaker than expected freight demand in certain markets and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar."" Shares fell 5% in extended trading after closing down 1.05% to 65.20 on the stock market today.J&J Snack Foods (JJSF), maker of soft pretzels, churros and frozen beverages, reported better than expected fiscal Q2 profit as net earnings rose 6.4% to $16.6 million, or 83 cents per share, beating analyst consensus by 5 cents.

740,ESRX,"Rising biotech star Medivation started losing altitude in after-hours trading Thursday after its Q1 report missed estimates, in a day when several high-rated drug stocks reported.Medivation's (MDVN) earnings excluding one-time items totaled 17 cents a share, reversing a year-earlier loss but missing analysts' consensus by 10 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 48% to $129.2 million, about $20 million short of consensus.Nonetheless, the company affirmed its full-year guidance of $600 million to $650 million in revenue. It did not offer EPS guidance, but its forecast of expenses remained the same.On the conference call discussing results with analysts, CFO Rick Bierly said the company had warned on the Q4 call that this quarter was likely to be slow. He cited a buildup of inventory of the company's sole marketed drug, Xtandi, in Q4, which has now returned to normal, as well as an unusually high refund rate due to the reset of the Medicare Part D ""donut hole"" at the start of the year. He also anticipated that returning to normal as the year goes on.The stock took a 5% hit in after-hours trading, after rising 1.3% in regular trade to close at 123.23.Also falling in late trading was specialty drugmaker Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), which also affirmed guidance but reported a mixed quarter. Jazz's revenue rose 25% from the previous year to $309.3 million, a hair short of Wall Street's $309.8 million estimate. Profit also increased 25%, to $1.99 a share, missing consensus by 16 cents.Jazz also announced that it had decided not to move forward with clinical trials of JZP-386, a product developed in partnership with Concert Pharmaceuticals (CNCE) as a possible successor to Jazz's bestselling narcolepsy drug Xyrem. The companies said the underwhelming results of phase 1 studies led to the decision, but they will continue to evaluate possible uses for the drug.Earlier in the day, big-cap biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) reported a more positive quarter and raised its guidance, but the stock still closed down a fraction at 468.62.Regeneron's earnings rose 27% over the year-earlier quarter to $2.88 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 20 cents. Sales climbed 39% to $869.6 million, about $45 million above consensus.The beat came from U.S. sales of Regeneron's flagship eye drug Eylea, which jumped 51% to $541 million. The Street expected $527 million, according to RBC Capital Markets. The firm now expects U.S. Eylea sales to rise 30% to 35% this year, up from its previous guidance of 25% to 30%. The company does not provide overall revenue guidance because foreign Eylea sales are handled by Bayer (BAYRY), while other sales come from collaborations and milestone payments.Regeneron executives stressed the importance of Protocol T, a study comparing Eylea head-to-head with its chief competitors, Roche's (RHHBY) Lucentis and Avastin, in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME), a type of vision loss associated with diabetes. Commercial head Robert Terifay told analysts on the company's earnings conference call that Regeneron's market research indicated that the study, published in February, was driving uptake of the drug and taking share from competitors.CEO Len Schleifer added that anecdotal accounts indicated that it might also be helping sales in Eylea's original target of wet age-related macular degeneration, since specialists who might have only had Avastin in stock now had Eylea available for all uses.""We had previously thought Eylea and Lucentis shares should at least equilibrate, but now believe Eylea should overtake Lucentis and maybe even grow the market with share away from Avastin, at least in DME,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt in a research note Thursday. ""REGN also has the power to post surprises from the pipeline.""The pipeline product that drew the most discussion on the call was Praluent, the cholesterol fighter that is under FDA review and expected to be approved by July.On the call, Terifay remained bullish on the drug's blockbuster potential but acknowledged that negotiations with payers might slow down the launch, as Express Scripts (ESRX) has made clear that Praluent's drug class will be its next target for a price war.""We are working with the players involved in the market-access decision-making process to focus on patient good,"" Terifay said. ""That said, it will likely take several months for commercial and government payers to take formulary reviews (and) make reimbursement coverage decisions.""

"
811,ESRX,"You get the feeling Michael Cartwright has spent a lot of time trying to clear up misconceptions about drug and alcohol addiction. Cartwright is CEO and co-founder of AAC Holdings (AAC). It's the parent of American Addiction Centers, which provides inpatient substance abuse treatment services to people with drug, alcohol and other addictions.AAC's therapy services include everything from motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy to family intervention services. It also provides personal training, yoga sessions, massage therapy and other amenities.At the end of the first quarter, AAC operated 12 substance abuse treatment facilities and one mental health facility specializing in binge eating disorders. It also made a series of acquisitions during the quarter to expand its operations.There aren't a lot of companies that do this on a large scale.Acadia Healthcare (ACHC), best known for its psychiatric services and treatment facilities, also offers treatment of addiction and chemical dependency. Other leading players include Elements Behavioral Health and Foundations Recovery Network.Cartwright estimates that there are around 6,700 treatment providers in the U.S. The vast majority are small mom-and-pop operations.IPO Serves ExpansionAAC currently has facility operations in Texas, Nevada, Florida and California, but intends to become a national brand. That's one reason for its initial public offering in October.""To expand nationally, you need capital, so we went public to raise capital,"" Cartwright told IBD.When it's suggested that there doesn't seem to be much of a model for operating a large, national brand of addiction treatment centers, Cartwright quickly strikes that notion down.""The American Society of Addiction Medicine has been building out a model over the last 25 years regarding the clinical science of how you treat drug and alcohol addiction with different levels of care,"" he told IBD. ""There's lots of data out there. It's just like diabetes — it's treated very scientifically.""The problem, Cartwright says, is that too many people equate alcoholism or drug addiction treatment with Alcoholics Anonymous. AA is a nonprofessional organization with a 12-step program that incorporates fellowship and spiritual elements.""That's more post-treatment,"" Cartwright said. ""People who say there's not a model (for a clinical approach) are not looking at the science or the research out there.""Addiction, like any disease, is the same anywhere you go, he says. The science behind its diagnosis, care and treatment is no different in Maine than it is in Oregon. So developing a national model for addiction treatment is no different than developing a national model for hospitals or diabetes centers, Cartwright says.""The diabetes industry has aggregated over the last 10 years, but the alcohol and drug addiction treatment industry is very unaggregated throughout the United States,"" Cartwright said. ""I think it's ripe for a consolidator like you saw in the diabetes space or the psychiatric hospital space.""Addressable MarketRyan Daniels, an analyst at William Blair & Co., noted in a research report that AAC has plenty of room to grow in a U.S. substance abuse treatment industry estimated to bring in around $35 billion a year.""The company has an active pipeline of organic growth opportunities ... as well as ample M&A opportunities of both facilities and marketing vehicles,"" he said. ""We believe AAC should be one of the faster-growing health care services companies in the public markets over the coming years.""AAC has made numerous moves this year to expand its footprint.In February it bought a former convent and a total of 96 acres in Ringwood, N.J., for $6.4 million in cash to be converted into the future site of a 150-bed residential treatment facility. Renovation of the existing structure and grounds should begin this summer.A month later, AAC agreed to buy the operating assets of Sunrise House Foundation, a nonprofit, in-network provider of substance abuse treatment in New Jersey.In April, AAC closed on its $13.5 million acquisition of an 84-bed hospital near Laguna Beach, Calif., which will be renovated into a Chemical Dependency Recovery Hospital with 124 beds. The renovation and construction work should be done during the first half of 2016.Meanwhile, the company expects to complete construction of a 164-bed, $18.1 million residential facility in Tampa, Fla., during the second half of 2015.Most of AAC's acquisitions are considered ""de novo,"" meaning the company buys properties and converts them into facilities rather than buying facilities that are already open and producing revenue.However, AAC occasionally acquires facilities that are already up and running. In February it completed a $13.1 million buyout of Recovery First, operator of an inpatient substance abuse treatment facility in the greater Fort Lauderdale, Fla., area. That facility is undergoing an expansion that should be completed in the fourth quarter.Last month, AAC completed its purchase of Clinical Services of Rhode Island, an operator of three outpatient treatment facilities in the state.AAC's expansion strategy is not that different from any other type of business. It eyes markets where there is sufficient population density to support a treatment facility.Some regions of the country have huge populations of addicts and an influx, Cartwright notes.Due partly to ObamaCare and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 — which made it easier for addicts to get insurance coverage for their conditions — a lot more people have access to treatment, Cartwright says.""Before 2008, insurance companies could deny or not offer coverage for substance abuse,"" he said. ""Now you can't be denied coverage for this disease. That's been a huge uplift in terms of people who can access care.""Revenue RisingFinancially, AAC saw its revenue balloon to $133 million in 2014 from less than $30 million three years earlier. On April 29, the company posted first-quarter revenue of $42.8 million, up 42% from the previous year. Earnings came in at 15 cents a share.There's no magic formula to AAC's financial growth, Cartwright says: ""As long as your facilities are filled up and you provide great clinical care, the financial part will take care of itself.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect AAC to post full-year EPS of 64 cents in 2015 and $1.04 in 2016. The company's stock price trades near 31, down from a high of 38.43 set on Feb. 26 but up more than 26% since March 11.AAC has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It belongs to IBD's Medical-Services group, which ranks No. 28 out of 197 industries tracked.The group features a pretty diverse range of stocks, including pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holdings (ESRX), pharmacy distribution and consulting firm Omnicare (OCR) and clinical testing services provider Laboratory Corp. of America (LH).

812,ESRX,"Big-cap biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) beat Wall Street's Q1 estimates and raised its guidance Thursday, sending the stock up more than 2% in early trading.
"
813,ESRX,"Regeneron's earnings rose 27% over the year-earlier quarter to $2.88 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 20 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 39% to $869.6 million, about $45 million above consensus.
"
814,ESRX,"The beat came from U.S. sales of Regeneron's flagship eye drug Eylea, which jumped 51% to $541 million. The Street expected $527 million, according to RBC Capital Markets. The company said it now expects U.S. Eylea sales to rise 30% to 35% this year, up from its previous guidance of 25% to 30%. The company does not provide overall revenue guidance because foreign Eylea sales are handled by Bayer (BAYRY), while other sales come from collaborations and milestone payments.
"
815,ESRX,"Regeneron executives stressed the importance of Protocol T, a study comparing Eylea head to head with its chief competitors, Roche's (RHHBY) Lucentis and Avastin, in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME), a type of vision loss associated with diabetes. Commercial head Robert Terifay told analysts on the company's earnings conference call that Regeneron's market research indicated that the study, published in February, was driving uptake of the drug and taking share from competitors.
"
816,ESRX,"Sees Opening Vs. Avastin
"
817,ESRX,"CEO Len Schleifer added that anecdotal accounts indicated it might also be helping sales in Eylea's original target of wet age-related macular degeneration, since specialists who might have previously only had Avastin in stock now had Eylea available for all uses.
"
818,ESRX,"""We had previously thought Eylea and Lucentis shares should at least equilibrate, but now believe Eylea should overtake Lucentis and maybe even grow the market with share away from Avastin, at least in DME,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt in a research note Thursday. ""REGN also has the power to post surprises from the pipeline.""
"
819,ESRX,"The pipeline product that drew the most discussion on the call is Praluent, the cholesterol fighter under FDA review that is expected to be approved by July. On the call, Terifay remained bullish on the drug's blockbuster potential but acknowledged that negotiations with payers might slow down the launch, as Express Scripts (ESRX) has made clear that Praluent's drug class will be its next target for a price war.
"
820,ESRX,"""We are working with the players involved in the market-access decision-making process to focus on patient good,"" said Terifay. ""That said, it will likely take several months for commercial and government payers to take formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions, and begin to process patient claims. Given these reasons, we expect an initial gradual uptake and launch.""
"
821,ESRX,"Terifay said he expects most patients will begin on the lower 75mg dose of Praluent, then move up to the 150mg dose if needed. Regeneron executives see the potential approval of two dosages as an important difference between Praluent and Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha, a similar drug whose approval deadline is only a month later.

The drugstore giant now sees $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017, up from a prior target of $1 billion, as it feels more cost pressure from the government, such as reimbursement cuts.

"
852,ESRX,"Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) said U.S. prescription-drug spending rose more last year than it had since 2003, according to its annual review. According to the 2014 Drug Trend Report, spending on drugs among the commercially insured rose 13.1% to $980 per member last year. Medicare spending rose 13.8% to $2,987 per member, while Medicaid spending climbed 10.2% to $882.
"
853,ESRX,"The report said that spending on hepatitis C drugs accounted for more than half of the increase, which was not a big surprise: Before 2014 the disease was still treated mainly with generic drugs, but in 2014 Gilead Sciences' (GILD) premium-priced Sovaldi, often prescribed in tandem with Johnson & Johnson 's (JNJ) also-pricey Olysio, took over the market. In October, Gilead launched Harvoni, which rendered Olysio obsolete but cost more than Sovaldi.
"
854,ESRX,"Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits management leader, was one of the earliest and loudest critics of Sovaldi's price, which amounted to $84,000 for a standard 12-week treatment. In its press release accompanying the report, the PBM bragged about how it had taken a bite out of Gilead by making an exclusive deal with AbbVie (ABBV), when it came out with Gilead's first serious competitor in the form of Viekira Pak near year's end. Express claimed that this would save clients $1 billion this year.
"
855,ESRX,"It's not clear, however, how well this is working out for AbbVie. Analysts tracking prescription data estimate that it only has about 10% market share, although the data are incomplete and won't be fully known until AbbVie's Q1 report. Another caveat is that Express' price data does not include rebates, which are a significant part of the picture, especially in the hepatitis C market lately.
"
856,ESRX,"When Gilead reported its Q4 last month, investors had a minor freak out after company executives guided the gross-to-net adjustment — i.e. the rebate level — on the hepatitis C franchise at 46%.
"
857,ESRX,"Express Scripts' release also echoed comments made by its CEO at January's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, where he indicated the next price war target would be PCSK9 inhibitors, a new class of cholesterol drugs expected to come to market this year with two offerings from Amgen (AMGN) and the team of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).

860,ESRX,"The flu season got off to a weak start, but will two of the three largest drugstore chains rally anyway as their earnings seasons get underway this week?
"
861,ESRX,"Walgreen (WAG), the largest retail drug chain, will report results for its fiscal first quarter Friday, a day after No. 3 Rite Aid (RAD) weighs in.
"
862,ESRX,"Analysts expect Walgreen's earnings to shoot up 26% over last year to 72 cents a share. After settling a contract dispute vs. Express Scripts (ESRX) last year, Walgreen's earnings have grown in double digits since its February-ending quarter, though easy comparisons with the prior year helped.
"
863,ESRX,"It's also presumably saving money from a global generic-drug sourcing venture with Swiss-based Alliance Boots, which drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) joined in March.
"
864,ESRX,"Rite Aid, which has been in turnaround mode, buys most of its branded drugs and some generics from distributor McKesson (MCK), which is in the process of acquiring German drug wholesaler Celesio for $8.3 billion — also a move meant to keep costs down.
"
865,ESRX,"And last week, drug wholesaler Cardinal Health (CAH) announced it was forming a generic-drug buying venture in the U.S. with CVS Caremark (CVS), the No. 2 drugstore chain and a pharmacy benefits manager.
"
866,ESRX,"While cost savings are in the works on the pharmacy side — which accounts for more than 60% of drugstores' overall revenue — the retail environment in the front of the store has been tough. Chains have been trying to drive traffic and sales with heavy promotions, analysts say.
"
867,ESRX,"Walgreen's sales have grown at a slower pace than earnings, even with the 45% stake it took in Alliance Boots in August 2012.
"
868,ESRX,"The chain pre-reported Q1 revenue was up 6% to $18.35 billion and same-stores increased 5.5%, largely due to gains on the pharmacy side.
"
869,ESRX,"Prescriptions filled at Walgreen stores opened at least 12 months increased 5.6%, while pharmacy sales grew 7.5%. Though the slow start to the flu season negatively impacted pharmacy sales by 0.3 percentage points, the number of flu shots it has administered to date was 6.1 million vs. 4.6 million last year.
"
870,ESRX,"But Walgreen's front-end comparable sales grew only 2.2%. And November sales were below consensus amid a heavy discounting environment.
"
871,ESRX,"The promotional tone of Walgreen's sales report, wrote Credit Suisse analyst Edward Kelly in a research note, ""seems to telegraph a more difficult Q1 gross margin.""
"
872,ESRX,"Rite Aid said earlier that total sales for Q3 rose 1.9% to $6.3 billion. Same-store sales were up 2.3%. Front-end same-store sales fell 0.2% while pharmacy same-store sales rose 3.5%.
"
873,ESRX,"Rite Aid posted its first profit in eight years in its February-ending fiscal year and has seen gains since then. But profit in Q3 is seen dipping 43% to 4 cents.

876,ESRX,"Analysts were singing the praises of life-science giants Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Illumina (ILMN) Wednesday morning after both surged above Q1 estimates late Tuesday. Shares of both companies were up on the stock market today.
"
877,ESRX,"Gilead's $2.3 billion in sales for its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi was called ""one of the most impressive beats in biopharma history"" by Piper Jaffray's Joshua Schimmer, although he increased his price target by only a dollar to 105. Gilead was up 3% in morning trading Wednesday, near 75.
"
878,ESRX,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee lifted his 2014 sales estimate to $9.5 billion from his previous $7.4 billion, and added $1.05 to his full-year EPS estimate, now $6.15. He expects Sovaldi sales to hit $11.5 billion next year, with EPS reaching $7.
"
879,ESRX,"Nomura's Ian Somaiya lifted his price target to 130 from 121. He wrote that Gilead's position in the HCV market is sustainable, and he says Sovaldi and the new Sovaldi-based combo pill expected to launch later this year are superior to competing products from AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK).
"
880,ESRX,"Cowen's Phil Nadeau was also impressed, but noted that lengthy discussion of ""payor pushback"" on Tuesday's earnings call provided ""probably not nearly enough resolution to satisfy investors."" Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) and insurer United Health (UNH) have both criticized Sovaldi's $84,000 price.
"
881,ESRX,"""Gilead did discuss pharmacoeconomic arguments that support the price of Sovaldi, such as the value of a cure to the health care system, and the cost of treating patients with end stage liver disease ($42k/yr),"" Nadeau wrote. ""While we found Gilead's discussion and datapoints encouraging, we suspect that investor concerns over payors' ability to limit access to Sovaldi and shuttle patients to competing regimens will linger until ABBV's pricing strategy is known (presumably after approval) and payor strategies are defined in early 2015.""
"
882,ESRX,"Meanwhile, gene-testing company Illumina was up 6% Wednesday morning, near 156, after it beat estimates and raised guidance. Sales rose 27% over the year-earlier quarter to $421 million, nearly $30 million above consensus. Earnings climbed 15% to 53 cents a share, topping estimates by 9 cents.
"
883,ESRX,"The company now expects full-year sales growth of 21% to 23%, with EPS of $2.10 to $2.15. Both ranges are above consensus.
"
884,ESRX,"Leerink analyst Dan Leonard wrote in a note Tuesday that the report ""exceeded even what we would have considered a best-case scenario in the face of multiple new instrument launches,"" and lifted his price target to 180 from 160. He wrote that the launches of the new HiSeq and MiSeq gene-sequencing systems did not appear to be cannibalizing from older versions. He added that orders for the HiSeq X Ten system, which Illumina announced in January with some fanfare due to its claim that it can sequence genomes for $1,000 apiece, were double the initial target.
"
885,ESRX,"ISI Group's Ross Muken noted that demand was up across Illumina's entire sequencing portfolio, and raised his price target to 162.50 from 152.50 to reflect increased EPS forecasts. However, he maintained his neutral rating on the stock, saying that the current price already reflects 20% annual revenue growth.

887,ESRX,"Can biotech stocks bounce back? As recently as last month, the Medical-Biomed/Biotech group was ranked No. 1 out of IBD's 197 industries. But it's been dead last over the last four weeks, plunging 22.1%. That partly reflects growth stocks overall falling hard in the current market correction. But specific concerns over sky-high drug prices, notably Gilead Sciences' blockbuster hepatitis C…
"
888,ESRX,"Big pharma Merck (MRK) reported stellar results for its phase-two hepatitis C (HCV) drug trials Thursday, sparking debate among analysts over its potential to take market share from leader Gilead Sciences.
"
889,ESRX,"At the International Liver Congress in London, Merck reported a 98% cure rate in patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 who took a combination of its drug candidates MK-5172 and MK-8742.
"
890,ESRX,"With the two potentially combined in one pill taken once per day, the pairing could rival the convenience and effectiveness of Gilead's (GILD) combo of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, which is currently awaiting an FDA approval expected by October.
"
891,ESRX,"Gilead launched sofosbuvir alone, as Sovaldi, in December. Though it is still recommended to be combined with interferon for genotype 1, which accounts for 70% of all HCV infections, it is already enjoying the biggest launch in drug history.
"
892,ESRX,"Now, however, Wall Street's attention is turning to its rivals.
"
893,ESRX,"Facing The Competiton
"
894,ESRX,"ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients that consensus peak-sales estimates for Merck's regimen will almost certainly go up from the current $400 million. Nonetheless, he wrote, the rise should present no real danger to Gilead.
"
895,ESRX,"""Most analysts (me included) have assumed GILD will capture perhaps 60%-75% genotype 1 share at peak,"" he wrote. ""The open question, however, has been which company grabs the other 25%-40% of the market. I would propose to you that perhaps MRK is now the leading contender for this position.""
"
896,ESRX,"Because Merck still has a way to go through clinical trials before it can file for approval, it won't have the first competing regimen. That's expected to be AbbVie's (ABBV) and Enanta's (ENTA) cocktail, also expected to launch late in the year.
"

"
901,ESRX,"""Our thesis regarding hep C competitive dynamics is that AbbVie's regimen may be underappreciated as a competitor to GILD, given its efficacy across multiple patient types and clean safety (though it still has some disadvantages versus GILD), but that Merck's regimen may be over-hyped as a potential competitive threat,"" he wrote in his research note Thursday.
"
902,ESRX,"But Gilead shares tumbled more than 7% Thursday to 65.48, its lowest close since mid-October, as biotechs and other growth stocks led a sharp market sell-off. AbbVie lost 6.5%. Even Merck, which initially rose to a 6-year intraday high, closed down 2%.
"
903,ESRX,"Gilead may worry after an Express Scripts (ESRX) officer said that the pharmacy benefit manager will try to drive down Sovaldi's $84,000 price. Goldman Sachs analyst Terence Flynn on Wednesday trimmed his Gilead price target after his physician survey implied that the HCV market is price-sensitive.Big pharma Merck (MRK) reported stellar results for its phase-two hepatitis C (HCV) drug trials Thursday, sparking debate among analysts over its potential to take market share from leader Gilead Sciences.At the International Liver Congress in London, Merck reported a 98% cure rate in patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 who took a combination of its drug candidates MK-5172 and MK-8742.With the two potentially combined in one pill taken once per day, the pairing could rival the convenience and effectiveness of Gilead's (GILD) combo of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, which is currently awaiting an FDA approval expected by October.Gilead launched sofosbuvir alone, as Sovaldi, in December. Though it is still recommended to be combined with interferon for genotype 1, which accounts for 70% of all HCV infections, it is already enjoying the biggest launch in drug history.Now, however, Wall Street's attention is turning to its rivals.Facing The CompetitonISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients that consensus peak-sales estimates for Merck's regimen will almost certainly go up from the current $400 million. Nonetheless, he wrote, the rise should present no real danger to Gilead.""Most analysts (me included) have assumed GILD will capture perhaps 60%-75% genotype 1 share at peak,"" he wrote. ""The open question, however, has been which company grabs the other 25%-40% of the market. I would propose to you that perhaps MRK is now the leading contender for this position.""Because Merck still has a way to go through clinical trials before it can file for approval, it won't have the first competing regimen. That's expected to be AbbVie's (ABBV) and Enanta's (ENTA) cocktail, also expected to launch late in the year.However, in a research note Thursday, Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote that a symposium with hepatologist Stefan Zeuzam brought up Gilead's higher efficacy than AbbVie's with certain patients, as well as the risk of drug interactions with patients who also have HIV.Zeuzam also raised the issue of higher alanine aminotransferase levels in a small percentage of patients in Merck's regimen, which ""point to acute liver injury that could motivate many physicians to avoid the regimen.""

905,ESRX,"Investors are warned to avoid buying stocks during market downturns, such as the one that began when the Market Pulse indicated on May 4 that a correction had begun. Yet, temptation lurks in this week's Big Cap 20.Four top-ranked companies with market values of $15 billion or more are in a buying area while two others are just below their entry points. These stocks could pop up when the market turns around.Biotech stock Amgen (AMGN) is just above a 70.10 buy point in a flat base. Profit for the first quarter rose 20% compared with the year-earlier period, the biggest increase in two years. Revenue rose 10%, the most in at least four years.The Thousand Oaks, Calif.-based company is in the highly ranked Medical-Biomed-Biotech industry group and boasts strong annual pretax margins and return on equity. Also, its Accumulation-Distribution Rating of B indicates that the shares are in demand.The stock cleared its buy point April 25 in strong volume, but has since struggled to climb much higher, highlighting the risks of buying during a market downturn.American Tower Reit (AMT), which operates cellular towers used by broadcasters and wireless service providers, is 4% past a 64.65 buy point from a flat base, putting it within the 5% limit that defines a buying area.Like Amgen, American Tower cleared its entry point April 25. However, volume was weak and the stock has struggled to gain traction in the three weeks since.The company has a Composite Rating of 95, putting it at the top of the 25-member Telecom Services-Wireless industry group, which was ranked a weak 135th out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD.Its Earnings Per Share Rating is a best-possible 99, however, reflecting a 143% jump in each of the past two quarters. Also, like several stocks in the Big Cap 20, American Tower's Relative Strength line is at an all-time high, a bullish sign.Meanwhile, Whole Foods Market (WFM) is 1% beyond an 86.45 flat-base buy point, which it cleared May 3 in huge volume.Like the stocks above, Whole Foods is just a few percentage points off its record high, another sign that it's held up well despite the turmoil around it.Cleaning products marketer Ecolab (ECL) is another Big Cap 20 stock still in a buying area. It's 3% beyond 62.52 entry from cup-with-handle base. However, profit growth has decelerated for two straight quarters, to 11% in Q1.Other stocks to watch include HCP (HCP), an operator of health care facilities, which is just below a buy point at 42 in a cup-with-handle base.Express Scripts Holdings (ESRX), a provider of pharmacy benefit management services to employers, insurers and managed-care organizations, is 1% below a 55.19 buy point.

Optum includes a managed care business, a software and consulting unit, and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) provider.The PBM unit, OptumRx, will get a lot bigger when UnitedHealth closes its $12 billion acquisition of Catamaran (CTRX), which was announced on March 30. The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter.The merged entity will serve 65 million customers — nearly twice the 35 million that Catamaran currently serves. That should give UnitedHealth's PBM business the kind of scale and bargaining power to land better deals on drugs, analysts say.""The combination of the two entities will take the total annual prescriptions filled to nearly 1 billion and make it the third largest player in the industry with a market share of around 20%,"" Trefis analysts noted in a recent report.In comparison, the report said, ""CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESRX), which together control more than 50% of the PBM market, filled around 1 billion prescriptions each in 2014.""Trefis says OptumRx was the fastest-growing business in the entire Optum division in 2014: ""OptumRx revenues have almost doubled since 2010, and there was improvement in the bottom line as well. This is exhibited by the fact that EBITDA margins improved from under 3% in 2011 to 4.4% in 2014.""UnitedHealth has an IBD Composite Rating of 92. It belongs to IBD's Medical-Managed Care group, which ranks No. 7 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD.Aetna (AET) is scheduled to report April 28, Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM) are due April 29, and Cigna (CI) on April 30.

"
959,ESRX,"As the price war over the new hepatitis C drugs heats up, the 2015 consensus estimates for both may be too high, according to Deutsche Bank.In two separate notes Tuesday and Wednesday, analyst Robyn Karnauskas calculated the prospects for AbbVie's (ABBV) Viekira Pak and Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Harvoni and Sovaldi after the two companies announced a series of exclusive agreements with payers and pharmacy benefit managers.""ABBV has so far nailed down 7% of US lives (Express Scripts (ESRX) national formulary) while GILD has been chosen as preferred for 30% of US lives (CVS (CVS) and Anthem (ANTM),"" she wrote. ""If we were to assume 10% market share for ABBV among non-exclusive/preferred lives, we see overall share for ABBV at 14% and US sales at $1.25 billion in 2015.""With added revenues from Europe, where the drugs in Viekira Pak are expected to launch this year both as a set and as separate products, Karnauskas arrived at total HCV sales of $2 billion vs. $2.7 billion consensus. However, she also expects Gilead is going to low-ball consensus due to the price discounts it's had to negotiate to compete with AbbVie.""At worst case, we expect discounts in commercial channels to be 15% for Harvoni (5% Sovaldi) which coupled with government discounts (40% Harvoni, 30% Sovaldi) calculates to 22% overall discount for HCV franchise,"" she wrote, explaining that this could result in revenue guidance $1 billion lower than the present consensus of $28.6 billion. ""If guidance comes $2.5 billion lower that would validate what PBMs (pharmacy benefit managers) are telegraphing regarding discounts.""AbbVie is due to report Q4 and 2015 guidance on Jan. 30. Gilead hasn't yet set a date for its report.Despite these lowered estimates, Karnauskas maintained a buy rating on both stocks due to their pipelines full of other promising drug candidates. The stocks didn't react much on the stock market today: In afternoon trading, Gilead was down 0.5% while AbbVie was down 1.4%. Gilead moved back above its 50-day moving average on Tuesday while AbbVie continues to slide below that key level.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.RELATED: Aetna Side With Gilead In Hepatitis C Drug Battle.

"
961,ESRX,"Monday brought a surprising turn to the twisting story of hepatitis C treatments, as pharmacy giant CVS Health said it will offer exclusive coverage for Gilead Sciences' hep C drugs.
"
962,ESRX,"But the key issue of price remained unanswered.The deal seemed to counterattack one cut two weeks ago between pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), days after the FDA OK'd AbbVie's four-drug Viekira Pak for genotype 1 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Express Scripts said that at the start of 2015 it would cover only the Viekira Pak for genotype 1 patients, unless they'd already started a course with another drug.Although both firms were tight-lipped on the details, CVS' (CVS) deal appeared to mirror Express Scripts'. Starting Wednesday, CVS, which also operates as a pharmacy benefit manager, will cover Gilead's (GILD) Sovaldi and Harvoni exclusively on its CVS/Caremark Standard Commercial, Exchange (Marketplace), Medicare Part D and Medicaid formularies. Viekira Pak would be covered only for patients who got an exception or prior approval.What they didn't say was how much CVS will pay for the drugs.Price was the big motive behind Express Scripts' deal, as it had objected to the cost of the new hepatitis C drugs ever since Sovaldi launched in December 2013 at $84,000 for a 12-week round of therapy.Harvoni, which for most patients eliminated the need for companion drugs, launched in October at $94,500 for 12 weeks.However, there wasn't much anyone could do about it as long as there were no competitors of equal quality on the market.When the Viekira Pak was approved on Dec. 19, a price war seemed to have been averted as the treatment priced at a modest discount to Harvoni — $83,319 for 12 weeks — which most analysts thought accounted for the fact that it's more complicated to take than one-pill-a-day Harvoni, though it's equally effective.Price Subject To HagglingAs Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum has observed, the official list price of a drug is a lot like the sticker price on a car, just a starting point for haggling.AbbVie acknowledged that Express got Viekira Pak at a discount, though it declined to reveal how much. Analysts think it could have been 25% to 30%.Gilead's stock fell more than 17% the day Express disclosed the deal, and some analysts cut their ratings or lowered their targets.Monday's news helped Gilead's stock rally 2%. AbbVie fell 2%.""Gilead is not a biotech start-up,"" Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert said Monday. ""This is a savvy, marketing-driven company that understands how to launch and manage a product life cycle. .. . Don't underestimate Gilead's ability to manage the competitive environment.""In his own research note Monday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee pointed out that he and most of the Street had already assumed a Gilead price cut once Viekira Pak came out.""We already have a steep 15% gross to net and moving to 18% over the following few quarters,"" Yee wrote. ""So it's not like we think the average price to CVS is going to be drastically different than a 15%-20% discount.""
"
963,ESRX,"CVS Health (CVS) on Monday said it would select Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Sovaldi and Harvoni as the exclusive treatments for hepatitis C patients who use some of its benefit plans, the latest development in what could become a price war among hepatitis C drugmakers.The decision, which takes hold Wednesday, comes after Express Scripts' (ESRX) move last month to dump Gilead's drugs from its preferred formulary list for genotype 1 hepatitis C patients, in favor of AbbVie's (ABBV) rival drug Viekira Pak. AbbVie agreed to discount the drug to get on the list, amid concerns that the hep C drugs from both AbbVie and Gilead are too expensive for many low-income patients.Harvoni costs $94,500 for 12 weeks of treatment, compared to Viekira Pak's $83,319. Sovaldi costs $84,000 for a 12-week treatment.""Our goal was to create the lowest net-cost solution for the entire population of patients with all genotypes of hepatitis C,"" CVS said, according to Bloomberg. It was unclear if Gilead and CVS agreed to any kind of discount.Express Scripts, in announcing its decision to add AbbVie's drug to its preferred list, cited concerns about a lack of sufficient price competition in the hepatitis C drug space. The company's clients have also warned about costs.""If the specialty drug trend continues to increase by double-digit percentages, payers will be forced to implement even more narrow management tools, thus limiting the number of patients who can afford to receive the drug therapy,"" Paula Jakub, CEO American Foreign Service Protective Association, said last month. ""It only makes sense for manufacturers to work with payers on pricing decisions.""Gilead's shares tumbled 15.5% on Dec. 22, the day of Express Scripts' announcement. They were up 2.8% on the stock market today . AbbVie shares fell 2%, below their 50-day line for the first time since October.CVS said Sovaldi and Harvoni will be the exclusive treatment for its list of standard commercial drugs, as well as its Medicaid, Medicare Part D and health-exchange formularies.The Wall Street Journal reported that patients could get AbbVie's Viekira Pak only if they obtained approval or a medical exception in advance.RBC Capital Markets reacted favorably to CVS' decision in an analyst note.""We view this as positive because it removes near-term uncertainty for many investors who feared CVS would also strike a deal with ABBV and further put more pressure on GILD,"" RBC said.

1311,ESRX,"Biotech stocks sold off hard Friday as Wall Street blamed a letter by several House Democrats asking Gilead Sciences to justify the price of its hepatitis C blockbuster Sovaldi.
"
1312,ESRX,"The letter, dated Thursday, was signed by Reps. Henry Waxman, Frank Pallone and Diana DeGete, all ranking members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It called Sovaldi a ""breakthrough"" in HCV treatment, but expressed concern that ""a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it.""
"
1313,ESRX,"Due to Sovaldi's $84,000 price tag, the letter went on to say that Colorado's and Pennsylvania's Medicaid programs had already announced that they're funding Sovaldi only for the sickest patients, and California's is still figuring out its reimbursement policies. The letter also noted that pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) is ""encouraging some doctors in its networks to delay prescribing Sovaldi.""
"
1314,ESRX,"Meanwhile, hepatitis C is a disease found disproportionately among the poor. As a result of all this, the lawmakers told Gilead to provide an explanation of their pricing by April 3.

"
1317,ESRX,"Gilead's (GILD) fell nearly 5% to 72.07, a 3-month closing low, but some biotechs selling expensive drugs fell even harder, perhaps on fears of a larger change in the national mood on drug pricing.

Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets wrote in an email to clients Friday that ""pricing discussions could generate headline 'concern,' but in our view, this underscores that the drug is going to be huge and they're curing patients and improving society. ...

"
1327,ESRX,"ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum pointed out that Sovaldi compares favorably to older hepatitis C drugs, especially Vertex's Incivek, which goes for $100,000 a year.

"
1329,ESRX,"Schoenebaum also queried Terry Haines, a longtime Washington lawyer and lobbyist who once served as the senior Republican counsel to the same congres sional committee that sent the letter. Haines responded that the government actually has little power to address drug prices. In his view, what Waxman et al. hope to accomplish is a ""public shaming"" not unlike the one Waxman delivered to the tobacco industry some years ago.
"
1330,ESRX,"""This letter is a 'bank shot' that gets things going, with the goal of getting Gilead to significantly lower the price of Sovaldi,"" Haines wrote.
"
1331,ESRX,"Such a move could be politically popular, he added. Discontent about the high price of Sovaldi and of new drugs in general has been swelling from payers and the general public for some time now.

1371,ESRX,"Apple (AAPL) still has plenty of runway for growth, says Michael Orndorff, a fund manager with American Century All Cap Growth .
"
1372,ESRX,"The Cupertino, Calif.-based colossus has dominated the holdings of his $1 billion fund, helping it gain 17.54% this year as of Monday. That's bested the 14.33% gain of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and S&P 500's 15.58% .
"
1373,ESRX,"Orndorff, along with co-managers David Hollond and Marcus Scott, continues to believe in Apple, which made up 10% of the portfolio as of the latest reporting date. The iPhone business, which accounted for 46% of Apple's revenue in the quarter ended June 30, has room to grow, Orndorff says.
"
1374,ESRX,"""There's room with existing carriers and room with adding new carriers,"" he said.
"
1375,ESRX,"He sees a big opportunity with China Mobile (CHL). Apple hasn't inked a big deal with the Chinese wireless carrier. But ""certainly you would think as the largest carrier in the world, Apple is having discussion with them, and at some point in the future they will sign them as a customer,"" Orndorff said.
"
1376,ESRX,"He notes that China Mobile has about 650 million subscribers. Many of them can't afford an iPhone, but still ""it does give you a significant opportunity to sell some additional phones,"" he said.
"
1377,ESRX,"Orndorff also sees more runway with business customers, many of whom are still using BlackBerrys. And there's runway in the overall global market, where he said about 2 billion cell phones are sold each year and only about 6% are iPhones.
"
1378,ESRX,"The fund's managers view Apple as having the ability to keep growing, and sustainable growth is a key quality they want to see in all holdings. They first screen for firms showing accelerating growth in profit and revenue, Orndorff said. Then, they study the quality of that growth, as well as its sustainability.
"
1379,ESRX,"For example, they prefer a company that's expanding thanks to a new product or market, rather than because of a currency benefit.

1380,ESRX,"Beyond accelerating fundamentals, the managers look for stock price outperformance relative to the Russell 3000. Orndorff said they view this technical analysis as ""another tool in our tool set.""
"
1381,ESRX,"""Relative strength can confirm positive changes in the fundamentals, but it can also indicate some deterioration in fundamentals,"" he said. ""Let's say the relative strength is breaking down. We'll try to go back and review if there's something in the fundamentals that's changing.""

1386,ESRX,"After one of the busiest and most important years in its history, Catamaran  (CTRX) must now tackle another major project: holding on to its largest customer.
"
1387,ESRX,"Catamaran, formerly known as SXC Health Solutions, provides pharmacy benefit services and health care information technology systems to corporate clients, managed care organizations, government entities and other customers.
"
1388,ESRX,"As a PBM, the company handles drug benefits for health plans, employers and other health care payers. It works to reduce drug costs by helping clients' members get deeper discounts with retail pharmacies and manufacturers.
"
1389,ESRX,"Catamaran's PBM business got a big boost last year when the company acquired rival Catalyst Health Solutions in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $4.4 billion.
"
1390,ESRX,"That deal, which closed in July, is expected to make Catamaran more competitive with the nation's other major PBMs: Express Scripts (ESRX) and CVS Caremark (CVS).
"
1391,ESRX,"Among other things, Catamaran has designs on landing more contracts with the kinds of Fortune 500 companies that were previously dominated by other PBMs.
"
1392,ESRX,"""The business model Catamaran brings to the party is highly transparent, customer friendly and flexible, which should be attractive to Fortune 500 companies,"" said Brooks O'Neill, analyst at Dougherty & Co. ""We estimate that the Fortune 500 employee market is as big as the overall market Catamaran has traditionally targeted.""
"
1393,ESRX,"While Catamaran chases more business with Fortune 500 firms, it must also focus on keeping its biggest customer: HealthSpring, a Medicare carrier that accounted for 24% of Catamaran's business during the 2012 third quarter.
"
1394,ESRX,"Catamaran's contract with HealthSpring is set to expire at the end of this year. The decision on whether to renew it now rests with managed care firm Cigna (CI), which acquired HealthSpring in 2012.
"
1395,ESRX,"""It's a big customer and, obviously, an important contract,"" O'Neill said.
"
1396,ESRX,"Cigna is expected to make its decision by midyear. Although the company has not tipped its hand, O'Neill and others sound confident Cigna will renew the HealthSpring contract with Catamaran.
"
1397,ESRX,"""Our speculation is that Catamaran is likely to retain its relationship with HealthSpring and possibly even expand its business with Cigna,"" O'Neill said. ""The recent commentary from Catamaran executives has been positive, where before it had been neutral.""
"
1398,ESRX,"In a Feb. 1 report for JPMorgan, analyst Lisa Gill offered a similar view, noting that Catamaran ""remains well-positioned to win a larger outsourcing deal with Cigna.""
"
1399,ESRX,"Meanwhile, Catamaran has scored a couple of impressive wins with other high-profile clients.
"
1400,ESRX,"In early November, it signed a three-year contract to provide PBM service to Target (TGT), one of the country's largest employers. That deal covers about 188,000 of the retail giant's 365,000 workers nationwide. The contract was previously held by Express Scripts.
"
1401,ESRX,"""The Target win supports the thesis that as a larger entity, Catamaran is much better positioned to win larger employer contracts, which have historically been the sweet spot for the larger PBMs,"" noted Gabriel Leung, analyst at Paradigm Capital.
"
1402,ESRX,"Earlier last year, Catamaran signed a three-year contract, $1.2 billion, to provide PBM services to Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, or BCBSRI. The contract went into effect Jan. 1.
"
1403,ESRX,"BCBSRI, a health insurer based in Providence, is the state's leading health insurer. It covers more than 600,000 members, over half the state's population. The previous PMB provider to BCBSRI was CVS, which is based in Rhode Island.
"
1404,ESRX,"""It should be noted that CVS is the sixth largest employer in Rhode Island and the largest private-sector employer,"" noted Tom Liston, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Canada. ""The BCBSRI contract underscores the competitive advantage Catamaran has in situations with complex requirements.""
"
1405,ESRX,"Those advantages include Catamaran's transparent pricing and technology leadership, he says.
"
1406,ESRX,"Another advantage is an efficient operation that lets Catamaran be competitive on prices, analyst O'Neill said: ""We believe Catamaran's EBITDA per script is lower than competitors, so they can be successful by charging customers less money.""
"
1407,ESRX,"Financially, Catamaran has built a reputation for delivering consistently strong growth. The company has increased annual earnings by double or triple digits every year since 2008. Quarterly profit has risen by double digits each of the past seven quarters.
"
1408,ESRX,"Earnings during the 2012 third quarter came in at 25 cents a share, excluding buyout-related expenses. That was up from 22 cents the prior year and a penny above Wall Street views. Even if you include the acquisition costs, Catamaran earned a profit of 10 cents a share.
"
1409,ESRX,"Revenue for the quarter more than doubled to $3.2 billion. It was the fifth time in the past seven quarters that Catamaran's top line rose by triple digits.
"
1410,ESRX,"The company is slated to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 20. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 35 cents a share, up from 24 cents a year earlier. They see full-year profit rising 37% for 2012 and 64% for 2013.

1414,ESRX,"Regular readers of the IBD Big Cap 20 can use the list as a barometer not only of the health of the large-cap sector, but also which industry sectors are at the head of the class.These days, the health care sector is getting an A grade.As today's Big Cap 20 shows, seven companies, or roughly a third of the entire list, are health care-related.This comes as no surprise. Health care is a big chunk of the American economy. Regardless of the November presidential election results, it's bound to grow in the years ahead.It's also an area of continuous innovation and development.As Monday's daily IBD industry groups table shows (today it's on B7), four of the top 30 groups are medical-related.Although Medical ranks just No. 14 within the IBD stock tables, it also sports four leaders as having the attributes of big market winners.HCA Holdings (HCA) ignored the market's decline Monday with its third straight strong advance. Its breakout past a 31.49 base buy point has boosted the hospital giant to a 52-week high. Now, the stock will have to wrestle with upside resistance near the 34-36 price level.The Nashville, Tenn.-based firm suffered a severe drop in earnings from 2005 ($3.03 a share) to 2007 ($1). But HCA has gotten its act together as earnings have climbed every year since then, from $1.27 in 2008 to $2.84 in 2011.Earnings grew 22%, 71%, 39% and 67% in the past four quarters. Revenue growth has been limited to 5% to 13% over the same time. Within the CAN SLIM paradigm those numbers are deficient. But once in a while, a company within a relatively mature industry can still emerge as a big stock winner because institutional demand is long-term and overwhelmingly strong.Within the HCA's latest 10-week base, only one of the six down weeks in price shows heavy trade relative to its 10-week moving average. Yet in that week ended July 13, HCA closed in the upper 60% of the weekly price range.Since such action took place in the base's left side, it actually counts as a week of accumulation, not distribution.Express Scripts (ESRX) continues to show good action after it rallied past a 59.60 buy point in a cup with handle.The handle began on July 19, when the stock reached as high as 59.50 before retreating. The decline within the three-week handle was a normal 7%.The stock has gained as much as 8% since then. It's trading well above its 50-day moving average, which is rising and was near 59.70 as of Monday's close.Elsewhere, Ross Stores (ROST) may be on the verge of building a new base. It's fallen three weeks in a row, but the decline has been a light manner.

1555,ESRX,"In a healthy market, there should be high-quality stocks to buy.Judging by the action in this week's IBD Big Cap 20, the bull market is improving in health.Quite a few stocks are still within buying range after recently rising past proper buy points. They come from a wide range of industries.In mid-July, Agrium (AGU) moved past a 92.84 cup-with-handle entry in fast turnover. Because investors should not buy a stock more than 5% past the proper breakout price, the upper limit is 97.48.Agrium on Monday finished down 1.04 at 96.19 in very thin trade. It's worth noting that Agrium's handle high exceeded the cup's left-side peak. This is unusual, but does not negate the authenticity of the pattern.Bill O'Neil's commentary on past great winner Redman Industries last week also pointed out a base that showed a handle high that was greater in price than the cup's high.Agrium is a Calgary-based producer of fertilizers. Most of its sales come from the U.S., where the severe drought this year has created a fast-shrinking supply of corn. Analysts reason that farmers will buy more fertilizer to capture more profit from high commodity prices.Agrium has a respectable 91 Earnings Per Share Rating, but its bottom line is volatile.Earnings have ballooned 224% from $2.97 a share in 2009 to $9.62 in 2011. But this year, the consensus Wall Street forecast sees growth cooling, up 6% to $10.23.Agrium's top-line growth appears a little more steady, but it still swings. In 2011, sales jumped 44% to $15.5 billion, the biggest bulge in at least nine years. But in 2009, as the U.S. economy began to steady itself after a horrific 2008, Agrium's sales wilted 9%.In the health care arena, Express Scripts (ESRX) closed Monday 3% past a 59.60 cup-with-handle entry.While that marks a second straight decline, the nature of the pullback is positive. Why?Last Wednesday's gap-up of 8% in more than triple normal volume was the kind of action one wants to see during the breakout. When a stock takes a breather, the decline should be mild and in weak trade.That's exactly what happened with Express Scripts Monday. The stock also could have been bought at 59.08.The pharmacy benefits manager has gotten a lot bigger this year due to a merger with rival Medco Health Solutions, which was spun off by Merck (MRK) in 2003.Express Scripts helps insurance companies negotiate lower drug costs. The average year-over-year EPS increase over the past eight quarters was 26%.In the technology space, eBay (EBAY) lies 7.7% extended from a 42.06 base buy point. But the e-commerce powerhouse is close to a 44.04 entry from a square box.Celgene (CELG) is now 10% below its 80.42 cup peak and above the base's midpoint of 69.48.

1590,ESRX,"Massive EPS gains one year might mean that a company tops out the next. While the five IBD 50 stocks in today's screen are set to show 2014 EPS growth that leaves 2013 in the dust, the years beyond might not be as bountiful.Shares of Gilead Sciences (GILD) have launched upward since its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi debuted last year. The company's full-year 2014 EPS is expected to grow 290% year over year to $7.95, partly on Sovaldi and Harvoni — which combines Sovaldi with a non-interferon treatment. Harvoni won FDA approval in October.However, the drugs have faced headwinds this year despite their effectiveness. Concerns from government and patient-advocacy groups over the drugs' steep costs in the U.S. have persisted. Many have argued that the drug is far too costly for low-income hepatitis C patients.What's more, Express Scripts (ESRX), citing concerns about the costs of hep C drugs, said Monday that it would dump Sovaldi and Harvoni from its preferred formulary list in favor of AbbVie's (ABBV) Viekira Pak for the treatment of genotype 1 hepatitis C. Gilead's stock plunged 14% that day and fell 13% for the entire week.Gilead shares have risen 24% since the beginning of the year. But they have struggled to find support at their 50-day line since October, and their relative strength measures have fallen as well. And while massive EPS growth is expected for 2014, analysts project that growth to shrivel into the low-double and single digits over the four years to follow.The stock closed up 2.8% at 93.83 in the stock market today.Generic drug-maker Akorn (AKRX) maintains top-shelf IBD Composite and Relative Strength ratings, and the company is poised to see EPS gains of 105% from a year ago.However, a price hike for its drug clobetasol, a topical rash treatment, weighed on its Q3 results, reported in November. And as with Gilead, analysts forecast Akorn's earnings growth to slow dramatically over the next few years.Shares dropped 9% on its Q3 earnings results, continuing a consolidation that the stock began in October and has remained in since.Facebook's (FB) full-year EPS is expected to grow 90% to around $1.69 a share, driven by Facebook and its still-cool-with-teens Instagram photo-sharing app. The social-media site has snapped up a variety of companies this year in an attempt to anticipate shifts in the online social landscape, and many forecast the company to gain big on online and mobile advertising.As part of their effort to strengthen its position in online advertising, Facebook recently announced a deal to show NFL video clips and Verizon (VZ) ads on its site.Facebook has warned that costs will rise as it steps up spending. Analysts currently expect Facebook's full-year EPS growth to dip to 13% in 2015 but then reaccelerate for the two years after. Shares hit an all-time intraday high of 82.17 on Dec. 23 after clearing a cup base a day earlier. Shares closed up one cent on Friday at 80.78.BitAuto (BITA), the auto-information and advertising website based in China, has benefited from being in the world's largest auto market and China's expanding car culture.Analysts expect the company to grow EPS by 74% this year. In November, the company beat Q3 views on the strength of its ads and gains in the ever-crucial mobile space.Despite near-best IBD fundamentals, the stock has dipped below its 50-day line this month, cooling from a 16% rise after the company reported Q3 results. Still, shares closed up 1.4% on Friday at 73.58 — more than double their value at the beginning of the year.Analysts expect the company's EPS growth to decelerate through 2016 but remain solidly in the double digits.Finally, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is forecast for full-year EPS growth of 69% from 2013 on the strength of its only marketed drug, Soliris, which treats two rare blood diseases.The company has years of double-digit quarterly sales and EPS growth under its belt. Shares cleared an 8-month consolidation in October and jumped 7% after a strong Q3 report. But the stock has since seen more sellers enter the picture, bringing its Accumulation/Distribution rating down to a D- .Analysts expect only 14% EPS growth in 2015 but stronger growth after that.The stock has rattled around its 50-day line over the past two weeks. But it closed up 3% on Friday, just under the line, at 187.48, a potential sign of support to come.

"
1594,ESRX,"The subject of drug pricing keeps getting hotter, though for most people it's a mysterious process.
"
1595,ESRX,"On Nov. 25, pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) said that to rein in costs it's upping the number of drugs excluded from its 2015 formulary to 66 from 48, with new targets including Amgen's (AMGN) popular blood boosters Epogen and Aranesp. And Express says it intends to provoke a price war once competitors to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) hepatitis C drug Sovaldi start coming out, in hopes of bringing down the treatment's $84,000 price tag.Will any of this work? And what will it mean for drugmakers and their investors?To explore these questions, IBD spoke with Ed Schoonveld, managing principal at consulting firm ZS Associates and author of ""The Price of Global Health,"" now launching its second edition.IBD: What's the biggest misconception people have about how drug pricing works?Schoonveld: It's a very complex environment. One of the reasons why there are so many misunderstandings is that the buying process is so different.I like to call it ""dinner for three."" Imagine you go to a restaurant. One person is ordering the meal, one person is eating the meal, and the other person is paying. You can imagine the conversation that's taking place: The one who's paying (says), ""Well, I'm not sure that caviar was necessary."" But then again, the payer might be a little too demanding as well, and say, ""I think a hot dog is good enough.""The patient, of course, is interested in their health, (and is) paying only indirectly for it. The physicians want to make sure the patient is doing well, and the payers may be overly concerned with costs. This is why a lot of people are saying the market mechanism is not there, and they feel they need to interfere, and in many cases are over-interfering.Another reason why it's different is because it's such a capital-intensive industry. It requires a lot of investment, so the cost structure is quite different. It's sometimes hard to explain to patients why they need to pay something for R&D — people (just) want a cure for their disease.What's even more important in that context is that it's changing so much. The combination of the rising cost of health care (and) an economy that's not doing too great (is) putting a lot of pressure on (governments) to cut costs, to reform the system.Then at the same time we have things like Ebola popping up. So we do need the strong development arm, because some of these diseases are actually very scary. And technology is advancing as well, which is probably leading to more expensive solutions.That all comes together in a perfect storm, where payers are faced with tough decisions.IBD: When Sovaldi came out, it seemed a lot of insurers were unprepared and wound up paying out more than they expected. Did the industry learned anything from that?Schoonveld: Obviously, it's raised a lot of debate. Interestingly, there's not been a lot of debate over the value of the drug. Honestly, I wish we had more problems like the Sovaldi problem, where we have a cure for the disease.The big challenge in this case is that in the time horizon, it's difficult for (insurance companies) to fund it. There are tremendous cost offsets that are going to take place, but that's a number of years down the line. That doesn't tend to help them in their short-term perspective.In addition, many health care plans in the U.S. are still pharmacy-only plans (that) really are not getting any benefit from the reduction in the occurrence of liver disease, cancer, everything else. That makes it a little harder for them to make a decision like this, particularly when it's impacting their budgets.In this case, it's more a matter of making sure we find the appropriate ways to treat the patients, and make sure there's additional budget available. For example, in Germany they've done that. It is a temporary budget increase, because it's a curative treatment.IBD: Are pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts getting more powerful in all this?Schoonveld: That's one of the examples of a plan that's only seeing the cost of a drug treatment, as it doesn't get rewarded with any of the benefit. It's a limitation in using PBMs to manage formularies. They don't see as much value in a treatment like this as a more intergrated health care system would see.Taking a step back, what this does is requires the (drug) industry to engage, to make sure we know what our value proposition is. It seems like we have some societal objective to bring these treatments to patients, and so (to clear) a hurdle of financing — which this mainly is — we should make sure we find solutions.IBD: What sort of alternatives are you thinking of?Schoonveld: This is not easy, but there are cost offsets in the long term. So finding a way to make sure that (cost offsets) are being recognized — even to make sure they (drugmakers, payers, PBMs, government agencies) talk to each other, rather than through the media — would be helpful.But this (Sovaldi) is a very specific case. There are many other drugs where insurance companies (and) physicians are looking at how they judge value, how it should be used appropriately. You see a lot of medical societies, like ASCO (the American Society of Clinical Oncology), have been pretty vocal about how they're going to take cost more into consideration in their clinical guidelines.This puts the pharmaceutical industry in a position where they, even more than before, have to make sure that they realize and provide evidence of how new treatments are providing value to patients, to physicians and to payers, and make sure there is guidance in how this can best be used in treatment. And that's sometimes hard to do at launch, but that's where this all leads.

1683,ESRX,"December is usually a quiet month for medical tech news, but this year will bring a few potentially stock-moving events worth keeping an eye on.As you digest your Thanksgiving turkey, here are the top five in chronological order:By Dec. 5, biotech Incyte (INCY) is looking to get an important expansion of the label on its sole marketed drug, Jakafi. As explained in the recent Incyte profile in The New America, Incyte and its partner Novartis (NVS) have been pulling in respectable income on Jakafi as a treatment for a rare bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis. The FDA is pondering whether to add an indication for polycythemia vera, a milder but more common condition. While uptake for that condition is expected to be fairly slow, it's expected to help push Incyte into more consistently profitable territory next year.Two days later, hot medical-device company Edwards Lifesciences (EW) will hold its annual investor day, in which it is expected to give 2015 guidance for the first time. The company impressed the Street last month with its strong Q3 report and Q4 guidance, on the strong launch of its latest Sapien artificial heart valve. Currently, analysts are forecasting 2015 sales of $2.47 billion, up 7% from this year's estimate. Earnings per share are expected to rise 17% to $3.95.Then, sometime before Dec. 21 (which likely means Dec. 19), the FDA is due to issue its verdict on AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis C combo of Viekirax and Exviera. The clinical-trial data was so good, the Street would probably be less surprised if a meteor hit Manhattan than if the FDA rejects the drug, but what has analysts all on pins and needles is what the price will be. A price significantly lower than Gilead Sciences ' (GILD) recently launched Harvoni, which costs $94,000 for a 12-week treatment, would help AbbVie gain market share and certainly please pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts (ESRX), which has been hoping to start a price war to drive down the suddenly high cost of hepatitis C treatment. However, most analysts are expecting AbbVie to price only a little bit lower. Also affected by all this will be Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA), which licensed a component of Viekirax to AbbVie.Speaking of hepatitis C, sometime before the end of the year the Street is expecting to hear phase one clinical-trial data on Achillion Pharmaceuticals' (ACHN) ACH-3422. The drug belongs to the coveted nucleoside inhibitor class, to which Gilead's mega-blockbuster Sovaldi (also a component in Harvoni) belongs, but which has otherwise shown enough safety issues that there are few left in development. Especially since Merck (MRK) acquired Idenix Pharmaceuticals for its ""nuc,"" speculation that Achillion could be the next target has driven up its stock price, but the Street has seen little real data about the safety and effectiveness of ACH-3422. The data would help analysts determine just how much the company is worth.Speculation exists about whether two aborted takeover attempts earlier this year will be re-upped. The Street seems to have mostly given up on the possibility that Pfizer (PFE) will make another bid for AstraZeneca (AZN) after the six-month cooling-off period mandated under U.K. takeover rules expired on Wednesday. Astra's CEO Pascal Soriot threw more cold water while appearing on CNBC Thursday, saying the deal would have fallen apart even if it had been made because of proposed restrictions on tax-inversion deals in the U.S. However, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro is still holding out hope for a union of orthopedics firms Stryker (SYK) and Smith & Nephew (SNN). Stryker didn't bid for the company, but since a news report leaked that it was working on one, it got slapped with the U.K.'s six-month cooling-off period anyway, which expired Nov. 28.""We believe a SYK/SNN deal could provide more recon (reconstructive surgery) scale, particularly in international markets, expand SYK's presence in trauma/sports medicine, and bring cost synergies,"" Novarro wrote in a note Friday.

1686,ESRX,"Air Methods (AIRM) has seen that happen more than a few times — including twice in the past three months.
"
1687,ESRX,"The company provides air medical transport and other services via a fleet of owned and leased helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.
"
1688,ESRX,"At the end of 2013, its fleet consisted of 264 company-owned aircraft and 136 leased aircraft.
"
1689,ESRX,"Its Air Medical Services Division — the largest air medical transport provider in America — generates the lion's share of revenue.

"
1692,ESRX,"Planning For Emergencies
"
1693,ESRX,"Air Methods' medical business is divided into two basic service areas: hospital-based and community-based.
"
1694,ESRX,"Its hospital-based division provides medical helicopter and airplane services, primarily on fixed contracts paid by hospitals.
"
1695,ESRX,"With this business, Air Methods typically provides only the aircraft and the pilot.
"
1696,ESRX,"The main challenge with the hospital-based business is that foul weather can hamper Air Methods' ability to transport patients.
"
1697,ESRX,"""A lot depends on the weather — whether you can actually go in and respond,"" said Richard Close, analyst at Avondale Partners. ""Someone might call in for a helicopter, but if the visibility is really low you can't go out and get them. When it doesn't fly, it doesn't get paid.""
"
1698,ESRX,"The community-based service unit is designed to serve whole communities and operate independently of hospitals. Air Methods not only provides the aircraft and crew, but also critical-care medical staff trained in areas such as burns, cardiac, pediatrics, respiratory and trauma, and can help out with specialty-team transports.
"
1699,ESRX,"This side of the business carries higher margins than the hospital-based division. It's even more volatile because in addition to having to deal with the weather, Air Methods must handle issues with medical care and billing.
"
1700,ESRX,"As anyone in the health care business knows, billing for medical service doesn't necessarily mean getting the money.
"
1701,ESRX,"""There's a big variance in net revenue based on the payer mix — who has commercial insurance, who depends on Medicare, who has no insurance at all,"" Close told IBD. ""Not everyone pays on time, or even at all. That dynamic has a really big impact.""

1705,ESRX,"The results for both quarters weren't that surprising, Close says.

"
1708,ESRX,"The good news for Air Methods is that its second-quarter results reflected positive trends for the company, says CEO Aaron Todd.
"
1709,ESRX,"These include more hospitals outsourcing their transport services to a third party. ""We've seen an acceleration of that activity, and in a great majority of cases our hospital partners have chosen Air Methods to outsource,"" Todd told IBD. ""Second-quarter earnings reflect an underlying quality in that they were driven by positive trends and top-line expansion of more patients being transported.""
"
1710,ESRX,"Air Methods reported Q2 earnings of 73 cents a share, up 49% from the prior year and 7 cents above analysts' consensus estimates. Revenue gained 14% to $258.5 million, also beating views.

1711,ESRX,"Revenue from the Air Medical Services Division rose 7% to $219.6 million, while tourism revenue nearly doubled to $31.4 million. Revenue from the United Rotorcraft unit climbed 51% to $7.4 million.
"
1712,ESRX,"Second-quarter total patient transports rose 7% to just less than 15,000, while net revenue per patient transport also improved 7% to $11,353.
"
1713,ESRX,"Much of the company's growth can be traced to the move by more hospitals to a community-based model to save costs, Close says.
"
1714,ESRX,"""Under a community-based contract, the costs for clinicians and other expenses get shifted to Air Methods, which has to hire the nurses and paramedics,"" he said. ""That's the advantage to the hospital, but it also has a positive financial impact for Air Methods.""

"
1752,ESRX,"She says growth in the U.S. is driven by increased diagnosis rates and patients moving to newer and pricier therapies. In emerging markets such as China and Mexico, the growth potential is rooted more in richer diets and less exercise as people move from rural to urban areas. Obesity is one of the biggest risk factors for developing diabetes.
"
1753,ESRX,"Andersen expects the impact from the Express Scripts decision to linger through the year.
"
1754,ESRX,"The three drugs cut from the preferred list were NovoLog, the firm's best-selling insulin drug in the U.S., NovoLog Mix and non-insulin drug Victoza.
"
1755,ESRX,"Sales of Victoza, in a class known as GLP-1, had been growing at double-digit rates. But first-quarter sales slowed, to $535 million from $587 million in the fourth quarter, though they were still 9% higher than a year earlier.
"
1756,ESRX,"Foreign-exchange head winds didn't help, nor did industrywide inventory cuts by U.S. wholesalers. Also, the company faced generic competition for Prandin, its blood-sugar-lowering oral drug.
"
1757,ESRX,"Not only did Novo Nordisk miss sales forecasts in Q1, it lowered its forecast for the full year for the first time in a decade.
"
1758,ESRX,"Revenue in the quarter grew just 2% in Danish kroners to the equivalent of $3.73 billion, or 7% in local currencies.
"
1759,ESRX,"The new forecast for 2014 calls for 7% to 10% growth vs. 8% to 11% previously.
"
1760,ESRX,"The quarter's sales results broke a streak of 47 straight quarters of double-digit top-line growth, says Kasper Poulsen, head of investor relations.
"
1761,ESRX,"""We knew there would be a head wind in Q1,"" he said. But he says the company was ""surprised by how fast Express Scripts implemented the (preferred provider) change,"" which went into effect Jan. 1. It took just one month rather than the typical two to three, he said.
"
1762,ESRX,"The bottom line fared better. Novo Nordisk earned 45 cents a share in the first quarter, a penny above views, and up 10% from the earlier year.
"
1763,ESRX,"Gross margin (83%) and operating profit (39.5%) were up 3% and 6%, respectively.
"
1764,ESRX,"Still, analysts expect per-share profit growth in American depositary receipts to slow this year to 11% from 25% last year. Revenue is seen climbing 7.5% to $16 billion.
"
1765,ESRX,"As efforts in the U.S. to cut health costs continue, ""The big risk is that people begin to push back (on prices),"" Gal said.
"
1766,ESRX,"Poulsen says increased pressure to contain costs could result in higher rebates, making it more important to come out with differentiated products.
"
1767,ESRX,"The company's new-generation insulin drug Tresiba has been launched in 12 countries outside the U.S., including the U.K., Germany and Japan. Approval in the U.S. will depend on results of a new clinical trial.
"
1768,ESRX,"The Food and Drug Administration asked for more data on heart risks for the long-acting insulin product.
"
1769,ESRX,"Novo Nordisk says the U.S. trial is progressing ahead of plan and expects to have enough data by mid-2015 to support an interim analysis.
"
1770,ESRX,"U.S. Launch
"
1771,ESRX,"If Tresiba shows positive data from the trial, as analysts widely expect, it would bode well for a U.S. launch as early as 2016.
"
1772,ESRX,"""Tresiba would help to extend their growth and renew their insulin portfolio,"" said Andersen, who expects the drug to generate $3.5 billion by 2023.
"
1773,ESRX,"Tresiba is an ""improved version of Levemir"" and has ""better pricing power,"" Andersen said.
"
1774,ESRX,"Tresiba has patent protection through 2028 vs. Levemir's 2019.
"
1775,ESRX,"Levemir competes with Sanofi's Lantus. Both modern insulin drugs are growing at a robust clip, and are different enough from each other to maintain pricing power, she says.
"
1776,ESRX,"Lantus will likely see competition in 2016 from a biosimilar drug.
"
1777,ESRX,"Tresiba's launch in the U.S. would leave both Levemir and Lantus behind as older-generation products more likely to do better in emerging markets, Andersen says.
"
1778,ESRX,"Novo Nordisk's pipeline includes a combination drug of Tresiba and Victoza, called Xultophy, which could launch in Europe around the new year, pending regulatory approval. A drug to treat obesity is under review by the FDA and by officials in Europe.
"
1779,ESRX,"Data from other trials are due out next year, including a faster-acting version of NovoLog. An oral GLP-1 class drug is also in development.

Unlike chief rivals Eli Lilly (LLY) and Sanofi (SNY), which target many other diseases, Novo Nordisk focuses mostly on diabetes therapies.That sharp focus is a competitive advantage, says Ronny Gal, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.""They have very good technical skills, and they spend a lot of money on sales and marketing,"" he said.Karen Andersen, an analyst with Morningstar, calls Novo Nordisk ""the most innovative player in diabetes.""But Novo Nordisk got off to a slow start this year. First-quarter sales were hurt in the U.S. as pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) removed three of the company's top drugs from its preferred provider list in favor of drugs with lower prices from Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca (AZN).Analysts expect 2015 and 2016 to look healthier as Novo Nordisk benefits from price hikes and new drug launches.

2291,ESRX,"Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) missed Q1 sales estimates and lowered its full-year revenue forecast Thursday, though profit was in line. Novo stock was down more than 2% in early trading on the stock market today.
"
2292,ESRX,"Novo made 45 cents a share in the quarter, up about 10% over the year-earlier quarter in Danish kroner, and a penny above analysts' consensus. Sales increased 2% in kroner to the equivalent of $3.73 billion, missing consensus of $3.97 billion.
"
2293,ESRX,"The company lowered its 2014 sales-growth guidance to 7%-10% from its previous range of 8%-11%, while maintaining operating profit growth of around 10%. CEO Lars Sorensen said he knew this year would be challenging since pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) took Novo's drugs Victoza and NovoLog off its preferred-treatments list, lowering the reimbursement for the two drugs. Management is also seeing more competition in the diabetes market, especially from the new SGLT-2 inhibitor class.

"
2295,ESRX,"Novo is also facing generic competition this year to its oral glucose-lowering drug Prandin.
"
2296,ESRX,"On the bright side, the company said the launch of Tresiba, its new long-acting insulin product, is going smoothly, with sales multiplying ninefold from the year-earlier quarter. Novo has now launched the product in 12 countries, but is still working on an FDA approval, which was unexpectedly delayed last year when the agency asked for more data on Tresiba's heart risks.
"
2297,ESRX,"Sorensen said the study the FDA requested is ahead of schedule, and an interim analysis of the data should be available by mid-2015.
"
2298,ESRX,"Novo's stock holds an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 97. The stock has been consolidating since it hit an all-time high of 48.42 on Feb. 25. By midmorning Thursday, Novo stock was trading near 44.

Management is also seeing more competition in the diabetes market, especially from the new SGLT-2 inhibitor class.Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana was the first of that class to be approved in the U.S. last year, and AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga was approved in January. More are coming down the pike from Astellas, Roche (RHHBY) and Eli Lilly (LLY).Novo is also facing generic competition this year to its oral glucose-lowering drug Prandin.On the bright side, the company said the launch of Tresiba, its new long-acting insulin product, is going smoothly, with sales multiplying ninefold from the year-earlier quarter. Novo has now launched the product in 12 countries, but is still working on an FDA approval, which was unexpectedly delayed last year when the agency asked for more data on Tresiba's heart risks.Sorensen said the study the FDA requested is ahead of schedule, and an interim analysis of the data should be available by mid-2015.Novo's stock holds an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 97. The stock has been consolidating since it hit an all-time high of 48.42 on Feb. 25. By midmorning Thursday, Novo stock was trading near 44.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_AreevesRELATED: Pfizer Confirms Pursuit Of AstraZeneca

2559,ESRX,"Merger and acquisition activities across the globe hit record highs in the first half of 2018 driven by growing ambition of American companies.According to the latest Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence data, global mergers and acquisitions totaled more than $2.5 trillion, up 64% from the year-ago level and marked the strongest year-to-date period since records began in 1980. With this rise, the mergers are on track to surpass $5 trillion in 2018, which would top 2015, the highest yearly total on record (read: How to Play the Surge in Global M&A With ETFs).The massive increase in M&A activity came despite growing global trade tensions. United States M&A volumes climbed 82% to $1 trillion, the country’s strongest period for deal making on record. This was followed by European deals, which nearly doubled to $767 billion in the first half.Most of the boost came from media and healthcare deals. The proposed media M&A has totaled $322.5 billion so far – up more than six times from the year-ago level. The sector is poised for more consolidation in the coming months as a federal judge ruling on AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  set the stage for waves of M&A in the media space that would change the landscape of the industry (read: Comcast Outbids Disney for Fox Assets: Media ETFs Surge).Big deals have driven much of the activity as total number of deals valued at $10 billion or more surged to 36 in the first half of 2018. These constituted $950 billion in deals, or nearly 38% of all activity. The bidding war for Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) was the largest contributor. This was followed by health insurer Cigna’s (CI  -  Free Report) deal to purchase Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion and Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical purchase deal of Shire for $62.4 billion (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).The boom in M&A is likely to continue, given an accelerating economy, still-low interest rates, and tax reform, which allow companies to bring offshore cash back home. Potential cost savings through mergers are further fueling the urge to merge in the current ultra-competitive environment.How to Tap?Investors could easily take advantage of this surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio. This strategy looks to tap the price differential (or spread) between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company. This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company. When the deal is completed, shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price (in some cases slightly below the deal price), giving investors a nice profit.Below, we have highlighted three merger ETFs to ride out the surge from the increasing M&A deals. Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low correlation strategy to their portfolio: IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time providing short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has 61 holdings in its basket with the largest allocation to Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) and Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) on the long side with each accounting for more than 8% share. The product has amassed $629.2 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 131,000 shares a day. It charges 77 bps in annual fees. The ETF has lost about 0.3% year to date (see: all the Hedge Funds ETFs here). ProShares Merger ETF (MRGR  -  Free Report) This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund holds a well-diversified portfolio of 39 stocks and charges 75 bps in annual fee. Healthcare, financials, real estate and technology are the top four sectors. The ETF has been able to manage assets worth $4.5 million while it sees light volume of just 1,000 shares a day. It is down nearly 1% so far this year. Bottom Line While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock, the ETFs provide diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk. Further, these could be excellent choices for investors in the rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market. This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently, ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks. As a result, investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2561,ESRX,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) has achieved a historic feat yesterday on emerging as the youngest participant on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) or DJIA. This is a momentous exploit not just because this goliath stock has entered the world’s most coveted index but more so for dramatically replacing Dow’s oldest member, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report). With this success, Walgreens stalled GE’s uninterrupted run on the exchange for 110 long years.The change will be effective Jun 26 market opening.Let’s delve deeper into the significance of the decision for Dow investors.GE Booted Off: How Far is This Logical?The S&P Dow Jones indices report says that “General Electric was an original member of the DJIA in 1896 and a member continuously since 1907”. However, per the index, this decision was prompted by the GE stock’s persistent trading at a low price of late, which affected the entire index’s price performance in turn. Going by the report, “the DJIA is a price-weighted index and the range of prices among its 30 constitutes matter. The low price of GE shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point.”Overall, GE’s market capitalization rose to $594 billion in 2000 and has shrunk unbelievably over the years to $111.87 billion at present.Over the past year, shares of GE have nose-dived by more than 50%, a significant plunge justifying the above logic. If we compare the stock with its broader industry, the stock has plummeted 52.1% compared with the industry’s 16.7% decline.For the same time frame, DJIA has rallied 16.9% and another sought-after index, S&P 500, remained slightly below at 13.7% growth. Both indices however, remained far above the General Electric’s tally. Walgreens’ DJIA Foray: Does it Make Sense?While talking about the decision to incorporate Walgreens on the DJIA index, the S&P Dow Jones indices report informed that Walgreens will contribute more meaningfully to the index as its share price is higher than GE’s. The stock will also help the index represent the U.S. market and economy in a better way.The investment world has already been dissected into two with respect to this impactful decision. Per David Blitzer, chairman of the S&P’s index committee, industrial companies like GE no longer hold prominence in the American economy, whereas healthcare, banks, tech and consumer companies race as front runners now.From Walgreens’ point of view, this world’s first pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise has never has been shoved away from the limelight, courtesy of its consistent flow of strategic developments. The company has been formed through the combination of legacy Walgreens and Alliance Boots. The merger brought together a couple of companies with compelling portfolios and iconic brands, complementary geographies, shared values and trusted health care services via pharmaceutical wholesaling and community pharmacy care.Recently, in a bid to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs, Walgreens has tied up with Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) and announced plans to expand their existing group purchasing efforts. Also, Walgreens’ Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) contract will extend its growth strategy and offer operational as well as financial benefits.Following the news, shares of Walgreens gained 5.24% to $68 at yesterday’s close.The Opposite ViewOn the flip side, some are questioning the practicality of substitution as CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is a bigger contender of Walgreens in the similar field in terms of market cap, volume and prescription revenues.According to the analysts, Walgreens incurred immense debt to maintain its expansion through acquisition strategy.The company’s long-term debt shot up to $12.5 billion as of February 2018 from $3.7 billion in August 2013 (per a Wall Street Journal report).Moreover, while CVS Health is currently in the process to complete its $69-billion Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) deal, its decision to buy the health insurerhas been taken quite positively by the investment world. Economists are looking forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put brakes on America’s mounting health-care costs. In spite of this huge prospect, CVS Health not present in the list of 30 Dow members is putting the investors in sort of dilemma. Walgreens’ stock performance too is currently not looking much convincing. Over the past year, shares of Walgreens have lost 17.9%, outperforming the DJIA and S&P 500 index. The broader industry has witnessed a 10.7% decline. Per a Bloomberg report, “On paper, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. is an underwhelming choice for inclusion in the world’s most famous stock index.”How Significant the ‘Delete’ & ‘Replacement’ Will Be?According to many investment experts, the General Electric-Walgreens case is more of a publicity stance for Dow, gradually losing its sheen since the economic recession of the 1990s. Going by a Reuters’ article, “GE is currently the sixth smallest member of the Dow by market value, and it sports the index’s lowest stock price, making it the least influential component of the price-weighted average.”A Lipper data also concluded that while just $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds attached to the Dow, ETFs tracking the S&P 500 index, have assets of around $380 billion. Undoubtedly, next week, GE’s exit and Walgreens’ entry may not have any relevant effect on the performance of the index.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

The company’s shares have gained 8.2% versus the industry’s rally of 8.8%.A rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States, loss of clients and stiff competition in niche space are significant headwinds for the company.Battered by such challenges, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter adjusted earnings is currently pegged at $2.20 per share, down 1.8% in the last two months. The same for revenues is pinned at $25.34 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 0.01%.The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Below we take a sneak peek at the major issues plaguing Express Scripts.Loss of Patient ClaimsThe MO-based pharmacy benefit manager lost certain public-sector clients, which resulted in a 1.6% year-over-year decline in adjusted network claims in the last reported quarter.Moreover, adjusted home delivery and specialty claims totaled 77.3 million in the quarter, down 8.6% year over year.Express Scripts Getting AcquiredExpress Scripts recently announced that it is getting acquired by Cigna Corporation, a global health insurance company.

2565,ESRX,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ESRX due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsExpress Scripts posted first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.77 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Further, adjusted earnings improved 33% year over year.Revenues of $24.78 billion edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.76 billion and inched up 0.5% year over year. The upside was driven by operational cost improvement backed by focus on technology, digital tools, home delivery and specialty services.Q1 Patient Claim Volume DetailsExpress Scripts’ first-quarter 2017 witnessed year-over-year declines in patient claims.Adjusted network claims were 262.8 million, down 1.6% year over year.Adjusted home delivery and specialty claims were 77.3 million in the reported quarter, down 8.6% year over year.As a result, net adjusted claims in the first quarter were 340.1 million, down 3.3% on a year-over-year basis. The decline was primarily driven by the loss of certain public-sector clients.Margin DetailsAdjusted gross profit in the first quarter was $2.94 billion, up 0.6% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin was flat year over year.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $917.8 million, up 12.2% from the prior-year quarter.GuidanceAdjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2018 are estimated in the range of $2.18-$2.22, which represents growth of 26-28% year over year. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $2.29, which is above the projected range.The company expects total adjusted claims for the second quarter in the range of 335-345 million, of which 280-290 million are attributable to the core business.For 2018, adjusted earnings are estimated in the band of $9 to $9.14, significantly below the previous range of $9.27-$9.47 per share. This is because of suspension of share-repurchase program. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently peged at $9.32, which lies significantly above the guidance.Revenues are expected in the band of $99 billion to $102 billion. The Zack Consensus Estimate for revenues in 2018 is currently pegged at $100.86 billion, which lies within the guidance.    Adjusted EBITDA is expected between $7.6 billion and $7.8 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

The stock was also allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for value and growth investors while momentum investors may want to look elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

2566,ESRX,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) is set to acquire Meridian Health Plans of Michigan and Illinois and MeridianRx, a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) to become the top-most Medicaid provider in the aforementioned states. The company would be paying a total of $2.5 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close by the end of this year.With this deal, WellCare will be able to add around 1.07 million of Medicaid members in Michigan and Illinois. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is also expected to generate more than $4.3 billion in 2018 total revenues from Meridian’s businesses and acquire an integrated PBM platform. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.WellCare has always pursued strategic acquisitions to accelerate its growth and strengthen its portfolio. In 2017, the company had acquired Arizona Medicaid Assets of Phoenix Health Plan and Universal American Corp.The acquisition of one of the largest privately held, for-profit managed care organizations in the United States is reminiscent of the increased merger and acquisition taking place in the healthcare industry, as the players are busy transforming their businesses to become a comprehensive healthcare provider.  In the same vein, two mega acquisitions of Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) by Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and that of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) are already underway.Rising medical costs, shift to value-based care, threat of competition from online retailers like Amazon.com Inc., demographic changes and increased regulations are some of the catalysts driving mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare industry.The WellCare and Meridian transaction is expected to add about 40 to 50 cents per share to the company’s adjusted earnings in 2019, 70-80 cents per share in 2020 and more than $1.00 per share in 2021. This is inclusive of $30-$40 million in synergies that will ramp up over the upcoming years and exclusive of one-time transaction-related expenses of $75 million to $85 million and cumulative integration-related expenses of $50 million to $60 million.WellCare expects to fund this transaction through a combination of cash in hand, an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility, issue of new equity of about $800 million to $1.2 billion, and new debt of around $600 million to $1.0 billion.The company also announced that it has secured $2.5 billion in committed bridge financing.Shares of WellCare have rallied 9.96% year to date, outperforming the industry’s average of 7.28%. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2567,ESRX,"Buoyed by the tax reform in the United States and a resurgent Europe, first-quarter 2018 recorded an all-time high tally of $1.2 trillion for global mergers and acquisition (M&A) activities. This portrays an intense consolidation wave across diverse markets, as most firms aim to capitalize on bullish macroeconomic sentiments to pursue transformative deals.According to Thomson Reuters data, M&A surged 67% year over year although total number of transactions declined 10% to 10,338. This implies that the average deal size increased with clarity on tax and solid equity and debt markets, all of which swelled corporate cash coffers and helped top management to loosen the purse strings. The transactions were also not concentrated in any particular geographic region and were well spread out as M&A volume doubled in Europe, while increasing 67% and 11% in the United States and Asia, respectively.A $67 billion deal inked by U.S. health insurer Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) to acquire pharmacy chain Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) was the biggest M&A deal in the quarter. This was followed by a $38.5 billion deal by German energy firm E.ON SE to acquire the renewable energy business of RWE Aktiengesellschaft.Despite the game-changing transactions, the quarter witnessed intense volatility in equity markets as U.S. President Trump imposed trade tariffs on Chinese goods. This perhaps robbed some companies suitable acquisition opportunities as corporate valuations remained high and management became more cautious to trade at inflated price levels.Regulatory risks also increased during the quarter as exemplified by the heightened threat perceived by the U.S. government in the proposed hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) for domestic chip-maker QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report). The transaction was blocked on concerns of national security as government feared that it would lose its technological prowess to the Chinese counterparts.The quarter further witnessed uncertainty on antitrust activities as the U.S. Department of Justice thwarted the $85-billion deal by AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) to acquire Time Warner Inc. . Concerns were raised about how the deal would affect two different sectors and the deal, therefore, was summarily rejected.Nonetheless, the first quarter made a perfect start to the year and is likely to give more firepower to the government as well as to top management of firms to pursue more strategic transactions and swim with the tide.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

2568,ESRX,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report).

2569,ESRX,"Strong operating performance of health insurers for the past many years continued in the first quarter of 2018. Higher medical enrollment, surging revenues, medical cost management and an increasing share of revenues from complementary services helped results. Most of the major players raised their earnings guidance for 2018, reflecting solid operating environment down the road. Moreover, a strong U.S. economy has held the health insurance industry in good stead. A record-low unemployment rate and gradual wage increase bode well for the space. High employment and wage growth fuel demand for health insurance and various other health-related services provided by these insurers. The overall bullishness reinforces our sentiment that the growth cadence for the sector should continue. Despite being tied by a strict regulatory regime and a fast-changing industry backdrop, insurers have time and again emerged as winners. To put it into perspective, revenues and earnings of almost all dominant health insurers have shown a secular rise since 2010, when a sweeping and historical health care reform was put into effect by ex-president Obama.Ever since the enactment of the healthcare reform act, numerous changes have gone into effect, which have altered the traditional operating model of the health insurers. The ensuing changes were taken sportingly by health insurers, which then adapted themselves to the changed industry dynamics. A shift in business mix from commercial to government, the way care is delivered from fee for service to value for care, greater emphasis on medical cost management, growing consumerism and technical innovations have been the game changers. Rapid evolution is, however, continuing in the industry. Given the need of the hour, players in the industry are taking concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive health care providers from their earlier role of being traditional payers. The same is being effectuated by a cross-sector collaboration wherein health insurers are foraying into another realm of the health care sector such as pharmacy benefit management, ambulatory care and physician services. Some of the deals that are underway in this vein are the merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) take over od Express Script Holding Co. (ESRX  -  Free Report) as well as the UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) acquisition of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). All said, the industry has remained an outperformer having generated returns higher than the S&P 500 index in each year since 2012. In the past five years, the health insurance industry has returned a whopping 257% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 91%. Is Further Upside Potential Left? While the industry has outperformed the broader market, valuations remain at the same level as that of the industry.The Zacks HMO industry is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 16.95 which is near 17 for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Over the last five years, the industry has traded in a range of 10.6 to 20.1, with a median of 15.3. We therefore go a bit further and look at the PEG ratio which bakes in the growth rate of the industry. The industry’s PEG ratio is 1.3, which compares favorably with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.8. This shows that the industry is undervalued and has room for upside. Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification, health insurers are broadly grouped in the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). We rank 256 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We club our industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.) Stocks Worth Adding Though past performance does not guarantee future returns, strong industry fundamentals keep our confidence undeterred. Therefore investing in stocks from the health insurance industry is a good investment decision.The following stocks with solid fundamental and a favorable Zacks Rank make them perfect picks.WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 3.3% upward over the last 30 days.

(GTS  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #2 stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised21.7% upward over the last 30 days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2570,ESRX,"President Donald Trump on Friday unveiled his plans of lowering drug prices, in keeping with promises he made in the run-up to the Presidential elections. Pharmaceutical companies and the broader industry had been anticipating that Trump would come down heavily on them, as he had long criticized drugmakers of “getting away with murder” by charging way too much for their products. However, these fears were dispelled as Trump’s proposal will actually not directly hamper the profitability of drug companies. Instead, the reforms are aimed at increasing competition for medicines, cutting list prices and reducing patients’ out-of-pocket costs. This pleasant surprise gave stocks of pharmaceutical companies a boost.Long-Standing CommittmentLowering drug prices was one of Trump’s presidential campaign promises. He had committed to take on the big drug companies, which was also supported by Trump’s Democrat opponent Hillary Clinton. Since then, Trump has time and again criticized drug manufactures and pharmaceutical companies for charging too much for their products. This had kept the pharmaceutical companies reeling under pressure for quite some time, as they had feared that Trump’s pharma plan could hurt their profits. The broader pharma sector SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals (XPH) has declined 6.3% year to date. And the industry had feared further losses, apprehending harsh measures from Trump on Friday.Raising Competition on the AnvilThe twist in the tale came when Trump stressed on increasing competition for medicines. This was one of the highpoints of his speech on Friday. Framing his plan as the “most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people” and describing it as “American Patients First,” he laid out a policy that intends to increase pharmaceutical competition and the power of negotiations while lowering patients’ out-of-pocket costs. Trump’s policy also aims at creating incentives to lower list prices of prescription drugs. The reforms certainly are a ray of hope for American patients for whom the rising cost of healthcare is a nagging concern. The American Patients First plan will have both immediate actions as well as future opportunities for both lowering out-of-pocket costs faced by patients and reducing drug prices. Interestingly, Trump refrained from raising direct Medicare price negotiations on Friday, although this was one of his agendas during his presidential campaign.Pharma Stocks Rally on Trump’s ReformsClearly, Trump’s American Patients First plan doesn’t seem to be a threat to pharmaceutical companies and their profits. In fact, it is very much in line with the financial interest of drugmakers and health insurers and will no way hamper their profits. These fears, which had often resulted in shares of pharma companies taking a hit in the last few months, finally saw them bouncing back on Friday. Although the sector declined initially on Friday, stocks started rallying by the time Trump had finished his speech. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) increased 6.2%. Also, shares of CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) were up3.2%, 2.8%,1.3% and 0.3%, respectively. Merck & Co has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump Spares DrugmakersThe biggest reason behind this rally is that Trump’s plan actually doesn’t hurt U.S. pharmaceutical companies at all. In fact, the administration keeps in place, and in a few cases, extends the role of drug middlemen, who have been often been blamed for spiking drug costs. Trump’s plan calls for drug companies to display prices in ads and restrict “gag clauses” for pharmacists. This proposal comes because some pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) have contracts that donot allow pharmacists from letting patients know if a drug on the cash counter would be cheaper than if it was purchased usingtheir insurance.However, Trump’splan gives the companies new powers in Medicare Part D, the U.S. program under which seniors get drug coverage. This would allow Medicare to change the list of covered drugs midyear in order to push back against price hikes of some generic drugsthat donot actually have so much competition. This led to shares of healthcare service companies like McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) rising 2%, 1.8%, 1.4% and 1%, respectively.Summing UpTrump’s American Patients First, which comes with a set of reforms, had sparked fears among pharmaceutical companies for quite some time. However, the fears seem to have subsided somewhat, as the new plan doesn’t hurt drugmakers and their profits. This saw investors’ confidence finally getting reinstated and pharma and biotech stocks rallying.   5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

2571,ESRX,"Launched on 11/17/2009, the IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Hedge Fund ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexMNA is managed by Indexiq, and this fund has amassed over $522.41 M, which makes it the largest ETF in the Hedge Fund ETFs. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the IQ MERGER ARBITRAGE INDEX.The IQ Merger Arbitrage Index seeks to achieve capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer. This differentiated approach is based on a passive strategy of owning certain announced takeover targets with the goal of generating returns that are representative of global merger arbitrage activity.Cost & Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.77% for this ETF, which makes it the least expensive product in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, Morgan Stanley Ilf/treas/inst (CASH  -  Free Report) accounts for about 19.60% of total assets, followed by Rockwell Collins Inc (COL  -  Free Report) and Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 66.04% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has lost about -1.61%, and is up about 1.13% in the last one year (as of 05/04/2018). MNA has traded between $30.08 and $31.86 in the past 52-week period.MNA has a beta of 0.14 and standard deviation of 4.98% for the trailing three-year period. With about 65 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

2573,ESRX,"For this Global Week Ahead, let’s rank five world market themes put out by Reuters in London.To start, I thought the latest five themes showed no compelling events.In lieu of that, what is there to watch most closely?That falls to a more subtle variety of factors – a possible inflation surprise, tariff fallout, ECB talk and FX volatility.Inside the USA, there are two key matters. First, traders should watch out for any change in U.S. consumer inflation on Tuesday. This reading may cause the biggest reaction in stock markets this week. Second, traders should watch out for U.S. tariff fallout. That can also introduce downside pressures.Outside the USA, watch out for Mario Draghi speaking on monetary policy and watch two currencies — the U.K. pound and the Hong Kong dollar.Below, I list the five themes in order of importance.(1) Watch the markets when U.S. Consumer Inflation hits on TuesdayWall Street is demonstrating a heightened sensitivity to any sign of rising prices, worried it might result in more aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed. So U.S. consumer price data for February will be closely watched on Tuesday.It’s worth remembering that recent stock market tumbles kicked off when January’s jobs data stoked inflation fears by reporting the biggest wage gain in more than 8-1/2 years. February’s employment report released on Friday showed the strongest job growth in more than 1-1/2 years, but a slowdown in wage gains.U.S. CPI rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in January, and a punchy 0.5 percent month-on-month. Stock markets could again come under pressure if the February data show inflationary pressures are building, with investors moving toward pricing four Fed hikes this year rather than three.(2) Watch out for U.S. Tariff internal friction and external falloutIt’s said a war has no winners. That certainly applies to trade wars. In the United States, initiator of the latest battle, big trade and budget deficits make the dollar vulnerable, as does the fact that the Fed (unlike its European and Japanese counterparts) can cut interest rates if things get too nasty. S&P500 companies earn half their profits overseas and will likely suffer from any outbreak of trade hostilities.But others may be harder hit. Many reckon the dollar will decline less than during the 2002 steel wars — its current account gap is smaller and growth is stronger.What about others? The currencies of small, open, developed economies such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia will fall, while emerging markets will suffer if global economic and trade growth slows.Metals tariffs alone won’t much dent China, South Korea, Taiwan or India — steel exports to the United States comprise 0.2 percent of Korea’s GDP for instance. But an escalation to other sectors will hurt, first via equity outflows that then feed into currencies, especially if the dollar firms.The markets of trade-reliant countries, such as Korea and Taiwan, should be hurt more than domestic-focused ones such as India or Brazil.(3) Watch out for any cues on ECB Monetary Policy Normalization  Central banks’ journey back to something resembling policy normalization went up a gear last week when the ECB dropped its pledge to increase QE if needed.Mario Draghi soothed any market concerns in his subsequent press conference, stressing that policy will remain super-loose. This was enough to push the euro, bond yields and bond spreads back down again.But despite Draghi’s ‘softly softly’ approach, it looks like the beginning of the end of the ECB’s post-crisis measures is in sight. The question for markets now is how quickly or slowly the ECB moves.On the other hand, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda quashed creeping speculation the BOJ could tighten policy soon, signaling his readiness to ramp up stimulus if need be.Draghi and several other ECB officials are scheduled to speak this week, so there will be further guidance on the pace of change ahead.There are no speeches from Fed officials scheduled this week, while Jerome Powell heads his first policy meeting as Fed Chair in the following week.(4) Watch the U.K. Pound: Brexit news is an underlying driverSterling started 2018 with its best monthly performance against the dollar since 2009. But renewed uncertainty about whether Britain and the European Union can agree on their future trading relationship has undermined the pound’s rally in recent weeks, despite a more hawkish central bank.Next week could prove crucial for investors unsure how to trade the pound, given the relative resilience of the UK economy and a stream of negative Brexit headlines.UK finance minister Philip Hammond gives his half-yearly update on the economy on Tuesday amid an improvement in public finances but nervousness about the outlook.Traders will also be looking closely for progress in talks with the EU to believe a Brexit transition deal — which Britain has said it will unveil in late March — will not be delayed.Edgy traders briefly pushed the pound to a three-month low versus the euro on Wednesday as the EU rejected Britain’s proposed trade deal. Against the dollar, sterling was largely unmoved by this week’s Brexit headlines and is stuck trading around $1.3860, five cents below its post-Brexit-vote peak hit in January.With the market pricing in an 80 percent probability of a Bank of England rate hike for May, the risk is that a delayed transition deal stays the BoE’s hand to tighten policy. Given Britain’s large trade deficit, its vulnerability to an extended trade war could also weigh on the pound.(5) Watch the Hong Kong Dollar: It has fallen to a 33-year lowThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate isn’t where you would normally expect to see too much movement.It’s confined to a trading band set and managed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. But this week the currency fell to a 33-year low, and markets are on high alert for HKMA intervention as it approaches the weaker end of its 7.75-7.85 trading band against the U.S. dollar.Hitting 7.85 would force the HKMA to mop up some of the excess liquidity and narrow the interest rate gap that has pushed the spread between Hong Kong and U.S. interbank rates to its widest since the 2008 financial crisis.The HKMA last intervened to defend the HK dollar’s peg in FX markets in 2015. While it sold bonds last year to mop up some cash, it has been absent this time. An attack on the trading band is unlikely to succeed however; the HKMA has some $500 billion in firepower.The question is, will the market correct itself or will the HKMA be compelled to hold regular liquidity draining operations? For investors, there is no precedent to lean on.As a gateway to Asian economies, money keeps pouring into Hong Kong and the territory is unlikely to suffer a shortage of cash any time soon even if some Chinese money moves back to the mainland.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report): This is a $45B market cap stock in the Medical Services industry, with a long-term Zacks VGM score of A.Last week, Cigna offered to buy the company. This comes 3 months after Aetna bought CVS Health Corp.Nissan Motor (NSANY  -  Free Report): This is a $41B market cap automaker, based in Japan.

2574,ESRX,"The health insurers continue to gain traction from increasing enrollment, product development, business diversification, cost-control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position. All these led to both top and bottom-line growth for most players in the field. Many in the industry have also kept raising their full-year guidance at the end of each quarter, thus indicating their rising operational excellence.Banking on the above positives, the industry has gained nearly 35.9% in a year’s time, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 11.3%. The Zacks HMO industry is placed among the top 21% of the Zacks Ranked industries. Nevertheless, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were a drag.Government Plans Look LucrativeDespite the prevalent uncertainty surrounding the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, the industry continues to put up a good show in 2018.  We see sustainable growth potential in expanding government programs. The recent announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding raising 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4% also proves that. This action will definitely attract the private health insurance players with the aim of increasing their managed care participation. Since the government plans have already been highly profitable for health insurers, their increased participation is likely to result in significant top and bottom line growth.Apart from this upside, an increasing focus on preventive and value-based care, growing accountable care organizations, international business expansion, mergers and acquisitions also keep the industry’s growth trend alive.Thriving Economy, Rising Interest Rates, Changing Demography Fuel GrowthGrowing demand for health insurance products and services on the back of changing demographics, increasing income, low unemployment and jobless claims continue to aid the insurance stocks. A strong economy enables people to spend more on their healthcare needs that again opens up scope for the health insurers. An ageing U.S. population also boosts demand for Medicare Advantage plans, especially designed for the retirees to control the rising Medicare costs. This in turn encourages more participation from health insurers ensuring profitability on this ground.Additionally, the recent interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve also bodes well for health insurers. The managed care companies benefit from the rising rates owing to a generally sizeable investment securities portfolio coupled with manageable debt levels.Consolidation in the IndustryOf late, increasing consolidation has been a major phenomenon in the health insurance industry. This in turn leads to market concentration, which should help players enhance their operational scale as well as gain a substantial market share.Health insurers are trying to integrate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain. The recently announced acquisitions of Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) by Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) underline the growing trend of two healthcare sector industries coming together to amicably provide a comprehensive care.Retailers have also expressed their interest in the health insurance industry. Humana has been in talks to get acquired by Walmart Inc. Eyeing the rewarding Medicare business provided to the surging baby boomers population, the retail major intends to invest big time in the health insurance industry. Recently, Amazon has also entered into a joint venture with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway to manage insurance for their employees and is further looking for a CEO to helm its healthcare joint venture.Stocks to Bet on Before Q2We zeroed in on three stocks, poised for an earnings beat in the second quarter of 2018.

2575,ESRX,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Express Scripts Holding has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.17, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.95. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Express Scripts Holding’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15.21 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it could be a solid entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.03. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Express Scripts Holding has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 7.81, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Express Scripts Holding stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Express Scripts Holding has a P/S ratio of about 0.41. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.37 right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Express Scripts Holding currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Express Scripts Holding a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Express Scripts Holding is just 0.89, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.59. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 6.96, which is far better than the industry average of 17.80. Clearly, ESRX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Express Scripts Holding might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score and Momentum Score of A, each. This gives ESRX a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower, while the full year estimate has seen seven upward and one downward revision in the same time period.This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has jumped 9.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus  Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteHowever, this bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock, as we have just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance in the near term. Nonetheless, the bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock’s prospects in the near term look good.Bottom LineExpress Scripts Holding is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite having a Zacks Rank #3, the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the top 48% of more than 250 Zacks industries, which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company.So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

2577,ESRX,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for the first-quarter of 2018, wherein earnings topped expectations but sales missed the same.  Nevertheless, the company’s shares are trading up in the pre-market trading. Regeneron’s stock has lost 27.2% in the last six months compared with the industry’s 11.5% decline.The company reported earnings of $4.67 per share in the quarter beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.51 and up from $2.92 recorded in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues in the quarter increased 15% year over year to $1.51 billion driven by strong sales of Eylea. Revenues however missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 billion. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Regeneron has co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report). The company is solely responsible for the sales of the eye drug and is entitled to the profits in the United States. However, it shares profits and losses equally with Bayer from ex-U.S. Eylea sales, except in Japan, where the company receives a royalty on net sales.Quarterly HighlightsNet product sales increased to $988 million in the quarter, up 15.1% year over year. The majority of sales came from Eylea in the United States ($984 million, up 15.2%).Sales also include Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Bayer collaboration revenues of $437 million, compared with $404 million in the year-ago quarter. However, collaboration revenues from Sanofi decreased to $189.5 million from $210.4 million primarily due to the end of the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement with Sanofi on Dec 31, 2017, lower reimbursement for Dupixent development activities, and an increase in the company's share of the Dupixent commercialization expenses.  Bayer collaboration revenue grew due to an increase in share of net profits in connection with higher sales of Eylea outside the United States.Praluent recorded global net sales of $60 million in the quarter, up from $36 in the year-ago quarter. We note Praluent has been developed in collaboration with Sanofi. Product sales for Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara are recorded by Sanofi, while Regeneron shares profits or losses from the commercialization of the drug.Dupixent sales came in at $131 million. The drug was approved in 2017 for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Kevzara recorded sales of $12 million.R&D expenses decreased 1.7% while selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 11.5% during the quarter. The decrease in R&D expenses were primarily due to due to a decrease in clinical manufacturing costs and a decrease in dupilumab development costs. SG&A expenses increased due to higher headcount and headcount-related costs and an increase in commercialization-related expenses to support the launch of Dupixent.2018 Outlook UpdatedCollaboration revenues from Sanofi are now projected around $450 - $485 million, compared to the previous guidance of $450-$500 million. The company now expects adjusted unreimbursed R&D expenses in the range of $1.23-$1.31 billion, compared to the previous projection of $1.2-$1.33 billion.Pipeline UpdateThe FDA has accepted for review the company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the label expansion of Eylea Injection. The company is seeking approval a for a 12-week dosing interval of Eylea Injection in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) based on physician's assessment. The action date set by the FDA is Aug 11, 2018.During the first quarter, Regeneron announced positive top-line results from the phase III study, PANORAMA, on Eylea in moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  The study results will form the basis of a sBLA which the company expects to submit to the FDA by the end of 2018.The company received a significant boost when the FDA approved Dupixent (dupilumab) injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in 2017 and is now looking to expand Dupixent’s label.  Dupilumab is being evaluated in asthma, adolescent and pediatric atopic dermatitis, nasal polyps, and eosinophilic esophagitis, with additional studies planned in 2018. Data from the phase III studies in patients with nasal polyps and adolescent patients with atopic dermatitis is expected during 2018. The sBLA for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) with moderate-to-severe asthma was filed with the FDA and the regulatory body has set a target action date of Oct 20, 2018. Additionally, a phase II/III study in younger pediatric patients (from six months to five years of age) with severe atopic dermatitis was initiated in the first quarter of 2018.A phase III study evaluating Praluent in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia was initiated in fourth-quarter 2017. The sBLA for use of Praluent with apheresis was filed with the FDA, which has set a target action date of Aug 24, 2018. During the quarter, Regeneron and Sanofi announced that the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial met its primary endpoint. The trial showed that high-risk patients who added Praluent to maximally-tolerated statins experienced significantly fewer major adverse cardiovascular events compared to those on maximally-tolerated statins alone. In addition, in this study, adding Praluent to maximally-tolerated statins was associated with reduced death from any cause. Moreover, both the companies have decided to lower the net price of Praluent in exchange for straightforward, more affordable patient access from Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report). Praluent will become the exclusive PCSK9 inhibitor therapy on the Express Scripts national formulary.The FDA also accepted for priority review the BLA for cemiplimab for the treatment of patients with metastatic CSCC or patients with locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for surgery and set a target action date of Oct 28, 2018.Our TakeRegeneron’s first-quarter results were mixed with earnings beating expectations while sales missed on the same. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the pipeline progress. The potential label expansion of Eylea in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration will further boost sales. The action date set by the FDA is Aug 11, 2018. A positive outcome will boost investor sentiment as well as the company had earlier suffered setback when it decided not to advance the nesvacumab and Eylea combination study to phase III development after two phase II studies evaluating the combination therapy failed to show additional benefit over Eylea monotherapy in patients with diabetic macular edema or wet age-related macular degeneration.Meanwhile, Dupixent uptake in the United States for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis was encouraging. Moreover, the company is also looking to expand Dupixent’s label.Zacks RankRegeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3(Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2578,ESRX,"Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after market close. Solid performance by the Pharmacy Benefit Management segment (“PBM”) is likely to drive the company’s top line. However, the company is getting acquired by Cigna Corporation by the end of 2018.In the last reported quarter, Express Scripts delivered adjusted earnings of $2.16 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.08. Further, adjusted earnings improved from $1.88 in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $25.38 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.12 billion.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $24.76 billion, reflecting a rise of 0.4% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.76, indicating an increase of 32.3% year over year.Let’s dig deeper to analyze how things are shaping up before the earnings announcements.PBM in FocusExpress Scripts is the largest PBM in North America. The company has been consistently trying to expand its core PBM business. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM revenues is pegged at $22.60 billion.We believe that the company’s unique offerings of home-delivery pharmacy care, specialty pharmacy care, specialty benefit management and medical and drug data analysis services buoy optimism. Express Scripts also distributes a full range of biopharmaceutical products and provides extensive cost-management and patient-care services.The company inked an agreement to acquire privately-held eviCore healthcare at $3.6 billion in October 2017. The transaction was closed in the fourth quarter of 2017. eviCore provides evidence-based and integrated medical benefit management services (MBM) solutions that drive cost reduction and quality care outcomes. The acquisition is expected to prove accretive to Express Scripts’ adjusted diluted earnings per share within the first full year of operation, the first quarter being no exception.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise  Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteExpress Scripts' PBM services coupled with eviCore's complementary medical benefits management is likely to build a solution.Strong demand for the company’s solutions continued into the quarter under review. The company expects solid demand for SafeGuardRx, 90-day supply for chronic medications, exclusive Accredo Specialty Pharmacy and advanced opioid solutions. Through each of these programs as well as many others, Express Scripts delivers superior care to patients at an affordable cost.The company’s latest offering of Multiple Sclerosis Care Value Program has been launched on Jan 1. This program extends the company’s differentiated payment model by shielding payers from costs associated with discontinued therapy. Express Scripts already enrolled over 22 million lives as of yet. Management claims this as the most successful launch till date.Other Factors to ConsiderGuidance: Adjusted claims for the first quarter of 2018 are expected in the range of 335-345 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 are estimated in the range of $1.73-$1.78. This represents growth of 30-34% on a year-over-year basis.For the full year, adjusted earnings are estimated in the band of $9.27-$9.47, reflecting growth of 31-33% year over year. Revenues are expected in the band of $99,000-$102,000 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected between $7,600 million and $7,800 million.Coming to guidance for Express Scripts’ core business, total adjusted claims are expected in the range of 280-290 million for the first quarter of 2018.Client-Retention Rate Positive: Express Scripts entered 2018 with strong market momentum and continued to witness success in retaining key clients. By the end of the previous quarter, the company created trusted client relationships by delivering exceptional care to patients while controlling costs. Its favorable drug-trend results are clearly indicative of the above fact. Buoyed by strong prospects, Express Scripts expects to provide retention rate guidance for 2019 of 96-98%.Express Scripts Getting Acquired: After declaring that Express Scripts is losing its biggest customer — the leading health insurer Anthem Inc., the company recently announced that it is getting acquired by Cigna, a global health insurance company.The acquisition is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2018. Per the definitive agreement, Cigna will take over Express Scripts in a cash and stock transaction worth $67 billion. Notably, this includes Cigna's assumption of approximately $15 billion debt of Express Scripts.In fact, Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody’s Corporation, is worried about Express Scripts’ high customer concentration and pricing pressure. Per Moody’s, Express Scripts is likely to experience declining script volume and higher-than-typical customer losses in the days to come. Other challenges include fewer generic drug introductions, softening mail order growth trends, client focus on cost savings and transparency.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Express Scripts in the quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

2580,ESRX,"Waves of mergers and acquisitions have been heating up the healthcare space this year that could change the landscape of healthcare business. This is especially true given that health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain.The latest catalyst is the health insurer Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which has planned to acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion, including $15 billion in debt. The moves comes three months after a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) agreed to buy the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), for $207 per share or $69 billion (read: 4 ETFs to Gain From CVS-Aetna Deal).Inside The DealUnder the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Cigna shareholders will own approximately 64% of the combined company.The merged company would create a one-stop shop for customers' healthcare needs, ranging from sale of drugs to insurance cover. It would benefit consumers by bringing together the medical care and pharmacy benefits at one roof to improve treatments and lower costs.The combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit, and CVS after it completes its merger with Aetna. The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmacy business. The e-commerce giant recently announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) in order to curb medical costs for their employees.The transaction would result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after it closes. As a result, Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from $18 to $20-$21 in 2021. The deal is expected to close by Dec 31, 2018 and is subject to approval from shareholders of both companies and anti-trust regulatory approvals (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).ETF ImpactThe announced merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CI-ESRX deal.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment.

2582,ESRX,"Masimo Corporation (MASI  -  Free Report) recently announced favorable results from a study, which evaluated the performance of noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring (NIHM) using Masimo noninvasive and continuous hemoglobin (SpHb). Masimo’s share price rallied 0.8% to $84.62 on Feb 23 post the announcement of the results.Notably, SpHb monitoring offers real-time visibility to changes or lack of changes in hemoglobin in blood samples, without which clinicians often get limited access to invasive methods, delaying laboratory results.Conducted at Michigan State University, a comparison was drawn with invasive laboratory hemoglobin (LabHb) monitoring on trauma patients having solid organ injury with severity score of 16.6. Their status of blood flow was assessed using physical examination per normal institutional pediatric trauma guidelines.Masimo Corporation Price and Consensus  Masimo Corporation Price and Consensus | Masimo Corporation Quote NIHM using Masimo SpHb was conducted continuously using a Masimo Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter and SpHb values were recorded multiple times to correspond with LabHb blood draws.Study results reflect NIHM’s (using Masimo SpHb) clinically acceptable precision, while following hemoglobin trends in the defined pediatric trend patient population. Researchers have further deduced that NIHM is a valuable addition to traditional laboratory hemoglobin monitoring.Market ProspectsPer forecasts made by Research and Markets, the global hemoglobin testing market is projected to see a CAGR of 10.6% between 2016 and 2020.The gradual shift from traditional POCT (Point of Care Testing) methods in laboratories boosts the market.Consequently, the proven study results of Masimo’s SpHb are likely to fortify the company’s hold in the niche of hemoglobin monitoring, apart from driving the customer base.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Masimo has underperformed the industry in terms of price.

2584,ESRX,"Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 27, after market close. Notably, the company delivered an average earnings surprise of 0.6% in the trailing four quarters.Moreover, in the past year, Express Scripts has outperformed the industry The stock has gained 5.4%, compared with the industry’s rally of 1.3%.Let us take a look at how things are shaping up before the release.PBM in FocusExpress Scripts is the largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) in North America. The company has been consistently trying to expand its core PBM business.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteHowever, one of the major revenue segments within its PBM unit — the PBM Product Network — is expected to reflect a decline in the quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM Product Network revenues stands at $12,082 million, reflecting a sequential decline of 0.8%. While this is expected to mar fourth-quarter results, an expected improvement in other segments should help the company generate solid results this season.Interestingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM Home Delivery revenues is pegged at $11,541 million, showing a rise of 5.4% sequentially. We believe the company’s unique offerings of home-delivery pharmacy care, specialty pharmacy care, specialty benefit management, and medical and drug data analysis services buoy optimism. Express Scripts also distributes a full range of biopharmaceutical products and provides extensive cost-management and patient-care services.Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM Service sales is pinned at $368 million, showing an increase of 7.6% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayView Upbeat: Prior to the fourth-quarter earnings release, management raised the previously-issued adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2017 from $6.97-$7.05 to $7-$7.08. This indicates a 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.Per management, the raised projected range can be attributed to the combination of accretive acquisitions and strategic tax planning initiatives.Notably, the company has issued guidance for 2018, where it expects the acquisition of eviCore healthcare to prove accretive to earnings.Favorable Estimate Revision Trend: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter revenues is pegged at $25.12 billion, showing year-over-year growth of 1%.Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings per share stands at $2.09. This reflects 11.2% growth year over year.Benefits from Generic Utilization: Express Scripts stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population. The company is focusing on specialty drugs as well as generics of late.Notable Developments: Express Scripts recently closed the acquisition of eviCore healthcare for $3.6 billion, with a view to drive growth, earnings and cash flow. Through the buyout, the company intends to provide improved healthcare and control unnecessary spending on pharmacy and medical.Recently, Accredo, a specialty pharmacy of Express Scripts, earned an accreditation from URAC, a Washington DC-based independent accreditor of health care management organizations.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Express Scripts in the fourth quarter.

2585,ESRX,"In some market shaking news, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced that they are partnering with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway  and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) to build a healthcare company in order to cut costs for their U.S. employees and improve worker satisfaction.As a result, shares of health sector companies are sliding in intraday trading. Insurance players like Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) are all down between 2.5%-5.5%, while pharmacy giants CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), and Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) each dipped around 5%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) is down nearly 6% as well.The goal of the partnership is to create a company with the sole intention of providing healthcare for its workforce, and the future entity will not aim to make a profit, but instead focus on the technology that will provide “simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare.”Amazon, Berkshire, and JPMorgan said that the kind of healthcare to be provided to employees will be long-term, and that they hope to bypass the frustration associated with securing healthcare from a third-party provider who is ultimately concerned with their own bottom line.“The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” said Berkshire Chairman and CEO Buffett. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.”Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that “Hard as [forming a new healthcare company] might be, reducing healthcare’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort,” while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon said the ultimate goal is to “create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.”There have been rumors of an Amazon entry into the pharmacy business for a while now—that so-called Amazon Effect—so this announcement is not entirely a surprise. The healthcare company is still in the “early planning” stages, though there is a temporary management team in place with leaders from each organization.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

2587,ESRX,"Small biotech firm Spark Therapeutics (ONCE  -  Free Report) recently announced a new gene therapy that is designed to treat a rare, inherited retinal disease that can cause blindness. Approved by the FDA, Luxturna costs $425,000 per eye, or $850,000 for both, though Spark did reveal payment and access programs to help with the astronomical price tag.The company said that it is exploring payments for Luxturna by installments, as well as tying payments to how well the therapy works. For instance, Spark wants to offer discounts based on whether or not the drug initially works and remains effective; there are roughly 1,000 to 2,000 patients in the U.S. who suffer from this kind of inherited retinal disease caused by a mutant gene.Spark is also proposing bypassing hospitals and healthcare providers and selling directly to insurance companies and specialty pharmacies. According to Bloomberg, the company is already in talks with Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) on such a deal.And, the pharmacy benefits manager looks to be a big proponent of Luxturna as well. Steve Miller, Express’ chief medical officer, said that ""Many people were anticipating this [retinal disease treatment] would be more than a million dollars…In the end, this is a revolutionary product, and I think in most plans this will be covered.”In a phone interview with Bloomberg, Spark CEO Jeff Marrazzo said that “We believe that this price reflects not only the breakthrough, life-altering value of one-time Luxturna, but it will enable us to continue to invest and build on the revolutionary science that supports not only Luxturna but the rest of our pipeline.”How is Luxturna delivered?Since Luxturna is a gene therapy, it involves the delivery of a healthy copy of a gene, using an altered virus, in order to make up for one that is deficient and causes a disease, in this case, retinal dystrophy. Luxturna is delivered to patients just once.In clinical studies, patients’ sight was examined based on their ability to navigate an obstacle course in varying light levels, and those who received the treatment showed huge signs of improvement in doing so at low light after a one-year period, notes CNBC. They also described being able to read again and seeing snowflakes for the first time to a panel of FDA advisers.Shares of ONCE closed up 4.6% to $55.76 per share.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

2588,ESRX,"The year 2017 has failed to turn things around for CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has underperformed the S&P 500 market year to date. The stock has lost 5.4% as against the S&P 500 market’s 20.4% gain.During the first-quarter 2017 earnings call, CVS Health’s President and Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said, “We continue to expect 2017 to be a rebuilding year, but our goals remain clear, and we fully intend to return to healthy levels of growth.” Unfortunately, little of this could materialize. The company is still grappling with issues from the past along with other challenges.2016 Deals Major BlowsCVS Health is still trying to recover from the setback caused by Prime Therapeutics’ collaboration with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) in August 2016. Owing to this, CVS Health lost access to Prime’s 22 million members. Notably, Prime Therapeutics is the fourth largest Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) in the United States owned by 14 leading Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans.Another major blow was dealt at the end of 2016 when the TRICARE retail pharmacy network managed by Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) restricted CVS pharmacies, including those in Target stores, from participating. This network, with more than 57,000 locations, included Walgreens Boots as a member instead.Thanks to these developments, CVS Health’s shares lost 15.2% in the last five months of 2016.   2017 Hasn’t Been Kind as WellCVS Health’s Retail/Long Term Care (LTC) business has been sluggish since first-quarter 2017 largely due to declining same-store sales, continued reimbursement pressure and a rise in the generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed).The company’s Retail/LTC business was also majorly impacted by weak operations in hurricane-ravaged areas like Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Puerto Rico. The company has valued the hurricane impact at about $55 million — primarily costs to cover insurance deductibles.The speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the PBM market has aggravated matters for CVS Health. To counter competition, CVS Health will have to add more digital and customer-friendly programs.CVS Health ~ A Force to Reckon With“If there is no struggle, there is no progress”Nothing could be more apt than this remark by Frederick Douglass. CVS Health, with a massive market cap of $74.52 billion, has been leaving no stones unturned to bounce back.Mergers & Acquisitions to Strengthen PBM BusinessIn a historic decision, CVS Health decided to acquire the United States’ third-largest health insurance company Aetna (AET) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is projected at $77 billion). The company expects the takeover to close in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. CVS Health expects $750 million of near-term synergies from the deal, with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post closure of the transaction.Many view the merger as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gains and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business.Apart from the Aetna deal, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS Health’s PBM customers.Initiatives to Boost Retail/LTC BusinessThe company has also been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that CVS Health is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share in 2018 and beyond. The company’s tie-up with OptumRx, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to provide a 90-day Pharmacy solution to OptumRx commercial clients was made available at the beginning of July. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card. Subsequently, the company is planning to collaborate with PBMs and health plans to offer a menu of services such as MinuteClinic services, Infusion and Long Term Care. Also, Store Brands is an area of both strength and opportunity for CVS Health. The company’s latest initiatives like next-day and same-day delivery and automatic refills of prescriptions with a text message also seem promising.Recognizing the growing opportunities in the digital market, CVS Health has also been focused on enhancing its online and mobile capabilities in 2017. Building on the strength of its digital tools within pharmacy, with 60% of patients using them, the company is focused on offering advanced services to customers. These services range from Curbside program to same-day delivery options as well as enhanced mobile functionality and ExtraCare. Moreover, CVS Health has been enthusiastically working with Instacart and is now delivering from 2,800 stores.Is There a Rebound in the Cards?CVS Health has been firing on all cylinders of late. The company recently inked a five-year agreement with Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) to provide services including claims processing and prescription fulfillment to support IngenioRx, a new PBM. Notably, the agreement will be implemented on Jan 1, 2020, and will run through Dec 31, 2024.While such measures will help smoothen the bumpy ride for the company, 2018 might come with a fresh set of surprises and challenges.

2589,ESRX,"Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) recently completed the buyout of eviCore healthcare for $3.6 billion. Notably, eviCore provides evidence-based and integrated medical benefit management services (MBM) solutions that help reduce costs and provide quality care.Post acquisition, eviCore will operate as a standalone business unit under Express Scripts and enhance its capacity to provide better clinical outcomes and savings for health plans, purchasers and patients. Express Scripts' pharmacy benefit management coupled with eviCore's complementary MBM platform is likely to build a comprehensive patient benefit management (PBM) solution. This buyout will provide Express Scripts opportunities to cross-sell to both the client bases.Furthermore, this buyout widens Express Scripts' ability to drive value in the use of Specialty medications.

2590,ESRX,"The second-quarter reporting cycle is in full swing with multiple companies coming up with their quarterly financial numbers. The picture that has emerged so far is quite encouraging and the season remains on track to end on a strong note. A high proportion of companies have reported better-than-expected earnings per share in the current reporting cycle.Generally, an earnings beat leads to an appreciation in stock price. Given this highly bullish backdrop, investors would like to add outperformers to their respective portfolios for healthy returns.However, the task is far from easy with a plethora of companies present in the market. Moreover, the complexities associated with the stock market make it even more difficult for individual investors to select outperformers in the absence of proper guidance.Be Guided by Broker AdviceThe requisite guidance to design a winning portfolio comes from brokers. Brokers, not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents, but also attend company conference calls and other presentations.Since brokers arrive at their recommendation (buy, sell or hold) on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty-gritty associated with the company, it is natural for investors to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions while deciding their course of action on a particular stock. Estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock.  In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade.Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.Making the Most of Broker OpinionsWe have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions in earnings estimates over the last four weeks.

Furthermore, adjusted earnings jumped from $1.57 per share in the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $25.35 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.40 billion but were up roughly 0.5% on a year-over-year basis.Q2 HighlightsAdjusted gross profit in the second quarter was flat year over year at $2.16 billion. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $782.6 million, down 13.5% from the prior-year quarter. Total adjusted claims amounted to 350.0 million in the second quarter, flat year over year.The company’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) witnessed a 1% rise to $1,824.1 million in the second quarter. The upside was driven by operational cost improvement backed by focus on technology, digital tools, home delivery and specialty services.Balance SheetThe company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.35 billion compared with $3.08 billion at the end of 2016. Total debt, at the end of the quarter was $13.84 billion versus $14.85 billion at the end of 2016. In fact, the company is striving to reduce its debt levels. Express Scripts Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Express Scripts Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteGuidance Raised The company raised its guidance for 2017 adjusted earnings. For fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings per share are projected in the band of $6.95 to $7.05, up from the previously provided range of $6.90 to $7.04. This represents 10% increase at the mid-point of the range.Coming to the guidance for the third quarter of 2017, Express Scripts expects total adjusted claims in the range of $340 million to $350 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter are estimated in the range of $1.88 to $1.92, representing growth of 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis.  Furthermore, the company anticipates compounded annual EBITDA growth rate between 2% to 4% from 2017 through 2020 for the core PBM business. This excludes any contribution from Anthem and other transitioning clients.Express Scripts Likely to Lose AnthemExpress Scripts recently announced that its biggest customer, the leading health insurer Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. In 2016, Anthem sued Express Scripts for overcharging its drugs and operational failures. Per management, Anthem refused to participate in further discussions on pricing concessions and probable adjustments for the agreement. Meanwhile, in the second quarter of 2017, Anthem generated $52.6 million in revenues compared with $106.6 million in the second quarter of 2016.Our TakeWe are highly upbeat about the company’s core pharmacy-benefits management long-term outlook. This includes the ongoing volatile healthcare market trends, inflation, patent expiration, lower industry utilization growth and other headwinds.Furthermore, we expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation, continued rise in the price of specialty drugs and an overwhelming regulatory burden that is actually paving the way for manifold prospects for generics.Key PicksNotably, Express Scripts currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report). Notably, INSYS Therapeutics sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Align Technology carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.INSYS Therapeutics has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20%. The stock has gained around 15.9% in the last three months.Align Technology has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 24.1%. The stock has added roughly 35.7% in the last three months.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's second trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2592,ESRX,"Earnings reports for the second-quarter are pouring in. Results from 97 of the 500 S&P companies out already paint a strong earnings picture, which is likely to look rosier over the course of this reporting cycle.Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for the S&P 500 members constituting 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization — reported so far are up 8.4% year over year on a 5.1% rise in revenues. Going by the scorecard, 78.4% companies delivered an earnings beat, while 72.2% surpassed revenue estimates.Healthcare falls within the Medical ambit, which is one of the seven sectors in the S&P 500 group. As of Jul 19, 3.6% of the total Medical sector reported second-quarter results. The beat ratio is strong with 100% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations.The sector has been in the limelight since the change of power at the White House. President Donald Trump, who is eager to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Act more popularly known as Obamacare, has injected a fresh dose of uncertainty. The stocks continue to be in focus as the “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” scenario plays out. A lot has been happening in this part of the medical sector with efforts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” failing to meet with much success and basically collapsing.In the meantime, the healthcare corner continues to benefit from patients gained under Obamacare. Players in the industry are also actively engaged in mergers and acquisitions to achieve fast-paced growth. New product launch, improving service, expansion into ancillary businesses, and cost control measures will accrue to the top line.Nevertheless, high bad debt, increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions will put pressure on the bottom line.Let’s take a peek at these healthcare companies that are gearing up to report their second-quarter results on Jul 25.HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of -2.78% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.75 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80.

2593,ESRX,"Pharmacy benefit manager, Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, after market close. This St. Louis, MO-based company is the largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) in North America.Meanwhile, the company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by almost 0.8% in the last reported quarter. The stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters at an average of 0.3%.Express Scripts’ stock has underperformed the Zacks classified Medical Services industry in the last six months. Specifically, the stock lost 12.1% during this period compared to the industry's gain of 3.7%. Moreover, the current rate is way lower than the S&P 500's 8.8% over the same time frame. This indicates looming concerns ahead.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise  Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteLet’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the second-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlaySecond-Quarter Outlook: For the second quarter of 2017, Express Scripts expects total adjusted claims in the range of $343 million to $353 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter are estimated in the band of $1.70 to $1.74, representing growth of 8% to 11% on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, the company anticipates compounded annual EBITDA growth in the band of 2% to 4% from 2017 through 2020 for the core PBM business.Favorable Macroeconomic Scenario: We expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population in the U.S. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation. Thus, continued rise in the price of specialty drugs and increased regulatory burden has been driving demand for generics, a key catalyst for the company.Cutthroat Competition in Niche Space: On the flipside, Express Scripts faces intense competition in the PBM industry. The company faces competition from independent PBMs like MedImpact and Navitus Health Solutions. Moreover, the niche space is dominated by players like CVS, Aetna and Cigna, among others. We expect intensifying competition to mar second-quarter revenues.Estimate Revision Trend: Express Scripts’ estimate revision trend lacks luster at the moment. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. In fact, over the last three months, the current quarter estimates declined almost 1.2% to $1.71 per share.Probable Loss of Biggest Customer: Although it is too early to gauge the losses, Express Scripts is on the verge of losing its biggest customer – leading health insurer Anthem Inc. (ANTM). Following a series of legal conundrum, Anthem is no longer expected to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement withExpress Scripts, which is slated for expiration by 2019-end. Per management, Express Scripts might lose almost 50% of its revenues related to the Anthem contract by the second quarter itself.Earnings WhispersBuoyed by the above factors, our proven model does not conclusively show that Express Scripts is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Express Scripts is -0.59% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.70, while and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.71. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Express Scripts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

2594,ESRX,"Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) announced the launch of a 12-month pilot program in fall 2018, to simplify pharmacy experience for 80 million patients.This innovative cost-effective network is likely to improve patient outcomes and bolster the company’s existing relationship with pharmacies.Share Price PerformanceFollowing the announcement, shares of Express Scripts have jumped 2.3% to close at $71.61.Notably, in a year’s time, the shares have rallied 7.8% compared with the industry’s mere gain of 0.9%.The Pilot Program in DetailExpress Scripts is keeping no stone unturned to maintain its leading position in the global Pharmacy Benefit Management industry. The latest development promises to build a retail-pharmacy network in the United States.Per the postulates of the Pilot program, pharmacies that are willing to take part will be able to assess their own performance and identify possible loopholes through a web portal.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus  Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus | Express Scripts Holding Company QuotePer management, the Pilot program will enhance clinical experience and usable patient data. The program will also focus on augmenting medication therapy, reducing patient costs and refining medical adherence for better patient outcomes.Notably, the pilot program’s standard of measurements is recognized by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA). Per management, the company’s ability to work across the pharmacy value chain led to newer healthcare outcomes, generating $32 billion savings in 2017.Healthcare IT’s ProspectsPer a study by Markets and Markets, the global healthcare IT market is projected to reach $280.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 15.9%.Majority of the demand for healthcare IT solutions is driven by the growing need to reduce healthcare costs, while adhering to the regulatory requirements set by government organizations.In ConclusionPer estimates of the U.S. government, national health expenditure in 2016 hit $3.5 trillion, which works out to $10,345 per person. A surge of 5.8% in healthcare expenses is projected in the period between 2015 and 2025.Hence, it can be concluded that Express Scripts’ move has been timely and strategic.Zacks Rank & Key PicksExpress Scripts carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are BIOHAVEN PHARM (BHVN  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

2595,ESRX,"Merger and acquisition activities across the globe picked up rapidly in the first quarter thanks to U.S. tax reform and faster economic growth in Europe.Per the preliminary Thomson Reuters data, global mergers and acquisitions had their strongest start ever totaling $1.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2018. This is up 67% over the past year and marks the fourth quarter that has surpassed $1 trillion over the past three years. United States M&A volumes climbed 67% while Europe volumes doubled. Meanwhile, Asia saw an 11% increase. However, the number of deals dropped 10% year over year to 10,338.According to a report by research firm Mergermarket, M&A activity across the world has hit a 17-year-high record in the first quarter with 3,774 deals globally, totaling $890.7 billion. This was the strongest start to the year since 2001 and represents an 18% year-over-year increase in value.The healthcare space has so far been at the forefront as Amazon’s move into the pharmaceutical sphere has spurred the major pharmacy retailers to consolidate. With regard to this, U.S. health insurer Cigna (CI  -  Free Report) will acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year. In another deal, the drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) is also in a process of acquiring the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for $69 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).Another large agreement is German utility EON SE’s $38.5 billion deal to acquire RWE AG’s renewable energy business Innogy SE.The boom in M&A is likely to continue given an accelerating economy, still-low interest rates, and tax reform, which allows companies to bring offshore cash back home. Potential cost savings through mergers are further fueling the urge to merge in the current ultra-competitive environment.How to Tap?Investors could easily take advantage of this surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio. This strategy looks to tap the price differential (or spread) between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company. This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company. When the deal is completed, shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price (in some cases slightly below the deal price), giving investors a nice profit.Below, we have highlighted three merger ETFs to ride out the surge from the increasing M&A deals. Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low correlation strategy to their portfolio: IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time provides short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has 44 holdings in its basket with the largest allocation to Blue Buffalo Pet Products  and Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) on the long side. These two firms combined to make up for 17.5% share. The product has amassed $503.7 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 119,000 shares a day. It charges 77 bps in annual fees. The ETF has lost about 2.3% year to date (see: all the Hedge Funds ETFs here). ProShares Merger ETF (MRGR  -  Free Report) This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition of such target is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund holds a well-diversified portfolio of 33 stocks. Technology, industrials, healthcare and financials are the top three sectors. The ETF has been able to manage assets worth $4.4 million while it sees light volume of just 1,000 shares a day. Bottom Line While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock, the ETFs provide diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk. Further, these could be excellent choices for investors in the rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market (read: Trade Tensions or Not, Stay Safe with These ETFs). This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently, ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks. As a result, investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

2597,ESRX,"Hologic Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) has been on a healthy growth trajectory of late. The company’s progress in the domestic and international markets, a strong pipeline of products as well as huge future prospects of the GYN Surgical and Molecular Diagnostics segments make it an attractive pick at the moment. Therefore this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock boasts solid prospects to drive its shares higher in the near term.The stock has a market cap of $11.01 billion. The company’s expected growth rate for 2018 is 11.6%.The company has an average positive earnings surprise of 6.3% for the last four quarters. Also, it has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 9.8%.The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive. In the past couple of months, 12 analysts moved north with no southbound estimates witnessed. Earnings estimates have been raised around 6.1% to $2.25 per share over the same time frame.Let’s find out whether the recent favorable trend is a sustainable one.Hologic’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 performance was quite promising, primarily on the strength of Molecular Diagnostics. Headquartered in Bedford, MA, the company’s global growth was driven by an increasing market share and utilization of fully automated Panther system along with a continued solid uptake of Aptima women's health products. Notably, Aptima women’s health assays are dominant in the testing labs for detecting chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV (Human papillomavirus) and trichomonas.Hologic, Inc. Price Hologic, Inc. Price | Hologic, Inc. Quote However, performance within the GYN Surgical space was disappointing in the reported quarter, majorly due to external factors. Moreover, four extra selling days in the prior-year period left a significantly adverse effect on the year-over-year comparison.

2598,ESRX,"Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 52 cents from continuing operations. The figure is ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Adjusted earnings improved 23.8% year over year, primarily on strong sales growth at the company’s Biologics and Spine Fixation strategic business units (SBU).Excluding one-time items, net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter came in at 8 cents per share, showing a remarkable year-over-year improvement over the net loss from continuing operations of 29 cents.Sales DetailsOrthofix’s fourth-quarter sales improved 7.7% (6.1% at constant exchange rate or CER) to $116.9 million. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $112 million by 4.4%.Sales were primarily driven by a better-than-expected performance by the company’s all four SBUs with significant contributions from Biologics and Spine Fixation.SBU DetailsFor the fourth quarter, the company posted BioStim sales of $49.8 million, reflecting 4.1% (same at CER) growth from the prior-year period. Biologics SBU sales totaled $16.9 million, up 10.7% (same at CER) from the year-ago quarter. This upside resulted from strong sales of Trinity Elite allograft, banking on an expanded distributor network.Extremity Fixation sales were $29.1 million in the quarter under review, showing an 8.4% improvement (up 2.2% at CER) from fourth-quarter 2016. The company particularly realized strong revenue growth from the outside U.S. Extremity Fixation's stocking distribution.Orthofix International N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Orthofix International N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Orthofix International N.V. Quote Orthofix reported Spine Fixation SBU sales of $21.2 million, reflecting 13.5% (up 13.2% at CER) growth over the year-earlier quarter. This uptick can be attributed to new product launches and the adopted strategic initiatives.MarginsIn the fourth quarter, gross margin expanded 133 basis points (bps) to 79.8%. Solid top-line growth can be a major factor to have boosted the gross margin.Sales and marketing expenses rose 6.5% year over year to $51.9 million. General and Administrative expenses were down 7.5% to $19.5 million, led by lower legal settlement costs in the reported period as well as core expense reductions due to the U.S. and outside U.S. restructuring initiatives and lower professional fees. The company also witnessed a 12.6% rise in research and development expenses to $8.5 million. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin expanded 426 bps to 11.6% owing to increased operating expenses.Cash PositionOrthofix exited 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $81.2 million compared with $39.6 million at the end of 2016. Full-year net cash provided by operating activities was $53.3 million compared with $44.7 million a year ago. Excluding capital expenditure of $16.9 million, free cash flow was $36.4 million in 2017. This compares unfavorably with the free cash flow of $26.4 million in 2018 due to capex of $18.3 million.2018 GuidanceOrthofix has provided its 2018 guidance. Full-year 2018 sales are expected in the band of $450-$455 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenues is pegged at $453.9 million, higher than the guided range.Adjusted EPS from continuing operations are expected in the range of $1.76-$1.84. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $1.83, within but close to the upper end of the company’s projected range.Our TakeThe company exited the fourth quarter of 2017 on a solid note with both earnings and sales beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top line was substantially driven by strength in Biologics and Spine Fixation businesses, expected to continue on the back of an improved performance by sales partners, expanded distributorship network and introduction of products.The year 2017 has remained successful for Orthofix. This is because the company transformed its spine fixation SBU, delivering exceptional growth and sales momentum in addition to a robust stream of new products in the period. In 2018, the company has already launched 20 products and has even scheduled another 17 to be released ahead.A strong current-year guidance is indicative of its enhanced prospects.On the flip side, currency fluctuations, a competitive landscape and macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges to the company. Moreover, higher operating expenses are a matter of concern for Orthofix. Also, heavy dependence on a third party for final distribution of products exposes the company to increased risks. Zacks Rank & Key PicksOrthofix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2600,ESRX,"Following Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) announcement to buy the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co. (ESRX  -  Free Report), rating agencies A.M.Best and Moody’s has sprung into action.Under the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Express Scripts’ shareholders will own approximately 36% of the combined company.A.M. Best has placed under review with negative implications the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “a” of the key life/health subsidiaries, health maintenance organizations, New Zealand and European insurance companies of Cigna.The FSR of A- and Long-Term ICRs of “a-” of Cigna Supplemental Benefit Companies, as well as the Cigna HealthSpring companies have also received the same treatment.A.M. Best has placed under review with negative implications the Long-Term ICR of “bbb” and the Long- and Short-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR; Short-Term IR) of Cigna.The move sent the shares down, declining 1.75% to close at $164.39 in last trading session.Since the announcement of the deal, the stock has lost 13% against the industry’s growth of 2.1%.The rating agency's concerns stem from Cigna’s higher leverage ratio due to the use of $22.5 billion of new debt to finance the Express Scripts transaction. The funding will expectedly cause the leverage ratio to go up to 49%, while its goodwill plus intangibles to equity ratio will likely exceed 125%. Though the company’s capacity to service its debt, as measured by interest coverage ratio, will fall under 10x, the level is still considered as strong.The deal, being one of the biggest in Cigna’s history, might pose significant execution risks.  There is also a fear of customer losses from Express Scripts, which might dent the combined entity’s growth to some extent.Last week, another rating agency, Moody's Investors Service placed Cigna’s debt ratings on review for downgrade (senior at Baa1) as well as the A1 insurance financial strength ratings of some of its operating subsidiaries.Despite initial skepticism from the rating agencies, we believe that Cigna will be able to secure back its favorable rating after it utilizes the synergies from the acquisition to pay back debt.The transaction is expected to result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after its closure. As a result, Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from $18 to $20-$21 in 2021.Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks worth considering in the same space are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report). While Centene sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), UnitedHealth holds the same rank as Cigna.

2601,ESRX,"The U.S. investment market has scaled new highs on the latest Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad.In fact, the MedTech sector is looking forward to the latest decision of the Senate to postpone an industry-wide excise tax (Medical Device’ tax) by another two years. The bill will also delay the Cadillac tax (a 40% tax on employer insurance), until 2022. The Medical Device tax imposes 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, reducing the research and development (R&D) prospects.Not just abatement of the taxes, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst of the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.M&A in FocusWe believe the M&A strategies will reduce pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.

R. Bard, and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Actelion deserve a mention.Further, health insurers are trying to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain.

2602,ESRX,"Integrating medical care and pharmacy benefits under one roof, Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is getting acquired by Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report), a global health insurance company. The acquisition is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2018. Post the acquisition, the combined company will invest $200 million in its charitable foundation to support the communities in which it operates.Per the definitive agreement, Cigna will take over Express Scripts in a cash and stock transaction worth $67 billion. Notably, this includes Cigna's assumption of approximately $15 billion debt of Express Scripts. Express Scripts is the largest pharmacy benefits manager.Express Scripts sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Express Scripts’ stock has outperformed the industry in the past year. Specifically, the company’s shares have gained 19.7% compared with the industry's rally of 13.8%.Under the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Express Scripts’ shareholders will own approximately 36% of the combined company.The transaction will result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after closure.

The latest acquisition has been undertaken solely to enhance customer base and improve ‘Patient-Provider Alignment’.Express Scripts Holding Company Price  Express Scripts Holding Company Price | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteU.S. Healthcare Leads the M&A GameMergers and acquisitions (M&A) have been the key driver of the U.S. healthcare space, lately. Glancing through the major acquisitions of the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard, and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Actelion deserve a mention.In fact, health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain. Notably, the latest buyout of Express Scripts comes just three months after a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) agreed to take over the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna.Coming to the post-acquisition impacts, we believe that the latest development will pose a big threat to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), the largest U.S. health insurer, with its own pharmacy benefits unit, and CVS Health after it completes the merger with Aetna.The move is also expected to nullify threats from Amazon.com Inc., which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmacy business. Recently, the e-commerce giant announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to curb medical costs for their employees.What are the Moody’s Ratings for Express Scripts?Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody’s Corporation, placed the Baa2 senior unsecured long-term ratings to Express Scripts. Notably, obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate-credit risk. However, the latest rating has been kept under review with a tag of ‘direction uncertain’ by Moody’s.Moody’s has not rated Express Scripts with high-credit risk because of its solid position as a leading pharmacy benefit manager, moderate leverage and strong cash flow.However, Moody’s is worried about Express Scripts’ high customer concentration and pricing pressure. Further, the company’s ongoing dispute with Anthem, Inc — its largest customer — is a concern.Per Moody’s, Express Scripts experienced declining script volume and higher-than-typical customer losses. Other challenges include fewer generic drug introductions, softening mail order growth trends, client focus on cost savings and transparency.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2603,ESRX,"In an initiative to reduce excessive opioid prescribing, Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) announced a 90-day analysis of its Advanced Opioid Management program.The program was initiated last September to address the national opioid epidemic situation.Express Scripts Aims at Curbing Opioid EpidemicThe opioid epidemic or opioid crisis is the rapid increase in the use of prescription and non-prescription opioid drugs in the United States and Canada. Notably, opioids are a diverse class of strong painkillers, often detrimental to health. In fact, per a report by STAT, Opioids could kill more than half a million people across America by the next decade.Express Scripts’ Advanced Opioid Management Program aims at protecting people using an opioid medication (mainly patients taking an opioid for the first time). As part of the Advanced Opioid Management program, Express Scripts Therapeutic Resource Center pharmacists are also providing proactive counseling on safe opioid use in patient's own home.  Notably, in the first 90 days of the review, nearly 60% reduction was observed in the average days supply for patients receiving an opioid prescription for the first time (from 18.6 days supply per prescription claim before the launch of the program, to 7.5 days supply per claim after the start of the program).Per management, the company is proactively addressing the national opioid epidemic by reducing excessive and improper opioid prescribing as well as promoting greater compliance with CDC guidelines. In June 2017, Express Scripts announced a new Advanced Opioid Management solution addressing the nation's opioid-addiction epidemic by working comprehensively with patients, prescribers and pharmacies. The aim was to minimize early exposure while preventing progression to overuse and abuse.According to a report by Persistence Market Research, the global opioids market has been estimated to reach a worth of $42,158.8 million by 2021, at a CAGR of 3.2% during 2015-2021.Stock Performance & Estimate RevisionExpress Scripts’ stock has outperformed the broader industry in the last month. Specifically, the stock has gained 10.2% during this period compared to the industry's gain of 4.1%. Moreover, the current rate is way higher than the S&P 500's 3.4%.Also, the estimate revision trend for the current year remains favorable with nine estimates moving south over the last two months, compared with no movement in the opposite direction. The company’s current estimate moved up 0.3% to $7.03 over the past two months.Zacks Rank & Key PicksExpress Scripts carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Amedisys, Inc.

2604,ESRX,"The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. From being just third-party administrators of prescription drug programs, PBMs have come a long way. PBMs currently play a major role in managing pharmaceutical spending and enhancing health benefits for end-users.Notably, PBMs are mainly accountable for the development of formularies, discussing discounts with major drug manufacturers and pharmacy contracts. These firms also play an important role in the settlement of prescription drug claims.As per Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, PBMs have the potential to save as much as 30% in total drug spending relative to unmanaged purchasing (data published in ‘The Economic Benefits of Pharmacy Benefit Managers’ by Orszag and Green).Undoubtedly, the PBM market is expected to continue the solid trend. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019.Factors Driving PBMHistorically, there have been a number of factors supporting growth in the PBM market. Rising healthcare expenditures along with higher cost of drugs and other healthcare services have driven demand for PBMs who act as middlemen between the payer and other entities in the system.We are also encouraged by a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board on rising U.S. healthcare spending. Per the report, the U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of Gross Domestic Product (based on assumptions that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The PBM market largely benefits from an aging population which tends to depend on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans. Per a report by Technavio, nearly 14.4% of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above which buoys optimism.Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts a continuation of this trend. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Per a 2017 Economic Report on U.S. Pharmacies ad Pharmacy Benefit Managers, specialty drugs accounted for about one-third of the pharmacy industry’s revenues in 2016.Mergers & Acquisitions Change PBM LandscapeThe PBM market has always been dominated by a handful of large players. In 2007, CVS’ merger with Caremark Rx to form CVS Caremark, now CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), had a huge impact on the functions and scope of PBMs. Again, CVS Health announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report).People in support of the merger view it as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gain and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business. Notably, a horizontal integration increases the chances of monopolistic practices in the market.Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced its decision to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc.

2605,ESRX,"On Dec 11, we issued an updated research report on Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Cardinal Health follows an acquisition-driven strategy and focuses on investing in key businesses to gain traction and boost profits. In line with this, the company recently entered into an agreement to buy the radioactive diagnostic drug Lymphoseek from Navidea Biopharmaceuticals.We are also encouraged to note that Cardinal Health is pursuing growth via joint ventures and long-term supply agreements. The company entered a long-term agreement with Henry Schein, under which the latter purchased Cardinal Health’s medical supplies for physician practices. The collaboration is expected to drive Cardinal Health’s earnings over the long haul. Meanwhile, Cardinal Health's Pharmaceutical segment has been gaining on solid client retention, with the loss of only a few key customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report).Recently, Cordis, a Cardinal Health company, and Medinol announced the receipt of FDA approval of the EluNIR drug-eluting stent (DES) for treating narrowing of or blockage in coronary arteries. Cardinal Health also recently launched the Opioid Action Program.Cardinal Health’s share price movement over the last year has failed to impress. The stock has lost almost 18.3%, comparing unfavorably with the broader industry's gain of around 17.4%. Cardinal Health faces the risk of losing considerable business in case of loss of a major customer, which in turn will severely impair revenues.Also, Cardinal Health faces tough competition in each of its business segments. For instance, its pharmaceutical supply chain business faces competition from the likes of McKesson and AmerisourceBergen (ABC  -  Free Report) as well as several smaller medical-surgical distributors such as Henry Schein and Owens & Minor.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2606,ESRX,"Third-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Oct 18, 52 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers.Per the latest Earnings Trends, third-quarter 2017 results of the 52 S&P 500 members that have reported results, account for 16.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up 13.3% year over year on 6.9% rise in revenues, with 73.1% beating earnings per share estimates.As of Oct 18, 5.4% of the total Medical sector, one of the seven sectors in the S&P 500 group, reported third-quarter results. The beat ratio is strong with 66.7% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations.Sector TrendsThe sector has been in the limelight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Act, popularly known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.The U.S healthcare industry substantially benefits from the strong membership base supported by medicare expansion under Obamacare. Aggressive inorganic strategies have helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, improving service, expansion into ancillary businesses and expense management strategies are expected to add to the top line.However, medical stocks face threats like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions. These are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Stocks to CompareLet’s take a sneak peek into two Medical sector stocks that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Oct 24.We expect the third-quarter earnings for Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) to show a decline in revenues at the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segment, which is one of the major revenue components. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM revenues stands at $23.226 billion, reflecting a decline of 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM product network is pegged at $11,069 million, down 8.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM service revenues is $365 million, down 3.2% year over year. Lackluster performance in these segments is likely to mar Express Scripts’ revenues in the third quarter.Per the company’s guidance for the third quarter, its total adjusted claims are expected in the range of $340-$350 million. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total claims stands at $243 million, down 2.1% sequentially.Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter are estimated in the range of $1.88-$1.92, representing growth of 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis. This excludes any contribution from Anthem and other transitioning clients.Express Scripts announced that its biggest customer, leading health insurer Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. Per management, Express Scripts might lose almost 50% of its revenues related to the Anthem contract in the third quarter itself.Express Scripts has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, the Earnings ESP for Express Scripts is +0.13%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteWe expect Centene Corporation’s (CNC  -  Free Report) third-quarter earnings to be aided by solid Medicaid expansion.For the past few quarters, Centene has been witnessing consistent growth in its membership that has been driving the overall top line.  The company expects this uptrend to continue in the third quarter as well and impact revenues positively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is currently pegged at 12.1 billion, reflecting 6.1% year-over-year growth.The major contributor to this rising membership is Centene’s continuously growing Medicaid base. Medicaid expansion one of the provision of Affordable Care Act, has benefitted Centene. This was driven by Centene’s intention to continue on exchanges while other health insurers like Humana Inc (HUM  -  Free Report) and many more are exiting it.The third quarter is also likely to witness further expansion of its Medicaid business. In the third quarter, the company successfully reprocured a new statewide Medicaid contract in Georgia and Nevada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medicaid membership presently stands at 5.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.6%.Moreover, Centene has been taking several cost saving initiatives that are reducing the level of expenses. The margin is likely to be aided by lower expenses in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total general and administrative expenses ratio is currently pegged at 0.09 compared with 9.23 in the second quarter of 2017.Centene also has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to strengthen the possibility for a beat. Notably, the Earnings ESP for Centene is +2.45%.Centene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Centene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Centene Corporation QuoteWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2611,ESRX,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Express Scripts Holding has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Express Scripts Holding’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Express Scripts Holding has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 8.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Express Scripts Holding stock in the near term too.PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important, it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well. One can easily do that with the PEG ratio (ratio of the P/E to the expected future earnings growth rate).The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P/E ratio.Express Scripts Holding’s PEG ratio stands at just 0.7, compared with the industry’s average of 1. This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Express Scripts Holding currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Express Scripts Holding a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Express Scripts Holding is just 0.7, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.8. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, ESRX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Express Scripts Holding might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B. This gives ESRX a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen ten up and one down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged at $1.90 the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 0.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteDespite this somewhat upward trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineExpress Scripts Holding is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 40% out of more than 250 industries) further strengthens its growth potential.So, despite a Zacks Rank #3, we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pickWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

Further, adjusted earnings jumped from $1.74 per share in the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $24.68 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.61 billion and were also lower than $25.41 billion in the year-ago period.Q3 HighlightsAdjusted gross profit in the third quarter was flat year over year at $2.24 billion. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $759.3 million, down 13.5% from the prior-year quarter. Total adjusted claims amounted to 343.6 million in the third quarter, flat year over year.The St. Louis, MO-based pharmacy benefit manager's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) witnessed a 1% rise to $1,947.4 million in the third quarter. The upside was driven by operational cost improvement backed by focus on technology, digital tools, home delivery and specialty services.Express Scripts Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Express Scripts Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteBalance SheetThe company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3.40 billion compared with $3.08 billion at the end of 2016. Total debt, at the end of the quarter, was $13.73 billion versus $14.85 billion at the end of 2016.

This represents an increase of 10% over adjusted earnings per share results at the mid-point of the range in 2016.For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share are estimated in the range of $2.03 to $2.11, which represents growth of 8% to 12% over the fourth quarter of 2016. The company expects total adjusted claims for the fourth quarter in the range of 347 million to 363 million.Express Scripts Likely to Lose AnthemExpress Scripts recently announced that its biggest customer, the leading health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, slated for expiration by the end of 2019. In 2016, Anthem sued Express Scripts for overcharging its drugs and operational failures. Per management, Anthem refused to participate in further discussions on pricing concessions and probable adjustments for the agreement.Our TakeWe are highly upbeat about the company’s core pharmacy-benefits management long-term outlook. This includes the ongoing volatile healthcare market trends, inflation, patent expiration, lower industry utilization growth and other headwinds.Further, we expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation, continued rise in the price of specialty drugs and an overwhelming regulatory burden which is paving the way for manifold prospects for generics.Key PicksNotably, Express Scripts currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include EnteroMedics Inc  and Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2613,ESRX,"On Tuesday, shares of Express Scripts Holding Co. (ESRX  -  Free Report) are falling, down about 1.7% in late-morning trading after the company announced plans to purchase privately-held medical benefit management company eviCore Healthcare for $3.6 billion.Express Scripts, which is the largest stand-alone pharmacy-benefits manager, hopes the deal will help grow its adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first full year of operation. The company also explained how the deal is “an attractive entry point into a growing market.”EviCore works with health plans in order to decrease the number of medically unnecessary and expensive tests—think imaging scans— and manages medical benefits for 100 million people and has 4,000 employees.""The rising cost of healthcare is one of the most important issues facing Americans today,"" Tim Wentworth, CEO of Express Scripts said in a statement. ""Together with eviCore, Express Scripts will be an even more powerful partner in managing costs for patients and payers, bringing us closer to our goal of becoming the nation's leading patient benefit manager.""EviCore CEO John Arlotta thinks the two companies will be “uniquely positioned” to help improve healthcare issues. The company will operate as a standalone business unit within Express Scripts.The deal also comes at an interesting time in the healthcare and pharmacy space, as leaders like Express Scripts await a possible decision from e-commerce player Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), who may or may not move into pharmacy benefits (also read: Could Amazon Be the Next Big Pharmacy Giant?)Express Scripts is buying eviCore from current investors that include General Atlantic, TA Associates, and Ridgemont Equity Partners. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017, but must be approved by regulators.ESRX is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, and shares of the company have fallen over 14% so far in 2017.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2614,ESRX,"St. Louis, MO-based pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) recently announced results from a new diabetes study, Diabetes Dilemma: U.S. Trends in Diabetes Medication Use. Per the study, people following their oral diabetes medications experienced significantly fewer emergency room visits and inpatient hospitalizations. Further, the report revealed that they spent nearly $500 less on total healthcare costs compared to nonadherent patients.With strong criticism being voiced against high prices of specialty drugs, the focus is on better management of healthcare costs as consumers are becoming increasingly proactive about healthcare decisions. Through the study, Express Scripts emphasizes on the need for necessary patient spending for medications. This we feel would lead to experiencing an average increase in diabetes drug spend in 2017.In this regard, we remind investors that the company’s SafeGuard suite of pharmacy solutions was designed to better manage specialty spending, thereby establishing a higher standard for patient outcome. The portfolio also includes the Hepatitis Cure Value Program, the Cholesterol Care Value Program, the Oncology Care Value Program and the Express Scripts Inflation Protection Program.Over the past three months, the company has underperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained only 1.7%, compared with 2.9% rise of the industry it belongs to.Going forward, we are highly upbeat about the company’s core pharmacy-benefits management and long-term outlook. This includes the ongoing volatile healthcare market trends, inflation, patent expiration, lower industry utilization growth and other headwinds.Furthermore, we expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation, constant rise in the price of specialty drugs and an overwhelming regulatory burden that is actually paving the way for manifold prospects for generics.However, Express Scripts recently announced that its biggest customer, the leading health insurer, Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. In 2016, Anthem sued Express Scripts for overcharging its drugs and operational failures. Per management, Anthem refused to participate in further discussions on pricing concessions and probable adjustments for the agreement. Meanwhile, in the second quarter of 2017, Anthem generated revenues worth $52.6 million compared with $106.6 million in the second quarter of 2016.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNotably, Express Scripts currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
