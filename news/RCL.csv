3,RCL,"With a portfolio featuring leading stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as of Dec. 31, $1.9 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) is going strong after having outperformed both its Morningstar large-cap blend category and the S&P 500 in four of the six most recent full quarters.Its 0.79% gain so far this year going into Thursday — after the market's recent volatility — is also ahead of the big-cap bogey and its peer group.X The fund owes its portfolio firepower to a double-barreled management approach. The fund is run by two groups of managers, who work independently of each other. That doubles their opportunities to generate investment ideas. One group consists of subadvisors Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, who focus on value-oriented stocks for the fund. The second team works for USAA Asset Management, and they focus on growth stocks.""Using two managers with different approaches can potentially provide more consistent returns over the long term,"" said USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the teams running the two sleeves.Currently, Barrow Hanley runs about 40% of fund assets, with the balance run by the USAA team. Parent firm USAA maintains that ratio by allocating new inflows.Although the Barrow Hanley team's mandate is to focus on value stocks, their portfolio sleeve still includes leaders like E-Trade and UnitedHealth, which happen to have several traits of top-notch growth names, such as IBD Composite Ratings of 99 and 94 as well as SMR Ratings of A and B respectively.Amazon and Schwab are in the fund's growth sleeve. Amazon sports a red-hot 99% three-year annual earnings per share growth rate. Its three-year sales growth rate is 26%.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with news and analysis of Amazon at IBD's web page devoted to the e-commerce and cloud-computing colossus.Schwab's three-year annual EPS growth rate is 22%. Its EPS is expected to grow 45% this year.And if ups and downs in the stock market today presage additional volatility in the near term, the fund's blended approach should serve it well, says Mark Giambrone, head of the Barrow Hanley team. The value sleeve has ""traditionally outperformed (the overall market) during weaker periods in the market,"" Giambrone said.Still, Giambrone blames recent market volatility on program-trading by index funds. Fundamentals are still sound, in his view. ""We have a positive economic backdrop for corporate earnings and cash flows and consumer confidence and spending,"" he said.E-Trade shares are up 46% in the past 12 months. Giambrone's sleeve has owned E-Trade for several years. As a value investor, he seeks to buy stocks when temporary ills have dropped their share prices. He bought his current E-Trade stake when it was trading below book value due to investors' concerns about its portfolio of home-equity loans, he says.Those loan woes have been cleared up, he says. ""They're garnering market share,"" he said. ""They're benefiting from rising rates (which allows its net interest margin to expand on clients' cash in its custody). And we expect consolidation among online brokerage firms.""Dow Jones industrial giant UnitedHealth is the Giambrone sleeve's largest nonbank position. He sees the firm as a health care technology and services provider. Half of its earnings, he says, come from its Optum unit, which provides pharmacy benefits management and technology services and also runs clinics and doctors' offices.Optum's data cache enables UnitedHealth to lower its own costs and its charges to customers. ""Optum is an incredible growth engine and differentiator for UNH,"" Giambrone said. ""It helps current healthcare clients and non-healthcare clients lower cost trends through technological advances. It is a key driver of the investment thesis.""Overall, UnitedHealth has great cash flow and a reasonable valuation. ""It's mostly a U.S. business, so it's helped by recent tax law changes, which can help raise its earnings,"" Giambrone said.Giambrone also likes Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL). Shares in the multi-cruiseline operator are up about 35% in the past 12 months.Royal Caribbean should benefit from expansion of destinations and markets in China and Cuba, Giambrone says. At the same time, industrywide supply of ships shows only modest growth. Giambrone says earnings should grow for years.He added, ""The company has not benefited from tax reform. But once the market settles and focuses on long-term benefits (of tax reform) rather than short-term reform, the company will benefit meaningfully.""Giambrone says regional bank KeyCorp (KEY) benefits from healthy loan growth. ""Credit (risk) is fairly stable, and tax reform will have a big positive impact on the bank,"" he added. KeyCorp's 2016 acquisition of First Niagara should provide economies of scale, he says.He added, ""We think the regulatory environment should get better for banks. The 'SIFIs' threshold may rise to $250 billion, which would make it easier for them to expand.""SIFIs threshold refers to the asset level at which banks are deemed systemically important financial institutions, triggering much stricter oversight, including higher capital buffers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

That's a decent gain, but a little shy of the 25% increase one would expect from a CAN SLIM market leader. Plus, it would mark a considerable slowdown from EPS gains of 26%, 33% and 41% in the prior three quarters.Target (TGT) (18 Relative Price Strength) is trying to bottom out after falling as much as 17.6% in the past three months. Check out the week ended July 28, when the giant discount chain fell hard during the week but ended it with a solid 1% gain in sharply higher gain. Such reversals at the bottom of a stock's decline are bullish.But Target, which still depends a lot on consumers to visit their stores to keep sales flowing, needs to rise back above the 40-week moving average (roughly equivalent to a 200-day moving average on a daily chart) to show that institutional investors are seriously accumulating shares. For now, Target is just 11% below the 52-week high.Target is forecast to grow FY 2018 earnings by 11% to $3.92 a share. But the 1.8% annualized dividend yield is inferior to the S&P 500 (around 1.9%).Home Depot (HD), the biggest gainer in the 30-stock Dow, rose more than 1.3% to 149.62 and is currently forming a new base. It recently posted a 14% EPS increase for the second quarter, marking a 14th quarter in a row of double-digit earnings-per-share growth.The IBD Big Cap 20 doesn't currently hold any traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. However, consumer-oriented firms help pack the list, including Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL), energy drink marketer Monster Beverage (MNST) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL).Michael Kors (KORS) and Five Below (FIVE) are trying to buck the general sell-off in the apparel and discount retail sectors, respectively.Michael Kors, famous for its jet set-styled handbags and clothing, may be working on a new bottoming-base pattern, which would be first stage. The stock had collapsed more than 60% from a February 2014 peak near 101. But shares are now up more than 15% in August so far and are on track for a third monthly advance. Quiet action from here would possibly yield a new buy point near recent upside resistance, at 46.Kors' Q2 profit dropped 11% to 80 cents a share, but that was a far smaller decline than viewed. Sales fell 4% to $952.4 million, marking a fourth quarter in a row of shrinking sales.Five Below, which sells toys, accessories and clothing for $5 each or less, rallied more than 3% to 48.58. A cup-with-handle base is forming. For now, the Philadelphia-based retailer shows a legitimate entry of 51.62, 10 cents above the two-week handle's high. The base barely passes the midpoint test (handle's midpoint is 49.29, base midpoint 49.21).Five Below holds a decent Composite Rating of 87 on a scale of 1 to 99 from Stock Checkup, second only to group peer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI). Five Below shows an excellent A grade for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) but the 54 RS Rating needs more work.RELATED:Here Is The Easy And Fast Way To Spot Major Market Tops Before Stocks CrashIBD Sector Leaders: Why YY Is Leading The Market, Fundamentals And Technicals-WiseStocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Best Large Cap Growth Firms Today: Inside Big Cap 20

22,RCL,"XWith Q2 earnings season kicking off and big banks like Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) nearing buy points as they get set to report in the next couple of weeks, here's a list of stocks to watch, including Nvidia (NVDA), Floor & Decor (FND) and Alibaba (BABA)-supported Chinese internet play Baozun (BZUN), that are expected to deliver 50% or higher EPS growth.To make the list, each stock must also trade over 200,000 shares per day and meet these benchmarks for their IBD SmartSelect Ratings, which measure the most important stock-picking criteria:
"
23,RCL,"• 90 or better Composite Rating.
"
24,RCL,"• 80 or higher Relative Strength Rating.
"
25,RCL,"• 80 or greater EPS Rating.
"
26,RCL,"• B or better Accumulation/Distribution Rating.In recent quarters, Facebook (FB), Tesla (TSLA) and Alibaba have made this list, but did not make the cut this round. Analysts expect Facebook to post earnings growth of 42%, and see Alibaba generating a 26% gain. Wall Street sees flat growth for Tesla in Q2 and Goldman Sachs (GS) said the electric car pioneer's stock is extremely overpriced.But new names on the list include a leader in self-driving-car technology, Nvidia; a South Korean maker of LCD panels, LG Display (LPL); and 2017 IPO Floor & Decor.LG Display tops the list with analysts expecting explosive earnings growth of 944%. The stock had already been rising in recent weeks when it jumped even higher on news that Apple (AAPL) is in talks with LG Display to invest in the display-maker's new OLED screen factory. The stock pulled back on Friday to close down nearly 2% for the week.After a solid run from its April 27 initial public offering, Floor & Decor has been pulling back recently, but managed to close the week in positive territory. Given its fundamentals, including 96% average earnings growth over the last three quarters and 35% three-year annual sales growth, it's one to keep an eye on. For Q2, analysts expect a 260% rise in earnings-per-share.Alibaba has invested in fellow Chinese e-commerce stock Baozun, which analysts expect to deliver 400% earnings growth in its next report. The stock is already extended from an earlier breakout and was up over 13% this week. See if it goes on to offer another buying opportunity.Nvidia, which is also extended beyond a proper buy zone, is expected to deliver 68% EPS growth. While self-driving car technology leader pulled back recently, it's managed to stay above its 10-week line and closed over 1% higher for the week.Heavy construction firm MasTec (MTZ) is also noteworthy. On Thursday, it briefly poked its head above a 46.15 buy point, but then pulled back as the indexes also encountered selling pressure. On Friday, the stock rose over 1% to close at 45.90. The Florida-based company is expected to report in early August, with analysts looking for earnings growth of 81%.The trick to making money during earnings season is to be prepared with an up-to-date watchlist and action plan. When a company delivers an earnings surprise and breaks out, you want to be there, ready to pounce.But keep in mind that disappointing numbers can trigger a sudden and sharp decline, which makes it risky to buy stocks just before they report.So use screens like the one below as idea generators that identify stocks to watch as we head into the Q2 earnings season.Also be sure to run all your stocks through a buying checklist before you invest, use sound buy and sell rules and check overall market conditions.Stocks Nears A Buy Point And Expecting 50% Or Higher Q2 Earnings Growth

28,RCL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and other carriers as well as hotels, cruise operators, booking sites and even tech giants like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were hit after the Supreme Court allowed a limited version of President Trump's travel ban to take effect.The top court will review the ban when it reconvenes in October. Meanwhile, justices said the ban wouldn't affect citizens from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ""who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,"" such as family members or students enrolled in American schools.The last time the ban was enforced, it made significant impacts on international air bookings, even though it was in effect for only a few days.Between Jan. 28, when Trump signed the ban, and Feb. 4, when Homeland Security suspended the ban, international bookings to the U.S. fell 6.5%, according to travel analysis firm ForwardKeys. Bookings rose in the middle of February, but the effect of the ban still lingered as overall February forward bookings for international arrivals were 0.4% slower vs. a year ago.Also during that period, some employees of tech firms were temporarily prevented from entering the U.S. and others were left wondering about their status, prompting companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft to denounce the order or express concern and support for their employees.Delta shares were down 0.1% in the stock market today.

"
45,RCL,"In an era when more than 80% of the active managers fail to beat their benchmark index, finding a mutual fund that consistently achieves the elusive element of alpha is akin to finding the Holy Grail.USAA Growth Fund (USAAX) is one of those funds. This portfolio of large-cap growth stocks has beaten its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. year to date, as well as in the past one, three, five and 10 years. And it has beaten the S&P 500 stock index in the past one, three, five and 10 years. In 2015, it returned 5.63% vs. the S&P's 1.38%.Lately much of its outperformance has been driven by such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alibaba (BABA).The portfolio managers are Michael Schroer of Renaissance Investment Management and Aziz Hamzaogullari of Loomis Sayles. They each separately manage half the portfolio. Schroer has been with the fund since 1991 and Hamzaogullari since 2010.The fund's strategy is to look for high-quality companies that can generate sustainable and profitable growth. When the managers see stocks selling at a significant discount to their estimate of intrinsic value, they snap them up. This leads to a small portfolio of just 92 companies. The fund also has a very long-term investment horizon, seen in its 31% portfolio turnover rate.Still, even a fund that consistently outperforms has moments when it doesn't. So far this year, it's underperforming the S&P 500 5.90% to 6.61%.""We favor companies that are high quality growth selling at a reasonable valuation,"" said Schroer. ""In the first half of the year lower P/E growth didn't do well. Higher P/E companies led the market, but by the later part of the year that reversed and lower P/E companies are doing better and we've benefited from that. We're in the sweet spot for the market where lower P/E, higher quality are doing better.""Another part of the strategy, this one favored by the Loomis Sayles team, is described as high ""active share."" Active share is a way of measuring how much a portfolio differs from its benchmark index. ""Our active share has been at or above 80%,"" Hamzaogullari told IBD late last year. ""While it does not ensure outperformance, we believe it is a necessary condition for generating alpha and outperforming the benchmark, net of fees, over the long term.""U.S. stocks make up 90% of the fund, with the rest in foreign equities. Technology makes up 27% of the portfolio.Amazon as of July 31 stood as USAA Growth's largest holding, at about 4% of assets. The stock made up the entire retail-internet segment of the fund. Amazon is up 21% this year, sitting just above support at its 50-day moving average after pulling back 3% from its all time high set Oct. 6. Analysts expect Amazon to post Q3 earnings 371% higher than a year earlier when it reports results Thursday.Facebook is the No. 2 holding also at about 4% of assets. The social networking and media leader is up 24% year to date near the 28.43 buy point of a flat base. Fiscal Q1 earnings are expected to rise 70% from a year earlier when results are reported, expected Nov. 2 after the market's close.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giants and another top fund holding, is up 28% so far this year. The stock has found support at its 50-day moving average, 6% below its 52-week high. The company is expect to show a fiscal Q2 earnings increase of 23% when it reports Tuesday.Not all USAA Growth top holdings have been barn burners. Database bellwether Oracle (ORCL) is up 5% this year. It's been in the fund since 2007.The rest of the top 10 holdings and their percentages are: Cisco Systems (CSCO), 3.24%; Visa (V), 3.11%; Qualcomm (QCOM), 2.89%; Monster Beverage (MNST), 2.52%; Alphabet (GOOGL), 2.48%; United Parcel Services (UPS), 2.37%.""We think technology and consumer discretionary look attractive,"" said Schroer. ""Health care still looks attractive. Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) still look very cheap. In this market there are still high quality companies.""Schroer likes Foot Locker (FL). The athletic shoe retailer posted very good second-quarter sales and still trades at a ""very reasonable multiple of 14."" The stock is up only 4.4% this year.""Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) and both are doing well over the last several months,"" said Schroer. ""They had sold off on fears of the Zika virus hurting tourism, but they didn't suffer too much. Now bookings for next year are running high and multiples are very attractive, Royal's trailing P-E is 13 and Carnival's is 14.""We've taken some things off the table, but we still think there are selective opportunities in this market,"" he said. ""We've gone through six quarters of negative earnings growth and we're watching this quarter carefully for signs of a rebound. So far, so good.""RELATED:Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On Facebook And Other Stock LeadersChinese, Other Foreign Stocks Drove Top Q3 Fund PerformersAlibaba Sets Stage For Big Online Shopping Spree

47,RCL,"Carnival Corp. (CCL) on Monday reported fiscal third-quarter profit of $1.42 billion.On a per-share basis, the Miami-based company said it had profit of $1.93.

The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.89 per share.The cruise operator posted revenue of $5.1 billion in the period, which also beat Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $5.04 billion.For the current quarter ending in November, Carnival expects its per-share earnings to range from 55-59 cents. The company expects full-year earnings in the range of $3.33-$3.37 per share.Analysts expect EPS of 58 cents in fiscal Q4, above the midpoint of Carnival's view, and $3.34 for the full year.Carnival shares reversed 1.7% lower but ended at 46.47, just above their 50-day average, after earlier climbing enough to retake their 200-day line. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) fell 1.9% and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) lost 0.75%.IBD'S TAKE: Higher fuel costs, fare cuts and travelers' uncertainty over their finances, health and safety could pose considerable headwinds to travel-related stocks. See how other travel names are doing at IBD's Stock Checkup.

"
58,RCL,"Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) on Tuesday slashed its earnings forecast for this year and said it would miss its profit target for next year, partly due to ""continued weak demand"" for European travel among core North American consumers and Brexit's impact on the pound.Shares plunged 11.8% to close at 37.91 in the stock market today, a day after the stock had begun to find support at its key 50-day line. Rival cruise line Royal Caribbean (RCL) sank 6.8%, and Carnival (CCL) was underwater by 3%.Norwegian's announcement comes amid more intense global anxiety, with some U.S. consumers thinking twice about traveling following ISIS-inspired violence worldwide over the past year, as well as heightened economic uncertainty and an often unpredictable, vitriolic election season.The cruise service cut its 2016 earnings-per-share outlook to $3.35-$3.45 from an earlier projection of $3.65-$3.85. The new forecast was below analyst expectations for $3.72.The company also cut its full-year forecast for adjusted net yield -- an important metric that gauges sales compared to available ships and space on them -- to around 1% growth. In May, the company had forecast an increase of around 3.5%.""Overall, while investors have been bracing for an ugly guide, this was probably short of even lowered expectations, particularly on the yield front,"" Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said in a research note.IBD'S TAKE: Higher fuel costs, fare cuts and travelers' uncertainty over their finances, health and safety could pose considerable headwinds to travel-related stocks. See how other travel names are doing at IBD's Stock Checkup. The company's third-quarter earnings guidance of $1.57-$1.62 a share was also well below views for $1.78.The second quarter, however, wasn't as bad, despite weak travel demand.Earnings per share during the second quarter rose 13% to 85 cents, topping estimates by a penny. Revenue increased 9.3% to $1.186 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts for $1.218 billion.Norwegian said it has tried to keep fare discounting at a minimum, something with which the airline industry has also grappled.""While successive geopolitical events dampened North American consumer demand primarily for our Mediterranean itineraries, our management team worked diligently to identify cost saving opportunities to partially mitigate these impacts and generate solid adjusted (earnings-per-share) growth of 13%,"" Chief Executive Frank Del Rio said in a prepared statement.
"
59,RCL,"The consumer stock sell-off intensified and broadened Tuesday, as bad news from General Motors (GM) added to concerns from McDonald's (MCD), Ford Motor (F) and others.The consumer slide fueled a general market retreat. But it's also a warning for the broader U.S. economy.Recent economic data on consumers have been positive. Consumer spending rose at a robust 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, with a Tuesday report showing a 0.4% monthly gain in June. But consumers were a rare bright spot, with business investment falling for a third straight quarter and homebuilding spending also falling. If consumer spending falters, the economy may struggle to match its anemic second-quarter growth of 1.2%.General Motors and Ford reported July U.S. sales that fell vs. a year earlier. Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCAU) eked out a gain, but less than expected. Ford had reported weak earnings last week amid rising incentives spending and stalling U.S. demand. It sees U.S. industry sales falling in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains.General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler shares fell 4.4%, 4.3% and 4%, respectively, on the stock market today.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which has been a top-rated restaurant stock, fell 12.4% Tuesday. The steakhouse chain missed on second-quarter revenue and said same-store sales growth was slowing in the early weeks of the current third quarter. Dave & Buster's (PLAY) dived 5.6%, taking a round trip on its breakout.Those follow weaker demand at McDonald's, which had been a great turnaround story in recent months. But last week McDonald's said U.S. comps in the second quarter fell short of Wall Street forecasts, and cited ""softening industry growth."" Starbucks (SBUX) also reported weak U.S. comps.More generally, analysts have been issuing warnings about the retail sector.McDonald's fell 0.3% Tuesday and Starbucks 1.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Texas Roadhouse and Dave & Buster's have been among the best-rated restaurant stocks in recent weeks. For a complete look at these stocks and other consumer giants, take a look at IBD Stock Checkup.Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) cut its 2016 outlook Tuesday, citing higher fuel costs and the weak British pound following the Brexit vote. Royal Caribbean stock sank 6.3% Tuesday. Carnival (CCL) lost 3.1%.Airlines sold off Tuesday as Delta Air Lines (DAL) said unit revenue fell sharply in July. Also hitting the sector: A Zika virus warning for a Miami neighborhood and  German carrier Lufthansa saying that terror attacks and global unease have had a ""tangible"" impact on demand. Delta Air stock fell more than 7% intraday, while American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell 6%.Department stores were among the biggest losers, with Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) down 8% and Nordstrom (JWN) tumbling 7%.Kroger got a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform, citing the deflationary environment for groceries. Shares are off 4.1%, on track for their lowest close since early January 2015. That follows weak same-store sales from natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM).One relative bright spot for consumer stocks has been consumer products producers such as Procter & Gamble (PG). P&G edged past profit views Tuesday, rising 0.4% to 86.78 for a 52-week high. But Procter & Gamble and other consumer- and food-product giants have been relying on cost cuts to offset declining revenue.
"
60,RCL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), Carnival (CCL), Expedia (EXPE) and other travel-related stocks plunged early Friday after a suspected terror attack left more than 80 people dead in southern France, but many pared losses.Delta shares fell 2.4% to 39.98 in the stock market today. The airline has the most exposure to France of any U.S. airline. American Airlines (AAL) stock erased losses and turned up 1 cent. United Continental (UAL) was off just 0.9%. All three carriers are up sharply for the week.Hilton Worldwide (HLT) shares rose 0.3%. Marriott (MAR) dipped 0.35% and Hyatt Hotels (H) turned up 0.3%.Travel booking site Expedia shares edged down 0.4%. Priceline (PCLN) shares fell 1.2%.Among cruise lines, Carnival fell 2.2%, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) 3.7% and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Most industry groups in the travel and leisure sector are well off highs, but have mounted a rebound of late. Airlines are back up to early June levels after dipping for much of the last month. Hotels recovered to March levels after a four-month drought. The travel booking sector that includes Priceline and Expedia is back up after a brief, Brexit-inspired sell-off. And cruise lines recently broke out to reach prices not seen since December.The attack in Nice happened late Thursday night as revelers were at a parade celebrating France's Bastille Day. A truck, reportedly filled with weapons and explosives, slammed into the crowd killing at least 84 people and wounding 100 others.The suspected terror attack comes eight months after gunmen opened fire at a Paris nightclub and cafes frequented by tourists.But, like prior attacks, the incident in Nice is unlikely to have long term effects on travel.In an prior interview with IBD, Jack Plunkett, CEO of global market research firm Plunkett Research, said that airlines were busy again within a few weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks and the same was true after the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, and the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005.

61,RCL,"Stocks opened modestly higher Friday as earnings reports and positive economic data from China bolstered investor sentiment.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose less than 0.2%. The Nasdaq was up 0.1%.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each go into Friday's session up 1.6% for the week. The Nasdaq is bucking to end its first week above the 5000 mark since December, and the S&P 500 is lined up for a record high weekly close. The Dow is tracking toward a third straight weekly gain, up nearly 2% for the week through Thursday and also taking out new highs.Small caps have been even more lively, with the Russell 2000 ahead 2.1% through Thursday, though still below its June 2015 peak. The S&P Smallcap 600 heads into today's stock market up 2.4% this week, and just a heartbeat below its June 2015 record.Big banks continued to roll out quarterly results.Citigroup (C) rose 0.2% and Wells Fargo (WFC) slipped 2%, while PNC Financial (PNC)  and U.S. Bancorp (USB) added 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively, after reporting results.India's Infosys (INFY) tumbled 9% after reporting lower-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue., and slashing its full-year sales guidance.Herbalife (HLF) spiked 18% on news that the Federal Trade Commission determined the network marketer was not a pyramid scheme.Rite Aid (RAD) popped 4%, as news reports said the company and Walgreens (WBA) had entered new discussions with the Federal Trade Commission to rescue what is seen as an endangered $17 billion merger. Walgreens shares slipped 0.1%.A wide segment of travel-related stocks were feeling some premarket pressure, possibly from investors reacting to the attack on a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, France. Delta Air Lines (DAL), Expedia (EXPE), Priceline.com (PCLN) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) slipped 1% to 3% at the open.Retail sales rose 0.6% for June, the Commerce Department estimated. That was a nice jump up from May's 0.2% increase, and far above estimates for a 0.1% advance. Minus autos and gas, sales rose 0.7%, vs. 0.3% in May, and better than double consensus views for a 0.3% improvement.June consumer prices were steady. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index ticked up 0.2%, equal to May's gain and a shade below projections for a 0.3% rise. Core prices -- stripping out food and energy -- were the same, up 0.2%, and in line with expectations.New York region manufacturing flattened in July, the New York Federal Reserve reported, with its Empire State Manufacturing Survey showing reading 0.55 for the month. That was sharply below June 6.01 tally, disappointing consensus forecasts for 5.00. New orders and shipment fell to scant gains, and employment and hours worked dipped slightly for the month.June factory capacity and utilization numbers are due out from the Federal Reserve at 9:15 a.m. ET. The University of Michigan delivers its preliminary July consumer sentiment estimate, and the Commerce Department releases May business inventories data, both at 10 a.m. ET.Oil prices could see some effect from Baker Hughes (BHI) weekly rig count, expected at 1 p.m. ET.Oil prices rose nearly 0.6%, putting West Texas Intermediate just below $46 a barrel. Gold slipped a fraction to $1,330 an ounce. The dollar strengthened and the 10-year yield rose 3 basis points to 1.57%.Strong second-quarter GDP growth data out of China helped Asia's markets end a very strong week on a positive note. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.5% Friday to take a 5.3% advance for the week. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 added 0.7% Friday, ending up 9.2% in its best week since December 2009.Europe's markets showed mild losses in afternoon trade. The CAC 40 in Paris and Frankfurt's DAX were tracking toward weekly gains just below 4%. London's FTSE was on to track to end the week up less than 1%.

69,RCL,"Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings early Tuesday and kept up its streak of at least double-digit profit growth, but it ran into rough seas with revenue falling short of forecasts, sending its shares down in morning trades.Adjusted earnings per share rose 23% to $1.35 a share, inching past the $1.34 prediction from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. It was the highly rated cruise ship operator's 11th straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth or better.Revenue rose 41.7% to $1.285 billion, but that was slightly short of views, which were at $1.287 billion. The miss sent Norwegian's shares sliding. Its shares closed down 5% to 60.55 on the stock market today.Adjusted net yield, which essentially measures revenue per available berth, rose 19.8% — 22.7% excluding foreign-exchange impact — mainly due to the 2014 acquisition of Prestige Cruises International. Norwegian acquired Prestige, parent of upscale Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands, last November.When comparing current results against the combined results of Norwegian and Prestige from a year ago, adjusted net yield increased 2.2%, or 4.7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The increase reflects improved pricing in the quarter which was driven by strength in the Caribbean, Bermuda and Alaska itineraries, and partially offset by some softness in Eastern Mediterranean business, the company said in a press release.The company narrowed its guidance range for full-year 2015 adjusted earnings per share to $2.85 to $2.90 from $2.80 to $2.90. Analysts were expecting 2015 earnings of $2.89 a share prior to the report.Norwegian, part of Investor Business Daily's leisure-services industry group, boasts a 98 Composite Rating out of a possible 99. Rival Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL)has an 88 IBD Composite Rating. Its shares closed down 1.7% to 96.66.In October, Norwegian officially opened its previously announced sales and marketing office in Sydney, Australia, its first in the Pacific region. This office represents the company's three brands and includes a dedicated Sydney-based call center for travel partners and guests in Australia and New Zealand.On Oct. 12, Norwegian announced plans to introduce the first ship customized for the China market in 2017. Currently under construction, this new ship will be the second of its Breakaway Plus Class series.The delivery of the ship Norwegian Escape in October marks the latest chapter in the company's measured ""new-build program"" which provides ship deliveries each year through 2019. It will take delivery of two additional ships in 2016.""With a clear path to significant earnings growth, we are confident in our targets of $5 earnings per share in 2017 and growing our already industry-leading return on invested capital to 14% by 2018,"" Chief Executive Frank Del Rio said in a prepared statement.Follow Marilyn Much on Twitter @IBD_MMuch.

Revenue rose 5.6% to $1.918 billion, roughly in line with views of $1.916 billion, and net yields rose 7% on a constant currency basis.Full-year EPS guidance was raised by 25 cents to a range of $6.15 to $6.35, driven by a more favorable currency environment and strength in North American products and onboard revenue. Analysts expect EPS of $6.09.Shares closed up 1.8% on the stock market today, after rising as much as 4.5% early then turning negative midday.Meanwhile, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) is scheduled to report Q1 earnings on May 10.

73,RCL,"Most U.S. stocks retreated as investors dived into haven assets including gold and the dollar after deadly terrorist attacks in Brussels killed at least 31 people. The Nasdaq composite index edged higher as drugmakers climbed.While transport-related shares led the Standard & Poor’s 500 index lower, the benchmark’s losses were eased somewhat by advances in health-care and technology companies. The pound slid amid speculation that the explosions at a Brussels airport departure hall and a downtown subway station may boost the case for Britain to leave the European Union. Gold advanced for the first time in four days and yields on 10-year German bunds touched their lowest level in almost two weeks. Treasuries fell as Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago chief Charles Evans called U.S. economic fundamentals “really quite good.”The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to 2,049.80, with the gauge still trading near its highest level of the year. Transportation stocks posted the biggest decline out of 24 groups, with Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Carnival (CUK) losing at least 2.1%. Biotechnology and technology hardware companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Amgen (AMGN) and Abbvie (ABBV), contributed the most to gains in the benchmark measure Tuesday.The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.3% in its fifth straight gain to cap its longest advance in 11 months.Activity was light again in this holiday-shortened week after Monday marked the lowest U.S. volumes this year. Trading on U.S. exchange listed shares was 26% below the three-month average. That follows two of 2016’s slowest sessions -- last Monday and Tuesday before the Fed’s March meeting. U.S. stock markets will be closed for a holiday Friday.The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the greenback against 10 major peers, added 0.1% in a third day of gains. The gauge slid 1.3% last week after the Fed dialed back its outlook for interest-rate increases this year. The presidents of the San Francisco and Atlanta Feds said Monday that tighter borrowing conditions could be warranted as soon as April,  given improvements in the U.S. economy.Benchmark German bunds rose, while Belgian bonds were little changed. Ten-year German yields fell as much as five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 0.18%, while the rate on Belgian debt due in a decade dropped two basis points to 0.6%.Yields on similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries added three basis points to 1.94%, after falling to as low as 1.88%.

74,RCL,"Cruise ship operator stocks gapped higher Wednesday after Carnival (CCL) reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings that nearly doubled as fuel prices remained low and pricing held steady.""All three (major) cruise operators have been doing pretty well,"" said Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz. ""(There's been a) pretty consistent voice across the industry: Nobody wants to bow to discounting right now. All three want to hold firm on pricing.""Carnival shares rose 5.5% to 52.37 on the stock market today, moving past a 50.01 buy point from a cup-with-handle base to a nine-month high. The stock also notched up above its 200-day moving average.Norwegian Cruise Line Holding (NCLH) jumped 5.7% and remains deep inside an area of consolidation that began in October. Royal Caribbean (RCL) leapt 5.65%, giving shares a more definitive boost above the stock's 50-day line. Royal Caribbean plunged over 15% in early February after offering disappointing guidance.Carnival's Q1 per-share profit jumped 95% to 39 cents a share, topping expectations by 7 cents. Revenue grew over 3% to $3.65 billion, slightly above forecasts for $3.63 billion, marking the second straight quarter of earnings and sales acceleration for the cruise ship operator.Gross cruise costs, including fuel, fell 6% during the quarter on changes in fuel costs and currency exchange rates.Carnival said advance bookings for the rest of 2016 are “well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices,"" and that since January, booking volumes for the year are ""running ahead of last year's historically high levels at higher prices.""""The risk of having really aggressive discounting come into the picture for them for that big quarter would be much lower than prior to today,"" said Katz, referring to the Q3 peak season, which ends in August. ""We feel like there are a lot of opportunities for the business to grow.""Carnival raised the bottom end of its full-year EPS guidance to $3.20-$3.40, up from a prior outlook for $3.10-$3.40. But the midpoint of the newly updated range still comes in below current expectations for $3.37 a share for the year.It sees Q2 EPS of 34-38 cents vs. views for 38 cents.Certain trends, such as a shift to millennials -- a group that greatly values experiences -- ""bodes very well for travel and leisure companies,"" said Katz, who also highlighted the retiring baby boomer set and an emerging market in China.On March 21, Carnival announced that it had gotten the green light from Cuba to start sailing there, beginning May 1, through its ""impact travel"" brand Fathom. Launched last year, Fathom is part of the new wave of ""voluntourism,"" which allows travelers to sight-see and volunteer at the same time. Its seven-day journeys to Cuba will include a cultural exchange program.Norwegian and Royal Caribbean are said to be expecting to receive approvals in the near future as well.""So far in calendar 2016, pricing trends appear to have remained relatively steady, despite Zika virus headlines and terrorist events in Turkey and Belgium, although the latter may be so recent as to have not yet had any impact on pricing,"" William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia wrote about Carnival on March 23.

The Islamic State took responsibility for the attacks, which seriously wounded at least three Americans.United said that its flight from Washington Dulles to Brussels deplaned normally at the gate and a second flight from Newark Liberty was rerouted to another location. All remaining flights were canceled.United shares closed down 1.1% in the stock market today, paring back steeper, early losses. American shares fell 1.6%. Travel booking site Priceline lost 2.3%. Cruise lines Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) all sold off 2% or more.Ryanair (RYAAY) canceled all flights to Zaventem, but flights were still operating to Charleroi Airport near Brussels with delays, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) diverted a flight to Amsterdam.U.S.-listed shares of Ryanair shares fell 1%. Delta shares dropped 1.5%.Savanthi Syth, a vice president of equity research at Raymond James, said in a note that it was too early to tell the impact the attacks will have on air travel but that the attacks came during peak Easter travel and ahead of summer travel.Syth said Ryanair has the greatest exposure to the Brussels market while United has the largest exposure of U.S. carriers followed by Delta.“While domestic U.S. airlines are not directly exposed, there may be knock-on impacts via code-share partners and potential pressure on domestic pricing from any fall off in connecting demand.”Starwood Hotel (HOT) said all of its hotels in the city were on lockdown. Starwood shares dipped 0.4%.Travel stocks had a similar reaction after the Paris attacks last year. But analysts didn’t expect overall travel demand to take a long-term hit.Airlines were busy again within a few weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, as well as the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005.Still, the current refugee crisis and ramp-up in the fight against the Islamic State could weigh on travelers’ decisions.

91,RCL,"Cruise line Royal Caribbean (RCL) on Monday slashed its profit outlook for 2015, saying higher fuel costs and a stronger U.S. dollar have weighed on results. Shares dropped 7.3% to 73.30 in the stock market today.
"
92,RCL,"The company said in its first-quarter earnings release that it now sees full-year EPS of $4.45-$4.65, down 20 cents from the outlook it issued three months ago and below Wall Street forecasts for $4.73.
"
93,RCL,"The higher fuel prices and rising dollar against weaker currencies in turmoil-wracked nations abroad negatively impacted Royal Caribbean's per-share profit forecast by $0.36, the company said. The rising fuel costs during the quarter, which ended March 31, came amid oil companies' decisions to cut production after a fracking boom over recent years led to oversupply.

100,RCL,"Recession-weary millennials haven't been as eager as previous generations to get saddled with possessions, a sentiment reflected in low home ownership rates and a thriving ""sharing economy."" But the newest generation of consumers likes having nice things. 
"
101,RCL,"Generation Z — those 17 and younger — is the latest demographic in the cross hairs of brands and retailers who have thus far been in hot pursuit of millennials. But teens and kids are markedly different from their older counterparts in want and how they spend, say experts.
"
102,RCL,"Their predecessors in the 18-to-34 set have a case of ""millennialism,"" a recession-induced mindset that translates to owning fewer things, said Jamie Gutfreund, chief marketing officer at digital marketing agency Deep Focus.
"
103,RCL,"Millennials, who graduated college during a recession and witnessed their parents struggle with layoffs, aren't attached to possessions, says Gutfreund, and they see property like cars and homes weighing them down. The travel-happy renters would rather take an Uber than buy a sedan, or resell items they no longer use.
"
104,RCL,"Have-Nots Vs. Aspiring Haves
"
105,RCL,"""If you've ever spent time with someone who's lived through the Depression, they don't go back (to their old ways),"" Gutfreund told IBD. Millennials ""essentially started the sharing economy,"" valuing experiences over products.
"
106,RCL,"Younger people, by comparison, dream of owning cars and homes. They're characterized as being entrepreneurial, well informed and socially conscious. If today's 20- and early-30-somethings are ""have-nots,"" Gen Z members definitely aspire to be ""haves.""
"
107,RCL,"Six out of 10 Gen Z youth would rather have a cool product than a cool experience, while 77% of Gen Ys (millennials) would opt for a cool experience over a cool product, according to the latest edition of the Cassandra Report, a Deep Focus survey of young consumers.
"
108,RCL,"Millennials, who were teenagers around the time the dot-com bubble burst, think that money doesn't make the man. When they were 14 to 18, only 28% of them viewed having lots of money as an indicator of success, said the report, vs. 51% of today's 14- to 18-year-olds.
"
109,RCL,"""Gen Z will be the landlords and Gen Y the renters,"" said Gutfreund. ""Gen Zs view larger, more significant purchases as a solid anchor, a direct investment toward building their future, while Ys view them as an anchor holding them back from experiences (like) traveling the world, and locking them into a lifetime of debt.""
"
110,RCL,"Ready To Drop Serious Dough
"
111,RCL,"What does this distinction mean for retailers and makers of consumer products?
"
112,RCL,"While both generations are budget buyers, today's teens look for ""investment value,"" not resale value, Gutfreund said. Young and still in school, they are nevertheless ""efficient and careful consumers"" who tend to do a lot of research online before making purchases, she added.
"
113,RCL,"Teens and kids are therefore more willing than their older peers to drop some serious dough (or their parents' dough ) on a product that they like, even if it means having less stuff overall. When it comes to purchases, 54% of 13- to 17-year-olds value quality over quantity, according to the Cassandra Report.
"
114,RCL,"""I do think they will spend more on individual purchases — buying less but better quality fits into their investment mentality,"" Gutfreund said.
"
115,RCL,"For example, Estee Lauder's (EL) upscale makeup brand Mac became the No. 1 favorite for teen girls across all income brackets for the first time, according to Piper Jaffray's latest Taking Stock With Teens survey. Never mind that Mac foundation can run up to $35 a pop, about three times the price of drugstore brands and more than the average teen's weekly allowance.
"
116,RCL,"Dressing well is also a priority for Gen Z. But logo-heavy Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) — millennial favorites — won't cut it anymore.
"
117,RCL,"""When millennials were in junior high, a lot of the retail (selection) was about these big, bold logos,"" said Leah Swartz, content specialist for millennial research firm FutureCast.
"
118,RCL,"""Now we're seeing those logos take a back seat. (Gen Z wants) to define the brands they're wearing, rather than (let them) define who they are.""
"
119,RCL,"Fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21, Zara and H&M, which have put pressure on traditional apparel brands, aren't safe either.
"
120,RCL,"""Zs have already started to move away from fast fashion — they are highly aware of the labor practices and impact on the world,"" said Gutfreund.
"
121,RCL,"Millennials are the last group to grow up with analog communication, straddling the line between home landlines and Facebook (FB) messages. Millennials tend to look at two to three screens at a time, said Swartz, but Gen Zs multitask across five screens, texting friends and playing tablet games as they watch TV and surf the Web. As attention spans shorten, ""show, don't tell"" seems to be the strategy.
"
122,RCL,"That's why Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell announced a Cinco de Mayo giveaway of its new ""biscuit taco"" via Periscope, Twitter's (TWTR) new live video streaming service. Periscope is getting a lot of Gen Z love, said Swartz.
"
123,RCL,"And in an age of skipping past ads and not-so-subtle product placement, being obvious about the intention to sell things might create a sheen of authenticity.
"
124,RCL,"Gutfreund points to Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) as an example. The cruise line partnered with Google (GOOGL) YouTube channel AwesomenessTV (partly owned by DreamWorks Animation (DWA) to launch ""Royal Crush,"" a teen soap opera set entirely, unabashedly, on a Royal Caribbean ship. One of its latest episodes garnered over 614,000 views and 1,500 fan comments in less than three days.
"
125,RCL,"With all the action online, do brick-and-mortar retailers stand a chance with the new generation of consumers?

126,RCL,"Surprisingly, reports of the mall's demise may be greatly exaggerated. Both teens and 20-somethings still like shopping. Gen Z does 67% of its shopping in store, according to Deep Focus figures, vs. 58% of millennials. And over the last six months, 74% of Gen Zs have engaged in ""webrooming"": researching a product online but ultimately purchasing it in store.
"
127,RCL,"""This is not doom and gloom for retailers,"" said Gutfreund. ""It's human nature that people still do love the shopping experience. But those shopping experiences are going to have to be much better.""Recession-weary millennials haven't been as eager as previous generations to get saddled with possessions, a sentiment reflected in low home ownership rates and a thriving ""sharing economy."" But the newest generation of consumers likes having nice things. Generation Z — those 17 and younger — is the latest demographic in the cross hairs of brands and retailers who have thus far been in hot pursuit of millennials. But teens and kids are markedly different from their older counterparts in want and how they spend, say experts.Their predecessors in the 18-to-34 set have a case of ""millennialism,"" a recession-induced mindset that translates to owning fewer things, said Jamie Gutfreund, chief marketing officer at digital marketing agency Deep Focus.Millennials, who graduated college during a recession and witnessed their parents struggle with layoffs, aren't attached to possessions, says Gutfreund, and they see property like cars and homes weighing them down. The travel-happy renters would rather take an Uber than buy a sedan, or resell items they no longer use.Have-Nots Vs. Aspiring Haves""If you've ever spent time with someone who's lived through the Depression, they don't go back (to their old ways),"" Gutfreund told IBD. Millennials ""essentially started the sharing economy,"" valuing experiences over products.Younger people, by comparison, dream of owning cars and homes. They're characterized as being entrepreneurial, well informed and socially conscious. If today's 20- and early-30-somethings are ""have-nots,"" Gen Z members definitely aspire to be ""haves.""Six out of 10 Gen Z youth would rather have a cool product than a cool experience, while 77% of Gen Ys (millennials) would opt for a cool experience over a cool product, according to the latest edition of the Cassandra Report, a Deep Focus survey of young consumers.Millennials, who were teenagers around the time the dot-com bubble burst, think that money doesn't make the man. When they were 14 to 18, only 28% of them viewed having lots of money as an indicator of success, said the report, vs. 51% of today's 14- to 18-year-olds.""Gen Z will be the landlords and Gen Y the renters,"" said Gutfreund. ""Gen Zs view larger, more significant purchases as a solid anchor, a direct investment toward building their future, while Ys view them as an anchor holding them back from experiences (like) traveling the world, and locking them into a lifetime of debt.""Ready To Drop Serious DoughWhat does this distinction mean for retailers and makers of consumer products?While both generations are budget buyers, today's teens look for ""investment value,"" not resale value, Gutfreund said. Young and still in school, they are nevertheless ""efficient and careful consumers"" who tend to do a lot of research online before making purchases, she added.Teens and kids are therefore more willing than their older peers to drop some serious dough (or their parents' dough ) on a product that they like, even if it means having less stuff overall. When it comes to purchases, 54% of 13- to 17-year-olds value quality over quantity, according to the Cassandra Report.""I do think they will spend more on individual purchases — buying less but better quality fits into their investment mentality,"" Gutfreund said.For example, Estee Lauder's (EL) upscale makeup brand Mac became the No. 1 favorite for teen girls across all income brackets for the first time, according to Piper Jaffray's latest Taking Stock With Teens survey. Never mind that Mac foundation can run up to $35 a pop, about three times the price of drugstore brands and more than the average teen's weekly allowance.Dressing well is also a priority for Gen Z. But logo-heavy Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) — millennial favorites — won't cut it anymore.""When millennials were in junior high, a lot of the retail (selection) was about these big, bold logos,"" said Leah Swartz, content specialist for millennial research firm FutureCast.""Now we're seeing those logos take a back seat. (Gen Z wants) to define the brands they're wearing, rather than (let them) define who they are.""Fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21, Zara and H&M, which have put pressure on traditional apparel brands, aren't safe either.""Zs have already started to move away from fast fashion — they are highly aware of the labor practices and impact on the world,"" said Gutfreund.Millennials are the last group to grow up with analog communication, straddling the line between home landlines and Facebook (FB) messages. Millennials tend to look at two to three screens at a time, said Swartz, but Gen Zs multitask across five screens, texting friends and playing tablet games as they watch TV and surf the Web. As attention spans shorten, ""show, don't tell"" seems to be the strategy.That's why Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell announced a Cinco de Mayo giveaway of its new ""biscuit taco"" via Periscope, Twitter's (TWTR) new live video streaming service. Periscope is getting a lot of Gen Z love, said Swartz.And in an age of skipping past ads and not-so-subtle product placement, being obvious about the intention to sell things might create a sheen of authenticity.Gutfreund points to Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) as an example. The cruise line partnered with Google (GOOGL) YouTube channel AwesomenessTV (partly owned by DreamWorks Animation (DWA) to launch ""Royal Crush,"" a teen soap opera set entirely, unabashedly, on a Royal Caribbean ship. One of its latest episodes garnered over 614,000 views and 1,500 fan comments in less than three days.With all the action online, do brick-and-mortar retailers stand a chance with the new generation of consumers?Surprisingly, reports of the mall's demise may be greatly exaggerated. Both teens and 20-somethings still like shopping. Gen Z does 67% of its shopping in store, according to Deep Focus figures, vs. 58% of millennials. And over the last six months, 74% of Gen Zs have engaged in ""webrooming"": researching a product online but ultimately purchasing it in store.""This is not doom and gloom for retailers,"" said Gutfreund. ""It's human nature that people still do love the shopping experience. But those shopping experiences are going to have to be much better.""

131,RCL,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance Report
"
132,RCL,"The $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.
"
133,RCL,"The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.
"
134,RCL,"That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.
"
135,RCL,"Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.
"
136,RCL,"Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.
"
137,RCL,"And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.
"
138,RCL,"IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter. October's stock market rally brought relief to you. The Q3 culprits seemed to be the China correction, the Federal Reserve delaying its long-promised interest-rate hike and political bashing of drugmakers. Does that square with your account?
"
139,RCL,"Turek: I think you hit it on the head. From a macro standpoint, the first two points are spot on. Issues in China, the devaluation, caused a lot of uncertainty in global growth and impact on emerging markets.
"
140,RCL,"It put a lot of questions on the table, especially for U.S. exports.
"
141,RCL,"And the Fed punting was not well taken by the marketplace.
"
142,RCL,"From a secular standpoint, health care affected us quite a bit. It started with (Hillary) Clinton's (critical) chatter about drug pricing (being excessive). Then there was piling on by other pundits and politicians. But pricing (criticism) is not a new thing. It's been around, and it will be around. So this too shall pass.
"
143,RCL,"IBD: You trimmed some health stocks due to the beating that segment was taking, right?
"
144,RCL,"Turek: We weren't so concerned about the health care services area, like hospitals. Where we trimmed was in a couple of areas: therapeutics and biotech.
"
145,RCL,"We had success in (those areas). So part of our trimming was profit-taking. Part was due to the uncertainty that the pricing risk to the industry created. We don't know how that will play out. So we more or less across the board trimmed a lot of positions.
"
146,RCL,"IBD: And by ""therapeutics"" you mean which types of stocks?
"
147,RCL,"Turek: Specialty pharmaceuticals and biotech. It does not include the Bristol-Myers Squibbs (BMY) of the world. They're too big. There aren't a lot of regular drugmakers in our midcap space. They're too big. We're interested in smaller versions of Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers.
"
148,RCL,"The smaller companies we focus on are specialized in one or two areas of health care.
"
149,RCL,"IBD: You like innovators, right?
"
150,RCL,"Turek: Yes, we look for that whether they're in tech, health care or consumer discretionary.
"
151,RCL,"We like companies that are doing something unique. If a company has a competitive advantage or a moat, so much the better. The advantage could be something like a new drug or software product. In consumer discretionary, it might be that the company is innovative, like Under Armour (UA), coming out with new products consistently, expanding rapidly as well. A couple of years ago, they only made apparel. Now they're coming out with footwear.
"
152,RCL,"IBD: In what sectors are you increasing your weights?
"
153,RCL,"Turek: In October, not much at all. We're watching. Where we're interested in doing that is in tech. And to be quite honest about it: In health care, prices have come down so much that maybe it's overdone. Prices have started to look pretty cheap in the past six to eight weeks.
"
154,RCL,"So perhaps in the near future, we'll be at a point where interest in that area increases quite a bit.
"
155,RCL,"We'll pass on some. But we'll get back to others based on fundamentals — companies that are doing something new and innovative, that deserve to be paid for.
"
156,RCL,"IBD: Do you still like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) despite its recent pullback?
"
157,RCL,"Turek: We still like it. These guys are best of breed as far as creating the next-generation firewall and security, as opposed to a single-point product provider.
"
158,RCL,"We don't think anything has changed. And there's still a high degree of need for security spending from all kinds of enterprises and government units as well. That's not necessarily going to abate.
"
159,RCL,"Competition is vigorous, but Palo Alto has done a good job of being innovative in designing and offering a suite of products to forestall hacking.
"
160,RCL,"IBD: Describe the attractive innovations of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI).
"
161,RCL,"Turek: Ultimate is a human-capital management company. Their niche is the marketplace below large companies, companies with 500 to 1,500 employees, which was their sweet spot for a long time.
"
162,RCL,"They offer cloud-based solutions, so you get continuous updates and upgrades for a suite of products. It makes the cost of ownership affordable, especially for midsize companies that don't necessarily have IT expertise in-house.
"
163,RCL,"What they've done in the past year is move down-market to companies with between 100 and 500 employees. They're starting at the high end of that. And they're having good success.
"
164,RCL,"That's going to add to their top-line growth. They have a high retention rate, over 95% if I remember correctly.
"
165,RCL,"IBD: What innovation by Avago Technologies (AVGO) interests you the most right now?
"
166,RCL,"Turek: Avago is a fabless semiconductor (company). They outsource manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and others.
"
167,RCL,"Their big thing is called FBAR, which stands for ""film bulk acoustic resonators."" FBARs are important, as the amount of data and signals from the expansion in the number of wireless phones causes noise. FBARs smooth out the noise and prevent dropped calls.
"
168,RCL,"As the technology for wireless gets more complicated, more FBARs are needed in each phone.
"
169,RCL,"But even that won't last forever, so they've bought companies to diversify their business stream.
"
170,RCL,"IBD: What made IT hardware and software provider CDW's (CDW) earnings per share grow 9%, 19% and 21% the past three stanzas?
"
171,RCL,"Turek: CDW is a leading distributor of all things information-related. The value they add is that customers — many of which are small or midsize and don't have a lot of in-house IT expertise — rely on CDW to solve problems. They (do that by partnering) customers with their general sales reps and with sales engineers who are experts in fields like Wi-Fi and routing.
"
172,RCL,"IBD: If the U.S. economy is improving, and if car sales are rising, why do consumers need car parts for repairs of older cars? What's the appeal of O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)?
"
173,RCL,"Turek: The average age of the U.S. car fleet hasn't changed much in recent years, even as new-car sales have risen.
"
174,RCL,"What's transforming the company is that they used to sell just to do-it-yourselfers. What the company did was start to sell parts to the professional or do-it-for-you channel. And they've had a lot of success in that. They're not necessarily selling to dealers, although they do. They're selling to mom-and-pop car-repair shops.
"
175,RCL,"IBD: What is Signet Jewelers' (SIG) innovation?
"
176,RCL,"Turek: We got interested when they bought a primary competitor, Zales. Signet was a better operator. So the opportunity was that Signet would overlay their management ability on Zales and improve the top and bottom lines of Zales over time.
"
177,RCL,"They've owned it about a year and have started to have success in those areas. Unlocking the value in Zales was important (to our decision to invest).
"
178,RCL,"Most recently, this quarter Signet plans their biggest new product introduction ever, a diamond ring called Ever Us, a high-quality diamond ring set that it will roll out across all of their stores. That's unusual. We hope it will be a big product for them in 2015 and into '16.
"
179,RCL,"IBD: You've increased your stake in Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) in recent disclosures. Why do you like them more than other cruiselines?
"
180,RCL,"Turek: They attract a slightly higher-end customer, who are less sensitive to price increases and economic shifts as well.
"
181,RCL,"NCL has a high yield on their ships. They haven't added capacity at the same pace as their competitors, so they're easier to fill for cruises. And, knock on wood, they're accident free, which helps their reputation.
"
182,RCL,"So recently we've liked their pricing power. It's a better offering than Royal Caribbean (RCL). And (low) oil prices have been a tailwind. Plus, they face new opportunities. They're eager to see what happens to Cuba. And now China is opening to cruisers. These should aid NCL and the industry.
"
183,RCL,"IBD: Why have you boosted your stake in Alaska Air Group (ALK) rather than some other airline?
"
184,RCL,"Turek: These guys are really good operators. They started as a West Coast airline. Now they're going transcontinental and midcontinental. They have really good financials, good return on equity, good free cash flow, good customer satisfaction levels. They're growing in the low double digits for the next couple of years. And it's a joy to listen to them talk about their business. They're having fun.
"
185,RCL,"IBD: Why did you start a stake in Tyler Technologies (TYL) this year?
"
186,RCL,"Turek: We started it in June or July, I think. It came from something my analyst had talked about. They're a leader in providing financial and ERP (enterprise resource planning) software to local and state governments.
"
187,RCL,"A lot of those governments are behind in technology, compared with private enterprises, so there's a need for them to modernize a lot of their systems.
"
188,RCL,"Tyler was a leader in the criminal justice area and has branched out into other areas like appraisal, taxes, public safety and vital records. Governments are getting that moving from legacy paper-based records to cloud-based records makes records easier to manage and makes things easier for us as consumers of public records.
"
189,RCL,"You wouldn't think it's a great market, but it is, even with the headwind of a lack of financing.
"
190,RCL,"IBD: Why have you been edging up your stake in Acuity Brands (AYI), a maker of lighting products?
"
191,RCL,"Turek: This is a play on energy efficiency in nonresidential areas. It's not wholly dependent on new construction. A lot of it is retrofitting. They replace a lot of old fluorescent lights with LEDs, which save energy — money — for owners of those businesses.Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance ReportThe $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter.

192,RCL,"If it's true that a rising tide lifts all boats, then it stands to reason that an ebb tide does the opposite. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) and other cruise ship operators found that out Sept. 22, when Carnival (CCL), the largest U.S.-based operator, reported fiscal third-quarter earnings and gave Wall Street reason to worry. Carnival beat analysts' consensus estimates…
"
193,RCL,"Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) surprised Wall Street with better than expected first-quarter earnings and raised its 2015 guidance, driving shares up sharply Thursday. Earnings per share minus one-time items for the highly rated cruise ship operator rose 17% to 27 cents, up from 23 cents a year ago and beating by 4 cents a share. Revenue climbed 41% to $938.18…
"
194,RCL,"Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) has pulled back to its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out of a flat base, giving investors a chance to buy additional shares. The first two pullbacks from the 50-day line are generally safe places to add shares to an already successful position. It's a sound method for building a larger position…
"
195,RCL,"Stock futures nosed higher ahead of Monday's open as earnings news contended with the effects of a rising dollar.
"
196,RCL,"Dow futures rose 28.6 points above fair market value, nearly doubling their gain from an hour earlier. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 9.9 points, also rising. S&P 500 futures kept to a 1.9-point gain.
"
197,RCL,"The stock market today rolls out with the Nasdaq fighting to hold fresh highs inked late last week, while the S&P 500 presses against resistance marked at its May 20 high. Stocks set sail under a fresh market status , a plus for investors.
"
198,RCL,"Banks reopened today in Greece, hinting at more progress toward whatever the new normal might be there. And with earnings season continuing to look somewhat better than forecast, the easing of overseas tension allowed currency traders to focus more directly on a potential rate increase by the Federal Reserve later this year.

GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran.

The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets.

287,RCL,"The cruise ship industry has had its share of negative headlines and public relations headaches in recent years. The Ebola scare triggered a four-week sell-off in cruise line operators in October.In December, a fire aboard Norwegian Cruise Line's (NCLH) ship Insignia while docked in St. Lucia canceled a 10-day trip and took the ship out of commission for nine weeks.In February 2013, an engine fire in a Carnival (CCL) ship disabled the vessel in the Gulf of Mexico, stranding passengers and resulting in unsanitary conditions.One month later, more than 100 passengers on Royal Caribbean's (RCL) Vision of the Seas ship came down with norovirus, a highly contagious stomach bug.But the industry is back on its feet amid improving fundamentals, partly due to lower oil prices. Fuel costs account for roughly 30% of operating expenses in the cruise industry.Norwegian, with a Composite Rating of 97, is much smaller than industry titans Carnival (70) and Royal Caribbean (78), but smaller can sometimes mean a more compelling growth story, and that's the case with Norwegian.Norwegian went public in January 2013 at 19.When the company reported fourth-quarter results last month, earnings per share just missed expectations but still soared 89% from a year ago. Sales jumped 31% to $788.9 million. In the earnings release, new CEO Frank Del Rio said that recent weeks of the January to March promotional ""wave"" season saw ""a significant acceleration in booking volume.""Del Rio came over from Prestige Cruise Holdings, which Norwegian acquired in November. It paid $3 billion for eight small luxury cruise ships as part of its strategy to pursue a higher-end demographic.Two 4,000-passenger vessels for Norwegian — the Getaway and Breakaway — have been big hits with customers. Meanwhile, the first of its four Breakaway Plus ships, with 4,200 passenger berths, is expected to start service out of Miami in late 2015.Norwegian recently cleared a second-stage base with a 48.26 buy point.

333,RCL,"Carnival's (CCL) second-quarter earnings topped analyst consensus, but it offered weak guidance as it anticipates higher costs this year.The No. 1 cruise line operator's adjusted earnings jumped 178% to 25 cents per share in Q2, 9 cents better than expected. Revenue dipped 1.2% to $3.59 billion, above projections of $3.56 billion.Carnival guided Q3 adjusted EPS to $1.56-$1.60, badly missing Wall Street's $1.70 target, as higher fuel prices and unfavorable currency rates are expected to reduce Q3 EPS by 6 cents.The company also revised its full-year EPS guidance to $2.35-$2.50 from $2.30-$2.50 earlier, but the midpoint remains below the consensus for $2.50.Carnival shares were down about 1% on the stock market today. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH), whose stock is on the IBD Leaderboard list of top-rated stocks was down 0.7%, and Royal Carribean Cruises (RCL) slid 2%.Carnival said that cumulative advance bookings for the next three quarters are ahead of the prior year's pace, but at slightly lower prices due to unfavorable currency rates.The company is also stepping up spending on marketing and to add new amenities to attract customers who defected to Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Carribean Cruises after a series of high-profile accidents on Carnival ships.The cruise operator expects Q3 net revenue yields to be up 3% to 4% compared to a year ago, up 2% to 3% in constant dollars.Deutsche Bank on Monday raised its rating on Carnival to buy from hold with a raised 55.30 price target (from 51), saying it expects both Carnival and the group to see more bookings and pricing recovery.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar .

334,RCL,"Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Broadcom (AVGO) are three stocks that show why $1.7 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) is smart for using two oars rather than just one.The fund's management is divvied up between two teams, one tilting toward value-oriented stock, the other toward growth stocks. Last year, when the postelection Trump Bump lifted value-oriented stocks like energy and financials, bets in those sectors boosted the fund's value-oriented sleeve. This year it's the growth sleeve's turn to shine brighter.And with year-to-date gains of 34% for both Amazon and Facebook and 39% for Broadcom going into Thursday, those stocks have added octane to the growth sleeve's fuel. So have consumer discretionary names like Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH). And likewise for health care names like Hologic (HOLX) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).The fund aims for a 60%-40% split in assets between its growth and value sleeves. ""That split makes sense in achieving a core fund experience for our shareholders,"" said USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the teams running the two sleeves. Subadvisors from Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss run the value sleeve. An in-house team from USAA mans the growth sleeve.Most of the fund's dividend comes from the Barrow Hanley sleeve.The tandem arrangement has resulted in a 23.46% return over the 12 months going into Thursday, topping 95% of its large-cap-blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 was up 19.06%.So far this year, the fund is up 9.74% vs. 8.82% for its peer group and 9.86% for the big-cap bogey.John Jares, who runs the growth sleeve along with John Toohey, likes Amazon's strength in retail and web services. ""It's referred to as Hurricane Amazon because it's so disruptive,"" he said. Amazon Web Services' operating margin soared to 24.3% as of the first quarter, up from 3.8% in 2014. It's expected to hit 29% by the end of 2017, he says. With AWS' profit growing much faster than the overall company's, the overall company's operating margin will be pulled up by AWS, Jares adds. And its rapidly growing free cash flow will give the company ""more ammunition to invest against any of its competitors,"" he said.He's less enthused about Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods Market (WFM), wondering what role it will play in Amazon's future.His team is crunching numbers to decide whether investors have oversold other grocery chains. The fund also owns Kroger (KR).Jares likes the way Facebook has become a magnet for advertising dollars, largely by providing advertisers with sharper targeting of consumers. ""They can see the effectiveness of ad campaigns,"" Jares said. And Facebook can post additional ads at minimal cost. ""That's what attracted us to the stock,"" he said.The stock is trading around 153. Jares says 200 is not out of the range of possibility.A third cruise ship line that the fund owns is Carnival (CCL). ""The cruise lines have been on a tear this year,"" he said, referring to all three of his cruise ship stocks. ""Because of improved demand, they've had better pricing. Last year, there were problems from terrorism in Europe, fears about the Zika virus. With the improvement in employment and the future economic outlook of the U.S., cruise lines have seen rising demand. Plus, they've enjoyed easy comps (earnings comparisons) from last year.""Royal Caribbean is up 39% so far this year. Earnings per share grew 13%, 31% and 74% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Royal Caribbean ranks No. 3 in the Leisure-Services industry group. It has four straight years of annual earnings per share growth. Norwegian ranks No. 6 in the group. You can compare the two stocks fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy to use Stock Checkup tool.Norwegian, trading around 55, is up 29% this year. The stock is within its buy range for investors looking for optimal entry points.In health care, Jares says his team likes Hologic because relatively new CEO Stephen MacMillan is shifting the company to a faster growth profile serving female health, diagnostics and aesthetics.The team's view of UnitedHealth is that investors have underappreciated its Optum division, which includes a number of fast-growing ancillary businesses that improve the effectiveness of their standard insurance business.Building materials maker Owens Corning (OC), in the Barrow Hanley sleeve, is up 30% this year. EPS grew 9% and 60% the past two quarters. The stock has been driven by the housing rebound and strength in the U.S. economy.Michael Nayfa, a manager of the Barrow Hanley sleeve, said, ""Underlying fundamentals remain strong in the roofing and composite businesses, and the insulation business looks set to recover in 2017 as housing starts remain below normal and pricing is picking up. OC remains an attractive value trading at 14 times normalized earnings with a 1.2% dividend yield.""RELATED: Microsoft would surpass Amazon Web ServicesUSAA Growth & Income Fund Shows Two Heads Are Better Than OneHow To Turn A Glass Of Wine Into A $173,000 Bump In Your IRA

335,RCL,"John W. Rogers, Jr. was introduced to investing at age 12, when his father began to give him gifts of stock instead of toys at each birthday and Christmas. His father's guidance paid off.Now 59 years old, Rogers is founder, chairman, CEO and chief investment officer of Chicago-based Ariel Investments, with $11.7 billion in assets under management (AUM). The firm, founded in January 1983, runs six no-load mutual funds with $4.6 billion in cumulative AUM as well as separately managed accounts. And Rogers is a pioneer. He was the first African-American founder of a major mutual fund complex, preceding Eddie C. Brown of Brown Capital Management by about six months.In addition to his executive duties, Rogers is lead manager of $2.3 billion Ariel Fund (ARGFX). He celebrated his 30th anniversary at the helm in November. Especially at that task, Rogers has an appetite for smaller stocks. And he takes an emphatically value-oriented approach in his investing. ""Smaller stocks are more nimble, flexible and adaptable,"" he said. ""Therefore, they're able to grow more rapidly."" And undervalued stocks whose fundamentals are sound offer opportunities to benefit from underappreciated gems, he says.His willingness to give undervalued stocks the time to blossom is reflected in the tortoise — you remember how the seemingly slow tortoise in Aesop's fable beat the swift hare to the finish line — that Ariel prominently displays on its website.Ariel's broad framework has been especially productive over the past five years, when his fund's 16.85% average annual return through May 31 topped 98% of its midcap blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.Despite his value bent, 13 of his 39 stocks have IBD's Composite Rating of 80 or higher. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings.Among those high Comp Rating holdings as of March 31 were Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), which is up 34% this year; Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), which is up 22%; Charles River Laboratories (CRL), which is 21% this year; KKR (KKR), which is up 20%; and First American Financial (FAF), which is up 17% this year.Rogers spoke with IBD about his investment approach and career from his office in Chicago.IBD: John, why do you focus on undervalued smaller stocks?Rogers: I worked at William Blair & Company for a couple of years (as a stock broker). Mr. Blair, who was in his nineties at the time, talked about the fact that small companies could grow faster than large ones. I loved that thesis. I thought it made a lot of sense. More people cover large stocks. There are more inefficiencies in small and medium-sized companies. It's easier to find inefficiently priced stocks there.IBD: And why undervalued companies in particular?Rogers: The value component started from books I read. I went to Princeton. Burton Malkiel, an economics professor, had (recently) written ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" (which has helped popularize idea that large markets tend to be efficient). But even he believed that some stocks can get vastly over- or undervalued. And I liked the idea that if you leaned against the crowd, you could be successful (as an investor).I read books by John Train, Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham and John Templeton. They all liked being contrarians. They all said that the best time to invest is when others are fearful. So as someone who had grown up as an only child and was comfortable with being independent, I was comfortable with an investment approach that involved not following the crowd.IBD: Did the market itself reinforce your tilt?Rogers: I graduated from Princeton in 1980. The market had not been good for a period. There had been a long slot of an underperforming market. So, low P/E stocks were something of a safe haven. There were few us focused on small stocks and low P/E stocks.IBD: Let's talk about stocks. I'm asking your thesis as of your latest disclosure. Zebra Tech makes thermal and thermal transfer printers. What do you like there?Rogers: They're in a sweet spot, where these products are critical to retailers in tracking inventory. Everyone needs to track it rapidly and with precision, in these days of Amazon (AMZN) (providing customers with quick turnaround).And we've seen a new wave of suppliers using their new technology.But a year ago the company was mired in bad press regarding a company Zebra bought from Motorola Solutions. It was supposed to enhance their business and diversify their product mix. But there was a sense they had overpaid, that the integration was not going smoothly and that Zebra's balance sheet was impaired by it.Now, a year later, management has worked hard to show their balance sheet is improved. The stresses of the acquisition seem to be settling down. We're seeing the benefits of the two companies being put together. We like to take advantage of those types of uncertain situations if we believe in the long-term prospects of a business.IBD: You've owned Royal Caribbean Cruises since 2007. Is this one of your stories about long-term patience?Rogers: They have gotten rational in the way they compete. They have not created too much capacity. That's critical. More people want to cruise, but not many companies can provide that experience.The industry has overcome negatives. Energy prices were high. The recession was a challenge. There have been health scares. Cruise ships crashing into things. There's always headline risk. But in the long-term they overcome those obstacles. And this company is well run. We know their CEO. He's highly competent. And it's stayed cheap — hasn't gotten expensive in last 10 years.IBD: You've owned MSG Networks (MSGN) since 2011. You also hold its sibling Madison Square Garden (MSG). Is this another story about long-term patience?Rogers: Both companies have wide moats around them. There's only one Madison Square Garden, the world's greatest arena in arguably the world best city, where there's a big population, lots of tourism, many businesses in the city. Having this extraordinary arena in the heart of Manhattan is irreplaceable and hard to compete with.Also, it has lots of real estate that's substantially undervalued on its books. It's got the sports franchises — the Rangers, the Knicks, the Liberty. The Knicks especially appear undervalued.And in MSG Networks you've got the broadcast rights to teams, which is very undervalued. And eventually the Knicks will be good again, as we've learned here in Chicago with our Cubs (who won the World Series after a drought of 108 years). That will make them even more valuable.There are challenges in media. But if you have the right live content, there will be a place for you on all of the different (carriers') bundles and you will do well.IBD'S TAKE: MSG Networks ranks No. 1 in IBD's Media-Radio/TV industry group. It has a 37.1% annual pretax margin and a 54.1% return on equity (ROE). See how its additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' data at IBD's Stock Checkup.IBD: What will enable Northern Trust (NTRS) to break out of what has been a sideways trend?Rogers: They are not a traditional bank. They are a huge custodian of assets for family offices, endowments and pensions. Only a few companies can compete with that, so there's a significant moat around their customer, custody and record keeping businesses.If you're a large endowment or family office, you let Northern Trust manage all of your finances. It's one-stop shopping. If you're a pension, you let them manage your money rather than hire staff yourself.They're a global business that will benefit if interest rates continue to move higher.IBD: KKR has done well for you, but you've trimmed your stake. What are your concerns?Rogers: Pension plans, endowments and wealth families believe that traditional long-only, 60% stock-40% bond portfolios are no longer the way to go. People want substantial exposure to alternatives.We believe that KKR is one of the top handful of major global private equity firms that are well-positioned to manage assets all over the world. Private equity has far outpaced every asset class, especially hedge funds, over the last 30 years. And this stock is still cheap. There's still a lot of value to be recognized here.IBD: Charles River offers researchers mice and rats that are bred for specific types of tests. Earnings per share grew 15%, 21% and 32% the past three quarters. What's your play?Rogers: Few people have the ability to help researchers in the health care field the way that Charles River does. They're a leader in breeding modified rats used to help health care companies test drugs and make sure they're healthy for humans.We've been there and seen their rows of color-coded cages. It makes you see their moat. There's always a little cloud (over this sort of stock) because of the stress on pharmaceutical companies. But we think this company is here for the long term. And there's still value in it.IBD: Many growth managers aim for sexy tech stocks. First American Financial sells title insurance and related services. What's their sex appeal for you?Rogers: They have products that are part of every real estate transaction in the U.S. Even during the worst of the real estate crisis, they were able to hold their own. Now they're poised to benefit from the housing recovery and economic recovery.IBD: Is Ariel a socially conscious investor?Rogers: The simple answer is that while we do not label or promote our funds and separate accounts as ""socially responsible,"" we have integrated ESG (environmental, social and governance) considerations in our investing process since our firm's founding in 1983...As an example, in terms of exclusionary factors, our domestic mutual funds do not invest in corporations with a primary source of revenue derived from the production or sale of tobacco products or the manufacture of handguns.IBD: When you were young, what else did your father do to expose you to investing?Rogers: He felt it was really important. He let me get the dividend checks every three months from the blue chips he invested in on my behalf. Then he encouraged me to read the newsletters and quarterly reports.Eventually he took me to meet his broker, Stacey Adams, who worked for Freehling & Co. He was the first African-American broker on LaSalle Street. I sat there, and he taught me to read the ticker and how to invest. He was a great role model and mentor.IBD: Your father was quite a dynamic guy, wasn't he?Rogers: He had quite a story. He was orphaned at 12. He moved to Chicago to live with a kindly uncle. He went to teachers college. He had a rough go of it. He worked odd jobs to pay his tuition, and he taught math at the public schools. He joined the Air Corps in World War II and became one of the original Tuskegee Airmen. He was a fighter pilot, who flew over 120 missions.When he came home, he tried to talk his way into the University of Chicago Law School. At first they turned him down. They weren't as welcoming of a place back then. My dad went back in his captain's uniform, and he got in.It was hard for my mother too. They kept telling her she should become a paralegal instead of a lawyer when she tried to get in. Now my father and mother's pictures hang in the law school. It became a progressive place, and it was kind of them to honor my parents for their historic roles.RELATED: Why This Wells Fargo Stock Mutual Fund Is 'Special'How Boosting Retirement Savings By 1% Of Salary Turns Into $100K Of Income

336,RCL,"XThe market's rebound Tuesday sent a pair of midcap funds to the brink of a potential breakout.Vanguard Mid-Cap Value (VOE) extended its win streak to five Tuesday and closed a few pennies shy of a 104.41 flat-base buy point. If it clears the entry, that would mark its third breakout since late last year with respective 6% and 4% gains in between the flat-base patterns.The $7.5 billion fund, launched in August 2006, tracks the CRSP U.S. Mid Cap Value Index. Financial services accounted for VOE's biggest sector weighting as of April 30, at nearly 21% of assets. Consumer cyclicals was next at 19%, technology 12% and utilities 9%. Top holdings included Western Digital (WDC), Newell Brands (NWL), M&T Brands (MTB) and KeyCorp (KEY).Western Digital made a solid showing Tuesday, bouncing back above its 50-day moving average. Shares have rallied 33% this year. Another big holding, Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), has sailed ahead 35% YTD and is near all-time highs.VOE has underperformed the S&P 500 this year, rising 7.1% vs. the benchmark index's 9.5% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. But it's slightly ahead over the five- and 10-year periods with respective average annual returns of 16.6% and 7.53% vs. the S&P 500's 15.3% and 7.3%.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility Portfolio (XMLV) is also on the cusp of a potential breakout, in this case past a 44.05 flat-base entry. The $1.04 billion ETF has formed a series of flat bases during the past year. The biggest advance in between was a 4.5%, one-month run from a late-January breakout.XMLV, launched in February 2013, tracks the S&P MidCap Low Volatility Index. The top sector weightings are real estate at about 20%, financial services 19%, utilities 17% and consumer cyclicals at 13%. RenaissanceRe Holdings (RNR), Jack Henry & Associates (JKHY) and Westar Energy (WR) were among its top holdings as of June 8, according to Morningstar.The ETF's YTD and one-year returns have lagged the S&P 500, but a 14.6% three-year average annual return is ahead of the S&P 500's 10.3% advance.Moving on to Tuesday's picks, both ETFs are in buy range from their respective entries. SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) cleared a 38.51 flat-base buy point in a fifth straight advance, while SPDR Technology (XLK) followed through on a Monday rebound off its 50-day moving average line.RELATED: ETF Breakout Watch Picks In Buy Range As Market Rebounds2 Top Picks For ETF Watch Could Offer Chance To BuyWhich 2 Key Index Funds Bucked The Rout To Stay Near Buy Points?

337,RCL,"Falling oil prices and a declining energy sector are expected to have dragged down corporate earnings in 2014's fourth quarter, but the overall picture for S&P 500 companies remains strong.
"
338,RCL,"The difference is remarkable: S&P 500 companies should average solid 4.2% Q4 profit growth. But when excluding energy firms, profits probably rose a brisk 7.2%.
"
339,RCL,"With both U.S. and Brent crude oil prices falling fast in Q4 — now below $50 per barrel, down about half since the summer — the S&P's energy sector is forecast to post poor fourth-quarter numbers, with an estimated 20% decline in earnings and a 14.2% drop in revenue expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That's a staggering decline from the 11.1% earnings growth analysts had predicted Oct. 1 for Q4.
"
340,RCL,"As a result, the overall S&P 500 earnings estimate of 4.2% growth in Q4 is the weakest since the third quarter of 2012. Revenue is expected to have grown a measly 1.3% overall in Q4 vs. 3.9% when excluding energy stocks.
"
341,RCL,"Picture Improves In 2015
"
342,RCL,"The trend looks similar as the picture improves in 2015. Analysts expect earnings to grow 5.2% in Q1 on revenue growth of 1.6%. Excluding energy, that growth would be 10.5% profit improvement on a 4.7% revenue hike.
"
343,RCL,"Energy companies are expected to post a 33% decline in Q1 earnings on a 16% drop in revenue.
"
344,RCL,"The year-end earnings reporting season moves into high gear with all of the big four banks and others disclosing data this week.
"
345,RCL,"""Really, the picture outside of (energy) is still pretty solid,"" said Gregory Harrison, a senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters. The growth is ""really much better than it appears at first.""
"
346,RCL,"Powered by biotech, health care companies are leading all industries with earnings up 17.4% and revenue growing 9.4% in Q4, the analysts estimate.
"
347,RCL,"One of the hottest leaders, Gilead (GILD), is expected to report profit up 298% on sales up 115%. Amgen (AMGN) apparently performed closer to the biotech norm, with profit estimated to have risen 7.5% on sales up 3.5%.
"
348,RCL,"Telecom Follows The Leader
"
349,RCL,"Telecom profits come next, expected to have risen 13.8%, followed by utilities, up 11.2%; industrials, up 9.9%; and technology, up 8.9%.
"
350,RCL,"AT&T (T), with the second-largest market value among telecoms in the U.S., is expected to lag its sector with profit up 7.5% on sales rising 3.5% when it reports Q4.
"
351,RCL,"Those industrials include transportation, aerospace and defense contractors, expected to report 9.9% earnings growth on 2.4% better revenue as a group. Southwest Airlines (LUV) is one of the leaders, with earnings expected to grow 67%. Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) are forecast to grow earnings 12% and 38%, respectively.
"
352,RCL,"Making Tech Look Good
"
353,RCL,"The tech sector's 8.9% earnings growth looks good but not spectacular. Facebook (FB) alone is estimated to have grown Q4 EPS by 55% and revenue by 46%.
"
354,RCL,"Up next, the S&P's consumer discretionary sector is expected to post 7.9% earnings growth on 4% better revenue as cheaper gasoline means more money for consumers to spend elsewhere. These companies mostly serve U.S. consumers, who drive 70% of the economy.
"
355,RCL,"Consumer discretionary play Lowe's (LOW) is expected to post 39% earnings growth, while analysts estimate homebuilder Lennar (LEN) to have earned 32% more in Q4. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is expected to have earned 91% more than a year earlier.
"
356,RCL,"Financials, a powerhouse of growth in most recent years, with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) leading the way, appears to have flattened with forecast 1.3% growth in earnings on a 1.4% gain in revenue.
"
357,RCL,"Yet, for all the winners from cheaper oil, there are some non-winners that are difficult to call losers because they're still profitable, just less so. ExxonMobil (XOM) is expected to post a 26% profit decline. Analysts anticipate earnings declines of 32% for Chevron (CVX) and 39% for ConocoPhillips (COP).
"
358,RCL,"Consumer staples are expected to have generated no profit growth.
"
359,RCL,"Only those energy profits are expected to have fallen harder than the materials sector.
"
360,RCL,"Materials, which were forecast on Oct. 1 to post 10.1% earnings growth, are now expected to have shrunken profit by 2% in Q4 on a 1% drop in revenue. Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals maker Monsanto (MON), which reported Jan. 7, reduced EPS 30% while revenue fell 8.7% from a year earlier.
"
361,RCL,"The U.S. economy is being propelled by low interest rates, lower unemployment, higher business and consumer confidence and stocks near record highs, but the rest of the world seems a bit dicey. Europe has fallen into deflation and flirts with recession, Russia wilts under falling oil prices and Western sanctions, and Greece again may exit from the eurozone. China isn't growing as much as its government might like, while Japan and Brazil endure recessions.
"
362,RCL,"Investors should look to companies' quarterly conference calls to see whether businesses see some improvement, said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks Investment Research.
"
363,RCL,"With the stronger dollar affecting U.S. companies with overseas exposure and the large-cap companies in the S&P very exposed to international markets, corporate management teams have become increasingly negative with their Q4 guidance — 5.1 negative pre-announcements for every positive one. The historical average is 2.5:1 and Q3's ratio was 3:1. Yet most companies' pessimism seems unfounded as a significant majority of them beat expectations. Or are their forward-looking statements designed to impress shareholders later?

Amgen (AMGN) apparently performed closer to the biotech norm, with profit estimated to have risen 7.5% on sales up 3.5%.Telecom Follows The LeaderTelecom profits come next, expected to have risen 13.8%, followed by utilities, up 11.2%; industrials, up 9.9%; and technology, up 8.9%.AT&T (T), with the second-largest market value among telecoms in the U.S., is expected to lag its sector with profit up 7.5% on sales rising 3.5% when it reports Q4.Those industrials include transportation, aerospace and defense contractors, expected to report 9.9% earnings growth on 2.4% better revenue as a group. Southwest Airlines (LUV) is one of the leaders, with earnings expected to grow 67%. Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) are forecast to grow earnings 12% and 38%, respectively.Making Tech Look GoodThe tech sector's 8.9% earnings growth looks good but not spectacular. Facebook (FB) alone is estimated to have grown Q4 EPS by 55% and revenue by 46%.Up next, the S&P's consumer discretionary sector is expected to post 7.9% earnings growth on 4% better revenue as cheaper gasoline means more money for consumers to spend elsewhere. These companies mostly serve U.S. consumers, who drive 70% of the economy.Consumer discretionary play Lowe's (LOW) is expected to post 39% earnings growth, while analysts estimate homebuilder Lennar (LEN) to have earned 32% more in Q4. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is expected to have earned 91% more than a year earlier.Financials, a powerhouse of growth in most recent years, with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) leading the way, appears to have flattened with forecast 1.3% growth in earnings on a 1.4% gain in revenue.Yet, for all the winners from cheaper oil, there are some non-winners that are difficult to call losers because they're still profitable, just less so. ExxonMobil (XOM) is expected to post a 26% profit decline. Analysts anticipate earnings declines of 32% for Chevron (CVX) and 39% for ConocoPhillips (COP).Consumer staples are expected to have generated no profit growth.Only those energy profits are expected to have fallen harder than the materials sector.Materials, which were forecast on Oct. 1 to post 10.1% earnings growth, are now expected to have shrunken profit by 2% in Q4 on a 1% drop in revenue. Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals maker Monsanto (MON), which reported Jan. 7, reduced EPS 30% while revenue fell 8.7% from a year earlier.The U.S. economy is being propelled by low interest rates, lower unemployment, higher business and consumer confidence and stocks near record highs, but the rest of the world seems a bit dicey. Europe has fallen into deflation and flirts with recession, Russia wilts under falling oil prices and Western sanctions, and Greece again may exit from the eurozone. China isn't growing as much as its government might like, while Japan and Brazil endure recessions.Investors should look to companies' quarterly conference calls to see whether businesses see some improvement, said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks Investment Research.With the stronger dollar affecting U.S. companies with overseas exposure and the large-cap companies in the S&P very exposed to international markets, corporate management teams have become increasingly negative with their Q4 guidance — 5.1 negative pre-announcements for every positive one. The historical average is 2.5:1 and Q3's ratio was 3:1. Yet most companies' pessimism seems unfounded as a significant majority of them beat expectations. Or are their forward-looking statements designed to impress shareholders later?""Management teams don't get rewarded for meeting expectations,"" Mian said. ""They get rewarded pretty handsomely for beating them.""

377,RCL,"Cruising waters are about to get a little more crowded as a new, high-profile cruise line plans to horn in on established Miami-based operators Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH).Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson announced Thursday that his company, with backer Bain Capital, plans to ""shake up the cruise industry"" with the start of Virgin Cruises, to be based out of the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area.Two new cruise ships are planned initially to serve cruise guests who ""deserve something better and different,"" stated Tom McAlpin, who will lead Virgin Cruises as its CEO. He formerly was president of Disney Cruise Line and most recently CEO of The World, Residences at Sea.Should Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian be worried? If they are, they have around three years to strategize over Virgin's move into their turf.That's about how long it would take for a new ship to be delivered, noted Robin Farley, an analyst with UBS.Despite obvious concerns about a new entrant's impact on the cruise market, especially in the crowded Caribbean, Farley says Virgin's entry might actually be a positive. It would attract more attention to the cruise market — and more passengers for everyone, she noted.She pointed out that Disney's entrance into the cruise market years ago was a concern but ended up as ""a big positive for the industry"" because it raised awareness of cruising as a vacation option. That was especially true for first-timers, who were likely to become repeat customers, often on other cruise lines.After first-timers try Virgin, they might want to try a different itinerary next time around — ""which means going to a different brand,"" Farley wrote in a research note Thursday.""While Virgin is not the powerhouse vacation brand that Disney is, we still believe it would attract more attention to the cruise market than the capacity it will represent,"" she said.Carnival, the biggest, is finally on smoother waters after three straight years of falling profit; earnings are expected to grow 19% this year. Norwegian and Royal Caribbean have been doing better. All three stocks have been steaming ahead since mid-October.IBD rates the stock of Norwegian, the smallest cruise operator of the three, the highest, with a Composite Rating of 97 out of 99, based on stock price, earnings and other metrics.

394,RCL,"Hotel giant Marriott International (MAR) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings late Monday. Hotel and travel stocks have been big winners in recent months.Estimates: Earnings per share of 91 cents, up 5%. Revenue should surge 40% to $5.286 billion, fueled by Marriott's acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts last year.Results: EPS of $1.01 on revenue of $5.561 billion. Revenue per available room rose 3.1% in North America and worldwide in constant currency.Outlook: Marriott sees revPAR up 1%-3% worldwide in Q2 in constant currency, including a 0-2% gain in North America and 3%-5% in the rest of the world. For the full year, the hotel giant sees full-year revPAR 1%-3% growth worldwide excluding currency swings, up from prior guidance for 0.5%-2.5%.Stock: Marriott shares rose 4% to 100.22 in early after-hours action. Shares closed down 0.7% to 96.37 in the stock market today after hitting a record 97.55 intraday.Rival Hilton (HLT) fell 0.6% to 60.68 in Monday's session, holding just above a 60.59 buy zone of a flat base. Hyatt (H), which was near a 58.15 buy point of a flat base, off 1.3% to 57.30. Wyndham (WYN) edged down 0.1%, consolidating near record highs.Hotel and other travel stocks have taken off since the U.S. election, which refreshed hopes that a pro-business approach to the economy would put more money in people's wallets and get them more comfortable with traveling more frequently.Hilton and Hyatt reported strong earnings last week, while Wyndam reported blowout earnings in late April. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) shot up to a record high following its late April earnings.Meanwhile, online travel giant Priceline (PCLN) reports earnings late Tuesday. Priceline rose 26 cents to 1903.91, hitting a record intraday high. Both Marriott and Priceline headed into earnings with best-possible 99 Composite Ratings, which means they are outperforming 99% of all other stocks on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. While you should never buy a stock on ratings alone winning stocks in history often have a 95+ CR near the start of their runs.More hotel-friendly policies and a more optimistic consumer could extend the cycle for the hotel industry, currently in its eighth year. Cycles tend to last seven to nine years, Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiolek said.Revenue per available room, an important industry metric, had likely peaked in 2015 but could stay positive this year and next. Still, the growth of hotels' supply of rooms has been limited in recent years. Many hotels have been reluctant to expand lodging since the recession, and creditors have been hesitant to extend credit.IBD'S TAKE: As President Trump's administration considers tougher vetting measures to people traveling to the U.S. and slaps electronics restrictions on some U.S.-bound flights, Gulf carriers have pulled back on flying to the U.S.As the current cycle enters its later stages, Wasiolek said he would be on the lookout for any Q1 commentary from Marriott around the strength of leisure travel, which tends to pick up first when sentiment turns around, followed by corporate demand and conventions.But Marriott has been doing many other things right as well, Wasiolek said, things that were perhaps punctuated by its Starwood acquisition.The company has done a nice job offering ""select-service"" lodging, he said. That is, hotels that offer a room, and maybe a bar, that appeal to millennials who would rather spend more time exploring the surrounding territory than being pampered in a full-service resort.Marriott also has hefty exposure to the U.S. and among the biggest loyalty programs in the business, Wasiolek added. That program has the potential attract not just travelers but smaller, third-party hotel operators looking to enter the Marriott fold through licensing or other agreements to expand their reach.""It's probably just the fact that maybe people are coming to realize that Marriott, with the acquisition of Starwood, was already a well-positioned company. Now it's even more so,"" Wasiolek said.Marriott management has said the Trump administration's attempted travel restrictions, which have targeted a handful of largely Muslim nations, have hurt demand. But the financial impact, at least, could be minimal, or offset by in the U.S. tax cuts and better consumer confidence, Wasiolek said.And if nothing else, the political rallies that have taken place since President Trump's election could also be good for the hotel business.In a research note last week, Instinet analyst Harry Curtis said business had picked up in the first quarter in part due to ""better-than-anticipated demand level surrounding the inauguration of President Trump, political rallies in D.C., and the Easter holiday shift.""The American Hotel & Lodging Association, whose members include Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt, reportedly plans a public relations and lobbying push criticizing Priceline and Expedia (EXPE), accusing them of monopolistic behavior.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio

416,RCL,"Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is in buying range after cruise stocks shook off an Ebola scare last month. It's now setting its sights on China.Royal Caribbean is just past a 69.41 buy point of a V-shaped cup base that it cleared earlier this month. The base is a riskier late-stage pattern that began forming in September, after the stock had tripled from a June 2012 low.The left side of the pattern shows a sharp decline coinciding with the spread of Ebola. In mid-October, a lab worker who may have had contact with the Ebola virus was quarantined after boarding a Carnival (CCL) cruise shipRoyal Caribbean has a Composite Rating of 85, sixth best in the 30-stock Leisure-Services industry, which has slipped 30 places to 60th out of 197 as of Thursday's IBD. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) leads the group with a 97 rating.Nevertheless, Royal Caribbean appears poised to benefit as a wealthy baby boomer generation enters retirement and China's middle class ventures abroad in growing numbers.UBS analyst Robin Farley said recently that China could be the next ""major force in cruising"" and that Royal Caribbean is angling for a big piece of the actionRoyal Caribbean's profit growth has been choppy, with a 40% decline in Q1 profit sandwiched in between two periods of triple-digit increases.Profit for the current quarter is seen rising 87% to 43 cents a share. Sales are expected to increase 2% to $1.9 billion, continuing a long string of mostly single-digit gains.Royal Caribbean's breakout came in below-average volume, a bearish sign.

421,RCL,"Planet Fitness (PLNT) has bulked up since its August 2015 initial public offering, thanks to a $10 per month fee, along with a catchy slogan that promises members a judgment-free setting with what it likes to call ""no gymtimidation.""It's a formula that seems to be working, as the chain boasts more than 8.7 million members and 1,200 facilities as of the third quarter.Macquarie analyst Matthew Brooks calls Planet Fitness the Domino's Pizza (DPZ) of gyms, lamenting that he doesn't own a franchise in a Jan. 10 research report. Buy like you would a pizza franchise, he suggests.""The biggest pushback on Planet Fitness is the gym business 'sucks,'"" he wrote. ""We get the comments from investors with experience but who are basing their comments more on what other listed gyms have done and not after going through the Planet Fitness model.""And therein lies the difference: ""Planet Fitness is not a gym,"" Brooks said.It's a franchise with 1,242 facilities as of Sept. 30, the day Planet Fitness wrapped up its third quarter. The number of facilities grew 22% year-over-year during that three-month period with membership running up 21%.Brooks says there is ""clear evidence"" the Planet Fitness model works. Low cost plus a judgment-free environment equals share gain.Investors seem to agree. Planet Fitness stock finished 2016 up 44% and shares have climbed nearly 7% year-to-date. Shares have been creating a flat base with a 22.17 entry point since mid-November. The stock inched down 4 cents Monday to close at 21.45.To that end, Planet Fitness stock has easily outperformed Investor's Business Daily's 31-company Leisure-Services industry group which ended 2016 up 4.4%. Shares for the group are up nearly 6% since New Year's Day. The group includes the likes of Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Six Flags Entertainment (SIX).But there is only one other gym in the group, Town Sports International (CLUB), which owns New York Sports Club and Boston Sports Club. Town Sports's $76 million market cap pales in comparison with Planet Fitness' $1.1 billion. Town Sports shares are up 14% for the year, but that's partly because the stock is trading below 3.Planet Fitness was established in 1992 when former Chief Executive Michael Grondahl acquired a struggling gym and reduced prices to compete with bigger box gyms, according to Entrepreneur.com. Grondahl grew the business by focusing on first-time gym patrons.Since then, Planet Fitness has expanded nationwide and is dabbling with facilities in Canada and the Dominican Republic via a franchise program that began in 2003. Each gym is considered a ""judgment-free zone"" and even has a ""lunk alarm"" to discourage grunting and dropping weights.""It doesn't matter if your legs have never seen a squat machine before,"" according to Planet Fitness' website. ""We believe no one should ever feel Gymtimidated by Lunky behavior and that everyone should feel at ease in our gyms, no matter what his or her workout goals are.""Grondahl stepped down in 2013 after most of Planet Fitness was sold to investment firm TSG Consumer Partners. Chris Rondeau, a 20-year veteran of the company, was named CEO. TSG sold 4 million shares during the company's IPO in 2015 and held several major sales last year.As of November, records show TSG holds 31.3% of the stock.It has been Rondeau who maintained Planet Fitness' ""no gymtimidation"" standard and $10 monthly fee amid its far-reaching expansion.Jefferies analyst Randal Konik is bullish that Planet Fitness can expand to 4,000 U.S. stores and sees ""strong potential for other areas of growth."" Planet Fitness management has said it's now looking at expanding in Europe and South America where it will likely have to license the business.On the third-quarter conference call with analysts, Rondeau said competitors are struggling to match Planet Fitness. Rivals who encroached on Planet Fitness' turf five years ago with 10-20 stores are now ""looking for a way out because they just can't compete with us in our space.""IBD'S TAKE: Analysts are calling for newbie IPO Planet Fitness to deliver 216% earnings growth in the fourth quarter when the company issues its quarterly report in March. But Planet Fitness isn't alone in major stock and earnings performance following its IPO. Check out IBD Stock Analysis for other big ideas.Konik noted as much in a Jan. 10 report. No rival seems able to keep up with Planet Fitness' vigorous expansion. With more than 1,000 facilities already committed to be built by franchisees, competitors are left lagging, he wrote.""Planet Fitness' scale, reach, size and value are proving impossible to replicate and the moat widens with each new mound of dirt that is moved to build a new unit in the solar system,"" he wrote. ""The competition just can't keep up.""On a year-over-year basis, Planet Fitness' sales grew 38.5% to $87.01 million in third quarter, and 16 cents earnings per share minus items was up 60%. But that was the first period those metrics could be measured vs. the year before. Sequentially, sales and earnings per share haven't been as smooth, with both dipping in the third quarter and the first.Still, Guggenheim analyst John Heinbockel is encouraged by Planet Fitness' ability to generate free cash flow. In November, Planet Fitness used $150 million on adjusted earnings and $17 million on capital expenditures to give shareholders a $275 million special dividend.By mid-2018, Planet Fitness should be a similar position to return some cash to shareholders, Heinbockel wrote in a Dec. 30 report. He rates Planet Fitness stock with a buy and has a 24 price target. He expects Planet Fitness to smartly leverage its $40 million ad fund, which is growing 20% annually.The monthly fee remains a predictable $10, but Planet Fitness could bump its annual fee above $39 — after all, it was once $29, Macquarie's Brooks wrote. Still, the company is likely to keep members coming in with monthly pizza nights, bagel mornings and Tootsie Rolls on demand.If that's not enough, the laid-back attitude might be. Heinbockel notes a new ad campaign likely to resonate well after a particularly divisive presidential election. The ad, combined with a compelling $1 joining fee in January, likely boosted first-quarter sales, he said.The new slogan? ""The world judges. We don't. At Planet Fitness, be free.""RELATEDWhich 3 New IPOs Show Superior Return On Equity?How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food

The travel period in the report covers Thursday, May 22, through Monday, May 26.Roughly 31.8 million people, 88% of travelers, will travel by car, up from 31.4 million last year. Gas prices are expected to stay the same as last year's national average of $3.63 per gallon, barring unforeseen refinery problems or international explosions.Weekend daily car rental rates will average $44, 1% more than last year.Avis Budget (CAR) shares rose 2% to 56.27 by midafternoon trading in the stock market today.Earlier this month, the rental car company reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and earnings. The company has been expanding its Zipcar offering in recent quarters, giving drivers the option of having a car for just a few hours.AAA expected lodging rates to rise 2% from a year ago for an average of $169 per night for its Three Diamond rated hotels.Hyatt Hotels (H) shares dipped 0.4% to 57.29.Last month the hotel operator reported better-than-expected Q1 revenue and profit on higher room rates and rising occupancy. The company says it expects occupancy rates to rise further as business travel heats up; and it has major expansion plans for Asia.Intercontinental Hotels (IHG), the operator of Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotels, this month reported rising revenue per available room in the U.S. and Europe.Americans are ready to board cruise ships again as worries fade from shipwrecks and electrical outages in recent years.

451,RCL,"Michael Kors (KORS) dethroned Coach in recent years as the it handbag, but how is it faring against upstart Kate Spade in the battle for affordable luxury purses and clutches?Last year Kors posted a 72% jump in shares as sales rose $2.2 billion. Kors is slated to report fourth-quarter results May 28. Analysts expect the fashion house to report a 36% jump in earnings to 68 cents per share and sales to rise 37% to $816.7 million.Over the holidays, Kors increased its market share among 18-24-year-old women. According to a Cowen Consumer Tracking Survey, among women 18 to 34 years old, 30% preferred Michael Kors to Coach (COH) in December 2013, up from 24% in November 2013 and 20% in December 2012. For women who buy two to three handbags per year, the preference for Michael Kors hit a new high of 27% in December 2013 vs. 23% in November and 16% in December 2012.Kors handbags tend to sell for $200-$350, a pricey item but less so than an even more upscale Louis Vuitton bag.Kors' stock debut on the NYSE in December 2011, but Michael Kors the designer has been turning heads on runways around the world since 1981 when he launched the Michael Kors women's wear line.Kors is a more mature brand than Kate Spade (KATE) and, like Coach, has learned, older, established brands that don't always do better.In a report last month, Citi said Kors has four times the share of the global handbag market vs. Kate.But as with Kors' leap over Coach, Kate could be the next big thing, say analysts in the Citi report.Last week, Kate reported an adjusted loss from continuing operations of 6 cents per share, up from a loss of 16 cents in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting only a 4-cent loss. But sales jumped 33.5% to $328 million, its best gain in several years, on a 54% jump in its namesake Kate Spade brand as the company sheds its underperforming brands like Juicy Couture and Lucky Brand.Kate is known for its handbags with bright colors and bold stripes. The brand also makes home accessories, an area Coach and Kors don't have a large presence in.The brutal winter and tough economic conditions for consumers hit retailers overall, but luxury brands still seemed to do well during the holidays as shoppers splurged on the it bag of the season.It's debatable if the it bag was Kors or Kate, but it definitely wasn't Coach. In April, Coach reported a 19% drop in Q3 EPS to 68 cents while revenue fell 7.4% to $1.1 billion, and its North American same-store sales fell 21% on weakness in women's bags and accessories.Still, the story isn't over quite yet for Coach. The company is under the direction of a new management team and creative director as it looks to remake itself from something old into something new.Michael Kors shares edged higher in the stock market today. Kate Spade and Coach fell less than 1%.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich.

"
455,RCL,"In May, Norwegian's 4,000-passenger Breakaway launched cruises out of New York, which helped boost the company's third-quarter net revenue nearly 20% year over year to $596 million and adjusted earnings 19% to 86 cents a share.

523,RCL,"A new face will be USA Compression Partners, a Texas-based provider of natural-gas compression services. It will also go public in LP form with its general partner remaining private. It plans to raise $200 million and trade as USAC.The IPO calendar is starting the New Year much like it ended the last one: with a lot of energy companies and financial vehicles.The one exception to the pattern is Norwegian Cruise Line, the third-largest cruise-ship operator in North America behind Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL). The company was co-founded by a Norwegian in 1966 but is based in Florida, and most of its shares are now owned by Star Cruises owner Genting Hong Kong and private equity group Apollo Global Management (APO).The cruise line's last five years of financials show slow but steady revenue growth and profitability, with only the recessionary year of 2008 recording an operating loss. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, revenue rose 2.4% from the year-earlier period, to $1.77 billion, while net income rose 30% to $167 million. The company is more than $2 billion in debt, however, and most of the roughly $400 million in proceeds will go toward paying its creditors and shareholders.The firm plans to price on Jan. 17 at $16 to $18 a share, under the ticker NCLH.Meanwhile, telecom provider Cincinnati Bell (CBB) is planning to spin off its data centers in the form of a REIT called CyrusOne. The REIT structure has gained renewed popularity in this field lately, with cellphone tower operators American Tower (AMT) converting to it a year ago and SBA Communications (SBAC) working on such a switch. CyrusOne will own some 23 data centers in the South and Midwest, drawing about $85 million in annual rent. The company plans to raise about $280 million under the ticker CONE.As IBD recently reported, energy IPOs were popular last quarter, so it's not surprising that they make up the rest of this week's list. Coal producer SunCoke Energy (SXC), which went public in July 2011, is planning an encore with its LP affiliate SunCoke Energy Partners, which will own an interest in two cokemaking facilities in Ohio. It expects to raise $270 million under the ticker SXCP. Investors might also get a sense of deja vu when CVR Refining LP starts trading as CVRR. Its parent, oil refiner CVR Energy (CVI), went public in 2007, and in 2011 it successfully spun off its nitrogen fertilizer business as CVR Partners (UAN).A new face will be USA Compression Partners, a Texas-based provider of natural-gas compression services.

590,RCL,"Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) fell 6.1% to $48.77 at the close of business on Jun 25, thus slipping to a 52-Week low of $47.33. Moreover the stock has declined 9.9% in a month against the industry’s 3.8% rise. What Caused the DownfallNorwegian Cruise stock decreased yesterday, primarily due to its competitor Carnival Corporation’s (CCL  -  Free Report) announcement of a dismal forecast. The company’s trimmed full-year earnings outlook (mainly due to rising fuel costs and currency-related headwinds) also induced a drop in the share price of another rival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report).It is important to note that the cruise industry has been grappling with unfavorable demand-supply conditions and Norwegian Cruise is no exception. Per CNBC reports, high industry supply, slackening yield growth and weakness in the Caribbean and China are causes for concern in the industry.Rising fuel prices are another headwind for the company as well as the entire industry. With fuel prices shooting up, such costs are anticipated to hurt the company’s bottom line in the second quarter of 2018. Notably, high costs have been affecting the company since the past few quarters. Total cruise operating expenses were up 7.5% in 2017. Moreover, the same rose 6.7% in the first quarter of 2018. Zacks Rank & A Key PickNorwegian Cruise carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Lindblad Expeditions Holdings Inc. (LIND  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
