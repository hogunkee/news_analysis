5,PEP,"A quiet day was due in the stock market Tuesday after three sessions in a row of strong gains.The Nasdaq was flat going into the final hour, while the S&P 500 added 0.3%. Blue chips showed more life as the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.7% after touching an all-time high earlier in the session.Volume crept higher on the NYSE but slipped on the Nasdaq.The Dow's outperformance was somewhat misleading. The Dow is a price-weighted index, which can distort results. Boeing (BA) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) are the two heaviest weightings in the Dow, and they advanced confidently Tuesday. Boeing rose 1.5%, while UnitedHealth gained 1%.In the S&P 500, PepsiCo (PEP) surged about 4% as it retook its 200-day line in fast trade. The 50-day line was reclaimed in June.Pepsi's earnings popped 7%, topping views by about 6%. Revenue came in above expectations but only narrowly so.Pepsi's image is tied to its namesake soft drink, but the company's brands include Doritos, Cheetos, Frito-Lay, Ruffles and Quaker Oats. In Q2, revenue in the snack segment grew 4%, while overall revenue growth was only 2%.Meanwhile, chip stocks of a different order did well. Chip designer Marvell Technology (MRVL) gapped up 3% in twice its usual volume. Chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) rose 1% as it tried to retake its 200-day line.Alphabet (GOOGL) tacked on small gains but was on track to extend its win streak to four up days in a row.Oil stocks showed some breakouts, but action was unsteady.

After that, they seesawed above and below the entry.Light sweet crude climbed about 1% to $74.70 per barrel and then reversed to $73.79. Crude then recovered partially, rising to $74.16.The noise around the trade war has quieted in recent sessions. Some optimism has even emerged.

6,PEP,"Hedge funds fled equities in the first quarter, with Apple (AAPL) and PepsiCo (PEP) the most-sold stocks, S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a report Wednesday.The top 10 hedge funds managed about $141 billion in equity holdings in Q1, down more than $18 billion from Q4 2015. The funds decreased the total number of stock positions held from 427 to 408, the fewest stock positions held since S&P Global Market Intelligence began tracking such data in 2014. It was the second consecutive quarter of equity sell-off by the large funds.Consumer discretionary and information technology stocks led the sell-off, with Apple ranked seeing the most selling for an individual stock last quarter. The major hedge funds sold $5.4 billion worth of Apple stock in Q1.Other top sells included PepsiCo ($1.8 billion), Amazon.com (AMZN) ($1.4 billion), Priceline (PCLN) ($1 billion) and Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA) ($1 billion).The highest volume of buying among the top hedge funds occurred in Facebook (FB) stock, with a total of $2.3 billion in buys in the first quarter, S&P said.

7,PEP,"This year's teeter-totter market has posed special challenges for all investors. The managers of $1.3 billion USAA Aggressive Growth (USAUX) are no exceptions.Over the past year going into Wednesday, the fund has outperformed 72% of its rival large-cap growth mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. by losing less than most of them. The fund has gained 4.99% in the volatile past three months, but that only tops 28% of its peers.The fund could be primed for strong performance when the stock market strengthens if the quality of its top holdings are an indication. Aggressive Growth's top 10 holdings as of March 31 included six stocks with IBD Composite Ratings of 80 or higher. The highest Comp Rating is 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating.In addition, holdings include Adobe Systems (ADBE), which sports a 92 Comp Rating.Trading around 95, Adobe is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 98.10 buy point. Volume has dried up as the handle forms, which is positive. But as IBD's Leaderboard analysis of the stock points out, Adobe's earlier breakout past an 88.65 handle entry within the base was successful, and from that point of view the stock is extended. Still, you could make a case that the right side of the base needed more work.Adobe has succeeded in morphing into a company that lets customers receive products through the cloud and pay a subscription fee.Is Adobe a buy or a sell? Take a free trial of IBD Leaderboard today to find outRevenue growth has sped over the past three quarters, from 9% to 21%, 22% and 25%. The fiscal second quarter ends this month. Wall Street currently expects earnings to rise 42% to 68 cents a share. That would extend the slowdown in EPS gains of 30%, 93%, 59% and 50% in the prior four quarters. It's still vigorous profit growth.Facebook (FB), another Leaderboard stock, is one of those top holdings. It has a 99 Composite Rating.EPS gains are accelerating, rising 16%, 33% 46% and 83% the past four quarters. The 83% earnings jump to 77 cents a share easily beat Wall Street estimates as did the 52% jump in revenue to $5.4 billion. The stock responded to the upbeat results by gapping up 7% April 28 and clearing a 117.09 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It got as high as 121 before easing to just below the buy point.Facebook has gifted investors with a big 300%-plus return since it broke out past a 29.17 buy point of a double-bottom base in the week ended July 26, 2013, as IBD pointed out recently.Electronic Arts (EA) is a top new buy, which has a 95 Comp Rating.The video game publisher delivered better-than-expected earnings and sales growth last week.Q4 EPS rose 28%. That profit got a boost from EA's growing digital sales, which made up over 70% of all fourth-quarter revenue, as IBD reported on Tuesday.Also, EA had no debt last year and a solid 32% return on equity. That, plus a 46% average annual EPS growth rate over the past five years, has attracted a rising number of funds as investors. Two typically better-performing funds own shares in Electronic Arts: $12 billion Fidelity OTC (FOCPX) and $12 billion MFS Growth (MFEGX).Among other holdings, Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) has a 99 Comp Rating and is up 16% so far this year.The maker of orthopedic and dental reconstruction implants, trauma products and related surgical products has seen EPS rise in each of the past four quarters, climbing from -2% to 30% in that span. Revenue grew 59%, 58% and 68% in the past three stanzas. The company beat consensus estimates for both EPS and revenue in Q1.The company was born from last year's $14 billion merger of Zimmer Holdings and Biomet. That created a global leader in musculoskeletal health care, which does business in more than 100 countries, IBD recently reported.Last month, Zimmer said it would take over Cayenne Medical to strengthen its sports medicine offerings.Trading near 117, the stock is within 1% of the 117.87 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base.The portfolio is run by two separate subadvisors. Winslow Capital and Wellington Management each manage about 50% of the fund. When one side's outperformance skews the split by too much, USAA rebalances by funneling inflow into the lagging portion. It also takes any shareholder redemptions from the larger portion.Winslow's Clark Winslow, Patrick Burton and Justin Kelly are somewhat more aggressive in their style, says USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the subadvisors. Wellington's manager is Paul Marrkand. ""Wellington is more conscious of valuation,"" Latif said.The subadvisors' sleeves share many names. ""But Winslow has more FANG stocks,"" said USAA analyst Julius Barnes, referring to 2015 high-flyers Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, now Alphabet (GOOGL).As of Jan. 31, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Starbucks (SBUX) were in the Winslow sleeve only.Going into Thursday, UnitedHealth was up about 11% for the year. It had an 86 Comp Rating but a weak D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks. Starbucks was down about 9% for the year. It has a so-so 70 Comp Rating and worst-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.Oracle (ORCL) and PepsiCo (PEP) were two names in Wellington's sleeve only.Oracle was up 8%, but has a weak 55 Composite Rating and a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating. EPS fell the past four quarters and were flat in the two frames before that.Pepsi was up less than 1%, with a 59 Composite Rating and E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.""When we have a high-growth, bullish market, Winslow does better,"" Latif said. ""The opposite happens when the market is not led by growth and is challenged."" Wellington's sleeve has outperformed Winslow's so far this year, Latif says.

The stock was trading nearly 6% higher.Among IBD 50 stocks, 35 were higher and 15 were lower in the stock market today.

Revenue fell 3%. The stock is just above a 103.54 buy point.

9,PEP,"Coca-Cola (KO) earnings and sales fell less than feared in the first quarter, but sluggish soda and other products' shipment volume hit shares as investors hoped that the global giant would continue momentum.Earnings per share minus one-time items for the world's largest soft drinks maker fell 6% to 45 cents on a 3.5% revenue decline to $10.33 billion. Wall Street was looking for 44 cents EPS and $10.29 billion revenue.But beverage volume rose 2%, vs. 3% in the second half of 2015. Organic sales growth slowed to 2%. Soda volume was flat after rising throughout 2015. Noncarbonated beverage volumes rose 7%.Coca-Cola shares closed down 4.8% to 44.37 in the stock market today, plunging below its 50-day moving average. Investor expectations had been running high, especially for a company with declining top and bottom lines.Coke stock rose above a flat base with a 44.01 buy point on Feb. 22 and climbed as high as 47.13 on April 11 before consolidating.IBD's Take: Does Coca-Cola stock still have fizz, and how does it compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupCoke said that the number of cases shipped in Europe fell 1% in Q1 vs. a year earlier, but it rose 2% in North America and 1% in Latin America. Growth was flat in Eurasia and Africa.Currency fluctuations resulted in a 10 point headwind on comparable operating income and a 12 point headwind on EPS in the quarter. Like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), IBM (IBM) and other U.S. multinationals, Coca-Cola sees a smaller currency headwind going forward as the dollar weakens.Coca-Cola still sees organic, currency-neutral revenue growth of 4%-5% this year. PepsiCo (PEP) on Monday topped Q1 earnings views on improved productivity gains and lower costs, joining other packaged-food companies that managed earnings gains despite weaker revenue.  Pepsi reported a 7% rise in EPS  to 89 cents a share, topping forecasts by eight cents. Revenue declined 3% to $11.86 billion, lighter than the $11.88 billion estimates.Pepsi fell 1.3% intraday Wednesday. Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) fell 1.5% intraday. Dr Pepper reports quarterly results on April 27.

10,PEP,"The dollar has been the not-so-jolly green giant for corporate America since mid-2014, cutting top- and bottom-line growth. But with the buck retreating, the negative impact for IBM (IBM) and other U.S. multinationals faded in Q1 results, with even more improvement expected going forward.The U.S. dollar index fell Tuesday to its lowest levels since last August's flash market crash. That continued a downtrend this year after a huge run from mid-2014 to late last year. S&P 500 companies with heavy overseas exposure already are seeing smaller FX losses and raising full-year guidance on currency trends.""About 50% of (Johnson & Johnson's) sales come from overseas,"" said Lindsey Bell, senior analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""That’s an encouraging sign.""The dollar index shot up 25% from June 2014 to November 2015. That made U.S. exports less competitive, while reducing the dollar value of overseas income and revenue.The strong buck also contributed to the huge sell-off in dollar-priced commodities, with crude oil falling as much as 75%, hurting energy companies and emerging markets, both of which hurt the industrial sector.The dollar rose in large part because the Federal Reserve was moving toward raising rates, which it finally did last December, while other central banks eased policy. But the Fed has turned more dovish this year amid sluggish economic growth and financial turmoil earlier this year. The Fed now indicates just two rate hikes this year, down from four previously, with markets seeing just one tightening step, perhaps not until September.Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank pushed ahead with negative rate policies, but their currencies unexpectedly rallied on those moves.  Also, China's yuan recovered its early 2016 losses vs. the dollar.""The dollar index was up 14% (year over year) as of August 2015,"" said Robert Keiser, vice president at S&P Global Market Intelligence.The dollar is now down about 4% vs. a year earlier, suggesting that the FX impact will continue to fade or even start to turn positive. The weaker dollar also has helped U.S. crude prices rise back above $40 a barrel from the mid-$20s in January.A slew of corporate giants with huge international exposure likely will report less of a dollar impact in the next week or so. General Motors (GM) and Alphabet (GOOGL) report on Thursday, with McDonald's (MCD) and General Electric (GE) on Friday.  Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) are on tap next week.But ""less bad"" isn't quite the same as good. Apple is expected to post a rare sales decline. Overall S&P 500 Q1 earnings likely fell 7.6% while sales dipped 1.3%, according to analysts polled  by Thomson Reuters. Excluding energy, earnings are forecast to slip 2.3% with revenue up 1.7%.

11,PEP,"CHICAGO — It seems there are few business realms where Amazon.com (AMZN) hasn't become a major player, and now the e-commerce giant is even venturing into the world of candy and snacks.Companies at the Sweets & Snacks Expo in Chicago this past week say that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rise of Amazon is likely to create both opportunities and challenges for food product manufacturers. Overall, though, it should be a net positive, especially benefiting niche and regional players.In the past 12 months ending in April, Amazon racked up about $518 million in sales of sweets and snacks. Sales in the category climbed 22% in just the past six months, said Mike Black, global vice president of marketing for e-commerce analytics firm Profitero.""Consumers can count on something almost always being available,"" Black said. ""Amazon is creating the endless shelf.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmazon fulfills two-thirds of snack-product orders made through its site, with one-third coming from third-party sellers on the marketplace.Shoppers have been trained to think of Amazon as the place to find an enormous selection, Black said.That has brought new challenges for companies to make their products stand out through keywords and engaging content, including photos and video, he said.Today only 3% of packaged grocery sales are done online, but it's growing rapidly, Black said.One way Amazon has helped the top brands is through its Amazon Dash program, which allows customers to instantly reorder their favorite products with the touch of a button. It has buttons for Doritos and Lay's chips from PepsiCo (PEP)-unit Frito-Lay and candy bars from Hershey (HSY), among others.Amazon's ""endless shelf"" also is a boon for regional candy and snack brands to serve customers who have moved and can no longer get those products at their local retail stores.""It is a tremendous opportunity, especially for regional companies as they look to broaden their distribution,"" said Christopher Gindlesperger, vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, which sponsors the Sweets & Snacks Expo.Amazon also is a boon for startups and makers of niche products.""It's been amazing for us,"" said Michael Goldstein, a representative of Clever Cookie of Hauppauge, N.Y. Clever Cookie's Shrewd Food brand started selling protein crisps on Amazon about six months ago and sales took off, he said.""There are products out there that are healthy and high protein, but no one is making anything that provides the nutrients that tastes this good,"" he said.The Shrewd Food protein crisps come in such flavors as baked cheddar and brick-oven pizza. Plus, they have sriracha cheddar, smokehouse maple, and cookies and cream.The company also sells its crisps in Costco (COST) stores in the Northeastern U.S.But the e-commerce giant also is increasingly a competitor with its private-label brand Wickedly Prime. It currently sells Wickedly Prime chips and crisps, granola and nutrition bars, snack nuts and seeds. There's also popcorn, puffed snacks, seaweed snacks, and snack and trail mixes.Still, the growth in e-commerce sales can't be ignored.""We're seeing double-digit growth in both snacking and treating,"" said Sally Lyons Wyatt, executive vice president and practice leader at marketing consulting firm IRI.In the past year, online sales of popcorn are up 68%. Non-chocolate candy up 61% and salty snacks are up 46%, she said. Categories seeing over 30% growth include chocolate candy, gum and dried meat snacks.RELATED:Trump Personally Lobbied Postmaster To Hike Amazon's Rates: ReportAmazon Stock Touches Record High After Obliterating Earnings ViewsAmazon Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart Analysis

13,PEP,"Blue chips overcame resistance at a key line with an hour of trade left in Monday's session. The U.S. stock indexes were on track for their third straight gain.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.4%, becoming the last of the major indexes to cross above its 50-day line. The line had been acting as resistance for more than two weeks and could now become support.The 50-day line often acts as a test area. When either a stock or an index trade above the line, the 50-day can act as a test for support. When the price is below the line, the 50-day can act as resistance.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 0.8%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.7%. The small cap Russell 2000 lagged with a 0.6% pop.Volume rose on both major exchanges compared to the same time Friday.In the blue chip Dow, Caterpillar (CAT) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) advanced 4% and 3% respectively.Caterpillar had fallen as much as 23% off its high since mid-January. The decline was blamed on President Trump's protectionist stance, which now has progressed to a trade war with China.Yet, Caterpillar was doing fine Monday afternoon. Some market watchers still regard Trump's moves as negotiating tactics rather than actions of conviction. If so, then stocks may be ready for a substantial relief rally.Earnings season, too, holds the potential to drive stock prices higher.

17,PEP,"Stocks came under selling pressure early yesterday morning as expected, but then did a complete 180 degree turn around closing mostly higher with the Dow up triple digits, piercing the psychologically important 18k level while the S&P surged 13 pts ending the day right on the highs as the rally that people love to hate moves on. Pressure on oil prices worked against stocks in the first moments of trading but investors/traders and the big banks ended up ignoring the news out of Doha in a move that surprised many.Mkts around the world are all celebrating today...taking their cue from the turnaround in US equities....US futures are rocketing higher - currently up 11 pts as we kiss the psychological 2100 level.....but as my friend Scott Redler (@RedDogT3) tells me on twitter this morning""The first kiss us usually meets some opposition, then the romance gets you around the bases"" - to which I say - Yes, but it is the first kiss that is the sweetest which makes you want to go back for more.....and more is what it looks like we are gonna get today.....Remember - the mkt is a discounting mechanism....it is looking 4 - 6 months out....the trading today is not about today.....(Just sayin.....) - it is really about what the mkts expect in the fall......and by the looks of it - the mkt is expecting great things...Asian mkts were all higher overnight - Japan which got clobbered on Monday - snapped back and regained 100% of Monday's losses.....as we saw the Yen weaken a bit....a stabilizing oil mkt is also helping to support mkts today....After yesterday's mkt action - it appears that investors are disconnecting from the whims of the oil mkt....at least for now and concentrating on earnings.....European mkts are also enjoying an explosive rally....because why? Earnings and oil......and the sense is that maybe - the whole Mid-East OPEC summit was all hype.....to confuse the conversation.....interesting that the possibility of increased production has caused oil to stabilize and rally a bit from the Monday lows.....Does it feel like something else is going on? FTSE +0.56%, CAC 40 + 1.21%, DAX + 2.22%, EUROSTOXX +1.58%, SPAIN +0.88% and ITALY + 0.57%.Now just a thought or two about yesterday.....and the role that the Deputy Crown Prince is now playing......Look the big story was OIL and POLITICS – Mid East politics – and after two months of all the hype about this pending agreement in a production freeze – traders and the mkts had to deal with the fact that there was no deal – which now sets up the oil mkt for a possible 'free for all'….Keep your eyes on Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – for he is now the name to know – for it was this 30 yr old son of King Salman who has now turned over the apple cart and merged the commercial considerations of the kingdom with his political stance – a move that is in complete contrast to what was existing policy.......You see for the past 20 yrs – Ali Al-Naimi – the current Saudi oil minister has kept those two issues on separate pages – keeping supply and pricing as the main drivers of any production decisions, always cooperating with the other members – including Iran – no matter what their politics were – in the past to cut production to boost oil prices. The Deputy Crown Prince is not sure he agrees with this policy and so while all the talk has been about how the Saudi's were cooperating with Russia, Venezuela and Qatar – Iran was still the thorn in Prince Mohammed's side….so in a bid to establish himself as an emerging 'force' - as the potential heir to the throne - he nixed the oil deal sending oil mkts into a tailspin on Sunday night/Monday.What is important to understand is that the deputy Crown Prince has now burst onto the global stage since his father became King last year and appears to have every intention of letting the world know. He was appointed the Defense Minister – and is the one responsible for launching the latest military campaign in Yemen while also chairing the country's 'economic planning body' and the council that controls the massive 'state owned' oil company. In a telling interview last week with Bloomberg – the Prince was very clear –""We don't care about oil prices, $30 or $70, they are the same to us. We have our own programs that don't need high oil prices.""This is not how the rest of the OPEC and non OPEC members feel at all – so by nixing any deal he has protected the Saudi's mkt share, and has secured their role as a 'leader' while at the same time laying the groundwork for continued political instability in the region.OK - back to the mkts.....After the initial concerns over these recent developments – the focus returned to US earnings…the day started off with better numbers from Pepsico (PEP), Hasbro (HAS), JB Hunt (JBHT) and in a another surprise move – we learned that Morgan Stanley (MS) – while reporting horrible numbers did in fact ""beat all the estimates."" Net Income FELL 54%, Equity trading revenues FELL 34%, Fixed Income trading revenues FELL 52% and Investment Banking Revenues FELL 15% - but yet they somehow managed to beat the 'much lower' EPS expectation….so all this means is that we must watch out for Goldman Sachs (GS) report this morning.....Analysts expect EPS of $2.48......Now remember – Uncle Lloyd pre-announced this 're-structuring' plan late on Friday – so investors/traders have been prepped about all the bad news and how he has dealt with it head on…. – and like Cousin Jamie (Dimon) of JP Morgan (JPM)– Uncle Lloyd knows how to 'massage' the street analysts – so what I expect to hear this morning is a 'BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF EPS' beat to rival even the most generous estimate….and the clock ticks towards 7:30 am......In other news - United Health (UNH) just reported a better number - $1.81 vs. exp of $1.72, Philip Morris (PM) on the other hand missed - $0.98 vs. exp of $1.10.....

19,PEP,"PepsiCo's (PEP) improved productivity gains and reduced operating costs helped boost first-quarter profits, joining other packaged-food companies managing to carve out strong earnings amid weaker revenue.Excluding items, Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo earned 89 cents a share for the three-month period ended March 19, up 7.2% from a year earlier and 8 cents better than estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Revenue fell 3% to $11.86 billion, missing estimates of $11.88 billion. It was the company's sixth consecutive quarter of overall revenue decline. Weaker foreign currencies cut 4.5 percentage points off PepsiCo revenue.Revenue in PepsiCo's Frito-Lay North America unit rose 3%, but fell 3% in its Quaker Foods North America subsidiary. Beverage sales in North America inched upward by 1.5%, but plunged 26% in Latin America and slid 9% in Europe and sub-Saharan Africa.PepsiCo reaffirmed full-year EPS guidance of $4.66, 4 cents below current estimates. PepsiCo stock closed virtually unchanged, dipping 5 cents or less than 0.1%, on the stock market today.Kraft Heinz (KHC) earned 62 cents on $7.1 billion in sales in Q4, beating estimates. The company has announced more than 5,000 jobs cuts and the closure of more than five plants in a plan to cut $1.5 billion in annual expenses by the end of next year.ConAgra Foods (CAG) reported a 25% revenue decline during its fiscal Q3, while its quarterly profit fell 3.4%. Earlier this year, the company sold its private label business to TreeHouse Foods (THS) for $2.7 billion. It had previously bought the unit for $5 billion about three years earlier. It has announced plans to cut annual costs by $3 billion, in part by laying off 1,500 employees.General Mills (GIS) saw an 8% drop in revenue during its fiscal Q3. Its profit slumped 7.1%. The company has moved to cut costs, shutting down factories and eliminating jobs. Its divestiture last year of its Green Giant unit cut sales growth by 3 percentage points. Foreign currency issues adversely impacted revenue growth by 4 points.Meanwhile, PepsiCo rival Coca-Cola (KO) will announce Q1 results on Wednesday before markets open. The Atlanta-based company is expected to report earnings of 44 cents a share, down 8.3% from a year earlier. Revenue is expected to fall 4% to $10.3 billion.Image provided by Shutterstock.

20,PEP,"So yesterday at about 3 pm EST the news hit the tape, the twitter sphere and the media outlets.....Headlines screamed:***BREAKING NEWS – SUNDAY APRIL 17, 2016 - ***Failure In Qatar - OPEC ministers unable to come to an agreement - oil mkts began to tremble - investors/traders now had to re-assess the reality of a fractured oil mkt......Oil which has rallied 18% from the early April lows and 30% off of the January lows and are now front and center as Asian mkts prepared to open - initial reactions saw oil plunge 6% as investors hit the sell button first only to ask questions later.....the headlines saturated the web.....who would be first to announce this failure and then the resulting mkt action? The headlines began...""Doha Summit Fails to Agree on Output Freeze""""Oil Freeze Talks End in Failure Amid Saud Demands Over Iran""""Oil Tumbles 5% on Doha Deal Disappointment""""Asia Stocks at Mercy of Post Doha Oil Moves""""Oil's Grand Bargain Falls Victim to Saudi Arabia's Iran Fixation""Futures around the globe plunged as day turned to night and the sun began to set in the US just as it began to rise across Asia….US futures were down 11 pts at 8 pm Sunday evening – while futures across Asia pointed in a similar direction as investors dealt with the fallout. News stories began detailing the talks that took place in Doha – the Qatari capital – which dragged on and on – going some 10 hrs past the original scheduled end time – as ""Howie Mandel"" shouted out –No Deal!Oil ministers from 16 nations, representing 50% of the world's production, gathered in the Qatari capital as they worked towards stabilizing the global mkt with artificial production quotas - the first real attempt at coordinating output among OPEC members and nations outside of the group since 2001. The barriers were numerous - would everyone fall into line? Would Iran come to the table? Could they really commit to restraining production? As we know - the Saudi's made it very clear from the beginning......they wouldn't restrain their production without commitments from other major producers including Iran, which had already made it clear that they had no such intention.The breaking story about a failure to agree on output or production quotas among the world's biggest oil producers now opens the flood gates to what many now expect to be a new retreat in oil prices.""Discussions stumbled after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations wouldn't agree to any deal unless all OPEC members joined including Iran, which wasn't present at the meeting…""Angus Nicholson – an analyst at IG Ltd in Melbourne, Australia had this to say:""The market has been so heavily positioned for a deal to go through, The change of tone from the Saudis, particularly driven over the last few weeks by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been quite a surprise to the market. With Saudi Arabia fighting proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Syria/Iraq, it is understandable that they had little inclination to freeze their own production and make way for newly sanctions-free Iran to increase their market share.""So then what happened? Was there really a change in tone from the Saudi's? Did investors get this all wrong? Once the idea of a freeze was floated (two months ago) – trader types started buying up oil – as it was assumed that any freeze would trim supply just as summer was about to begin and the driving season was about to take off… Oil rallied 30% off the lows as the excitement built…..but hey, buyer beware – remember it was the news sources that reported this ‘cease fire' all while the Saudi's and the Russians never really confirmed or denied the story - they let it play out in the media - they never explicitly committed. ….It all sounded good – but it did require that all members fall into line and Iran had said from the very beginning that they had no intention of ‘playing nice in the sandbox'.Overnight oil suffered a bit - with Brent down 4% and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) down about 4.5% - makes some sense - but equity mkts did NOT follow suit and implode the way many thought they might.....In fact - we have to ask: Is a ‘No-Deal' actually better for the mkts in the long run as it allows for supply and demand to find its ‘natural' level of equilibrium vs. ‘artificial production controls' which will only put off the inevitable? ( I mean look - we all know what artificial controls can do to mkts - think massive QE programs instituted by every central bank)As Asian mkts opened – the pressure came to bear - mkts sold off - but not to the extent that many were prepared for.....…..Japan was the outlier - falling some 3+% - but this had more to do with the major series of earthquakes in the past 3 days – vs. the oil story.... South Korea (Kospi) moved 0.28% lower, Australia stumbled by 0.4%, Hong Kong lost 0.9% and China was off 1.43% by the end of the day.As the sun sets on Asia it rises in Europe and as the clock ticked – European mkts were the next to react.....they too are under a bit of pressure – taking their cue from investor angst in Asia - but again - equities are not getting clobbered by any stretch.......Currently Brent North Sea Crude oil is off by 2% while WTI (West Texas Intermediate) is down by nearly 3% trading at $39/barrel. FTSE - 0.07%, CAC 40 - 0.04%, DAX +0.06%, EUROSTOXX - 0.18%, SPAIN -0.35% and ITALY +0.11%.US futures which were down 11 pts Sunday evening have recovered a bit from the initial ‘knee jerk' reaction trading last night – currently they are lower by 7 pts as the reality of this OPEC decision permeates the psyche. Since the equity mkts did not implode on this news (as many had expected) – we need to ask: Are investors trying to separate action in the oil/energy space from the rest of the mkt. Now while energy names will get hit today – think transports and manufacturers as beneficiaries of lower oil prices.Earnings will continue to ramp up this week as we enter the thick of it. Last week- the message was all about the banks….now while we saw trading revenues decrease and loan loss reserves increase and most reports miss revenue estimates - they all managed to beat the on the bottom line. Uncle Lloyd (Blankfein) released a strategic restructuring plan ahead of his earnings this week - Headlines read:""Goldman's Blankfein Demands Deepest Cost Cuts in Years"" -on the chopping block? Travel limits, Entertainment, deferring projects and Layoffs as he""has already adjusted his workforce, relying more on JUNIOR bankers, moving support staff to cheaper locations and investing in technology to improve productivity""(Junior bankers? I mean if you want a Jr banker there are so many other places to go - You don't go to GS for a Jr. Banker)The stock rallied on this news taking it to its down trending 100 dma at $163.... earnings are due tomorrow...so the clock is ticking....did he do a good enough job of acknowledging the disastrous industry environment for the sake of investors?Earnings today include Morgan Stanley (MS) - they beat the estimate - reported 0.55 cts/sh vs. exp 0.46 cts/sh, Pepsico (PEP) - beat reporting 0.89 cts/sh vs. the 0.81 cts/sh expected. HASBRO (HAS)toys also beat 0.38 vs. 0.23 cts/sh.....later in the week we will hear from American Express (AXP), McDonald's (MCD), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Cocoa Cola (KO) and Microsoft (MSFT)There is not major economic data points today..so the chatter will be about earnings and oil.....and the 3 FED speakers today....Dudley at 8:30 am, Kashkari at 12:30 pm and Rosengren at 7 pm....Take Good Care

25,PEP,"Who doesn't appreciate a company that not only pays a dividend but has a history of consistently raising the payout each year?Those are the types of stocks in which Tuesday's ETF picks aim to invest.XVanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), which tracks the Nasdaq Dividend Achievers Select Index, counts among its holdings highly profitable companies that have increased their dividend for at least 10 years in a row.Top holdings as of May 31 included Microsoft (MSFT), PepsiCo (PEP), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and 3M (MMM), according to Morningstar Inc. Microsoft didn't start paying dividends until 2010, but has boosted its payout each year since. The other three companies are all members of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have increased their dividend payout for at least 25 straight years.While dividend stocks are often thought of as slow gainers, these four have all outpaced the S&P 500's 8% year-to-date return. Microsoft is up 13% through July 10, PepsiCo 9% and J&J 14%. 3M has rallied 18%.VIG is testing its 50-day moving average line and could set up a buy opportunity on a solid rebound. It offers an annualized yield of nearly 2.1%, slightly ahead of the S&P 500's average 1.9% payout. The $24.5 billion fund has a 10-year average annual return of 7.3%, in line with the S&P 500's 7%.

27,PEP,"The candy and snack food industries are doing well right now, based on statistics released Tuesday at the Sweets and Snacks Expo. But you wouldn't know that from the share prices of publicly traded companies in the sector.""Consumer staples in general are extremely out of favor,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. ""Consumer staples have significantly underperformed the broader market.""IBD's confectionery industry group ranks near the bottom of 197 industry groups. It includes just four stocks: Mondelez International (MDLZ), Hershey (HSY), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR) and Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF).Many makers of sweets and snacks are in IBD's packaged-food industry group, which ranks No. 161. It includes 29 stocks, among them Nestle (NSRGY), PepsiCo (PEP), General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), ConAgra Brands (CAG) and Hostess Brands (TWNK).Investors started rotating out of food stocks in mid-2016 in anticipation of rising interest rates, Weissman said.Amazon's (AMZN) acquisition of Whole Foods Market, announced in June 2017, added to the worries, she said.The Amazon-Whole Foods merger, completed in August 2017, led to large grocery sellers like Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) gaining more negotiating power with manufacturers, she said. That's made it harder for food makers to pass on cost increases, such as rising grain and cocoa prices.Another factor hitting major candy and snack makers has been the rise of store brands. They include Kirkland Signature at Costco Wholesale (COST), Member's Mark at Walmart-owned Sam's Club and Wickedly Prime at Amazon.To combat these private-label products, the major candy and snack companies are focusing on product innovation to attract consumers. They're using new ingredients, different combinations, bold flavors and novel textures to entice customers.Many of these new products were on display at the annual Sweets and Snacks Expo, which ran Tuesday through Thursday in Chicago. The show had about 900 exhibiting companies and was expected to attract about 18,000 attendees.This year's Sweets and Snacks Expo is the biggest yet in terms of number of exhibitors and attendees, said Christopher Gindlesperger, vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, which sponsors the show.Product trends among candy makers at this year's show include greater use of coconut and caramel in products, Gindlesperger said.Cocoa and chocolate producer Barry Callebaut is promoting its new ruby chocolate at the trade show. Introduced last September, it is the fourth type of chocolate after milk, dark and white. Made from the ruby cocoa bean, the pink chocolate has a ""berry-fruitness and luscious smoothness,"" the Swiss firm said in a press release.Candy sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $25.3 billion in 2018, up from $24.9 billion in 2017, marketing and consulting firm IRI said at the show.Snack sales are seen hitting $42.5 billion in 2018, up from $41.1 billion in 2017.""Consumers are still snacking,"" said Sally Lyons-Wyatt, executive vice president at IRI. ""On average consumers are snacking over 2.5 times a day. Younger consumers actually snack more than that.""Top growing categories in snacks include protein, fiber and energy snacks, she said. Consumers are also shifting more to crisps not made from potato or corn, she said. Consumers enjoy variety and are trying chips made from chickpeas, lentils, quinoa and other ingredients.Food companies are targeting millennials by offering products in smaller portion sizes suitable for snacking.""It seems like almost anything can be a snack right now,"" Edward Jones' Weissman said. ""You change the portion size and suddenly it's a snack. Everybody is focused on snacks. Yogurt went from breakfast to a snack. It's a much more crowded marketplace.""RELATED:Amazon Widens Its Influence Even More And Takes A Bite Out Of SnacksCampbell, Hershey, Humana Lead Frenzy Of Year-End M&A Activity

28,PEP,"Consumer staples have been slumping lately, and key exchange traded funds tracking the sector are down from 6% to 13% this year, through Tuesday's close.So what's the culprit? One of the key reasons: higher interest rates. The 10-year Treasury is now yielding about 3.08%, up sharply from around 2.4% at the beginning of the year. That makes bonds more attractive than dividends.Consumer staples stocks are considered a defensive play because people need these products no matter how the economy is doing, and the companies often offer steady dividends. When bond yields are low, dividend stocks look more compelling. But when bond yields rise, dividend stocks can look less attractive.Add to the sector's woes are a stronger dollar and weaker emerging-markets currencies, where consumer staples giants like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL) generate a sizable percentage of sales.

31,PEP,"After a stunning 2017 during which the stock market pretty much went straight up, the last six weeks have been an unkind reminder that volatility is a natural part of the market, which can cause investors a lot of anxiety.If you're re-evaluating your risk tolerance and looking for investments to help you sleep better at night, you might want to look at low volatility ETFs, a group of funds that seek to offer a smoother ride during choppy waters.People buy these funds for risk mitigation when the market falls, by providing downside protection. Your losses should be much less than the broader market's during a decline. But of course, in return for less risk, you give up some profits when the market rallies.Since its May 2011 inception, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) has outperformed the S&P 500 in each of its 20 largest weekly declines — including the February correction, according to the company.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe $7.1 billion fund seeks to capture 75% of the upside and fall only 45% on the downside over market cycles. Not day-to-day, or week-to-week, but over a three- to five-year time horizon, says Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares by Invesco.The fund does this by investing in the least risky stocks in the S&P 500. It holds the 100 stocks with the lowest volatility over the past year and rebalances every quarter. The biggest sector weights in the portfolio include 22% in utilities, 20% in financials and 17% in industrials. Among its top holdings: Coca-Cola (KO), PepsiCo (PEP) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). Last year, SPLV returned 17.3% vs. the S&P 500's 21.8%. On a five-year annualized basis, the fund returned 11.9% vs. the S&P 500's 14.3%, according to Morningstar Inc. The ETF charges a 0.25% expense ratio.""We get the best of low volatility by examining it on the Sharpe ratio basis. What is my return, per my unit of risk that I'm taking?"" said Kalivas. ""If you're an investor who wants equity return without great volatility, that is essentially where the low volatility strategy will shine.""For people who want a little more risk and closer tracking of the S&P 500, PowerShares S&P 500 Quality Portfolio (SPHQ) seeks to capture 97% of the upside of the index and 75% of the downside. It holds what it considers the 100 highest quality stocks in the benchmark. These stocks have the strongest balance sheets, highest return on equity, and lowest leverage determined by debt to equity. The $1.4 billion fund rates them according to those traits and rebalances twice a year.""The idea is to pick stocks that can weather difficult economic times,"" said Kalivas. ""Like the low volatility fund, it will lag when the market rises a lot and outperform when it falls.""SPHQ's portfolio contains 24% in information technology, 23% in industrials, 15% in health care and 14% in consumer staples. Top holdings include Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and Boeing (BA). It earned 19.1% last year and a five-year annualized return of 14.3%. The expense ratio is 0.29%.""We like both of them in terms of reducing risk,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research. ""They go about it in different manners. SPHQ has no exposure to utilities and greater exposure to more economically sensitive sectors.""""These products haven't been tested in a severe market downturn like 2008,"" said Alex Bryan, Morningstar's director of passive strategies research, North America. ""While the downside capture has been pretty low, around 50%, I wouldn't expect that to always be the case in a more severe downturn.""Bryan says he likes iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL) because it takes a sector-relative approach to stock selection and is cheaper at 0.15%. The $4.6 billion fund eliminates unintended sector bias or bets on certain sectors, he says, ""(and) I like it because it hasn't changed its benchmark as many times as the PowerShares ETF has changed its benchmark."" QUAL posted a 22.3% return last year and a three-year annualized return of 12.8%.For low volatility, Bryan recommends iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV). He said it uses a more complex methodology, as well as a holistic approach to construct the least volatile portfolio possible under a certain set of constraints for the sector weightings. The $14.6 billion fund's biggest sector weights include 21% in information technology, 17% in health care, and 13% in consumer staples. It returned 18.91% last year and a five-year annualized return of 13%. USMV carries a 0.15% expense ratio.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Blockchain Expands Beyond Bitcoin To Amazon, Nvidia, AlibabaIs Your Portfolio Ready To Handle Increased Market Volatility?Which Sectors Does Market Pro Expect To Outperform This Year?

33,PEP,"A good attitude propels pros. Try these upbeat moves to lift your mood:Find focus. Toiling for a paycheck is short-sighted. Better to work for a purpose.“I always carry a goal card,” said Peggy McColl, co-author with Brian Proctor of “Darn Easy: Work Half as Hard, Earn Twice as Much, While Living the Life of Your Dreams.”A solid objective is less about what you want, and more about whom you strive to become.“Find something that’s meaningful,” McColl told IBD.Write it down and keep it handy.Take steps. Hesitators complain that it’s hard to get started.McColl’s advice: “Stop saying it’s hard.”The statement prevents forward motion.“Just get started,” McColl said. “You don’t have to see the whole staircase. You just have to take the first step.”Flip it. Perspective matters. If a task seems annoying, find the upside.“If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change,” McColl said.Take on tasks. Go the distance and do the grunt work.“Do the things unsuccessful people don’t want to do,” McColl said.Winners keep moving.“It’s about momentum,” McColl said. “It’s like Einstein said: Energy is everything.”Say thanks. Naming things you’re grateful for is a mood booster.“The Thriver’s Edge” author Donna Stoneham recommends collecting those notions.“Every time someone in your family has something good happen, write it down on a piece of paper and put it in the gratitude jar,” she said.Once a month, read the happy missives.Tune in. “Practice being present with those around you. Really be there,” Stoneham said. “Listen to them without any agenda except being fully present.”Ten minutes of practice builds attentiveness muscle.Act decisively. Purpose can get lost in the hustle and bustle.“Whatever your reasons are for doing what you do, take one action each day that helps you feel renewed and recommitted to your passion, purpose and mission,” Stoneham said.Be nice. “Every day, practice delivering one act of kindness and notice how that makes you feel,” Stoneham said.Pay a stranger’s road toll or buy a colleague a cup of coffee.See if that small act gives you a lift.Recognize strain. “The Happiness Track” author Emma Seppala noticed a negative vibe at a Silicon Valley company event.“I could feel the pain in the room,” she said.She cautioned company leaders that constant striving in a competitive environment wears pros down.“You don’t have to work yourself into the ground and burn the candle at both ends to be successful,” she said.Pros pay attention to energy level.“We can build our own internal resilience without burning out,” Seppala said.Replenish. Deep breathing is one way to refresh.“It’s the simplest, most efficient and quickest way to calm down our nervous system,” Seppala said.Her technique, in short: “Slow down the breath, deepen the inhale and lengthen the exhale.”Gaze. During idle moments, put down the smartphone and embrace a chance to daydream. Enter “that space we used to be in as children,” Seppala said.When you’re away from the office, don’t check in.“Employees who completely disengage from work come back more creative,” she said.Find balance. Seppala advises company leaders to prioritize developing a supportive company culture: “If we respect human needs, we will have a more productive workforce.”

34,PEP,"Shoot for the stars. They’re closer than you think. Trajectory-setting advice:Seize today. “This is the most exciting time that I’ve been in business,” said “Moonshot!” author John Sculley.The former PepsiCo (PEP) and Apple (AAPL) CEO sees possibilities -- not just for developing innovative products or services, but also for launching billion-dollar businesses.It starts with a moonshot. The term refers to advances that reset the status quo, such as how the personal computer and smartphone changed the way we work and live.Grab advances. The sophisticated tools available to today’s entrepreneurs make big leaps possible.“We live in an era of exponential growth of not just one technology but several technologies,” Sculley told IBD.Advances in cloud computing, mobile devices and wireless sensors make breakthrough solutions possible.“At the same time, these technologies are rapidly being commoditized,” Sculley said.The price to store a terabyte of data used to be in the thousands.“Now it costs $4,” he said. “The cost of these technologies is just plummeting.”Dream big. Savvy entrepreneurs can tap these tools to create transformational -- not traditional -- businesses.“You start with a noble cause -- something that excites you,” Sculley said.That cause becomes a transformational business when leaders attack a big problem and “solve it in a much better way than anyone has ever done before,” he said.Take a lead. Artemis Networks founder Steve Perlman’s noble cause: taking on the wireless communication industry with technology that eliminates cell towers.Biotechnology billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong is leading a Cancer MoonShot 2020 coalition that aims to treat childhood cancer.Both are sector geniuses taking on giant problems.“But for the rest of us, there is the possibility of becoming adaptive innovators who want to make a difference in our own smaller universes, embracing a noble cause as a powerful driving force,” Sculley said.Reach carefully. Missteps can occur out on that limb. Take care, but keep inching forward.“What happens when failure isn’t accepted? Many highly talented people refuse to take further risks,” Sculley said.Experimenters make sure someone’s watching their back.“As a risk taker, if you want to limit risk, one of the best ways is to have another set of trusted eyes,” he said. “The mentor’s biggest role is to be just that.”Use your individuality. “Entrepreneurs are not interchangeable, like batteries or light bulbs; the best opportunity for you is unique to you.”So says “Unleash Your Inner Company” author John Chisholm. The 30-year Silicon Valley serial entrepreneur is CEO of John Chisholm Ventures, a consulting, angel investing and mentoring firm.Over the years, he’s advised hundreds of bootstrappers. The successful ones start by matching what they love doing with a willingness to work tirelessly.“Passion without perseverance is a fleeting fancy; perseverance without passion is drudgery,” Chisholm wrote.Pinpoint it. ""Start with your strength"" is common business advice. Chisholm suggests focusing on a consumer need -- the gap between a preferred state and the current state -- then using your skill set to solve that problem.Dig deeper. Scratch beyond the surface of what consumers say they want. Someone who asks for a better mousetrap might really need a barrier that keeps rodents out.“Think further out of the box -- that is, more broadly and creatively -- than your prospective customers do,” Chisholm wrote.

Analysts expected a 14% increase to 82 cents. It was the third time in the past five quarters that Monster has reported lower-than-expected earnings.Net sales grew 6.6% to $645.4 million, well below analyst consensus of $698.4 million.Shares sank 8% in after-hours trading in the stock market today despite Monster also announcing a $1.75 billion addition to its share buyback plan, bringing the current total to $2 billion. Coca-Cola was flat in late trading.Sales were hurt as customers rushed to buy ahead of a price hike in Q3, reducing Q4 sales by about $11 million. Sales were also affected by destocking in certain Europe-Middle East-Africa markets.“Distributor transitions and uncertainties in portions of our international non-Coca-Cola distribution network limited further revenue growth during the quarter,"" Monster CEO Rodney Sacks said in a statement, adding that currency rates also jarred results.Last year, Coca-Cola acquired 17% of Monster in a strategic partnership in which Coke transferred its global energy drink business to Monster and took over the energy drink maker's nonenergy brands, including Hansen's Natural Sodas.The deal gave Monster access to Coke's global distribution network, which should give it a lift as it expands internationally.Earlier in the week, Monster announced that it's agreed to buy longtime flavor supplier American Fruits & Flavors for $690 million. After the deal closes, which is expected this quarter, Monster plans to ""further enhance (American Fruits) flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities.""Monster said it expects the acquisition to add to earnings in 2016.Among other large beverage makers, Coke's archrival PepsiCo (PEP) rose 1% to 100.67.

40,PEP,"Justin Gold is not your typical corporate founder type. Long, tight curls spill out from under his baseball cap as he throws his head back and howls delightedly in selfies with nut-butter enthusiasts who approach him in a steady stream. One woman stops to tell Justin that her mother is a big fan.At food trade show Natural Products Expo West, where alternative meats and other health-conscious products reign supreme, everyone wants to say hi to the creator of Justin's Nut Butter. You probably can't say the same about the makers of Skippy.Such is the marketplace for natural foods now. Once the hippy-dippy niche of places like Whole Foods, the arena in 2018 is stacked with players hawking Greek yogurt and kale chips and high-protein everything on shelves at Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR).""It's a lot more competitive, but now there's more (shelf) space that's available,"" said Gold of the changes to the industry over the years. Larger retailers like Kroger, Target (TGT) and Walmart are looking to put more organic products on their shelves, he said.The interest means that Big Food heavyweights — such as General Mills (GIS), Nestle and PepsiCo (PEP) — have been snapping up natural and organic food startups, a trend that NPD's food and beverage industry analyst, Darren Seifer, does not see stopping.Acquisitions give legacy packaged-food companies entry to the natural and organics market with a brand that has ""believability,"" said Seifer.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportJustin's Nut Butter, for its part, was acquired by Hormel (HRL) in 2016. That brought the almond- and cashew-butter company under the same umbrella as Spam, Hormel Chili and peanut butter stalwart Skippy.The added resources of a food titan like Hormel gave Justin's the fuel to ensure that all of its products' secondary ingredients could also be organic, something that Justin's could ""probably not"" have accomplished by itself, said Gold.But that doesn't mean every new food company out there is looking to ultimately be acquired.The idea of being acquired ""would worry me, at this stage,"" said Snow Monkey co-founder Rachel Geicke. Snow Monkey, a plant-based, nut-free, vegan ""superfood ice treat,"" lists banana puree as its first ingredient. It is sold in about 300 stores across a dozen states and comes in flavors such as passion fruit, goji berry and cacao.""We've technically only been on the market for about 14 months, so it's still very new, and I think what's really important for a young company is ensuring we're shaping culture and as we grow we never forget why we started,"" she said.Better-for-you ice creams were popular at this year's Expo West. Not surprising, given that indie brand and Expo alum Halo Top managed to outsell freezer staples Ben & Jerry's (owned by Unilever (UN)) and Haagen-Dazs (owned by Nestle) in the supermarket pint category last year.""Companies like Halo Top are sort of what the industry needed,"" Snow Monkey co-founder Mariana Ferreira told Investor's Business Daily at the expo. ""It needed a little bit of a shake, to show the big guys you can't be comfortable. You can't put out the same thing all the time.""Smaller brands are the ones bringing the innovation, she added, something that ""isn't fast enough with these big companies.""Nevertheless, they aren't ruling out the possibility of M&A down the road. An acquisition could provide strategic advantages, and ""there could be some really great big partner for us to do that with,"" said Geicke.Either way, the current eating trends are good for business.""What's really promising for us to see is that health has never been so mainstream, and it continues to be,"" said Geicke. ""When you walk into Costco and you're seeing products that you would usually only find at Whole Foods, that's amazing to see the industry shift.""

42,PEP,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite continued to rebound, despite rising inflation pressures and Treasury yields, triggering a shift from market correction to confirmed uptrend. Cisco Systems (CSCO) reported strong earnings, along with Weibo (WB) and other China internets as well as several other top-rated tech stocks. Top-rated hotels were mixed after their reports. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) hired Taco's chief to be its next CEO. Facebook (FB) showed signs of losing more young users to Snap (SNAP)-owned.X After plunging in the prior two weeks, the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite surged in the latest week, shrugging off rising prices and the continued rise in Treasury yields. The market is back in an uptrend. Cisco hit a 17-year high on a bevy of good news. Shopify (SHOP), Hubspot (HUBS) and Weibo (WB) also had good results. But Arista Networks (ANET) and LogMeIn (LOGM) fell Friday on guidance.Cisco Systems (CSCO) announced a $25 billion stock buyback, topped earnings forecasts, reported its first revenue gain in eight quarters and guided March quarter views higher. Aside from the new $25 billion buyback, Cisco plans to use some of the $67 billion in repatriated cash for a dividend hike. Cisco would have around $30 billion, including domestic cash on hand, for acquisitions. Cisco shares rose to a 17-year high.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersArista Networks handily beat Q4 earnings views with a 64% jump but revenue only edged estimates and its sales outlook for the March quarter and 2018 disappointed. Shares dived 19% Friday after a 200% run-up the past year. Management forecast a sequential revenue decline in the March quarter, with the mid-point of revenue guidance implying 37% growth to $459 million, just above estimates of $457 million. Analysts said Arista set the expectation for ""mid-20s"" revenue growth in 2018 which is below the Street's 27.5%. The guidance could reflect stiffer competition from Cisco.Shopify (SHOP) earned 15 cents a share in Q4, up from no profit a year earlier, vs. estimates of 5 cents. Revenue jumped 71% to $222.8 million, topping consensus estimates of $208 million. The e-commerce software firm forecast Q1 and 2018 revenue above expectations. Shares edged up Thursday after surging to a record high ahead of earnings. Shopify surged 15% through Thursday.RELATED:New America: Shopify Is Killing It By Making Businesses Win OnlineFacebook (FB) is losing younger users to Snap (SNAP)-owned Snapchat at an even faster pace than previously expected, said research firm eMarketer. It said Facebook is still adding monthly users overall, but older age groups are mainly responsible for the increase. Facebook will lose 2 million users under 25 in the U.S. this year while Snapchat will add 1.9 million, eMarketer predicts. Facebook's Instagram will still add teens and young adults.Shares of China internet companies Weibo (WB) and parent Sina (SINA) both reported fourth-quarter results that largely topped estimates. Weibo is a social media company that has a Twitter (TWTR)-like platform, while Sina offers a popular internet portal. Internet search leader Baidu (BIDU) also jumped on a fourth-quarter report that topped views, thanks to upside from online video and news feed advertising.RELATED:These Top China Names Are Trying To Form BasesDiamondback Energy (FANG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reported Q4 results above Wall Street estimates and plan to boost production this year as the International Energy Agency said U.S. crude output will overtake Saudi Arabia ""soon"" and ""catch up to Russia by the end of the year."" The Energy Information Administration said domestic oil production edged up to 10.27 million barrels per day from 10.25 million the prior week. OPEC sees global demand growth increasing by 60,000 bpd to 1.59 million, but expects U.S. production growth to outpace demand growth. Saudi Arabia called for production cuts by OPEC and Russia to continue through 2018. That, along with a stock market revival and a weak dollar, helped lift crude by 4.2% to $61.68 a barrel.The consumer price index and core CPI rose more than expected, pushing the 10-year Treasury above 2.9%, hitting fresh four-year highs. But core inflation is still just 1.8%. Markets priced in greater certainty of three Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2018, but still only about a 25% chance of a fourth hike. Meanwhile, January retail sales fell 0.3%, leading economists to mark down expectations for first-quarter GDP growth.Bitcoin continued on its upward trajectory, moving just above $10,000 afterfter briefly undercutting the $6,000 mark in the prior week. Meanwhile, Litecoin vaulted  as anticipation builds for the launch of payment processor LitePay and an upcoming fork of its blockchain. Meanwhile IBM (IBM) warned Congress about overregulating digital currencies in case it has ""unintended consequences"" on blockchain technology.LogMeIn (LOGM) reported adjusted Q4 earnings that beat estimates while pro forma revenue topped views. For 2018, LogMeIn forecast profit of $5.48 a share, well above estimates of $4.90 a share but its March quarter and full-year revenue outlooks were a bit light. LogMeIn sold Xively, its Internet of Things business for web-connected devices, to Google for $50 million. LogMeIn completed a reverse merger with the GoToMeeting business of Citrix (CTXS) on Feb. 1, 2017. Shares, which had broken out earlier in the week, fell 8.5% on Friday, undercutting its buy point.Chipotle Mexican Grill said Brian Niccol, CEO of Taco Bell, would become the fast-casual chain's chief executive in March. Shares sprinted higher on hopes Niccol — known for helping bring hits like Nacho Fries and Doritos Locos Tacos to Taco Bell's menu — might revive Chipotle's sales and traffic following food-safety issues.Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands International (QSR) said Burger King turned out strong Q4 sales, and the company more than doubled its dividend. Shake Shack (SHAK) said that by 2020, it planned to more than double its store count from last year's levels, while Q4 results beat views.

45,PEP,"WeWork, the shared-office company valued at $15 billion, has cultivated a chic vibe to attract the freelancers and startup workers that helped launch the co-working movement. That means hip interior design (some offices have wallpaper created by the Beastie Boys' Mike D) and free micro-roasted coffee and craft beer (the company gave out 90,000 glasses during a single month last year).Now that youthful ambiance is helping attract the olds. General Electric (GE) moved 20 workers from its new energy business, Current, into a WeWork space near Boston's South Station this year as GE readies its new Boston headquarters. Other recent WeWork tenants include business consultancy KPMG, pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK), and British news publication the Guardian -- companies that have been around for an average of 155 years.The moves mean traditional employers can rub shoulders with the young tech set. KPMG rents about 75 desks at a WeWork in Manhattan, which it splits between workers who provide business services to startups, and another team that advises corporate clients on technological innovation. Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), which rents space at 16 co-working offices across the country, including with Galvanize in San Francisco and Centrl Office in Portland, Ore., says the move allows its bankers to work alongside the tech startups it courts as clients. “People literally open the door and say, 'We need to open [a] bank account,'” said Mark Gallagher, who leads the bank’s Boston technology practice.It's also a useful way to manage real estate costs, according to workplace strategy experts. “Anyone doing it now is a pioneer,” said Julie Whelan, head of occupier research for CBRE. “I can’t see that it won’t become a norm, based on how companies have worked to change their footprints in recent years.”It costs the typical U.S. company upward of $12,000 a year for each worker it provides office space, according to CBRE Group (CBG). Co-working spaces can be more expensive than traditional office space on a per-square-foot basis but make it easy for companies to move in and out, letting execs focus more on expanding their businesses than managing their real estate operations. ""If I go and find a space with a five-year lease and build it out, it might take me five years to recoup my expenses,"" said Brent Harrell, president of HeritageBank Mortgage, an Atlanta-based lender who recently moved a team of four mortgage bankers into an Industrious co-working space.Employees tend to like it, too. The homebuilder Lennar (LEN) rents space from Industrious in Chicago and Minneapolis so it can hold meetings near downtown construction projects and because the stylish offices help with recruiting, said Peter Chmielewski, vice president of development for the builder's multifamily arm. In a September report published in the Harvard Business Review, workers in shared offices reported that they were ""thriving"" so much that researchers “had to look at the data again.” The results, the researchers theorize, are largely because the workers tend to have a greater sense of purpose. They’ve opted into a workspace instead of showing up at a site designated by their employer, which tends to produce a community effect that makes them feel empowered.A stylish or flexible workplace doesn't necessarily require a co-working membership. Most employers are more comfortable adopting aspects of co-working than sending employees to shared offices, said Phil Kirschner, senior vice president at JLL (JLL), who consults with employers on workplace strategy. That could mean trading assigned desks for access to a variety of shared spaces. ""(They've) given up a desk and gained a floor,"" Kirschner said.Co-working companies, however, are welcoming the corporate interest. WeWork has raised $1 billion from investors to fuel expansion around the world, and renting space to large companies that need lots of desks is a good way to expand quickly. Thirty percent of WeWork's 45,000 members work for companies that rent more than 10 desks, and large employers make up its fastest-growing market. ""You’re going to see people dip toes in,"" said WeWork Chief Operating Officer Artie Minson. ""People go back to their drab, soulless office and say, I sort of wish I could have stayed there.""Serendipity Labs, which opened its first co-working space in Rye, N.Y., in 2013, says corporate employees make up 45% of members at its two U.S. locations, including workers from PepsiCo (PEP), Microsoft (MSFT), and Heineken International. The company is seeking to open 200 shared offices in the next three years, mostly in suburban locations, to appeal to companies with national footprints, founder John Arenas said. To fuel its rapid growth, Arenas is selling franchises to hotel operators and other hospitality companies. Not every corporate employer wants the kind of hip, downtown spaces associated with co-working, Arenas said.“Instead of having a bro-out Thursday night party, we’re having a Tesla test-driving event,” Arenas said. “We have different members. They can afford a car.”Related:Creative Offices Become The Norm And Get SmarterWhy Rental Rates At Biotech Labs Are SkyrocketingFood Feeds Real Estate Development In Edgy Areas

47,PEP,"Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown look for the early stages of a growth cycle. As managers of American Century Growth Fund (TWCGX), the pair uses bottom-up stock picking to find companies with improving fundamentals. Rigorous research is central to their investment process.The strategy has proven successful for the mutual fund. American Century Growth has outperformed its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar by an average of 91 basis points per year for the last 10 years. Year-to-date the fund was down 6.91% going into Thursday vs. an average decline of 8.74% by peers.The mutual fund carries a 36-Month Performance Rating of A from IBD, meaning it's outperformed 90% of all mutual funds.Woodhams has managed American Century Growth since 1997. Brown, who's been at American Century since 2000, joined Woodhams as co-manager on Jan. 31, replacing Prescott LeGard.With $7.4 billion in assets, the mutual fund primarily invests in large-cap U.S. stocks. At the end of Q3, American Century Growth held 81 stocks with a 49% turnover rate. Technology, healthcare and consumer cyclicals were the fund’s top sector weightings.Woodhams and Brown place a premium on risk management. They seek to protect shareholders from exposure to adverse sector or industry concentrations. By focusing on stock selection, the American Century Growth team settles on company-specific risks that figure to pay off over the long run.Once such bet that has paid off in a big way is Alphabet (GOOGL). The stock was added as a holding to the American Century Growth portfolio in 2005. Over the last 10 years its share price has soared more than 250%. On Monday, Alphabet reported an 18% jump in quarterly revenue.The stock fell 6% the past two days, slicing through its 50-day moving average after Google's head of search said he is leaving the company.Another stock that the fund bought into early in a growth cycle is the fund’s No. 2 holding, Apple (AAPL). Shares were purchased for the portfolio in 2006. Apple’s stock price has skyrocketed more than 800% in the past decade. Last week, the company reported mixed results for its fiscal Q1. Revenue and net income were quarterly records for Apple, but the company said it expects revenue in the current quarter to decline for the first time in 13 years as sales of iPhones have leveled off.The stock has sold off 28% from its 52-week high and is looking for a bottom.American Century Growth has owned shares of PepsiCo (PEP) since 2004. For 2015, PepsiCo is projecting organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Its full-year results are due out next week. The stock has held up relatively well this year. Pepsi is down 5% from its 52-week high vs. a 10% decline by the S&P 500. Pepsi yields 2.9%.Amazon.com (AMZN) is a more recent addition to the portfolio. Last week the company announced record quarterly profits, as operating income from its Amazon Web Services business almost tripled. But the results were way below analyst estimates. Amazon’s stock price is up 56% from one year ago, but has pulled back this year to be 23% off its 52-week high.The fund has held Visa (V) shares since 2013. In its most recent quarter, the company said it is seeing strong payments-volume growth, but is facing headwinds from an uneven macro environment and a strong U.S. dollar. Shares of Visa are 15% higher from a year ago, but are 9% off their 52-week high.

At least the industry appears headed in that direction.Whether you support gender diversity, prefer religious-oriented investments or believe in Millennials' spending power, there's an ETF for you. Those are just a few of the new wave of thematic ETFs that came on the scene last year.One of last year's most successful launches is SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index (SHE), which brought in $313 million in assets as of May 19. State Street Global Advisors' March offering tracks the SSGA Gender Diversity Index, which is made up of large-cap companies that show diversity in their senior leadership. Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN) and PepsiCo (PEP) are its three largest holdings.Daily trading volume is about 9,000 shares. Its gross expense ratio is 0.20%, according to independent industry researcher Morningstar Inc. How does diversity work as an investment? The fund is up about 10% from its March 2016 debut and 5% year to date.April brought about Global X S&P 500 Catholic Values (CATH), with $96.9 million in assets and average daily volume of about 17,000. It tracks the S&P 500 Catholic Values Index. The ETF's top big-cap holdings as of May 17 included Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT).The fund invests in companies whose business practices meet the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' socially responsible guidelines. Its expense ratio is 0.39%. It's up about 8% this year and 20% in the past year, in line with the broad stock market.Global X Millennials Thematic ETF (MILN), launched in May last year, aims to invest in companies that provide products and services Millennials are likely to use. Top 10 holdings as of May 17 included Alphabet, Apple, Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and PayPal (PYPL). The ETF tries to provide investment results similar to the price and yield performance of the Indxx Millennials Thematic Index and carries a gross expense ratio of 0.68%. It has $5.2 million AUM and an average daily volume of around 3,000 shares. It's up about 11% this year and 19% from a year ago.August saw the launch of Principal Millennials Index ETF (GENY), which has a similar goal, tracks the Nasdaq Global Millennial

Which begs the question: Are thematic ETFs too trendy or do they have staying power?""A common thread among them is that they're preying on investors' impulse to chase what's hot,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar, said in a December report. ""These funds tend to offer narrow and often overly complex exposures, charge high fees, and have sponsors that prioritize salability over staying power.""""There were a host of thematic ETFs that were launched in 2016, covering a wide variety of trending topics (3-D printing, the obesity epidemic, video game technology, you name it),"" Johnson wrote. ""This made it difficult to pick just one for my short list of 2016's worst.""His pick? Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey&Spirits (WSKY), which has $2.8 million in assets.

""The fund charges an annual fee of 0.75%, a hefty price to pay for a concentrated bet on booze. Investors would be well-served to leave this one on the shelf.""Of the 247 new ETFs launched last year, 19 were thematic funds, according to Ron Rowland, founder and executive editor of Invest With An Edge.""Thematic ETFs have been around for years, but there was a noticeable increase in launch activity in 2016,"" he wrote in a January article.

51,PEP,"As we move through May, the old Wall Street adage ""Sell in May and go away"" comes to mind, a reminder that stocks historically tend to underperform during the May-to-October period.But does that mean ETF investors should liquidate their holdings, take the summer (and a few extra months) off, and resume buying stocks in November?That's one investment strategy. But, as with most old sayings, it doesn't have to be taken literally. Even if the market's return tends to be bigger in the November-April period, investors sitting out the other six months miss out on intermediate rallies and on the power of reinvesting dividends and compounding returns.That's why Oliver Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management, doesn't think the adage proves advantageous for most investors.""It is at best unreliable and inconsistent and amounts to market timing,"" he told IBD. ""When taking into account possible tax consequences, missed dividends and trading commission, the math doesn't bear out.""But Pursche, who oversees the New York-based firm's investment banking and wealth management divisions, thinks May is a good time for investors to reassess their portfolios.Click Here To See A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Bruderman Asset Management is a registered investment advisor (RIA) with more than $1 billion in assets under management.Here are Pursche's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:""Sell in May and walk away"" is not a strategy we feel is particularly smart or beneficial to investors. However, as we enter the summer months and the second half of the year, there is a need for investors to revisit their investment thesis and potentially reallocate their portfolios. After a solid double-digit run by the S&P 500 since Mr. Trump was elected president, a portfolio risk assessment is certainly due. Investors should expect a continuation of the current positive sentiment, even though the Trump administration is unlikely to pass any major legislation, in particular tax reform. Nonetheless, there are several key factors that are benefiting our economy and consequently, corporate earnings.The United States economy, as well as the world as a whole, is benefiting from a cyclical rebound in growth and consumer demand that is helping drive corporate earnings higher, and could help boost U.S. GDP growth by 4% or more in the second quarter. One phenomenon that has been interesting to observe in the current earnings cycle is the strength of earnings coming from outside the United States. Of the companies within the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, those companies that earn more than 50% of their revenues offshore have seen EPS growth of nearly 20%, while companies that derive all of their earnings domestically are experiencing low- to middle-single-digit EPS growth.One last note: Expect a correction at some point, but don't let that change your long-term investment strategy. The ETFs named above should perform well if the current environment persists through the end of the year and into 2018, as we expect it to.RELATED:This ETF Is Knocking The 'Socks' Off The Tech Sector

54,PEP,"Glen W. Bell Jr. wasn't one to move with the rest of the pack in the nascent days of the fast-food industry.While burgers were the standard fare at stands like McDonald's Drive-In in the early 1950s, Bell opted to introduce the American consumer to Mexican food.""An innovative product will set you apart,"" said Bell (1923-2010), the founder of Taco Bell and pioneer of the Mexican chain fast-food segment, in ""Taco Titan: The Glen Bell Story,"" a 1999 biography by Debra Lee Baldwin.That was his goal when in 1951 he added homemade crisp-shelled tacos to the menu of his Bell's Burgers stand (it also served hot dogs) located in a Hispanic neighborhood in San Bernardino, Calif. — at 19 cents a pop.Bell recalled the response of his first taco customer: "" 'That was good. Gimme another.' Right then I knew we had a winner.""From those humble beginnings, Bell laid the groundwork for Taco Bell, which he started in 1962, serving what his customers called 'Tay-Kohs.'Armed with determination, resourcefulness and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, Bell not only transformed Taco Bell into a restaurant dynamo, he also revolutionized the chain restaurant business by pioneering and popularizing a new category — the Mexican quick-service restaurant — which Taco Bell continues to dominate.Today, Taco Bell is a subsidiary of Yum Brands (YUM) and the No. 1 Mexican-inspired quick-service restaurant brand. Taco Bell represents approximately 30% of Yum's operating profit, according to Yum. Last year, system sales (includes results of company-owned and franchise restaurants) rose 6% to $9.66 billion, including the 53rd week.""The Mexican chain fast-food market was Bell's creation,"" Darren Tristano, food service trend expert and advisor to Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm, told IBD. ""He looked at the niche of tacos, which at the time wasn't a big mass food opportunity, and really built that business. He brought tacos (and Mexican fare) to the American consumer in the chain restaurant (venue).""Taco Bell remains a giant in its field. The size of Taco Bell ""dwarfs"" every other Mexican fast-food chain in the category, which also includes Taco John's and Del Taco Restaurants, Tristano says.Taco Bell's menu today includes various types of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos and other related items.Bell began formulating his recipe for success as a leader as he ventured on the path to overcome financial woes as a youth and as he pursued his goal to start a restaurant business.At every juncture, with every experiment, setback and win, Bell learned what he called his ""recipes for success"" — 60 lessons outlined in his biography.His first two recipes were key ingredients for running his restaurant chains and important to his success:""You build a business one customer at a time. In the early days, I never closed when there was a customer waiting even though I had put in 12 hours and was eager to go home. … One happy customer is worth his weight in gold.""Find the right product, then find a way to mass-produce it. When I had my hamburger stand, similar takeout stands were spreading all over San Bernardino. If my business was to survive and grow, I would have to apply what I knew about quick service to a different product.""That's where the taco came in. Key to Bell's success was the way he ran Taco Bell's operations, says Dan Jones, who owns four Taco Bell franchises in California — two in Long Beach, one in Azusa and one in Montebello. Jones started at Taco Bell in 1965, running its original restaurant in Downey, Calif.""He was really concerned about the quality of the food, the customer service and cleanliness of the restaurants,"" Jones told IBD. He was very strict on operations. (The franchisees) were motivated by that. We knew the standards by which Taco Bell was supposed to run.""Franchisees knew how to run a restaurant profitably by allocating certain food, payroll and other costs according to certain percentages set by these standards, Jones says.If a franchisee was not following the standards, Bell would send troubleshooters to help them with their operational problems.Jones, who worked in various posts at the Taco Bell corporate level for 11 years and has been a franchisee since 1976, describes Bell as a ""mild-mannered and gentle man"" who never raised his voice.Bell created a culture where he motivated by setting a good example.""You wanted to work for him to grow the company,"" Jones said. ""He was the most honorable person I ever met and an awesome guy to work for.""The franchisees put in 60 hours a week because they ""loved being part of a dynamic company,"" Jones says.In the early years, he was active in helping franchisees. For example, if someone had a low-volume store, Bell would do something like lower the rent or reduced the royalty.Bell also hired people to whom he could delegate responsibility.""Find people who know things you don't,"" he said in his biography. ""I'm an entrepreneur, not an administrator. Taco Bell prospered because I recognized my limitations, hired professional managers to make up for them, and knew when to let go.""Another recipe for success: ""Respect your competitors and learn from them. At first, no one, not even the McDonald brothers, fully recognized the potential of fast food. But we did know, because of the customers' response, we were onto something. We experimented and continually made changes. Our 'market research' was to observe our competitors and to borrow their best ideas.""Bell learned a lot eyeing other entrepreneurs and competitors, especially the McDonald brothers.""One thing I learned from the McDonald brothers is don't sell everything your customers ask for,"" Bell said. ""Decide what you're going to sell, then make it the best it can be.""When Bell came up with the idea to sell tacos at his Bell's Burgers in 1951, he needed to develop the recipe for the best taco — one that could be made and served quickly and was good to eat. At the time, tacos served in Mexican restaurants were made with soft tortillas. Bell wanted tortillas that were ""delicately crisp"" and ready to be filled. After weeks of experimentation, Bell developed a crisp-shelled taco that was quick to assemble and tasty.Tristano calls Bell a visionary. ""The biggest trend he recognized was that Mexicans were immigrating to this country, and there was an opportunity to feed them,"" he said. ""More importantly, he Americanized Mexican food in a way he was able to create demand for his product from the American consumer.""Before Taco Bell started expanding throughout the country, no one knew what Mexican food was, says Jones, who was a franchisee consultant at the time the first Taco Bell in Florida opened.At the time, people didn't know what they were eating or even how to pronounce the names of the food on the menu, Jones says. But that didn't stop the Florida eatery from being a success.""The food was great,' Jones said. ""We couldn't make tacos fast enough.""After Florida, Bell pushed Taco Bell's expansion across the country.Bell was also a visionary in identifying the void in the market for more exotic multicultural fast food.Bell developed Taco Bell during a time when the burger market was taking off with McDonald's (MCD) and Burger King.Bell focused on franchising. ""This was his way of building an empire in a very short time span,"" Tristano said. ""Franchising has proven to be a strong growth vehicle, especially in fast food. Access to capital wasn't as common back then. He was able to build stores without having to operate them or finance them.""The first Taco Bell franchise opened in Torrance, Calif., in 1965. Bell's first venture in the restaurant business was in 1948, when he opened Bell's Drive-In, in San Bernardino. The idea to build a restaurant came to him after he studied the success of the McDonald brothers and their namesake burger drive-ins first founded in San Bernardino.Between 1954 and 1955, Bell and a business partner built three drive-thru taco stands in Southern California called Taco Tia. Bell's partner wasn't in favor of expanding Taco Tia into Los Angeles. Bell sold his interests in the taco stands. Later in the 1950s Bell and a new group of partners opened a chain called El Taco, which Bell also sold his interests in.Taco Bell went public in 1970.In 1978, Bell sold 868 Taco Bell restaurants to PepsiCo (PEP). PepsiCo spun out Taco Bell and its other restaurant chains in late 1997 to Tricon Global Restaurants. With the purchase of two other chains, Tricon Global restaurants changed its name to Yum Brands in 2002.Bell was born in Lynwood, Calif. At 16, with his family struggling financially, Bell ""rode the rails"" across America looking for work, according to his biography. Bell joined the Marine Corps in 1943, and served in the Pacific. While in Guadalcanal, his job was to serve meals to high-ranking officers.That's where he gleaned one of his key recipes for success:""Any job is an opportunity to learn. You would think that serving food to generals in Guadalcanal wouldn't have much relevance later on. But it taught me how to estimate how much food was needed based on the number of people served. That knowledge gave me confidence to start a restaurant.""Pioneered and popularized Mexican quick-service restaurantOvercame: The competition from the burger-chain giants to convince American consumers to eat Mexican fast foodLesson: Learn from your wins, setbacks and experiments.""An innovative product will set you apart.""

55,PEP,"Stocks made new highs Friday as Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA) and Microsoft (MSFT) boosted the Dow and a Bitcoin play found support.X SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) led with a 0.8% gain, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) advanced 0.6% and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) rose 0.7%. Emerging markets also participated as iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) lifted 0.8%.Apple, extended its gain to more than 1%, marking a new record high as it regained a 176.34 flat-base buy point. It first crossed the entry Dec. 18, before pulling back to its 50-day moving average, where it found support. The iPhone maker's relative strength line, however, has been flat to lower.Microsoft gained 2% to a new high. KeyBanc Capital Markets raised its price target to 106 from 94 and kept an overweight rating, citing prospects for Microsoft's artificial intelligence products and initiatives.Gold miners, retail and energy were among the biggest sector fund gainers in the stock market today. Gold futures were up 1.3% to $1,339.29 an ounce. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ), up more than 2% each, have been consolidating above their respective 50-day lines. Real estate and utilities were among the few sectors bucking the uptrend.Bitcoin also rose as it tries to recover from Thursday's slump, which occurred after South Korea said it was working on a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading. Bitcoin climbed 2.4% to $13,601.77, according to CoinDesk, off slightly from an earlier high of $14,095.06. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) bounced 13%, on track to snap a four-session losing streak, after finding support near its 50-day line Thursday.Facebook (FB), down 4%, weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The social network said Thursday it would change its News Feeds to give precedence to friend and family posts. Analysts say the move could affect Facebook's ad revenue.Want to own Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) and other holdings similar to those of billionaire investor Warren Buffett?PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV) could fit the bill. The ETF is in a potential buy range from a rebound off its 50-day moving average. It advanced 7% from an early September bounce off the line to its Dec. 4 intraday high. SPLV was featured in this ETF column, which was published Sept. 27.The fund, which launched in May 2011, has gathered $7.5 billion in assets. It tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, which comprises the 100 least volatile S&P 500 stocks over the past 12 months. The index also has the ability to respond dynamically to market conditions. So unlike some other low volatility indexes, it can move into better-performing sectors when deemed necessary.Financials account for the biggest sector weighting at nearly 21% of assets. Utilities make up about 20%, industrials 19%, and information technology and consumer staples roughly 10% each. The top 10 holdings as of Jan. 10 included Honeywell International (HON), Coca-Cola, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), PepsiCo (PEP) and Republic Services (RSG).Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's holding company, owned Coca-Cola as one of its biggest positions in Q3. Other Buffett names in the ETF include American Express (AXP), U.S. Bancorp (USB), Moody's (MCO), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Visa (V).IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.Buffett tends to own some big dividend payers. For instance, Coca-Cola yields an annualized 3.2%, P&G offers 3.1%. SPLV's 12-month dividend is just north of 2%, above the S&P 500's average 1.7% payout. And it has a dividend growth rate of 7% vs. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY)'s 12%.SPLV is up 0.2% this year through Jan. 10, lagging the S&P 500's 2.9% gain. Its average annual returns of 10.2% and 13.6% over the past three and five years also slightly trail the benchmark index, which returned a respective 12.7% and 15.7%.Generally, SPLV tends to perform better if the stock market declines and low-volatility stocks fall less than growth stocks. It carries a 0.25% expense ratio.Thursday's pick, Robo Global Robotics & Automation (ROBO), hit a new high but remains in a buy zone from a 42.69 flat-base entry.

56,PEP,"Dozens of ""sustainable"" mutual funds and ETFs have hit the market in recent years to satisfy rising demand for socially conscious investing.Financial advisors have noticed.As more consumers seek to invest their assets in funds that track environmental, social and governance (ESG) indexes, some financial advisors are marketing their socially responsible bona fides. The sustainable-investing niche capitalizes  on the public’s growing awareness of companies’ policies and strategies -- and to what extent these corporate activities align with an investor’s values.""I've been in the socially responsible investment space since 2002, and people have more knowledge and awareness today than ever before,"" said Sanjay Das, a financial planner in Seattle. ""Now they come in with a lot more questions like 'What am I supporting with my money?' and 'Does this company give political contributions to certain groups?' ""When he first started tapping this niche, Das spent more time teaching investors about it. He led adult education classes at a local college on socially responsible investing (SRI) and reached out to nonprofit organizations ""that tend to have more progressive employees who are concerned with climate change, human rights"" and other issues, he says.Today, his clients don't just possess a better understanding of SRI concerns. They also want their investments to reflect their values, so they ""do their research beforehand on what they want and don't want to support,"" Das adds.In terms of investment products, he sifts through more choices than ever. While specialty firms such as Pax World Funds and Calvert Investments used to dominate the niche, many mainstream financial services companies now operate sustainable-investing units.""There's more competition in the financial community,"" Das said. ""About 40 or 50 mutual fund companies have SRI products. That's way up from just two or three years ago.""For financial advisors, part of the challenge of harnessing the sustainable-investing niche is staying on top of ever-changing societal trends. The issues that investors care about can ebb and flow based on a range of factors.When George Gay started to focus on SRI in the late 1980s, global headlines included the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 and anti-apartheid protests in South Africa. At the time, Gay was a certified financial planner and chief operating officer of First Affirmative Financial Network in Colorado Springs, Colo.""Today, new areas of concern include sustainable (retail) food chains and factory farming,"" said Gay, now First Affirmative's chief executive officer. ""These things are getting more complicated.""Gay's firm, which works with about 100 financial advisors across the U.S., hosts an annual SRI conference for financial planners to discuss the latest developments and investment strategies within their niche. For example, advisors often compare notes on how to serve millennials who embrace ""impact investing."" Gay finds that ""younger clients are more interested"" in SRI and advisors often want to attract more entrepreneurs and professionals in their 20s and 30s.Advisors engage in deep discussions with their clients about their values -- and the types of investments that they like and dislike. To gain a better sense of an investor's preferences, financial advisors often ask clients to fill out a questionnaire.Investors will check boxes of stock screens they'd like to set up. Examples include seeking companies with high marks for gender diversity or avoiding companies that make or sell military weapons.""We use their answers to craft portfolios that are aligned with their values,"" said Allan Moskowitz, a certified financial planner in El Cerrito, Calif. ""I had a client who was a doctor. He was looking to avoid funds with Coke (KO) or Pepsi (PEP), because he felt they caused obesity.""Moskowitz, who has focused on SRI for 25 years, says that the niche has soared in popularity. In addition to joining First Affirmative's network, he says that clients find him through his website and a listing on National Green Pages, an online directory. He has also adopted a lifestyle that embodies his values.""I bought an office building 1-1/2 years ago and lowered my carbon footprint by about 80%,"" he said. ""I have solar panels on the roof. I drive a Nissan Leaf.""He also seeks to hold companies accountable for their stated commitment to ESG standards. A shareholder activist, he has joined coalitions to fight ""greenwashing"" (when organizations falsely claim they're environmentally friendly) and highlight other social-justice issues.All the effort pays off. Moskowitz says his clients appreciate working with an advisor who walks the talk.""Clients in this niche are stickier,"" he said. ""They're loyal. My retention rate is high.""

57,PEP,"The world's largest soft drink maker, Coca-Cola (KO), reported a fifth straight quarter of better than expected earnings per share.Coca-Cola said early Tuesday that its fourth-quarter EPS fell 14% to 38 cents on an 8.2% drop in revenue to $10 billion. Wall Street was expecting 37 cents EPS and $9.91 billion revenue.The beverage maker, which also sells teas, juices and energy drinks, says that it's agreed to refranchise its China bottling operations to China Foods and Swire Beverage Holdings, its partners there. Coke earlier shifted bottling operations to partners in Europe and Africa.The upside earnings surprise comes after Coke last year moved forward with a five-point plan that it laid out in late 2014 to reinvigorate growth and boost profits.CEO Muhtar Kent said in a statement that the results reflect the reorganization. ""Importantly, this top-line growth was led by our flagship market of North America, which delivered its strongest annual performance in three years.""Coke's unit case shipments grew 1% in China. Its case volume in Japan rose 3%, and the company saw double-digit growth in India.Its shares rose 1.5% to 43.30 in the stock market today.

59,PEP,"They call it stormy December, but January was  -- worse.On the heels of December's 1.58% decline in the S&P 500 and 2.80% tumble for U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, in January the broad market lost 4.96% and U.S. diversified stock funds dove 6.25%, according to Lipper Inc.It was the sixth worst January for the big-cap bogey in the past 47 years. And in that span it was the third worst opening month to a year for U.S. diversified stock funds as a group.Click Here To See List Of Top Performing Mutual Funds Past 6 MonthsThere was no mystery about the main culprits. Investors worried about stock market news that harped on China's economic slowdown and speculated about how badly it would affect the global economy -- including that of the U.S.And investors fretted about oil's declining price. Light sweet crude, for example, fell from $37.04 a barrel to $33.62 by January's end. It closed below $30 on five trading days.""China and oil are two of the reasons for the weak market in January,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. ""I would also throw into the mix the strong dollar, high inventories, weak manufacturing sector and the political cycle.""Still, the market trended higher in its final eight sessions. Why? Credit the Federal Reserve, Orlando says. On Jan. 27, the Fed signaled that its decisions regarding future rate hikes ""would be dovish, data dependent and cautious,"" Orlando said.That was in stark contrast to the Fed's quarter-percentage-point rate hike in December.Also, Japan's central bank went to negative interest rates on certain bank reserves -- a move that bolsters stocks by making them more attractive than cash.The Federal Reserve action preceded by two days the Bureau of Economic Analysis' release of its advance estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter: annualized 0.7% growth, lower than Q3's 2% gain and slightly below market expectations of 0.8% for Q4.So investors, who were already spooked by the five indicators that Orlando cites, were relieved by the BEA's move, which virtually wiped out the prospect of three or four rates hikes in 2016. ""And when the Fed does make its next rate hike, investors know that that will be a sign of the Fed's faith that the economy is strong enough to handle it,"" Orlando said.Orlando believes that the Fed won't lift its rate again until the U.S. sees a quarter with 2% annualized GDP growth. ""July is the earliest we might see sufficiently strong data,"" he said. ""Then September is the next time that they'd be likely to raise the rate.""A 9.03% gain made dedicated short-bias funds the best-performing mutual funds among all U.S. diversified stock funds in January.Click Here To See The Top-Performing Stock And Bond Mutual Fund CategoriesAmong just market capitalization and style categories within U.S. diversifieds, large-cap core funds did best by losing the least, 5.35% in the month. Equity-income funds gave up even less: -3.92%.Top large-cap growth managers included Frank Caruso, whose AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) fell 6.08% last month.Reflecting the flight to safe havens, commodities precious metals funds paced all sectors, gaining 2.53%.Also reflecting the flight to safety, U.S. Treasury bond funds leapt 3.45% as taxable-bond funds overall lost 0.34% in the month.Latin American funds led foreign-region stock funds by losing the least, -4.30%.Orlando expects the market blahs to continue until about midyear.""I don't think China is going into recession,"" he said. ""Consumers are doing well there, but it will take a couple of quarters for investors to figure that out. Consumers in China will offset weakness in manufacturing by midyear.""By midyear, investors should also see that the U.S. dollar has stopped strengthening altogether, or at least as fast as it has, he adds. ""That dollar stabilization will make it easier for U.S. megacaps to export, which will boost corporate earnings,"" he said.Corporate inventories are already falling, he says. ""So we might see a restocking-cycle kick off in the second half of the year, which would boost manufacturing,"" he said.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index jumped to 55.6 in January from 42.9 in December, the highest pace of growth in a year. When that barometer tops 50, it's a sign of growth in the manufacturing sector. ""It was in contraction mode the last six months,"" Orlando said.As for politics, only once in the past 75 years has the party in power extended control of the White House to a third straight term. Concern about weak growth in jobs and wages should help swing control of the presidency to Republicans, Orlando says. And that should be good for business interests.With his eyes glued to midyear, Orlando expects that the technology, consumer-discretionary and industrial sectors to lead the breakout. That should benefit tech-hardware makers, chipmakers, automakers, homebuilders and airlines, he says.""Once the Fed starts to tighten again, then financials ought to work better,"" he said.In the meantime, his focus is on lower-beta, higher-dividend stocks. Names that he likes include Exxon Mobile (XOM) and Royal Dutch (RDSA).""In the first half of the year, we have overweights in Europe and Japan vs. the U.S.,"" he said. ""We're overweight in developed foreign markets but underweight in emerging markets.""Jeff Rottinghaus, manager of $1.6 billion T. Rowe Price Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $203 million Large Cap (TRULX), also expects ""a pretty tough year."" To cope with slower earnings growth, he has beefed up what he calls quality and higher-yield stocks. He's also been looking for early cyclical stocks with sound fundamentals, whose prices have been beaten up.In railroads, he began to buy Kansas City Southern (KSU) late last year. ""In a recovery, it should do well,"" he said. The stock is 32% off its 52-week high. Earnings fell 6% last year and are expected to increase 1% this year and 13% next year.In financials, he likes Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). ""They take advantage of volatility,"" he said. Intercontinental provides a market for derivatives, which many investors use to hedge volatility.He also likes American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), two REITs that own wireless towers. Their long-term contracts with telecom carriers give them ""fantastic recurring revenue businesses that should do well in a more stressed economic environment,"" he said.And in consumer staples he owns CVS (CVS), PepsiCo (PEP) and Philip Morris International (PM).In fixed income, he expects bonds generally to look more appealing if the Fed is forced to pause its rate hikes. In that scenario, bond prices should stabilize rather than decline.Rottinghaus would like to find commodities stocks that have been dragged down by their sector or industry group -- more than their own fundamentals call for. ""Those companies could do well over the next couple of years,"" he said. ""But they're still not there yet.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

61,PEP,"Immigration: The deportation rules announced this week by Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly were greeted with the expected outrage from the usual suspects. But since when is enforcing the law a crime?In this case, the law that Kelly plans to enforce is the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which was approved by 52 Democrats in the Senate and 202 Democrats in the House in a Democrat-controlled Congress and was signed into law by President Johnson, a Democrat.That hasn't stopped today's Democrats from decrying the DHS memo as obscene and horribly un-American.New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez says the policies described in Kelly's memo are ""xenophobic."" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it a ""mass deportation plan … to round up and quickly deport anyone who is undocumented."" He said Democrats would oppose it and ""continue fighting for what is right.""News accounts, meanwhile, said the DHS memos were creating fear and panic among immigrant communities.Others complained that the DHS plan would let the government deport illegals to Mexico, even if they originated from another country, that they could be deported for something as mundane as a traffic ticket, and that the rule, as The New York Times put it, ""strip such immigrants of privacy protections.""What the memos say, however, is that DHS will enforce the 1965 law.Critics say, for example, Kelly wants to enlist local law enforcement to help identify and arrest illegals. CNN says the memos ""expand the federal government's ability to empower state and local law enforcement agencies to perform the functions of immigration officers.""Not true. This ability is drawn directly from the 1965 law and has been used ever since as a ""force multiplier."" It was Obama who sharply scaled the program back — after he won re-election in 2012.The decision to ship illegals back to Mexico, even if they came from another country, is also drawn directly from the law — which also, by the way, makes it clear that illegals can be deported simply for the crime of being in the country illegally.As far as ""stripping"" immigrants of ""privacy protections,"" what Kelly's memo actually says is that DHS will abide by the 1974 Privacy Act, which provides privacy protections for information collected by the federal government about U.S. citizens. These protections, the law makes clear, do not extend to visitors or aliens.In early 2009, the DHS decided on its own to extend the Privacy Act to illegals, because it was easier to do so. Kelly's memo simply rescinds that 2009 ""guidance memorandum.""This doesn't strip immigrants of any privacy rights — which they didn't have to begin with — but simply better aligns DHS policy with federal law.In addition, DHS is scrapping Obama's Priority Enforcement Program, which was also implemented after Obama won re-election and was in force for all of two years. PEP severely limited which illegals would be deemed a priority for removal, supposedly to focus the agency's efforts on high-risk illegals.But as Kelly states, Obama's PEP ""failed to achieve its stated objectives (and) hampered the Department's enforcement of the immigration laws."" So the agency is going back to the Secure Communities Program that PEP had replaced.For the most part, then, what Kelly is doing is wiping away various roadblocks set up by Obama that hampered enforcement of the 1965 law.It's true that Kelly plans to hire 10,000 more agents and officers, but many of these personnel will go toward speeding up what is an absurdly long removal process and to better enforcing existing laws.In any case, the memos make clear that DHS still intends to prioritize their deportation efforts on illegals who are 1) criminals, 2) drug traffickers or 3) national security risks. Anyone want to object to that?If Democrats don't like the 1965 law — which their party wrote and passed — they should try to convince the public that it needs to be changed, rather than mindlessly attack the president who tries to enforce its provisions.RELATED:Donald Trump News & Tweets Trump's Right: Law-Breaking 'Sanctuary Cities' Must Obey The LawAre We Going To Freak Out Every Time Trump Does What He Promised?Now We Know: Those 'Spontaneous' Anti-Trump Airport Protests Weren't Spontaneous At All

62,PEP,"Over the last several years, smart beta ETFs have surged in popularity as a potential replacement for an active management strategy, but at a much cheaper price.X In the first nine months of 2017 alone, global smart beta equity ETF/ETP (exchange traded products) assets surged 22% to $644 billion, according to London-based ETF tracker ETFGI.Smart beta, sometimes called strategic beta or factor investing, refers to rules-based strategies that go beyond ETFs that track traditional market-cap weighted indexes. Market-cap weighted ETFs include SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), which track the Nasdaq 100. SDPR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), tracks the price-weighted Dow industrial average.Smart beta ETFs come in a variety of strategies, including value, growth, income, dividend yield and dividend growth, fundamentals-weighted and equal-weighted.Why diversify away from weighting a portfolio by market cap, which is a stock's price times shares outstanding? Consider QQQ.The top five holdings of the Q's are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Together, they account for more than 39% of the ETF's total portfolio.When each of those companies perform well, the fund will have a good year. In 2017, for example, the Q's are up over 34% year to date through Dec. 19. But if Apple has a multiyear correction — like it did in 2013 and again in 2016 — the vanilla ETF's performance could be muted compared with a smart beta ETF that has either avoided Apple or rotated out of the stock into a different equity opportunity.A number of smart beta ETFs that can provide both an active investment strategy and lower costs, compared with the Qs. As a comparison, the expense ratio of the QQQ ETF is 0.2%.According to Ben Johnson, Director of Global ETF Research at Morningstar, there are two key factors of analyzing smart beta ETFs: the fund's investment process and the fee that the fund charges.Investors should have a thorough understanding of the ETF's investment process and how it constructs the portfolio and its weighting. Meanwhile, the fund's fee should be compared to its actively managed peers and vanilla ETF alternatives.These two income-producing funds have strong Morningstar Analyst Ratings: Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) and Schwab Dividend Equity (SCHD).The Morningstar Analyst Rating measures the quality of the fund within the context of the fund's objective, benchmark and peer group. Meanwhile, the fund must distinguish itself across Morningstar's five pillars of investment success: talented management team, sound investment process, portfolio that is in sync with the fund's process, reasonable expenses and a strong parent organization.VIG boasts a Gold Star Analyst Rating, indicating that Morningstar analysts have the highest-conviction recommendation for its investment objective, which seeks to select a diversified portfolio of highly profitable U.S. dividend-paying companies. In the meantime, the fund reduces exposure to firms with weak fundamentals that may have difficulty sustaining their dividend.Yielding an annualized 1.9%, its top holdings include consumer products company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) and beverage king PepsiCo (PEP). According to IBD data, the fund's dividend growth rate is a staunch 20%, compared with the S&P 500's 13% growth rate.Year to date, the ETF is up 22%. It carries an expense ratio of 0.08%.SCHD sports a Morningstar Silver Star Analyst Rating. Similar to the Vanguard fund, the Schwab fund looks to focus on equities with strong fundamentals and attractive yields. The fund's three biggest positions are Intel (INTC), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Microsoft. The annual dividend yield is 2.8%.Year to date, the fund is up 20.9%. Its expense ratio is 0.07%.According to Todd Rosenbluth, Director of ETF and Mutual Fund Research with CFRA, there are two different types of income-related plays: high-yielding income generation and dividend-paying stocks with growth potential.On the income-generation side, Rosenbluth likes iShares Core High Dividend (HDV). The fund focuses on blue chip energy and telecom names, like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), AT&T (T) and Verizon, which account for about 30% of the portfolio.The fund is up 12.9% year to date and has an annualized dividend yield of 3.2%. Its expense ratio is 0.08%.On the dividend-paying growth side, Rosenbluth mentions WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW), which yields 1.7%. The design of the dividend-with-growth angle is to participate in some of the market's upside, while protecting against some of the downside through the income stream.IBD'S TAKE: Apple has outperformed the broader market this year, but how does it rank in its industry group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.Among its top holdings are J&J and Apple. The iPhone maker is strongly weighted within the portfolio due to its strong fundamental profile — three quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth — and its solid 1.4% annual dividend.Even though it has a slightly higher expense ratio — coming in at 0.28% — the fund in the past three years has returned an average annual 12.3%, compared with the S&P 500's 11.3%. Year to date, the fund is up 27.2% vs. the S&P 500's 22.1% return, according to Morningstar Direct.RELATED:Where To Find Income Without Taking Big RisksTop Dividend Fund Manager Expects Growth In These Three SectorsDoes Steady Earnings Growth Lead To Big Dividends?Apple Weighs On Dow; Bitcoin Drops Again; Nvidia Ready To Run?

Shares are well-extended from a 82.09 flat-base entry.On the downside, Apple's recent breakout lost some luster early Tuesday, falling 0.8% after Nomura downgraded the iPhone maker from buy to neutral, saying the iPhone X has already been priced in to the stock. Shares are back below their 176.34 flat-base entry.Tesla (TSLA) reversed from early gains to fall 0.8% early Tuesday after shipping giant United Parcel Service (UPS) pre-ordered 125 Tesla Semis.

Shares rose 1% and are just above their key 50-day support level.The delivery giant is anticipated to report EPS of $2.87 on revenues of $15.67 billion.

64,PEP,"Shipping company UPS (UPS) announced Tuesday that it placed a reservation order for 125 Tesla (TSLA) tractor-trailer trucks, the largest order received for the all-electric vehicle since it was introduced one month ago.X It follows soda giant PepsiCo (PEP), which placed reservation orders last week for the Tesla big-rig truck named Semi, though the planned vehicle won't start shipping until 2019. Sysco (SYY) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) also placed orders for the company's electric tractor-trailer trucks earlier this month, totaling 90.Food distribution company Sysco placed reservations for 50 of Tesla's new fully-electric trucks, while Anheuser-Busch placed orders for 40 Tesla trucks, ""to reduce the environmental impact and increase the efficiency of its operations.""UPS, which operates one of the largest commercial trucking fleets in the world, said the new Semi big-rig trucks will join its ""extensive alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicle fleet.""""These groundbreaking electric tractors are poised to usher in a new era in improved safety, reduced environmental impact, and reduced cost of ownership."" said Juan Perez, UPS chief information and engineering officer, in prepared remarks.The trucks have an estimated range between 300 miles and 500 miles on a single charge, depending on the model.Tesla shares dropped 2.3% to close at 331.10 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla shares last week surged above its 50-day moving average, though a breakout from a 370.10 buy point failed. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 40 out of best-possible 99.Tesla introduced its futuristic big-rig truck and a sports car with a splashy debut last month, at a time when the company is burning cash and hasn't met delivery schedules for its new Model 3.Each reservation requires a $20,000 deposit. The truck has a price range starting at $150,000 for the low-end model and $180,000 for the high-end version.Tesla previously received orders for 15 trucks from Wal-Mart (WMT). Trucking company J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHY) has also placed reservations for ""multiple"" Tesla Semi trucks, though it has not said how many.The new Tesla vehicles come at a time when the company is struggling to get its new Model 3 out the door, during what Musk has called ""production hell."" Tesla twice delayed the launch of its semi-truck to give it more time to work through production bottlenecks on its Model 3 sedan, planned as a mass-market vehicle.UPS' preorder of Tesla vehicles complements and advances the company's overall commitment ""to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions from global ground operations 12% by 2025,"" it said.UPS pays a quarterly dividend of 83 cents a share. That works out to an annualized yield of 2.8%. Since 2000, the company has raised the dividend every year except in 2009, following the financial crisis.RELATED:Robotrucks Hit The Road In the Name Of Safety, Efficiency And ProfitThis Is Ford's Plan For The Market That's Driving EV, SUV Growth

65,PEP,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) on Wednesday expanded its product portfolio with a fashionable new fitness wristband called the Fitbit Alta.Fitbit began taking pre-orders for the device, which sells for $129.95, on Wednesday, with retail availability starting in March in North America.Alta activity trackers feature stylish, interchangeable bands in a range of colors and materials. Extra bands in Fitbit's ""classic"" style cost $29.95 each. It's also selling luxe leather bands for $59.95 apiece and stainless steel bands for $99.95. Plus, Fitbit is working with designer Tory Burch on fashion accessories for the Alta.In addition to tracking regular activity, exercise and sleep, the Fitbit Alta includes reminders to move when you’ve been sitting too long and smartphone notifications of calls, texts and appointments. Fitbit Alta has a five-day battery life.The Alta provides personal pep talks and motivation, with on-screen messages to meet mini-goals like 250 steps per hour. It tracks steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned and active minutes. It automatically recognizes when someone is exercising.Users can track their progress with a smartphone app and online tools.The Fitbit Alta ultimately will replace the Fitbit Charge, but not the Charge HR, which measures heart rate.“Alta is going to be the premier product for the biggest segment of the market, which is everyday fitness,” Woody Scal, Fitbit’s chief business officer, told IBD. “We think this will broaden our addressable market significantly by bringing in people who care a little bit more about style.”From a business perspective, Alta provides Fitbit the opportunity to sell more high-margin accessories. That’s also a focus with the upcoming Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch.Plus, the Alta provides an upgrade path for owners of Fitbit Flex devices, Scal said.“Fitbit is more than just cool stuff on your wrist or clipped to your waist,” he said.Fitbit has differentiated itself by focusing on software and building a platform for providing personalized fitness insights and coaching as well as social and motivational tools, Scal said.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy on Wednesday reiterated her overweight rating on Fitbit stock with a price target of 60. Fitbit stock was down 1% to about 16 in midday trading on the stock market today.The Alta “combines a higher level of fashion and functionality at the sweet spot of pricing,” Murphy said in a report. Fitbit launched its latest device in tandem with New York Fashion Week.“The infusion of fashion in their product should aid the company to convert retail consumers and help drive a product upgrade cycle,” Murphy said.Fitbit competes with a host of companies, including Fossil (FOSL), Garmin (GRMN), Jawbone, Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA).RELATED:Fitbit Given Physical, Passes With Outperform Rating.

67,PEP,"In a quarter highlighted by the often-promised, finally delivered start of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, the average stock mutual fund ended it higher despite a rough December.U.S. diversified stock mutual funds leapt 6.18% in October. Losing steam, they inched up just 0.78% in November. And then they plunged 2.80% last month, according to preliminary Lipper Inc. data.That left U.S. diversified stock mutual funds ahead 3.99% for Q4.Large-cap growth funds' 7.51% gain made them the best-performing mutual funds among U.S. diversifieds in Q4.Top large-cap growth managers included Dennis Lynch, whose Morgan Stanley Growth Fund gained 9.40% in Q4.The S&P 500 gained 7.04% for investors in Q4 despite its 1.58% December setback.The broad market index gained 1.38% in 2015 overall. U.S. diversified mutual funds lost 2.10%.""Active fund managers, whatever their cap size or style, on average have been underperforming the indices,"" said Rich Weiss, senior portfolio manager of American Century's target-date One Choice Portfolios. ""It's an environment where risky assets, stock funds especially, have not been doing well.""J.J. Kinahan, chief strategist for TD Ameritrade, blames the Q4 stock market slowdown in part on the rising strength of the U.S. dollar. He expects that it will continue to be a headwind in 2016, fueled by rising U.S. interest rates amid easy-money policies elsewhere globally. ""U.S. goods are becoming so much more expensive that foreign customers will find cheaper substitutes,"" Kinahan said.The most obvious weak spot among sectors was commodity energy funds, which slid 15.85% in Q4 on top of an 8.49% setback in December alone. The culprit was stock market news about the weakening price of oil.And energy's struggle was not due solely to oversupply. It was also due to weak foreign economies creating lax demand, says David Joy, chief market strategist of Ameriprise Financial.Weiss said: ""Economic growth is lackluster here in the U.S. But, except for China, most foreign developed markets are showing growth that's even slower than here.""Dragged down by energy's woes, value stocks — measured by iShares Core U.S. Value ETF (IUSV) — gained 4.75% in Q4. Growth stocks in the form of iShares Core U.S. Growth ETF (IUSG) gained 6.89%.Global science-technology funds led all sectors in Q4, surging 11.17% despite a 2.12% December pullback.World equity funds gained 3.29% in Q4 despite losing 1.87% last month.Japanese funds topped those foreign stock-fund categories, gaining 8.97% in Q4 even after absorbing a 1.00% December decline.A 1.03% loss in December left taxable bond mutual funds down 0.77% for Q4 on average. Not a single taxable bond fund category notched an advance last month. U.S. Treasury funds lost 0.32%, extending their Q4 loss to 1.49%. They lost 0.41% for the year overall.Tax-exempt bond funds gained 1.38% in Q4, extending their 2015 gain to 2.59%.Q4's top performing U.S. diversified stock fund with more than $100 million in assets was $13.7 billion Fidelity OTC Portfolio , which gained 13.32%. The fund's largest sector is technology, with a 56% weighting.OutlookKinahan expects big-cap stocks and funds to keep their lead in the market. ""In the first half of the year, we expect large caps to continue to outperform because there remains uncertainty surrounding the markets, surrounding global GDP growth, so people don't want to take additional risks that they don't have to,"" he said. ""They'll move toward S&P 500-type stocks.""He expects financials to be among the strong sectors. ""With rate hikes, their spread margins are coming back. They can charge more for money they lend without paying much more for money they hold. And they've done an amazing job managing costs. That should translate to gains on the bottom line.""Weiss expects value-oriented stocks to do well in 2016, financials among them. ""We expect (slowing economic growth and rising rates) will combine to favor value-oriented stocks and sectors in the coming year,"" he said. ""Thus, although we are neutrally weighted on value vs. growth stocks/sectors currently, we anticipated moving to an overweighted position in value sectors during 2016.""Those value-oriented segments that his group is tilting into more include health care and consumer staples, which are late-economic-cycle defensive sectors that tend to outperform when the economy is stressed.Amgen (AMGN), which has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 86, is among stocks his team owns. So is PepsiCo (PEP), which has a so-so 75 Comp Rating.In addition, Weiss favors short-duration assets for 2016. Investors will be leery of waiting for riskier stocks to post price gains. They will tilt toward steady-Eddie dividend stocks that pay off sooner and with less risk.More bullish on the economy than Weiss, Kinahan also likes the consumer discretionary sector. ""As the economy gets stronger, people will start to spend money on things and on big-ticket items — things like trips and expensive things like cars. Housing will rise.""And he likes the tech sector. ""Enterprises will continue to spend on security,"" he said. ""They have to. Companies will also continue to spend on new programs, new ways to do things.""In global markets, Kinahan expects ""the U.S. to continue to be the leader."" Even before China stocks tanked on the first trading days of the new year, Kinahan said, ""I don't see China's market exploding (upward). I see it more just leveling off.""Japan's expected 1% growth this year would double its 0.5% 2015 pace but still lag the U.S.'s expected 2% growth, the same as last year's, Weiss says.Darrell Riley, a vice president of T. Rowe Price and a member of the team that runs the firm's multiasset investment strategies, says that Europe is also at an earlier stage of economic recovery than the U.S. and could post faster growth. Also, both the eurozone and Japan's easy-money stimulus programs should boost their stock markets.Weiss expects the dollar's gains to slow. The factors driving the dollar's appreciation — such as oil's woes — are no longer fresh enough to jolt increasing numbers of investors, he says. ""The dollar will remain strong, but I don't expect as rapid an acceleration,"" he added.Weiss bottom-lines his outlook this way: ""We're not expecting the sectors and types of mutual funds, both in stocks and bonds, that have done best in recent years to be the best (this) year and coming years. Very growthy, high-beta stock funds that have done best in the past couple of years — we expect value-oriented and equity-income funds to do better.""Sector rotation will occur, he says. ""Tech, health care and some go-go sectors will not do as well again in 2016,"" he said. ""Financials, REITs and some value-oriented segments will do better in 2016.""In fixed income, Weiss sees bond funds that focus on the hottest sectors, such as multisector funds, to lag behind more diversified, plain-vanilla bond funds that hold U.S. government and investment-grade corporate debt.

69,PEP,"As Super Bowl LI takes its place in the history books — climaxing with a 34-28 victory by the Tom Brady-led New England Patriots over the feisty Atlanta Falcons, settled abruptly in overtime as the Patriots notched the biggest come-from-behind rally in the NFL championship game's annals — the Patriots and the Falcons probably were not the only teams you had a rooting interest in. Through mutual funds in which you are a shareholder, you likely had a financial stake in the annual sports and advertising extravaganza.More than 10,000 mutual funds hold shares in at least six companies that ran television ads during the game in NRG Stadium in Houston, which was expected to be watched by more than 100 million viewers. The ranks of those funds include some of the biggest names in the industry. That puts the odds in your favor that a slice of your portfolio may gain value, depending on the impact of ads during the game. The odds go up that your portfolio will be impacted when the pool of mutual funds is expanded to account for ads before and after the game as well, and game-related ads in additional media.Advertisers ranged from the very familiar such as Budweiser beer, whose parent company is Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD), and carmaker Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler (DDAIF), to lesser-known enterprise software company Wix.com (WIX).IBD'S TAKE: IBD reported Thursday that German automaker Daimler said that its fourth-quarter net profit rose 18%, but the firm offered only modest guidance for future earnings as it gets ready to spend on new models and advanced technologies such as autonomous driving.InBev shares were down 16% over the past 12 months, going into Friday. But Daimler was up 8% in that period. And Wix shares had soared 159%.Mutual funds owning a piece of advertisers in the big game included $104 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), $82.2 billion American Funds Investment Company of America (AIVSX), $40.9 billion MFS Value (MEIAX), $16.7 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), $13.1 billion JPMorgan U.S. Equity (JUEAX), $12 billion Franklin Growth (FKGRX) and $8.5 billion Hartford Capital Appreciation (ITHAX).Other funds with players in the ad contest: $7.5 billion MFS Total Return (MSFRX), $6.8 billion Vanguard Total International Stock Index (VGTSX), $5.7 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLGX), $4.8 billion Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value (GCMAX), $4.6 billion AMG Yacktman Focused (YAFFX) and $3.3 billion Alger Capital Appreciation (ALARX).Those funds are among the stock owners in six publicly traded companies that advertised on TV during the Super Bowl: Budweiser, Intel (INTC), Mercedes-Benz, Mountain Dew (PEP), Victoria's Secret (LB) and Wix.com.Intel shares are up 23% over the past 12 months. The stock has a decent 82 Composite Rating from IBD. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.PepsiCo shares are up 6% in the past year. Performing dismally, L Brands stock is down 38% in the past year.Altogether, 10,898 mutual funds held stakes in those six companies or their corporate parents as of Dec. 31. Their positions in the six amounted to 2.49 billion shares.Mutual funds held just 1.3% of total shares in Budweiser owner Anheuser Busch InBev. Mutual funds owned 40.7% of Wix.com, an Israeli company that offers customers a web development platform.Mutual funds held 39.1% of the shares in Victoria's Secret parent L Brands, 34.8% of Intel, 31.7% of Mountain Dew parent PepsiCo and 26.6% of Mercedes driver Daimler's ADRs.Additional publicly traded TV advertisers during the game included Ford (F) and Volkswagen (VLKAY)-owned Audi and Kia.RELATED:Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 20172017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

70,PEP,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care?

72,PEP,"Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are facing a wave of new soda taxes after it appeared four U.S. cities would pass the measures in Tuesday's election, part of an escalating war on sugary drinks.Proposals to slap a 1-cent-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages are poised to pass in the California Bay Area cities of San Francisco, Oakland and Albany. In Boulder, Colo., meanwhile, a 2-cents-per-ounce tax was leading. Cook County, which includes Chicago, also has a similar penny-per-ounce tax written into its proposed 2017 budget.The levies bring fresh headaches to soda companies already coping with a shift in consumer tastes away from their core products. Per-capita soda consumption in the U.S. fell to a 30-year low in 2015, according to data compiled by Beverage Digest, a trade publication. But both Coke (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) announced plans to deal with their sugar problems last month, including a move toward smaller beverage sizes.The new taxes underscore the need to take more dramatic action, according to Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.""It clearly accelerates it,"" he said on Tuesday. ""Soda taxes just add to the impetus for them to be mindful of price mix as an element of growth and innovations and other things,"" rather than just focusing on increasing volumes.The American Beverage Association, an industry trade group, said on Wednesday that it respected the decision of voters.""Our energy remains squarely focused on reducing the sugar consumed from beverages — engaging with prominent public health and community organizations to change behavior,"" the association said in a statement.Before the votes on Tuesday, Philadelphia and Berkeley, Calif., were the only U.S. cities to have similar measures on the books. Philadelphia became the first major city to pass such a tax in June after proponents changed tactics to focus on badly needed funding rather than health benefits.Since 2009, there have been more than 40 attempts to enact a soda tax in cities across the U.S.More than $40 million was spent on the battle over sugary drinks in the San Francisco Bay Area, $20 million of which came from the American Beverage Association, a trade group representing the big beverage companies, according to Bloomberg BNA.Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg gave more than $18 million to campaigns in support of the Oakland and San Francisco soda tax initiatives, finance records show. Bloomberg is the founder of Bloomberg LP, the parent organization of Bloomberg News.The latest ballot victories mean a large swath of the Bay Area — with the bordering cities of San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and Albany — all embracing a similar policy.The amount of industry spending makes it clear that the soda companies think the taxes put a lot at stake, according to Marion Nestle, a New York University nutrition professor and author of ""Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning)."" These taxes will also inspire other communities to follow suit.""Why would you put millions and millions and millions of dollars into fighting this in every community that is coming up with one of these if you didn't think it would make a difference and a big one,"" she said. ""It will have an enormous impact.""
"
73,PEP,"CSX (CSX) shares tanked Friday, with the railroad operator losing billions in market value after reporting late Thursday that CEO Hunter Harrison — installed by activist investors at the start of this year — would take an unexpected medical leave of absence.X Jim Foote, chief operating officer since October, will temporarily assume the CEO position. He told investors in a Friday morning call that Harrison became ill last week after one of the chief executive's regular multiday pep-talks with management, and that the illness ""led to medical complications,"" The Wall Street Journal reported.Foote declined to discuss Harrison's medical condition and didn't divulge when the chief executive, who has been using an oxygen tank in recent months and largely working from his Florida home, might return, the Journal added.CSX plunged 7.6% to 52.93 on the stock market today. The sharp move lower saw the Florida railroader's stock undercut the 55.09 flat-base buy point it cleared in heavy volume just three weeks ago. Shares were right around their 50-day moving average after an intraday tumble to their 200-day line.Harrison's medical leave introduces incremental risk and uncertainty to CSX's  trajectory, Baird senior research analyst Benjamin Hartford wrote Friday. But with the stock near 50 and with  accelerating EBIT growth expected in upcoming quarters, Hartford sees a path to further outperformance.""We would be buyers on this morning's pullback,"" said Hartford. ""In our view, $48-50 offers near-term support.""Hartford has an outperform rating on CSX stock and a price target of 58.Among other railroad stocks, Union Pacific (UNP) added 1.1% to 130.57 while Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC) reversed higher for a 0.2% gain to 141.11. Union Pacific is extended from a breakout roughly two months ago, putting the stock out of buy range. Norfolk Southern is now just outside a buy zone that extends to roughly 141.All three stocks belong to the 20-member Dow Jones Transportation Average.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.According to the Journal, the CSX board was aware it was hiring a 73-year-old railroad veteran with ""known health risks,"" initially resisting pressure to do so from activist investor Mantle Ridge but finally agreeing to hire him.Harrison won a four-year contract, including an $84 million payment, with investor approval. Foote signaled CSX would continue with Harrison's ""disruptive"" turnaround strategy, featuring new train schedules, cost-cutting and terminal closures, but faced spiraling problems and customer complaints, the report said.CSX stock spiked massively at the start of 2017 when Harrison left Canadian Pacific (CP) to take over at CSX, raising hopes for a shake-up at the Florida company. But shares leveled off and moved sideways for several subsequent months before breaking out in late November.CSX matched earnings views in its last quarterly report, in mid October, but revenues slightly missed. Harrison said at the time the results reflected the resiliency of  the turnaround strategy he calls ""precision railroading"" and described the company's transition as ""largely behind us.""RELATED:Dow Stocks Lead Early Surge; Costco Gains, Top Railroad Sells OffOne Of The Hottest Dow Stocks Has A New Buy Point: Investing Action Plan

75,PEP,"Stocks finished mixed Tuesday, but Tesla (TSLA) had a very important session. Shares in the electric vehicle firm gained more than 3% in heavy trading and continued Monday's rebound back above the key 50- and 200-day moving averages.XA healthy growth stock tends to rise ahead of its 50-day moving average, which in turn is higher than the long-term 200-day moving average. The 200-day line covers roughly 10 months' worth of trading action. IBD daily charts show the 50-day moving average as a red line.Tesla, a June 2010 new issue, is getting an order of 100 electric semi trucks from soda and snack maker PepsiCo (PEP). Watch to see if the innovative transport and energy storage firm can form the right side of a potential first-stage base.Meanwhile, Bitcoin fever was unabated. The Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) shot 22% ahead to 2,273, breaking the 2,000 barrier for the first time. Volume zoomed 155% above the 50-day average to 232,500 shares.Bitcoin Investment Trust broke out of an extreme cup with handle that offered a 985.10 buy point, or 10 cents above the handle's intraday high of 985 seen on Nov. 3.The ETF has since gained more than 130% in the space of 14 sessions. At this point, Bitcoin Investment would have would have to fall more than 30% just to test the short-term 10-day moving average.Judging by the near-vertical slope of the recent move, it would not be a surprise if Bitcoin Investment Trust, which seeks to mirror the price movement of the actual digital currency, took a break soon and succumbed to profit-taking. However, the strong start of Bitcoin-related derivatives trading in the Chicago Board Options Exchange serves as a positive factor for potential rising demand.Gold futures, meanwhile, sank 0.4% to $1,241.70 a troy ounce on the Comex. Gold has now corrected 8% since hitting a high of $1,351 in early September.The Nasdaq fell nearly 0.2% amid weakness in Chinese internet and select retail firms as well as software and semiconductor shares. Biotech, homebuilding, mobile home and RV and biotech stocks also fell 1% or more.The S&P 500 advanced nearly 0.5%; the Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 0.2% and the S&P SmallCap 600 eased nearly 0.2%. Volume ran higher on both exchanges, according to early data.The Dow utility average dropped more than 1.9% to 748, marking its worst decline since a 1.9% slide on Feb. 1.Tesla broke out of a sloppy cup with handle with a 370.10 buy point in October, but did not hit new highs and flopped.The stock then undercut the low of that base, thus resetting the base count, a good thing. But Tesla will still need to prove to institutional investors that it will return to a path of profitability.Long-term shareholders who bought when the company broke out in the spring of 2013 near 40 still hold a marvelous profit cushion and have no reason at all to sell. Even at the Nov. 2 low of 292.63, the Elon Musk-led company stood just 25% below a 389.61 all-time high.Many great stocks fall that much in price and eventually form a solid base that spurs a breakout to fresh highs and profit opportunities for those who bought at the correct buy point.A typical cup with handle, cup without handle, or double bottom will feature a drop from head to toe of 12% to as much as 33% or more. These base-building activities reflect profit-taking by a certain group of holders. But in the best stocks, such sell-offs become short term in nature.Tesla is expected to post a 44% rise in revenue to $3.29 billion, but Wall Street analysts on consensus see the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company losing $3.08 a share vs. the 69 cents lost in the year-ago period.For 2018, the Street sees a net loss of $3.79 a share despite a 69% jump in sales to $19.82 billion.RELATED:When Is The Right Time To Sell Bitcoin?Can You Make A Million Dollars Trading ETFs?

80,PEP,"Energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST) reported mixed third-quarter results Wednesday after the market close.Estimates: Earnings per share growth of 21% to 40 cents, on revenue of $901 million, a 14% pop.Results: EPS rose to just 38 cents. Net sales rose 15% to $909.5 million.Stock: Monster Beverage fell 5.5% to 54.80 in after-hours trading, suggesting the stock will undercut a flat-base 57.35 entry. During the regular session, shares closed up 0.1% at 58 in the stock market today.Wall Street will likely be looking for signs indicating whether the company can keep growing internationally. Results in the U.S. could also be a focus as that segment laps easy comparisons.Monster's biggest growth prospects lie outside the U.S., analysts say, in large part through the expanded access to Coca-Cola's (KO) bottling and distribution network that the company gained via a deal announced in 2014.The company earlier this year began distributing through Coca-Cola bottlers in parts of the Caribbean and in nations like Jordan and Pakistan. In August, Monster said it would expand in Africa and that it continued to ""make progress"" toward a relaunch in India planned for this year.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said she'd be watching for updates on those regions as well as plans to begin distribution via Coca-Cola bottlers in Taiwan and Vietnam. Trends surrounding Mutant, an ultra-caffeinated response to PepsiCo's (PEP) Mountain Dew, and Hydro, an ultra-caffeinated response to water, are also points of interest.Monster's results also come as soda demand wanes amid a wellness boom. Cannabis also appears likely to grow as a rival to alcohol and caffeine in the beverage industry. Some companies already use THC and CBD in coffees, teas and sports drinks. Cowen cites ""emerging access to legal cannabis"" as an investment risk for Monster.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.Some alcohol companies have begun to stir as marijuana-related startups proliferate.

And while sales fell 6.9% to $10.6 billion, that beat analysts' $10.5 billion average projection.With consumers in developed markets abandoning soda for healthier beverages, Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has changed Coca-Cola's focus from boosting sales volume to increasing profit. His $3 billion cost-cutting initiative -- as well as a push to get consumers to buy smaller bottles and cans that sell for a higher price per ounce -- have supported earnings.

Coca-Cola is partnering with Dunkin' Donuts to expand its presence in the U.S. bottled iced-coffee market.Sales volume for non-soda drinks, which Coca-Cola refers to as still beverages, rose 2% in North America last quarter, driven by water and sports drinks. Volume for sparkling beverages on the continent was ""slightly positive,"" the company said. Pricing in the North American soda business rose 3%, helped by the smaller-package strategy.

So its focus is on the stocks that fared best as a group in the latest week. Lipper's large-cap growth category topped all U.S. diversified stock fund groups that don't do a lot of shorting, hedging or borrowing by losing the least in the week, 0.56%.Some large-cap tech names are prominent among a narrowing group of stocks providing market leadership. The fund's top five holdings included several of them, such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Alphabet rose 1.6% in the week. Amazon gained about 2%.Top holdings also include Apple (AAPL), which lost 2.3%; Visa (V), which slid 0.9%; and PepsiCo (PEP), which fizzled 0.6%.One reason why large-cap stocks did relatively well is an ongoing rotation into that category. Many investors see large caps as better positioned to withstand uncertain economic growth, says David Joy, chief market strategist of Ameriprise Financial.And a reason why growth stocks did well was that investors were avoiding value-oriented stocks. Higher-dividend stocks tend to be value-oriented, says Craig Ferrantino, president of Craig James Financial Services, in Melville, N.Y. ""And in a rising-rate environment, those don't do as well (in general) as growth stocks.""Another reason is that many investors expect to see an increase in corporate capital expenditures in 2016, which should benefit growth stocks more than value, he adds.

96,PEP,"It's the most exclusive club for financiers in Dallas. With seven Jeffersonian-style buildings and manicured lawns, Old Parkland looks more like a college campus than a hive of private-equity firms, hedge funds, foundations and family offices.But the 9.5-acre site, where an abandoned hospital once stood, is now home to some of the city's wealthiest investors.Old Parkland is the pet project of Harlan Crow, 66, a son of swashbuckling real estate developer Trammell Crow, whose empire was in tatters when he gave up control in the late 1980s. It's also a symbol of a decades-long effort to rebuild the family's legacy. Step inside any of the buildings and you might think you're in a museum, with Rodin sculptures in the hallways, a 17th century antique sofa in a lobby and, on display, a piece of curtain Abraham Lincoln is said to have grabbed after being shot.""When I got involved in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was not really clear that our company was going to survive,"" Crow said, sitting in a wood-paneled room in his Old Parkland office, just past a Rembrandt Peale portrait of George Washington, a stain on the lapel of Crow's rumpled suit jacket and a piece of white printer paper stuffed haphazardly in a pocket.After nine years of renovation and expansion, the complex is now home to TRT Holdings, owner of Omni Hotels and Gold's Gym; Highside Capital Management, the hedge fund turned family office led by Lee Hobson; an outpost of Boston-based real estate private-equity firm Rockpoint Group; and the investment company of Roger Enrico, former CEO of PepsiCo (PEP). Residency is by invitation only.Statuary GardenAt the center of this financial hub is Crow Holdings, an $8.6 billion investment firm built on the remains of Trammell Crow's real estate empire that included the Dallas Market Center, San Francisco's Embarcadero Center, the Wyndham Hotel chain and thousands of homes. The Wall Street Journal in 1986 called Crow the largest landlord in the U.S.Harlan Crow has spent the past quarter-century making his family wealth about more than the buildings bought and constructed by his father. A prominent Republican contributor and friend of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Crow hosted a fundraiser at his $39 million home last year for Marco Rubio. He has amassed a collection of historical documents that includes Walter Raleigh's last plea to King James, written a month before his execution in 1618, a memo from Lincoln condemning slavery written before he decided to run for president, and a signed copy of Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kampf.""He also has a collection of statues in his backyard that he jokingly calls his ""Garden of Evil."" There's Vladimir Lenin, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro.Crow said he likes hunting for the best statues from dying regimes, though there's also one of Margaret Thatcher on display.'Wildly Optimistic'""My father was wildly optimistic, and most of what he thought would happen did,"" Crow said. ""I have a little bit of a mentality that the world is dangerous and the only thing you can really do is be morally, mentally and physically strong. The rest of the stuff, well, you just do the best you can.""Old Parkland was built on the site of the original Parkland Hospital, which opened in 1894. A new hospital had already been built by the time President Kennedy was shot during a Dallas motorcade in 1963 and rushed to the facility where he pronounced dead, and Old Parkland had been converted into a treatment center for tuberculosis and psychiatric patients.The building fell into disrepair, was covered with graffiti and became a blight on a gentrifying neighborhood five minutes from Dallas's downtown and the same distance from its priciest neighborhood, Highland Park, where Crow lives.Today, Old Parkland charges among the highest office rents in Dallas. It has a restaurant, a barbershop, a gym and a circular underground debate hall. A statue of Alexis de Tocqueville overlooks a central courtyard, and Crow said he plans to install a painting of George W. Bush standing in the wreckage of the World Trade Center towers.""There's a feeling of university campus more than an office building,"" said Ben Weinstein, a managing director at Korenvaes Management, the family office for the founder of hedge fund HBK Investments. He used the campus network to raise money to fund the purchase of Super Chix, a fried-chicken sandwich restaurant concept, from Yum Brands (YUM) in August.""It's nice,"" he said, "" to be part of a network that shares.""

100,PEP,"A presidential campaign is figuratively called a ""race."" Two runners sprint toward the Election Day finish line for the prize of the presidency.But the 2016 presidential campaign has spawned lots of weird races.The first sprint is one between embarrassments and scandals.Will another WikiLeaks disclosure confirm that Hillary Clinton is a dishonest and conniving hypocrite? Or will yet another open-mic tape, disgruntled beauty queen or old Howard Stern interview remind us that Donald Trump's private life was -- and perhaps still is -- uncouth?The winner will be the candidate leaked about the least by Election Day.Here, Trump might have an odd edge. Even the most lurid disclosures will only confirm what we already knew about his vulgarity. But any more leaks about Clinton could shatter the crumbling facade depicting her as a highly respected and ethical establishmentarian.Another race is between the relative health of the two candidates.At 68, Clinton seems too frail. At 70, Trump seems too frenetic. This race is nearing the home stretch to see whether Clinton stumbles, nearly faints or goes into a coughing fit. Or will the sleepless Trump stay on his Twitter feed at 3 a.m. to self-destruct in feuds with another former beauty queen or Republican kingpin?Democrats want to pep up Clinton. Republicans want to calm down Trump. For now, worries over Clinton's poor health seem to be outracing Trump's nocturnal mania.A third race is one of defections within the candidates' respective parties.Leaked emails revealed that in the primaries, the Clinton campaign colluded with the supposedly neutral Democratic National Committee. The leaks also confirmed that Clinton's team derided Bernie Sanders' youthful mob of supporters as a conglomeration of snotty perpetual adolescents stuck in their parents' basements. During his campaign, Sanders charged that Clinton was a Wall Street toady. Clinton denied it. Leaks substantiated Sanders' claim.Will Clinton manage to turn off as many Sanders supporters as Trump has members of the Republican establishment?Trump is now not just at war with Clinton and the liberal media. He is in mortal combat against almost all the Republican bluestockings of the Washington-New York corridor, along with most of the traditional conservative media and consulting class.For now, Trump's civil war has a far higher body count than Clinton's.There is a fourth race between two quite different media.Traditional media sources -- the three major network news outlets, the flagship New York Times and Washington Post, the public affiliates NPR and PBS, the hip late-night TV shows, the Hollywood-celebrity venues -- are unabashedly pro-Clinton. Several of America's highest-ranking news kingpins are married or related to stalwarts of the Obama administration, and journalists are likewise connected to the Clintons' campaigns, past and present. Supposedly neutral debate moderators and fact-checkers are also unabashedly pro-Clinton.Against these fixtures of some 70 years is pitted a louder outlaw media.Talk-radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham, edgy internet sites such as Breitbart News and the Drudge Report, some of the hosts on the Fox News Channel and a number of assorted bloggers are overtly pro-Trump.If spirit and passion rather than manners won races, then the unorthodox pro-Trump media would beat the predictable pro-Clinton media. But so far, Clinton is reaching far more voters with the old media than Trump is with the new.There is yet another race between the grating personalities of the candidates themselves.In the next three weeks, will voters finally tire of Trump's empty and over-the-top superlatives, such as ""tremendous,"" ""awesome"" and ""great,"" or his periodic meltdown rants in defense of his business career?Or will we become even more exhausted by Clinton's inadvertent depiction of the aggravating Nurse Ratched character from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""? The more we hear Trump go off, the more we hear in reply Clinton's canned monotony. Yet her contrived calmness is still preferable to her occasional screeching when excited.There are two final races, the most important of all: money and time.The billionaire wheeler-dealer Trump oddly has raised far less cash than the supposedly progressive, anti-Wall Street Clinton.More valuable than even money is time. Clinton is ahead, sitting on her lead. Trump is behind, in need of another two weeks beyond Election Day.The money and the clock races usually trump all others.Mostly reliable traditional polls -- Gallup, Reuters, etc. -- seem to be assuring us of a Clinton landslide. A few quirky outlier daily-tracking surveys -- such as those of the L.A. Times and Rasmussen -- on some days have the race about even or have Trump slightly ahead.In this outlandish year, the winner will be the survivor who crawls barely alive over the Nov. 8 finish line -- without having been blown up.

Growth was flat in SodaStream's Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa segment.Birnbaum also highlighted expense optimization and the consolidation of the company's manufacturing, logistics and distribution activities in Israel.""This has resulted in an all-time record operating and net income year, strong free cash flow and $57 million in cash and deposits with zero financial debt,"" he said.

107,PEP,"After a mild pullback in April, and again in mid-May, low volatility ETFs are on the upswing again. These strategies cushion portfolios against big market drawdowns like the ones investors saw early this year.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility (XMLV) posted a fresh 52-week high of 38.09 on the stock market today. Its bolting RS line is a sign that it is outperforming the benchmark S&P 500.The exchange traded fund invests in roughly 80 of the least volatile midcap stocks, including salvaged-car auctioneer Copart (CPRT), ranked No. 1 by IBD in the auto parts industry group.Stocks with the lowest price volatility get the biggest weighting in the XMLV portfolio.However, two industry experts strike notes of caution about this popular asset class.Low volatility ETFs tend to be stuffed with more established, dividend-paying names. A potential Fed interest-rate hike in June or July could dent high-dividend sectors such as utilities or consumer staples, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote June 1. His research note preceded Friday's dismal jobs report, which was perceived to set back the likelihood of an imminent rate hike.Rosenbluth suggests that investors may want to consider a small, new rival to the hugely popular iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV).Like SPLV, PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility (XRLV) invests in low volatility stocks in the S&P 500. But there's a difference.SPLV looks for the 100 stocks with the lowest volatility over the past 12 months. XRLV invests in the 100 stocks that show both low volatility and low interest-rate risk. It removes stocks that have historically lagged when rates are rising.XRLV has a zero weighting in utilities and 14.6% in consumer staples, both of which are rate-sensitive sectors. By comparison, SPLV has 21.1% and 20.8% weightings in the respective sectors. Also, XRLV has a 17.5% weighting in the financial sector vs. 13.0% for SPLV. Banks and some other financial services tend to benefit from increasing rates.Coca-Cola (KO), Waste Management (WM) and PepsiCo (PEP) and a host of other stocks are common to both portfolios.But medical equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and credit-ratings agency Equifax (EFX) are among XRLV holdings not to be found in SPLV.As a new ETF, XRLV should be traded with care.Moreover, low volatility stocks may be starting to look expensive. ""As more money has piled in (to low or minimum volatility ETFs), valuations have richened commensurately,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar Inc., wrote in a May report.Johnson looked at the historical relationship between the beginning value of the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index's price-to-cash-earnings ratio and subsequent 3-year annualized returns. He found that the richer the starting valuation, the lower the ensuing return.""At current levels, newcomers to the low volatility part could be setting themselves up for disappointing future returns,"" Johnson cautioned.This year, low volatility ETFs focused on U.S. large caps have surged in popularity.IShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) absorbed a staggering $5.37 billion in new money through May, more than any other equity exchange traded fund. PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) soaked in $1.04 billion over the same period.Smart fund investors are looking beyond large caps for less risky stocks. Both XMLV and PowerShares S&P SmallCap Low Volatility (XSLV) have positive net flow year to date.They're outperforming their large-cap peers too. XMLV was up 11.6% year to date through June 2 vs. 8.9% for XSLV, 6.8% for XRLV and 6.6% for SPLV.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad market, gained 4.0%.

139,PEP,"Smart ETF investors stay tuned for opportunities in the stock market as sectors rise and fall, styles ebb and flow, and factors come and go.Take the case of iShares Edge Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV). The two exchange traded funds target volatility, one of several ""factors"" or drivers of returns that are historically proven to add value to stocks.With the use of factors, ETF investors hope to achieve attractive or enhanced portfolio returns across full market cycles, notwithstanding periodic bouts of sunshine and squall.For instance, USMV and SPLV limped through the third quarter after bolting ahead of the S&P 500 in the first two. Investors coveted the low-volatility style earlier this year, but on the stock market today these ETFs lurched to or near June lows.It's the nature of factor-based exchange traded funds to outperform in some markets and underperform in others. So in the spirit of staying tuned for opportunity, as successful investors do, which factor ought to be on your radar?Quality, according to PowerShares. That basically means financially sound companies, typically those with stable earnings growth. PowerShares is a pioneer in the world of factor-based, alternatively weighted ETFs. These funds stray from the traditional cap weighting of stock holdings and also go by the names smart beta or strategic beta.""Quality is a step up from volatility,"" said Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares. He likes the quality factor now because it offers more upside participation while also buffering against downside risk, though to a lesser degree than low-volatility strategies.Kalivas sees in quality ""a factor that makes sense"" when investors are starting to position for a recovery in corporate profits, but aren't unfettered by worries.Two of the largest ETFs offering exposure to this factor are iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL) and PowerShares S&P 500 Quality (SPHQ). They hold more than $4 billion in assets combined.Quality factor ETFs invest in profitable U.S. firms, with solid earnings growth and low risk. Both QUAL and SPHQ choose stocks based on measures such as return on equity, financial leverage and cash flow. Each counts industry giants PepsiCo (PEP) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) among stock holdings.There are differences between them, however.QUAL avoids big sector bets. SPHQ offers a more pure focus on the quality factor. The former is younger, but larger in assets. It holds a more diversified basket of stocks and has a far lower 0.15% expense ratio.Year to date through Oct. 5, SPHQ is up 9.0% and QUAL 5.5%, while the market-proxy SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) has advanced 7.4%. SPHQ also performed better over the last three years, averaging a 12.1% gain.IBD'S TAKE: An uncertain outlook for interest rates and a divided Fed are among the issues weighing on stock market investors.Bear in mind that good companies don't always make good investments, as Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan wryly notes. He wrote in August that quality stocks seldom offer eye-popping returns and tend to lag in strong market rallies, although they hold up better during market downturns.Rather than getting shaken out in volatile markets, investors may want to consider a long-term allocation to quality factor ETFs, according to PowerShares.Kalivas described SPHQ as both a nice core holding in portfolios and a potential tactical opportunity.Don't take that last bit to mean you should jump headlong from volatility- to quality-focused strategies. Factor timing requires expertise and skill.Investing in multifactor ETFs may be a better approach for most investors. These funds are an alternative to trying to combine or time single factors on one's own.IShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA (LRGF) combines the quality factor with value, size and momentum. So does JHancock Multifactor Large Cap (JHML).Combining factors takes advantage of their low correlations with one another and their tendency to perform well at different times.RELATED:Which Of The Best ETF Investment Strategies Is Right For Your Portfolio?

140,PEP,"Tommy Tibajia, a star pilot in the rapidly-growing arena of drone racing, initially turned down Mountain Dew's offer to sponsor him. He'd flown drones as a hobby and entered the occasional competition.Videos showing a drone's-eye-view of beaches, parks and neighborhoods accumulated on the YouTube channel under his pilot nickname ""UmmaGawd."" He began to build an online following, and helped start a drone-focused web program called Rotor Riot, which as of mid-September had nearly 50,000 YouTube subscribers.Still, he said, he was working as a business consultant for a Fortune 500 company. He had reservations about leaving. But what started out as a hobby had gained more media attention, and Mountain Dew, owned by PepsiCo (PEP), was persistent with its offer. So Tibajia agreed and, after some nine years at his day job, quit.The sponsorship, Tibajia said, has given him more practice time and helped with travel bookings, hotel arrangements and purchasing racing parts for drones.""I was like, 'There's a whole ecosystem building around this. I gotta do this,' "" he told IBD at the DR1 Invitational race at Los Angeles' Sepulveda Dam in June. ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.""Finding practice space can be difficult. Pilots sometimes practice in abandoned, graffitied warehouses, factories or other buildings — in part for the dramatic footage — or parks when they're not crowded. Zachry Thayer, one pilot at the DR1 race, said he was from California but recently moved to Colorado with another pilot, in part because the airspace was less crowded.Steele Davis, the host of the event, said he can show up to competitions with up to $5,000 of equipment, including two to three aircraft, goggles, radios, airframes and batteries.And the overlap between aviation, gaming and general nerd-dom (e.g., a drone re-enactment of ""Star Wars"") can run deep.""There are people who pinch and who thumb,"" Brad Foxhoven, CEO of Blockade Entertainment, one of the DR1 race's organizers, told the Nerdist at the event. ""The guys who thumb — guaranteed they're probably gamers, because they grew up with the controllers.""The DR1 Invitational at the Sepulveda Dam took place on a bright, hot, quiet day and was sparsely attended. The event wasn't broadcast on a television network (it was broadcast on Amazon.com's (AMZN) Twitch), so the crew took their time setting up for each round of races.But as drones become a bigger business, stiffer competition and politics certainly seem possible. Indeed, Walt Disney's (DIS) ESPN will broadcast Drone Racing League competitions and began with an introductory program on Thursday night.Scot Refsland, chairman of the Drone Sports Association, said a separate ESPN deal to air the National Drone Racing Championships in August hadn't exactly made him wealthy. Some worry that the camaraderie formed when the DIY community was smaller might be sacrificed.""I fear that, yes,"" said Justin Haggerty, the founder of the International Drone Racing Association, adding that his organization's plans to focus more on education ""will help create a more knowledgeable fan base and grow our market.""Prior to the Drone Nationals ESPN broadcast, the Drone Sports Association, formerly known as Rotor Sports, planned to acquire IDRA. That merger, Refsland said, would have combined IDRA's younger talent with DSA's connections to bigger tech players, networks and potential sponsors.Drone racing leagues sometimes share ideas on how to organize races, and sometimes develop their own software to do so. The two groups over the past year became ""quite friendly"" as they shared technology to help each other out, Refsland said. But the merger attempt failed, with two members of IDRA going to DSA, and IDRA no longer a participant in the ESPN broadcast.Not long after, IDRA announced that it would partner with a Korean drone-racing league to hold the GiGA World Masters race on Haeundae Beach in Busan, South Korea, an event sponsored by KT Corp. (KT), a Korean telecom giant. Haggerty said KT has been looking at ways to broadcast via drones.""It's the golden hour,"" Refsland said. ""And the golden hour for us is that there is literally territorial staking and land-claiming going all the way up and down the chain.""RELATED:Why The Next Apple Could Come From A Drone WildcatterWhat's Next For Drones?

141,PEP,"While exchange traded funds are ideal for producing short- and long-term investment gains, many ETFs can be deployed to generate steady income from stock dividends and bond interest.ETF investment strategies for generating income fall into five main categories:The highest yielding U.S. bond ETF tracked by Morningstar Inc. right now is SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK). Its 12- month yield sits near 6%. It's followed by First Trust Tactical High Yield (HYLS) yielding 5.6% and SPDR Short-Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) yielding 5.5%.But seeing a fat yield on an ETF can be misleading. A big payout doesn't mean as much if the fund's total return is slipping. JNK has returned 11.31% year to date and an average annual 2.53% the past three years. That compares with 7.16% and 4.13% for HYLS and 10.8% and 1.64% for SJNK.Ranked by three-year returns, the top performer is Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury (ZROZ), up an average annual 18.39% the past three years and 20.44% year to date, and yielding just over 2%. It is followed by Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV), up 17.1% and 18.6% over the respective periods, and yielding 2.4%. Next is iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond, at 11.8% and 13.1%, and yielding 2.2%.Junk bonds and long-duration Treasury bonds are subject to bouts of heightened volatility, which investors looking for income often seek to avoid. So they're better off using ETFs that track these kinds of bonds as part of a diversified portfolio that contains steadier bonds.The benchmark for diversified bond portfolios is the Barclays Aggregate Bond index, which is made up of a broad array of investment-grade bonds. The index is tracked by iShares Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG), which has $190 billion in assets. It's up 5% year to date and an average annual 3.96% the past three years. It yields 2.3%.Those who prefer bonds need to be aware that anticipated interest-rate hikes could affect potential returns.In general, bond ETFs with higher durations will be more negatively impacted than those with shorter durations as expectations increase for higher rates. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond price to changes in interest rates. Duration is tied to a bond's maturity, or the date at which the bond's principal is repaid to lenders. Investors can check an ETF's website for the average duration.For example, if rates rise, a long-term ETF such as iShares 20 Year Treasury (TLT) incurs more interest rate risk than iShares 3-7 Year Treasury (IEI), notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In short, if rates trend higher over time, returns for bond ETFs will be negatively impacted, but not equally,"" he said. ""However, one rate hike by the Fed should not be that impactful.""The highest yielding ETFs can bring big payouts, but if the quality of their holdings declines, the total return could be sapped by declining prices in unfavorable markets. The top yielding dividend stock ETF is Global X SuperDividend Alternatives (ALTY), paying out 8.2% of its stock price annually. It's a small, young ETF with just $3 million in assets and without a three-year record. It's up almost 19% this year.Its older and bigger sibling, $807.4 million Global X SuperDividend (SDIV), yields 6.7% and has gained 12% this year and an average annual 11.27% the past three years.High-yield stock investors tend to prefer stocks whose declines are about over. In that way investors can reap big payouts for each dollar invested with the hopes of capital appreciation as the business turns around. Not all ETFs screens for stocks in this way. One that does is Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV). Its index methodology screens for stocks that have exhibited low betas relative to the S&P 500 in an effort to produce low-volatility of returns. It's up 9% this year and has risen an average annual 6.8% the past three years. Top holdings include Cone Midstream Partners (CNNX) and Invesco Mortgage Capital (IVR).At the other end of the spectrum, lower yielding ETFs invest in companies that have a long history of increasing dividends. Only top quality companies can increase payouts year after year, and they tend to be in big demand by investors looking for steady capital appreciation. Their stock prices rarely get whacked to the point where they have big yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more. It yields 2.1% vs. SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 2%. Top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Pepsi (PEP)ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more. It yields 1.8%. Top holdings include Cintas (CTAS), W.W. Grainger (GWW) and S&P Global (SPGI).SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 15% year to date. It yields 2.4%. Top holdings include property REIT HCP (HCP), People's United Financial (PBCT) and Caterpillar (CAT).Safe to say, MLPs are best left to the pros who know when to get in or out, or how to use them as portfolio diversifiers.Morningstar tracks 20 REIT ETFs. The top-performing one year to date is Global X SuperDividend REIT (SRET). It's up 27.4% this year and yields about 8%, the third-highest. The index it tracks, the Solactive Global SuperDividend REIT index, invests in 30 of the highest dividend-yielding REITs in the world with the least amount of volatility.Nearly all of the $33 million ETF's assets are invested in North America. Top holdings include mortgage REITs Annaly Capital Management (NLY), which yields 10.1%, and Chimera Investment (CIM), yielding nearly 12%, as well as property REIT Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) yielding 6.6%. The REIT was launched in March 2015.The biggest REIT ETF is $35.59 billion Vanguard REIT (VNQ). It's up 14% year to date and yields 3.3%. Its top holdings along with their year-to-date price performance include Simon Property (SPG), up 12%, Public Storage[ticker symb=PSA] down 7%, and Prologis (PLD) up 30%. They all yield about 3%.Convertible bonds are bonds that can be exchanged for a set number of the issuing company's common stock. They tend to carry lower interest than normal corporate bonds but have the potential for greater price appreciation.The top performing ETF in this area year to date is $471 million VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials (PFXF). It's up 12% and yields 5.6%. The largest is $17.86 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF). It's up 3.8% this year and yields 5.74%.RELATED:The Latest ETF News

143,PEP,"At this summer's DR1 Invitational race at Los Angeles' Sepulveda Dam, a vast, sun-baked plane of concrete, drones the size of overgrown insects carved wide cursive loops through the dam's broad archways. They threaded through slalom posts and shipping containers, punctuated by saw-toothed bursts from their rotors, and sailed to the finish line past a handful of quiet spectators and a few white tents containing tables scattered with toolboxes, extra drones and extra parts.The drones themselves can hit speeds of 80 miles per hour. And they crash a lot -- propellers snap off, frames get bent, the GoPro (GPRO) cameras often mounted to drones to capture video get smashed. That also means the pilots can gauge more quickly what propellers, batteries, frames and controllers work and which don't.""You'll find the technology in the drones that we're racing is newer than most of what is used in commercial applications, or in even military applications, because our development time is so rapid,"" said Chris Thomas, founder of the racing league MultiGP, which helped organize the race. ""We're creating this massive furnace for innovation.""The sport has grown big enough that Disney's (DIS) ESPN will air races and started with an introductory program Thursday. Meanwhile, Amazon's (AMZN) drone delivery plans and Facebook's (FB) intentions to use drones to strengthen internet access are helping to push the aircraft into the mainstream. But flying under the radar is a loosely-knit community of tinkerers creating a groundswell of activity that some have compared with the early years of the PC revolution embodied by Apple (AAPL) a generation ago.And as these drone wildcatters stumble upon ways to improve the aerial devices -- and forge a regulatory framework -- an array of companies is also circling to tap into the entrepreneurial energy.""The drone industry is probably one of the first open-source hardware industries,"" said James Peverill, CEO of GreenSight Agronomics, a Boston-based startup that uses drones for agricultural imaging and analytics and which has done work with golf courses and agrochemical giant Syngenta (SYT).""It almost harkens back to the beginnings of the personal computer industry,"" he added. ""In the late 70s, people were experimenting with computers in the basement, and when Apple Computer was founded, they basically used a lot of the ideas and technology from that DIY community that had hatched.""While few public companies are pure-play drone stocks, the financial industry has been offering broader exposure to the market. PureFunds describes its Drone Economy Strategy ETF (IFLY), which debuted in March, as the first exchange traded fund devoted to tracking the commercial drone market.The fund's holdings include Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other defense contractors, drone-maker AeroVironment (AVAV), GoPro and its chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA).""We've seen drones start to transcend the initial aerospace and defense uses into many different industries and sectors around the world,"" PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin told IBD. ""Trying to play the drone industry -- or any early-stage industry -- by picking one or two companies can be a pretty difficult and volatile proposition.""Amazon has been approved to test delivery drones in the U.K, and Alphabet (GOOGL) this summer got the OK for limited delivery-drone testing in the U.S. But despite the entrance of several tech Goliaths, the drone space is still so wide open that upstarts can aim high.Back when Amazon's drone plans were in a younger stage, Skycart, a drone delivery startup in San Jose, Calif., that started roughly four years ago, was trying to sell companies on the idea of using drones to send things.""Those companies thought we were joking,"" said Lukas Wrede, the company's CEO.Then, Amazon published a video demonstrating Prime Air, its future drone delivery service, and Wrede initially thought Skycart was done for. But he rethought.""If such a big company gets a lot of attention and they also have a powerful lobby, then they could probably influence the market in our interest,"" he said. ""And that's what they did.""Skycart also continued to improve its drone technology, enhancing its autonomous-flight and drop-off capabilities and its abilities to carry packages weighing 10 pounds, up from an earlier target of 5. Today, Skycart has started several delivery projects with their customers, which Wrede characterized as Amazon rivals who have become more aware of the possibilities of drone delivery. Among them is one of the biggest shipping express companies in the U.S., but he declined to identify it.Meanwhile, at the University of Southern California, assistant professor John Carlsson has been developing a delivery model in which drones carrying packages bounce between a moving delivery truck and their destination -- potentially cutting time, traffic and fuel costs.His means of testing this particular model? A drone and a skateboard. Still, he said, he has been approached by a handful of companies, including a multibillion-dollar retailer that sells a variety of products, but which he said is ""not Amazon.""He said he will be ""working on a project with them that will involve drones"" in the next several months that will either incorporate the delivery model or his other drone-related research, which has been backed by U.S. defense funding.""The kind of thing that we work on specifically is really applicable to any situation where you have one large vehicle, and a collection of smaller vehicles that are somehow tied to that,"" he said.As more drones swarm the skies and raise the risk of midair collisions, regulations have struggled to catch up, forcing the community of drone racers and other enthusiasts to cobble together solutions -- similar to the way they improvise technologies for their drones.The Sepulveda Dam race was two years in the making, said Brad Foxhoven, CEO Blockade Entertainment, one of the DR1 race's organizers. Thomas, of MultiGP, said that conversations had to happen between the site's owner and with the FAA, and a film permit had to be obtained.""Nothing like that has ever been permitted before,"" he said. ""We essentially had to look toward the jungle, take out our machetes and cut a path. We're building a sport from scratch.""Permitting, in general, though, is ""like they're trying to put a round peg into a square hole,"" Thomas said.The FAA and Transportation Department in June finalized regulations for small drone use, and the rules took hold last month. Still, some state and local officials are seeing a drone up close for the first time and regulators face information gaps. For example, the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act requires drone operators within five miles of an airport to notify that airport of their presence, but the lines of communication weren't always clear. So companies saw an opening.""People were knocking on the door of the airport manager or calling on the phone and saying 'Hey I'm going to fly my drone at the 7-Eleven,' "" said Ben Marcus, CEO and co-founder of Santa-Monica-based tech company AirMap. ""Airport managers were like: 'What am I supposed to do with that?' ""AirMap's technology offers up a smartphone-accessible map of what's happening in the low-altitude airspace. Their technology lets airports know what drones are in the skies nearby, and provides a communications platform between pilots, airports and others. If you're flying a drone and, say, a jet approaches, AirMap will send an alert. The technology can also provide information on temporary flight restrictions -- wildfires, a sporting event, presidential visits, Marcus said.More than 100 airports use AirMap's technology, including Los Angeles International Airport, Houston's George Bush Intercontinental and other U.S. hubs, said co-founder Gregory McNeal.""Ultimately, when Amazon and Google and other companies are looking to make deliveries, they're going to need to know about all of these types of pieces of low-altitude airspace information, some of which is dynamic,"" McNeal said. ""So the county fair comes to town, and the Ferris wheel goes up. The Amazon drone should know about that before it ever gets to the county fair.""Back at the DR1 race, the Sepulveda Dam was decorated with logos for Pepsico's (PEP) Mountain Dew and Doritos as well as Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD). The event was broadcast on Twitch, the gaming-centric streaming service Amazon bought in 2014. And in August, the 2016 National Drone Racing Championships took place in New York, an event broadcast via ESPN.And in separate announcements Wednesday, ESPN and U.K. media giant Sky struck deals with the Drone Racing League, another racing group, to broadcast five races over 10 episodes. An introductory broadcast is set to air Thursday on ESPN2, with the others to be broadcast there, ESPN and Sky Sports Mix in October. Sky, which is 39% owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA), also invested $1 million in the league.Blockade Entertainment's Foxhoven, meanwhile, said his company has had ""multiple conversations"" with people in the e-sports industry, some of whom attended the DR1 Invitational.As the racing community gains more mass appeal, the innovations it has made are starting to trickle out. The Drone Racing League has had ""quite a few outside parties"" approach them about potentially licensing its radio-system technology for non-drone-racing uses, founder and CEO Nicholas Horbaczewski said.""It's been fun to discover that in the process of developing this for a particular purpose, in this case sports, we've developed technology that has a broader application that can be used in other capacities in a positive and productive way,"" he said in an interview.Peverill, of GreenSight Agronomics, said his company uses a flight controller sometimes used in racing. And some companies are also scoping out racing events to see how drones can help their own products.Staff from GoPro, the event's title sponsor, attended the National Drone Racing Championships partly to get more of a sense of how drones could be used to provide more immersive, closer-to-actually-being-there camera work, said Scot Refsland, chairman of the Drone Sports Association, which organized the event.Enterprise data-storage giant EMC (EMC), which also backed the event, ran live demos of virtual reality technology there. AIG (AIG), a partner in the event and an issuer of drone insurance, has been working with the DSA to generate ideas on how to improve insurance for aerial devices as low-altitude airspace grows more crowded and complicated, Refsland said.Elsewhere, Justin Haggerty, founder of the competing International Drone Racing Association, said his organization has attracted interest from telecommunications companies looking to learn more about their technology. Among them was Korean telecom giant KT Corp. (KT), which Haggerty said is looking at ways to use drones for broadcasting.Meanwhile, the educational nonprofit Drones Pilot Federation sees drone racing as a crossover into education. Henry Minden, a vice president in the group, said the aerial devices have the potential to teach younger people, ages 12 to 30, about computer programming, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and assembly, and create new jobs in those areas.""You want to know how to go faster than the rest,"" he said. ""So you find yourself immersed in this world of physics, aerodynamics, electrical engineering and computer science.""In the process, many people involved in the informal community of drone enthusiasts have become advocates for wider application of the devices, which are still best known for their years of use in the military.""If I could just share this with more people, and especially take away the negative connotations,"" said Tommy Tibajia, one of the pilots at the DR1 race. ""Because, whenever I'm flying, (people) are like, 'Stop spying on me!' I'm like, 'Lady, trust me. I'm not spying on you.'

147,PEP,"Remember whenever an American president stepped out on the world stage and we could each feel quietly proud of our elected chief executive? We knew he felt the same warm pride in the United States that we did. We knew, as he did, that it's not a perfect place. But it is the best one yet conceived. And always striving to improve.And we could count on a president to play a strong leadership role globally not just in words, but deeds as well. If he promised -- or threatened -- something, it would happen.Instead we get Barack ""That's Not Who We Are"" Obama, on his second international trip in as many weeks, again apologizing and portraying the United States as a culprit. Like some 150 other national leaders, Obama laid a jet-engine carbon footprint all the way to the Paris global warming summit to discuss the allegedly deleterious problem of carbon footprints on Earth.Speakers were allotted three minutes apiece for introductory remarks. Obama took 14 because, Obama.""I’ve come here personally,"" he said, ""as the leader of the world’s largest economy and the second-largest emitter, to say that the United States of America not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it.""Late last month in a Malaysian town-hall the first black American president took the opportunity to detail for Asians many of his country's ""pitfalls,"" including longstanding racial and economic inequalities, plus pride. ""The United States has to have some humility,"" said Obama, who could use some too, ""because there have been times where we did the wrong thing.""Besides themselves contributing to global warming, Obama's 1,750 words in Paris were largely pep-rally remarks, portraying the roughly five-billion-year-old planet as basically doomed until this magical meeting in France, ""a turning point, that is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet.""He described for attendees the devastated Alaska he visited last summer, beset by seas ""already swallowing villages,"" erosion, glaciers that melt in the summer, burning forests and tundra.That's merely a preview of the future, Obama said, ""a glimpse of our children’s fate if the climate keeps changing faster than our efforts to address it. Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields that no longer grow. Political disruptions that trigger new conflict, and even more floods of desperate peoples seeking the sanctuary of nations not their own.""Yes, yes, of course, community organizers must perceive dire situations everywhere. Otherwise, how could they fool people into accepting them?  He has, however, gotten pretty tiresome with his never-ending litany of American faults.Obama did get one thing right in Paris. He said, ""One of the enemies that we'll be fighting at this conference is cynicism.""Perhaps Obama was channeling another Democrat president, Woodrow Wilson whose failed League of Nations notion almost a century ago, also in Paris, helped set the stage for World War II.Gee, where could that cynicism have come from? After 2,506 days under the political pall of Obama, here's a clue:A doubling of the national debt despite Obama promises of fiscal restraint. No explosion of new jobs after Obama promises that a trillion dollars in spending would produce them. No consequences at all for the murderers of four Americans in Benghazi despite Obama promises of swift justice.No $2,500 family healthcare savings from the advent of ObamaCare despite serial Obama promises. No keeping of your family doctors if you like them. No lasting nuclear weapons deal with Iran despite Obama promises. No lasting victory in Iraq. No decimated al Qaeda. No defeated ISIS. No trained moderate Syrian rebels. No counter-terrorism success story in Yemen.Other than that and about 40 other examples, there's no reason at all to look at Barack Obama's doings with the slightest bit of cynicism.RELATED:

150,PEP,"Dancing to the Federal Reserve's familiar rate-hike-is-coming tune in August, the major stock market indexes did little more than tread water near multiyear if not all-time highs.A pullback by defensive sectors largely offset an advance by cyclical sectors as the S&P 500 inched up 0.14%. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds edged ahead 0.48%, according to Lipper Inc.General domestic taxable bond funds rose 0.74% to be up 8.53% for the year.At an economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in late August, Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other Fed officials said the economy is strong enough for a rate hike.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders""The fact that the market saw an opportunity for a rate increase at the Sept. 21 (Fed) meeting was an indication that the U.S. economy was actually moving in the right direction,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer, equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management. ""So the market reacted to that.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceThat reaction took the form of a rotation out of high-dividend stocks and stable sectors into more economically cyclical sectors, Aguilar said. Investors pulled money out of utilities, consumer staples and telecom, he added. They shifted much of it into technology, health care, consumer discretionary and financials.Sector funds reflected some of that. Financial services funds gained 4.25% last month on average. Tech funds gained 2.33%. Health/biotech and consumer-goods funds lost ground.The mood shifted again early this month when the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised the count of its July jobs gains upward to 275,000, but reported August jobs gains of only 151,000. That was less than the 180,000 jobs forecast by economists polled by Reuters. The relatively weak employment growth increased the odds that the Fed would delay its rate hike until November or even December, and the stock market rallied modestly and rotated back toward dividend stocks.""There isn't a lot of market leadership now,"" Aguilar said last week. ""Bottom line: We're going to have to wait until the Fed's September meeting to know what comes next.""IBD's TAKE: How will investors react once the Fed finally hikes rates? Understanding the stock market's prevailing trend is a key factor when you are choosing between growth and defensive stock buys. For pointers, visit IBD University.Chip Rewey, lead manager of Third Avenue's $1.2 billion Value (TVFVX) and $317 million Small Cap Value (TVSVX) funds, said ""the market is confused by the Fed, the way Charlie Brown is confused by Lucy.""Rewey added that whenever the Fed does raise rates, sustained, aggressive hikes are unlikely. ""Still, why allocate (money) to yield-oriented sectors when you see a raise coming off generational low rates?"" he asked.Instead, Rewey has added to stocks that should not be hurt by a hike. He recently increased his stake in Johnson Controls (JCI), which makes building-efficiency systems and just completed its combination with Tyco, which makes fire and security systems.""We like the merger with Tyco,"" Rewey said. ""There's a lot of misunderstanding about what type of company Johnson is. Many people still think of it as an auto company (because of its history as a maker of car seats and interiors). But the majority post-Tyco merger is a building services company.""Rewey also added to Amgen (AMGN), which has a dividend yield of 2.3%. ""We saw it as a leading pharmaceuticals (company) that had been caught in the generic fears about (drugmakers because of political calls for intervention over pricing).""Rewey bought shares under 150. They're now trading near 170. ""At that price, we're getting its pipeline for free,"" he said. The company has 31 potential treatments in preclinical and clinical targets development, including 12 in phase three tests, which are closer to market. Another nine biosimilars are in development, including three in later stages, nearing the point where they might go on sale.Rewey also likes Comerica (CMA), a bank with most of its operations in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona and Florida. ""It's trading around 1.1 times tangible book value,"" he said. ""We think it's undervalued. They're cutting costs. If rates and loan growth go up, their return on equity will go up.""And Rewey likes media giant CBS (CBS), which is controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements, which also controls Viacom (VIA). Some family members and company executives have been jockeying for power over the company once Redstone ceases to exercise control.""Investor overreaction to the noise over Viacom has weighed on the value of CBS stock,"" Rewey said. ""They are taking an advertising driven model and taking it to more fee-driven (which should generate revenue and earnings that are more visible and stable). They should be almost 60% fee-driven by 2018 once they spin out their radio business. And they're in a stock buyback program. And we like the management team, led by Les Moonves.""James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds and manager of its $156 million Select Equity (DHAMX), says it's possible the Fed won't raise rates in the wake of disappointing recent economic data.In this environment, he likes consumer staples names PepsiCo (PEP) and Kimberly Clark (KMB) for their aggressive cost cutting. He likes the outlook for Coach (COH), whose rising sales per employee show that its restructuring is on track, he says. And he likes Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), whose innovations provide them with a competitive moat.RELATED:The August Jobs Report Was The Weakest Since 2010As Companies Step Up Wage Hikes, Tax Receipts Get A LiftMutual Fund Strategists Like U.S. Stocks, Led By Tech, Health Care In A Sluggish Market

151,PEP,"If the 2012 London Games were colloquially known as the first ""Social Media Olympics,"" then the Rio Games' sophomore outing is in full swing, as Twitter (TWTR), Facebook (FB), Instagram and Snapchat are abuzz with winning activity from athletes and fans alike.The previous two parts of this series have examined how brands such as Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA) and McDonald's (MCD) have been making the best -- or worst -- of their time in Rio.Now it's time for a look at perhaps the greatest beneficiary of these Summer Games: the social media universe.NBC's Rio ratings have tumbled about 15.5% vs. London, says the Wall Street Journal, with an even steeper decline of about 30% among 18- to 34-year-old viewers (though it's worth noting that NBC is both live-streaming events and splitting the broadcasting duties across Bravo, CNBC, the USA Network and other Comcast (CMCSA) properties).For younger viewers, for whom a tape delay can seem as antiquated as a rotary-dial phone, #Rio2016 might be more appealing than a remote control -- especially when it comes with direct, behind-the-scenes access to their favorite Olympic athletes.Zuckerberg's well-oiled social media machine has nearly doubled its daily active user base over the last four years, with an average of 1.13 billion DAUs in June 2016 vs. 552 million in June 2012. As the social action moves from desktops to smartphones, mobile monthly active users have nearly tripled since then. Small wonder, then, that Michael Phelps would bother to host a nearly hour-long Facebook Live chat with his fans on the day of his last Olympic race, wherein he confirmed that 1) his favorite dessert is frozen Reese's, ""without question, but the holiday ones, because they're better peanut butter-to-chocolate ratio,"" and 2) he is definitely retiring.""They're starting to hashtag #4moreyears!"" he tells his Olympic roomies during the live-chat. ""No, no guys. No, guys. No, guys. ... (But) I'll be in Tokyo, I'll say that. I'll be there. No competing.""The video has gotten about 3.7 million views since Saturday.
"
152,PEP,"Facebook also has the benefit of social hotspot Instagram, which it acquired in 2012. Around the time of the London Games, Instagram had 80 million users; now it has 500 million, with about 60% of those users opening the app daily.And postings from Rio offer an intimate look at the athletes' living quarters, late-night shenanigans and teammate banter that viewers won't find in polished post-game interviews. The Real Athletes Of Olympic Village, if you will.NBC and the ""Today"" show can host formal sit-downs with the Final Five, but social channels are where fans can see the blossoming friendships among the gymnastics quintet play out -- particularly that of BFFs Simone Biles and Aly Raisman, who went 1-2 at the women's individual all-around final.helping a sista out(or should I say grandma👵🏽😘), so if anyone needs a back to be cracked. I gotchuuu 💕A photo posted by Simone Biles (@simonebiles) on Aug 13, 2016 at 4:34pm PDTWith the addition of Instagram Stories (read: the video feature ""inspired"" by Snapchat), the here-for-24-hours-and-then-they're-gone videos are a lure for return users.For what it's worth, NBC Olympics has been doing its part to keep up with its millennial fan base, striking a deal with Facebook to provide the social network with some exclusive content. It's a real change of pace from its official on-air commentary: Speaking of gold-medal activity: Facebook shares are still floating in buy zone after breaking out of a flat base with 121.18 entry in late July. Facebook fell 0.8% to 123.90 on the stock market today.(IBD University has pro tips on when to buy stocks.)There may be no greater testament to the Olympic-sized influence of social media than Leslie Jones' ascendance from live-tweeting mega-fan to official NBC correspondent over the course of the Games.The comedian -- an SNL castmate and 25% of the new ""Ghostbusters"" foursome -- is the Biggest Olympics Fan ever. Her unreserved enthusiasm primarily took the form of posting short Twitter videos from her sofa while clad in a star-spangled outfit and American flag, at least until NBC picked up on the viral popularity of her Games-related tweets and decided to fly her down to Rio.Much of her bleep-able commentary probably can't be rebroadcast on NBC's TV stations -- Vulture has a pretty comprehensive round-up of her pre-Rio coverage -- but it seems like she's keeping all her best work on Twitter and Snapchat anyway.

Check out parts 1 and 2 of the series ""Brand Olympics: The Medal Count For Coca-Cola, Nike, McDonald's"" and ""Brand Olympics Part 2: The Medal Count For Apple, Under Armour And Visa.""The limited-time-only nature of Snapchat's content means users have to remain in constant connection with the app, lest they miss out on important happenings, like the Olympic Village fire drill that prompted Simone Biles to screech, ""The fire alarm's going off!

The company's annual revenue has barely budged over the last three years, and it hasn't grown annual earnings since 2011. The fact that Pep Boys brought such a rich buyout offer says a lot about how much auto parts retailers are valued right now, analysts say.

172,PEP,"The industry's strength is the result of several dynamics, analysts say. One is the average age of cars on U.S. roads: a record 11.5 years, according to research firm IHS Automotive. Older cars require more of the replacement parts, maintenance and repair work that auto parts retailers provide.
"
173,PEP,"The aging fleet has also put more vehicles on the road — a record 250 million, according to Bloomberg. More cars lead to higher demand for auto parts and services.
"
174,PEP,"Lower gas prices have been a boon as well. When consumers pay less for gas, they have an incentive to drive more, which increases demand for parts and services.

"
177,PEP,"Meanwhile, a growing number of consumers are outsourcing maintenance and repair to auto parts retailers rather than doing it themselves.

"
179,PEP,"Finally, auto parts retailers — unlike most other retailers — have not been hurt by Amazon and other e-commerce sites. That's mainly because when someone needs an auto part, he or she doesn't like to wait around for it to arrive by mail.

182,PEP,"U.S. auto sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 18.2 million in September, the highest rate in more than a decade.

""Cars last longer than they used to, so there's a secular shift going on there. There's still a growing need for auto parts as the age continues to rise, and that's a big positive.""Forget the current banner year for new-car sales — auto parts retailers are forging ahead undaunted, benefitting from a host of favorable industry trends.Cheap gasoline prices, an increase in miles driven and an aging fleet of cars on the road have helped leading players such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) maintain decent growth.They've accomplished that even as vehicle sales are at their highest point in over a decade — something that normally would act as a headwind to the auto parts sector.Auto parts chains have also largely avoided competition from Amazon (AMZN).O'Reilly, the sector's biggest by market cap, has shown particular strength, with a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth. It extended that streak after Wednesday's close, logging a 28% year-over-year EPS gain and breezing past consensus views.O'Reilly shares touched a new high of 263.66 on Wednesday and moved even higher after hours. AutoZone shares set their own new high Wednesday, while Advance Auto hit a new record last week.IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group — which also includes Genuine Parts (GPC) and LKQ (LKQ), among other stocks — ranks No. 8 out of 197 industries surveyed.Pep Boys AcquiredThe group is doing so well that even members considered to be laggards are attracting attention.Case in point: Monday's news that auto parts supplier Bridgestone will acquire Pep Boys — Manny, Moe & Jack (PBY) for about $835 million. Bridgestone will pay $15 a share in cash, a 23% premium over Pep Boys' Oct. 23 closing price. The deal is expected to close early in 2016.Bridgestone paid the premium even though Pep Boys has underperformed for most of this decade.

188,PEP,"This month, American Century Investments has sponsored big-name professional golf tournaments. But instead of trumpeting its mutual funds directly, the Kansas City, Mo.-based asset manager's advertisements highlight how its ownership structure benefits the nonprofit Stowers Institute for Medical Research (SIMR).Its newly launched Prosper With Purpose ad campaign is aimed at setting the fund company apart from others: Not only does it have equity funds with strong long-term performance, but it is the only one tied so directly to benefiting society through medical research funding.The SIMR is named after American Century founder Jim Stowers Jr. and his wife Virginia, who endowed the medical research organization with cash and American Century stock in 1994 -- an ownership stake of more than 40%.That followed Jim's battle with prostate cancer and Virginia's surgery for breast cancer. ""They were motivated by their experiences with cancer,"" said American Century vice president for client marketing Woody Bendle.Jim Stowers passed away in March 2014 at age 90.Stowers founded American Century -- then named Twentieth Century -- in 1958. With $102.4 billion in assets as of June 30, it is the 19th-largest mutual fund complex.The firm is one of only eight among the 25 largest mutual fund complexes that has year-to-date investor inflow of net new money this year. American Century enjoyed $242.3 million inflow through June 30, according to Morningstar.That's a turnaround, coming after three straight calendar years of net outflow.Inflow went mainly through its target date funds into underlying funds such as $679 million AC Alternatives Market Neutral Value Fund (ACVQX) and $7.9 billion Mid Cap Value (ACMVX).Industrywide, target date funds draw steady inflow from retirement-account savers, Rupp says. The alternatives and value funds offer relatively safe havens from market volatility.The firm's inflow defies an industrywide trend of investors shifting money into lower-cost, passively run investments. Yet American Century has no ETFs. And it does not run any index mutual funds.What's behind the fund family's popularity this year? Twenty-two of the complex's 33 stock mutual funds were outperforming their Morningstar category averages as of July 20.And most of the clan's top-20 U.S. holdings are household names, most of which were performing well year-to-date.Apple (AAPL) has the largest weighting at 1.73%. It was down 4%.Next was Exxon Mobil (XOM), with a 0.69% weighting. It was up 22.4%.Third was PepsiCo (PEP), with a 0.57% allocation. It was up 10.46%.Sixteen of the top-20 stocks have an SMR Rating from IBD of either A or B, the two highest possible grades.IBD'S TAKE: Strong sales growth, profit margins and return on equity are the hallmarks of many stock market winners. IBD's SMR Rating measures these traits and combines them into a rating from A to E. Read this and this to learn more about what the SMR Rating tells you about a stock you might buy.American Century portfolios are built bottom-up, one stock at a time. But growth-value style weightings reflect where managers have found stocks with the best opportunities to appreciate. Twenty-two percent of American Century's assets were in U.S. value stocks vs. only 18% in the U.S. growth camp as of June 30.One new step by the complex: It has begun to expand its lineup of funds that focus on alternatives ""to help investors manage volatility, balance market downturns and improve diversification,"" says company spokesman Chris Doyle.As an overall result, American Century stock funds averaged a 3.74% gain this year through June 30. That was fifth-best among the 25 largest fund families. The S&P 500 gained 3.84%.In a report a year ago, Morningstar said fund manager turnover at the shop has declined in recent years. Meanwhile, manager investments in their own funds have increased. That increases alignment of managers' self-interest with their shareholders'.In addition, the managers' bonus plan has been changed to reward longer-term performance more.""American Century is a solid investment outfit,"" Morningstar said. ""Most of its investment teams seem on sturdier ground, and the company's evolution has been positive for both the firm and its fundholders. New leadership and initiatives bear watching, however, and there's need for performance improvement in some areas.""

189,PEP,"Monster Beverage (MNST) is getting a boost from consumers' need for speed, but company's stock and energy products could easily fall from their caffeine high.Known for its distinctive tall can and ripped M logo, Monster is helping lead the energy-drink revolution as sodas and other carbonated drinks fall out of favor with Americans and consumers in many developed markets.Carbonated soft-drink volumes in the U.S. fell 1.54% in 2015, on top of a 0.97% drop in 2014, according to Beverage Marketing Corp. Meanwhile energy-drink volumes have risen dramatically, up 7.94% in 2015 and 7.34% in 2014, on top of double-digit increases in recent years.""Energy drinks have had very strong growth for over a decade now and the primary reason for that is there is a huge demand for energy and the products are well-formulated to deliver on that,"" said Gary Hemphill, managing director of research at Beverage Marketing.Monster cans come in 16 fluid ounces and contain two servings. Each serving has 86 milligrams of caffeine vs. 95 milligrams found in a typical cup of coffee. The drinks often contain other stimulants like guarana, taurine and B vitamins.""Consumers gravitate more toward things that are healthier for you, and consumers want variety and a change of pace,"" Hemphill said.Monster declined requests for an interview.But the company offers a variety of products including a low-carb version, Muscle Monster energy shakes and a football-themed version inspired by Rob Gronkowski, the energetic New England Patriots tight end who manages to simultaneously maintain a fun-loving lifestyle and still set National Football League records.Monster and Austria's Red Bull are the two global leaders in the energy drink market. Red Bull has more market share in Europe, as it tapped into the EU market before Monster did.But Monster leads in the U.S., the largest energy-drink market in the world with volumes at 629.3 million gallons last year, Beverage Marketing says. Monster is typically sold in the U.S. in a can twice the size as Red Bull, but at the same price.Smaller players in the energy beverage spectrum include Rockstar, along with Rip It by National Beverage (FIZZ) and 5 Hour Energy shots by capital management firm Innovations Ventures.Monster generally has been a highly rated stock, but Wells Fargo downgraded it to market perform from outperform this past Monday. That sent the stock tumbling as the analyst warned on lower-than-expected sales and no new products until the fourth quarter.But shares have gained back some ground since then, and remain in buy range. Shares ended trading up at the close Friday and were down fractionally at the close Monday to 160.07.Monster was founded under the name Hansen Natural in 1935 before switching its name to Monster Beverage in 2012 to emphasize its focus on energy drinks. During its first-quarter conference call in April, Monster said that according to Nielsen data, U.S. sales of its energy drinks grew 10.8% while sales of Red Bull increased 4.1% and sales PepsiCo's (PEP) Amp decreased 8.1%.Monster also is making headway overseas and saw market share gains during the first quarter in a slew of European nations. They include: Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden.Much of Monster's international growth has come from Coca-Cola's (KO) ownership stake in the company. Last year Monster completed a deal to move its bottle and distribution to Coke bottlers and sold its non-energy drink assets, including Hansen's soda, to Coke. Coke sold its energy products such as its Burn drink, to Monster.""This opens up new channels, new areas to get product into more storefronts,"" said Adam Fleck, director of consumer equity research at Morningstar.""There have been lawsuits and continuing regulator concerns around the product,"" Fleck said. ""A company the size of Coke has some concerns about going all in on energy drinks. Instead they have chosen to take a minority stake in Monster and get out of the business entirely.""Fleck believes U.S. energy drink volumes will continue to grow in the high-single to low-double digits in the foreseeable future.Monster consumers tend to skew younger and male, Fleck said. Monster sponsors extreme sporting events and athletes in motocross, BMX, mountain biking, surfing and snowboarding. It also has an athlete development program for kids ages 13-21.IBD's TAKE: Monster shares are trying to recover from a mini-selloff after tumbling in the wake of an analyst's downgrade this past Monday, and remain about $4 short of a new high. The strongest player in the nonalcoholic beverages group is National Beverage. Its Stock Checkup is available here.But with the addition of a line of Java-themed products that include coffee, cream and a ""Monster energy blend"" the brand is looking to expand its reach past its key demographic.Monster is planning to launch its products in China later this year but warned during its first-quarter conference call that the launch could be delayed by regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements.Monster settled two wrongful-death lawsuits last year after teenagers died of cardiac problems after drinking the energy drinks.Studies have shown that increases in blood pressure after drinking energy drinks can make people more susceptible to cardiovascular problems, and the World Health Organization said high caffeine levels can cause heart palpitations, hypertension and heart attacks in extreme cases.Middlebury College in Vermont has banned the sales of energy drinks on campus as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say mixing energy drinks with alcohol makes people three times more likely to binge drink.Because Monster relies so heavily on one product Fleck said investors need to have ""a larger margin of safety"" than with a more diversified beverage company like Coke, which relies on its signature drink along with bottled water and juices.""Health concerns are a real downside risk in the Monster story,"" he said. ""While the international growth rates remain pretty good, a U.S. slowdown will be a big risk.""

191,PEP,"Major stock indexes shifted into neutral Thursday afternoon, while Tesla Motors (TSLA) let its early gains dissolve into a small loss. Meanwhile, Tesla rival Ferrari (RACE), which has been showing the most pep among automaker stocks, is cooling off with a light decline following a two-week rally that sent shares up 12%.The Nasdaq composite edged 0.1% higher, pulled up by modest gains in Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other mega-cap techs. The S&P 500 fractionally higher, while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped less than 0.1%. At noon ET, volume was running modestly lighter vs. the same time on Wednesday.Helping lead the stock market today on the upside were oil field service, oil exploration, mobile home & RV, and mortgage services groups. The crude oil market was quiet, as West Texas Intermediate futures continue to hold above the psychological $40-per-barrel level, rising to about $42.Tesla rose 0.5% to 226.88 in above-average volume, looking to snap a three-session losing streak. Tesla has held above the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Also positive: Tesla's 50-day line recently crossed above the longer-term 200-day moving average, hinting at improved price momentum for the large-cap electric vehicle and battery play.Late Wednesday, Tesla reported underwhelming sales of $1.27 billion for the second quarter, yet those sales still grew 33% year over year, the biggest jump in five quarters. The Palo Alto, Calif., company lost $1.06 a share -- its seventh quarter in a row of net losses. Yet CEO Elon Musk expressed confidence that the company would meet full-year production goals.Plus, Wall Street is now forecasting a return to profitability in the third quarter, following the company's exhaustive spending for the ramp-up of its Model X and preparation for the more affordable Model 3 sedan, due out at the end of 2017.Analysts see Q3 profit of 38 cents a share vs. a 58-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Sales are seen spiking 86% to $2.32 billion, which could mark a second quarter in a row of top-line growth acceleration.Tesla shares have been in basing mode since peaking at 286.65 in July 2015. A double bottom has formed recently within the long, deep consolidation, offering a 240.94 early entry point for ultra-aggressive investors. However, keep in mind that the stock also faces potentially heavy overhead supply at the 250 to 270 price levels.Ferrari, meanwhile, has been working on a cup-like base. Watch for potential upside resistance near 50. The stock, off 0.4% to 46.49 in active trading, has a 50-day average turnover of 524,000 shares. Earlier this week, the Italian luxury sports car maker announced a 6% gain in Q2 sales and an 8% jump in units delivered. Adjusted earnings per share rose 34% to 0.55 euro (61 U.S. cents) a share, according to Ferrari's news release on Aug. 2.Elsewhere, April 2015 IPO Enviva Partners (EVA) showed bullish action, rising more than 4% to 23.38 in big turnover. That hoisted the stock closer to the top of a nearly eight-week base with a 24.96 pivot point. The post-Brexit sell-off mars the look of Enviva's base, but a weekly chart shows that in the week ended July 1, the stock bounced hard off its lows and finished the week higher in huge volume. Such action points to strong institutional demand, a necessary ingredient for successful breakouts.Enviva is a thinly traded small-cap alternative energy play with a market value of $587 million. The company's wood pellets act as a raw materials substitute for coal-fired power plants.Enviva's earnings per share have grown an average 218% over the past three quarters. The three-year average annual revenue growth is also superb at 60%. However, due to the cyclical nature of the power industry, quarterly results can swing. In the past four quarters, Enviva's top line grew 53%, 48%, fell 6%, then rose 9% vs. the year-earlier period, respectively.

Stocks rallied yesterday on the rumor or chatter that the FED has to delay raising interest rates even as they tell us how appropriate it is to raise rates in October or December, but the most recent readings on the U.S. economy and global economy appear now to force the Fed to wait until 1Qtr of 2016.

Words like POW, BOOM & SMACK appeared in bubbles on the TV screen -.....the fight was left to the viewers imagination.....and so ladies and gentlemen - that is what it appears to be today with the markets.......It's all about your imagination as words like GLOBAL WEAKNESS, CHINA, INTEREST RATES, QE, STIMULUS flash across computer screens causing stocks to jump yesterday sending the S&P, the DOW and the Nasdaq higher for the 5th straight day....Ok, look - The last week was another example of a manipulated market......traders feel forced to buy stocks to cover short bets as the media and the industry celebrates the weaker macro data and new evidence of economic weakness.....Celebrate? Why yes - because that means that the FED (and the ECB, BoJ and PBoC) will all come to the rescue (again) in one way or another. Stocks rallied yesterday on the rumor or chatter that the FED has to delay raising interest rates even as they tell us how appropriate it is to raise rates in October or December, but the most recent readings on the U.S. economy and global economy appear now to force the Fed to wait until 1Qtr of 2016.(Just to add another notch in the belt - Yesterday we learned that the ISM Service sector report missed analysts' expectations - although to be fair - it IS still in expansionary mode - but so many took the opportunity to accentuate the negative which then translates into a positive for risk assets....)And did you see that the treasury sold a 'new gov't security' with a 3-month yield of ZERO for the first time in history? Ok...so just so we understand - investors gave the gov't a 3-month FREE loan......no interest, Here! - just take it. See the Money and Investing Section of today's WSJ -""Yield of 0%, a First at 3 -Month T-Bill Sale""As the article points out:""The result reflects diminishing expectations in financial markets that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term rates before year end after Friday's disappointing jobs report....""And so - the prospect of loading up the punch bowl with more 'Kool Aid' creates demand for 'riskier assets' and this sent both stocks and commodities higher......Technically speaking we can expect more volatility in the weeks ahead as we enter earnings season.... We have seen how analysts have slashed estimates and repositioned themselves ahead of what is likely to be a volatile couple of weeks.Last night we learned that Ellen Kullman - CEO at DuPont (DD) is the first casualty of this 'hurricane season'. News out last night that she is 'retiring' (convenient) just as her company slashed its profit forecast - (dollar strength, global weakness...blah, blah, blah) and the activist investor, Trian, boosted its stake in the company - citing Kullman's failure to meet her targets..... Remember that Trian - owned by Ed Garden and Nelson Peltz - wants to break up the company saying that the parts are worth more than the sum of its whole. The stock is trading UP $2 or 4% in pre-market trading.....This morning Pepsico (PEP) announces a surprise earnings report : $1.35 vs. exp of $1.26....which is contra to what the expectation was.... Revenues of $16.3 bil vs exp of $16.1 bil and they are on track to deliver $5 bil of productivity savings thru 2019 and return $9 bil to shareholders this year.....the stock is trading UP 3 pts (3%) at $98.57/sh.Later today we will hear from YUM Brands (YUM) - and on tomorrow afternoon - we will hear from AlcoaAA.On a side note Uncle Benny (Bernanke) took to the media circuit yesterday - announcing the publication of his new book - ""The Courage to Act"" . In this book - Benny discusses what went wrong and what went right during the GFC of 2007/2015 and counting......He points his finger at corporate executives saying that:""It would have been my preference to have more investigation of individual action, since obviously everything that went wrong or was illegal was done by some individual and not by an abstract firm.""He also acknowledges that so many were slow to realize just how serious the crisis would become and he 'faults himself for not doing more to explain to Americans why it was in their interest to rescue the financial firms that had helped cause it'.And finally he calls out a defective congress that 'failed to do its part' in helping to navigate the turmoil that engulfed this country - turmoil that caused untold hardships and crisis on so many Americans - The book is available today on Amazon and is a must read for anyone interested in how close the country was to financial Armageddon.Overnight Asian markets were mostly higher due to the news that the TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership) agreement seems to be finished. This trade deal among the US and 11 Pacific Rim countries has been called 'the biggest of its kind in a generation' and is supposed to yield global benefits of $300 bil. by the year 2025. This deal though - still needs final approval from Congress....HSBC analysts had this to say about the deal:""An accord among countries representing a large swath of the global economy sends a positive signal worldwide.....increased market openness via trade policy reform on this scale can promote growth in a manner that compounds"".We can only hope....Japan +1%, Hong Kong -0.1% and ASX +0.3%.In Europe - markets are now higher after being lower all morning. German Factory Orders fall 'unexpectedly' raising the risk that Europe's largest economy is vulnerable to a weakening China.....The rebound that we have seen of late has been on the back of the idea of more stimulus....vs. on an improving economic outlook. So - is the move really sustainable? I guess we are about to see.....as earnings season is about to begin in Europe as well....so the devil is in the details...FTSE -0.04%, CAC 40 + 0.72%, DAX + 0.81%, EUROSTOXX +0.65%, SPAIN +0.73% AND ITALY + 0.31%US Futures are off 4 pts.....that is after they were 10- pts lower earlier....this should not surprise anyone - after yesterday's rally to resistance at 1990ish. Expect the news to be about DD, PEP and YUM today as more of the details emerge over leadership and results. Banks begin next week and those will surely set the overall tone for the broader market. No eco reports to speak of, but there are two FED speakers that will hit the circuit today. Kansas Fed Ester George at 9:15 am and San Fran's John Williams at 3:30 pm.I suspect that the market will trade tight as it digests yesterday's move and dissects the DD, PEP and YUM news.....as it looks for the next catalyst to determine market direction. Look for resistance at the 50 dma at 2000 and support at 1950.Take good careKpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O'Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

264,PEP,"Stocks showed a tad of oomph on Tuesday after Monday's technology sell-off, but small caps and transportation-related issues continued to gain more traction in late-afternoon trading.XMeanwhile, Apple (AAPL) defied the listless action of the Nasdaq composite, which nevertheless rebounded a little more than 0.3% at 3 p.m. ET and is still holding the fort in its defense of the 50-day moving average. The former gained nearly 2% to 153.48 in heavy trading and is trying to snap a sharp four-day sell-off.The Nasdaq 100, a gauge of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic Nasdaq exchange, is up more than 0.4%. But the Nasdaq 100-tracking Powershares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF remains a tad below its 50-day moving average. QQQ is up an impressive 20.9% since Jan. 1.Watch to see how turnover in Apple, the largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap, finishes today; Apple's average volume over the past 50 sessions is 29.2 million shares. A significant rise in above-average turnover would be bullish for Apple shareholders.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were up no more than 0.1% to 0.2%. Dairy, medical services, and select retail stocks rebounded, while gold mining, biotech, ethical drug, medical research and equipment, and fertilizer stocks lagged with losses of 0.7% or more.Truck, airline and other stocks helped push the Dow Jones transportation average up 0.7%, matching the S&P SmallCap 600's gain. Volume was running lower on both main exchanges vs. the same time on Monday.Since its Aug. 24 recent low, the Dow transports have rallied 8.5%, broadly outperforming the S&P 500's 2.4% rise over the same time frame. The Nasdaq composite is up just 2% over the four-week period.Despite growing fears, as seen in news headlines, that the market is getting frighteningly close to a major peak, the market's technicals continue to refute such thinking. On the NYSE, winning stocks were beating losers by more than a 3-to-2 margin, and ditto for the Nasdaq.As seen in the ""What's The Market Trend?"" page, a daily PDF link at the bottom of IBD's Big Picture column, the NYSE advance-decline line continues to mark new highs. A rising NYSE A-D line is one sign of a healthy uptrend.No doubt the huge advance since the March 2009 bottom certainly makes the market vulnerable to a correction, especially if a geopolitical event such as military conflict in North Korea takes hold, or the Federal Reserve suddenly accelerates its intention to raise the cost of money. However, for now, an improving U.S. economy, prospects for economic recovery in Europe, increasing global trade and low interest rates around the world could set the stage for further gains in global equity markets.The last time the S&P 500 fell more than 5% from its 52-week high was during a 12-week spell from Aug. 15, 2016, at 2193 to Nov. 4, 2016, at 2083, right before the historic Nov. 8 U.S. elections.Going back to Apple, even though the stock has recently pierced its 50-day moving average (as seen in red on a daily chart at Investors.com) and dipped below the 156.75 proper entry in a flat base, the recent action is not unusual. Many great stocks, both big cap and small cap, will test a breakout level and shake out uncommitted holders before resuming their runs.Consider that in the end of 2016, Apple spent nearly seven weeks trading below its 50-day line, then hopped back above it in December. That action ultimately produced an excellent cup-with-handle base that yielded a breakout on Jan. 6-9 this year at 118.12.In the most recent correction, the iPhone giant spent no more than five weeks below its 50-day line. Again, normal action.At this point, watch to see if Apple can rebound in decent volume and return back above the 156.75 entry (10 cents above the flat base's left-side high). If it does not immediately do so, then you can expect the stock to potentially form a new base.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is currently at a decent 78, which is not great compared with the turbo-charged high growth names seen in IBD 50, but is still higher than the 59 it scored on a scale of 1 to 99 at the start of the year.The 85 EPS Rating reflects the positive turnaround in profits in Apple, which has seen earnings turn from a 15% year-over-year drop in the fiscal fourth quarter of last year (ended in September 2016) to gains of 2%, 11% and 18% in the past three quarters.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising another 13% to $1.88 a share in the soon-ending fiscal fourth quarter on a 9% jump in revenue to $50.93 billion.In the Chinese social media sphere, YY (YY) roared into new high ground, rising more than 8% to 84.36 in brisk turnover and clearing an 83.10 entry in a six-week cup base.Volume is on track to almost double YY's average turnover over the past 50 sessions, a telltale sign that large institutions are anxiously grabbing shares.Notice how the stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in IBD's charts, has moved into new high ground, a good sign. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500.The buy zone in YY goes up to 87.26, 5% above the proper 83.10 buy point.YY had earlier flashed a follow-on buy signal when it bounced nicely off its rising 10-week moving average (please see a weekly chart) near 69 in the week ended Sept. 1 in solid turnover. That came after YY's breakout from a cup with handle at 56.31; that cup base was part of a long bottoming base pattern.As this Investor's Corner notes, some stocks can post excellent gains even after bolting out of a cup base that features no handle.YY scores a 99 Composite Rating, the maximum possible, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, due to its stunning combination of excellent fundamentals, relative price strength, and rising fund sponsorship. According to William O'Neil + Co. data, mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in the mid-cap Nasdaq stock ($5.2 billion market value; $1.22 billion in sales in 2016) jumped from 214 funds at the end of the second quarter of 2016 to 346 funds in Q2 this year.Meanwhile, among other large-cap firms, McDonald's (MCD) is issuing a sell signal for recent new buyers as shares continued to fall deeper below the 50-day moving average. The restaurant chain was the worst performer within the Dow Jones industrials, tanking 2.47 or more than 3% to 153.79. Volume is running nearly 50% above its usual pace.McDonald's first showed weakness as it dived below its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover two weeks ago. At its recent peak of 161.72, the consumer play rallied as much as 24% past a saucer-with-handle buy point at 130.10.Those with giant gains in McDonald's can be more patient in holding the profit turnaround, as the stock still maintains a big air pocket of gains above its rising 200-day moving average. Large and megacap leaders tend to find solid buying support near or at this long-term moving average during significant pullbacks in price.The 50-day line is drawn in red on all IBD charts as well as on Leaderboard and MarketSmith charts.Any stock that rises 20% to 25% triggers a sell signal, based on IBD rules. That is, such gains are in fact hard to come by in many stocks, and it's a good time to sell on the way up. Many times, a stock will correct in price after rising that much following a solid breakout.IBD's TAKE: One of the keys to strong long-term results in stock investing is to take many gains when your stocks go up 20% to 25% or more from a proper buy point. Read more about this important sell rule in this Investor's Corner column.McDonald's earnings have been on solid footing after a 13% decline in 2014 to $4.82 a share. Since then, earnings rose 4% to $5.01 a share in 2015, 14.8% to $5.75 a share in 2016, and are seen rising another 14% to $6.55 this year.However, the global restaurant chain, despite launching an interesting ""NEXT"" eatery concept in Hong Kong that includes fresh vegetables, quinoa and other superfood items, has not been able to get out of its sales rut. The top line has fallen vs. year-ago levels for 12 quarters in a row.RELATED:Income Investing: Why You Should Watch This Major Utility Stock NowHow To Make Money In Stocks: How Do You Grow $2,500 Into Something Substantial?Tech News: The Latest In Artificial Intelligence And ChinaThe Key To Making Big Money In the Long Term: Sell On The Way Up This Way

266,PEP,"The latest telecast of the Emmy Awards on CBS drew the second-lowest audience ever, just 11.4 million, and that is no surprise. This show could not have been more predictable, quickly devolving into a boorish hourslong festival of Trump bashing and Hillary mourning.Awards shows used to be blockbusters for TV. But in the Age of Trump, they're becoming screaming political spectacles, like the infamous funeral/pep rally for Sen. Paul Wellstone in 2002. The red-state audience knows it's going to be a leftist hootenanny attack on conservatives all night long. Why put up with it? So they don't bother.Naturally, the Hollywood crowd gave out Emmy awards like candy to ""Saturday Night Live"" for its sneering satire of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. And Kate McKinnon thanked Hillary Clinton for her alleged ""grace and grit.""Jane Fonda recalled her film ""9 to 5,"" saying, ""Back in 1980 in that movie, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot."" Her co-star Lily Tomlin picked up the attack, saying, ""And in 2017, we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot.""Got it.Picking up the Emmy for best actor in a comedy series for the FX show ""Atlanta,"" Donald Glover announced: ""I want to thank Trump for making black people No. 1 on the most oppressed list. He's the reason I'm probably up here.""Host Stephen Colbert even compared Trump to Walter White, the murderous drug kingpin at the center of ""Breaking Bad."" He joked: ""I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You like Walter White. He's just Walter Much Whiter.""Hilarious.There's another obvious reason awards shows have been slipping: who's nominated and who wins. Much like the Oscars, Emmy voters lurch toward excess, the egregiously sexy and violent and progressive/""transgressive"" products. Popular shows are often rejected because, well, they're popular, which must mean they're not smart enough or they're just too formulaic and predictable.Shows on the Big Four networks get slighted for cable networks and streaming services. Here are the top Emmy winners by network in 2017: 29 for HBO, 20 for Netflix, 15 for NBC and 10 for Hulu. By contrast, ABC won seven. Subtract NBC's nine awards for ""Saturday Night Live"" and it won only six. CBS got four.The Emmy for best drama hasn't gone to a broadcast network since 2006, and in that span, voters have given four to ""Mad Men"" (AMC), two to ""Breaking Bad"" (AMC) and two to ""Game of Thrones"" (HBO). A top-rated show like CBS's ""NCIS"" doesn't get nominated for Emmys ... unless you count ""outstanding stunt coordination."" But Logo's drag-queen show ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" won three Emmys in 2017.There's also little suspense when the same liberal favorites win Emmys over and over. Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her sixth Emmy in a row for HBO's ""Veep."" Yawn. It doesn't matter that the ratings are tiny. Jon Stewart's ""Daily Show"" won for 10 years in a row. Why tune in for that? And why don't the over-rewarded liberals have the decency to let someone else get an award? Why don't they redistribute Emmys?Hollywood loves to be ahead of the people, ""educating"" them along the path to progress. But it gets remarkably upset when the people refuse to follow it. The people are supposed to bend their minds agreeably as the entertainment elite sculpts the ""arc of justice."" A few swift kicks at the morons from the eminentoes on the Emmy stage are expected to work their magic.Check out all of IBD's Political coverage, including the award-winning editorial page.IBD can help you make more money in stocks.

269,PEP,"Stocks were lower Thursday afternoon as oil prices sank and investors turned cautious ahead of Friday's key jobs report. Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell, but IBD 50 stock WhiteWave Foods (WWAV) jumped on a takeover offer.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each fell 0.5%, while the Nasdaq was little changed. All three indexes had opened higher. Volume was running below Wednesday's levels on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.Chevron fell 2% and Exxon Mobil slid more than 1%, weighing on the Dow. U.S. oil futures plunged nearly 5% to less than $46 a barrel on a smaller-than-expected decline in U.S. crude supplies.Stocks have moved in tandem with oil prices for much of the year due to crude's importance as an indicator of global economic health. Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for June will be watched closely for additional clues, especially after May's job tally came in well below expectations.Elsewhere in the stock market today, PepsiCo (PEP) rose 1% to clear a 107.94 flat-base buy point in heavy volume after the beverage and snack maker beat Q2 profit estimates and raised its full-year earnings outlook. The stock later retreated to low in the day's range.Costco (COST) jumped 4% after the wholesaler reported strong same-store sales for June.

271,PEP,"Monster Beverage (MNST) flexed its muscles with double-digit sales gains across retail channels last month as more consumers opted to quench their thirst with its energy drinks.Monster's dollar sales were up a solid 11.2% from a year earlier during the four-week period ending Sept. 5, according to a report on beverage sales by Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog, citing Nielsen's ""all channel"" data — including grocery, drug, mass, and convenience stores.Monster's unit sales were up 12.6% from a year earlier during the period and its average unit pricing was down 1.3%.Monster's lineup of energy drinks now include Coca-Cola (KO) energy brands as a part of a partnership deal with the soft drink giant that closed in June. Under the pact, Coke transferred ownership of its energy drink business to Monster and in return, Monster transferred its non-energy drink business to Coke. Coke has also become Monster's preferred global distribution partner.Coke now owns about 16.7% stake in Monster.The energy drink category overall remained strong during the month with dollar sales up 11.1% vs. a year earlier, Herzog noted in her report.Rockstar led the pack with a hefty 29.5% gain in dollar sales for the month.Energy drink hot shot Red Bull saw a 9.4% increase in dollar sales for the four-week period.But total carbonated soft drink dollar sales (excluding energy drinks) in all channels fizzled with a 1.0% decline for the month, noted Herzog.Coke's dollar sales overall were up 2.2% vs. a year earlier for the four-week period amid ""solid growth"" from juices, water, and teas, which ""partially offset declines"" in carbonated soft drinks, Herzog noted.Pepsico (PEP) saw dollar sales rise 0.9% during the month, according to the report. ""Soft"" results in carbonated soft drinks were ""offset"" by ""slight growth"" in snacks and by ""solid"" growth in water, sports drinks, and shelf-stable juices, Herzog noted.Pepsi recently expanded an alliance with home-based Sodastream (SODA). That comes as Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) and Coca-Cola are developing Keurig Kold device for soft drinks. Coke also owns a significant stake in Keurig Green Mountain.Dollar sales for Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) were up 2.2% during the four-week period, driven by ""modest growth"" in carbonated soft drinks and ""strong"" results in juices and teas, Herzog noted.Monster is part of IBD's Beverage-Non-Alcoholic industry group, where it ranks No. 2 with a Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99. Coca-Cola Bottling (COKE) ranks No. 1 with a Composite Rating of 99.Monster's stock closed up 1.1% to 133.93 Wednesday in the stock market today. Coca-Cola Co. closed up 1.7% to 39.15, Pepsi closed up 1.1% to 93.07 and Dr Pepper closed up 0.6% to 77.26 .

272,PEP,"Signs of institutional buying were apparent in the market Friday when the Nasdaq and S&P 500 scored big percentage gains in higher volume, but it wasn't so apparent Monday despite another solid up session.At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, the S&P 500 added 1.8% and the Nasdaq rallied 1.6%. Preliminary data showed NYSE and Nasdaq volume coming in lower than Friday's levels in the stock market today.Inside the Nasdaq, Micron (MU), Netflix (NFLX) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) were among the top percentage gainers. Netflix reclaimed its 50-day moving average Monday, rising about 5% in average volume.So why is the market in such a good mood all of a sudden? Well, the market is still focused on the Fed, and the odds of a rate hike have fallen precipitously in recent days. According to CME Group FedWatch, the odds of a hike at the October meeting (Oct 27-28) are 7%.The next catalyst for the market will be earnings season. Most companies just closed their books on the third quarter and reports will start rolling in later this month.Advancing stocks trounced decliners on the NYSE by more than 7-to-1. The ratio was smaller on the Nasdaq, at just over 3-to-1. The 10-year Treasury yield shot up 7 points to 2.06%.Oil and gas-related groups outperformed as oil prices rose.

273,PEP,"Stocks were still down hard, but pared their losses heading into the last hour of Thursday's trading session.The Nasdaq lost 0.9%, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.8% and the S&P 500 gave up 0.7%. Volume swelled across the board vs. the same time Wednesday. Decliners outpaced advancers by nearly 3 to 1 on the NYSE and more than 2 to 1 on the Nasdaq.Gold miners, utilities and nonalcoholic-beverage stocks led the scant list of outperformers in the stock market today. The downside was led by construction gear makers, solar and medical stocks.Biotechs continued to take a beating since Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's tweet Monday alleging price gouging by specialty drug makers. Leading biotechs with sizable losses included Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP), down 7%, while Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) were off 4% each.On the upside, Diamond Foods (DMND) reclaimed its 50-day moving average as it soared 9% to a near three-month high in massive trade. The maker of Emerald nuts, Pop Secret popcorn and other snacks has tapped Credit Suisse to explore a potential sale, according to Dealreporter. Kellogg's (K), J&J Snack Foods (JJSF) and PepsiCo (PEP) are potential suitors.Among IBD 50 stocks, Paycom Software (PAYC) was the biggest loser, slumping 7% in heavy trade. It's below its 50-day moving average for the first time in a month. The company provides cloud-based payroll and human resources software.Also in the enterprise software group, Paylocity Holding (PCTY) gapped down and fell 6% in fast turnover, breaching its 200-day line.

Two dividend funds have broken out as the stock market trades near all-time highs.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) dipped early Tuesday, after clearing a 94.63 flat-base buy point Monday. The fund is up more than 2% from July 11, when it was featured in this column as it sought support at the 50-day moving average. Shares took a slight dip before rising to shape the right side of a flat base and set up a new potential buy opportunity.The $25.3 billion fund, which tracks the Nasdaq US Dividend Achievers Select Index, marked its 11th anniversary in April. The index includes U.S. stocks with a history of increasing dividends for at least 10 years in a row and excludes those that may be less likely to raise their payout.Industrials accounted for VIG's biggest sector weighting as of Aug. 31, at 32% of assets. Consumer services weighed in at about 15%, health care and consumer goods at 14% each, and financials and technology at 10% and 9%, respectively.

The ETF's expense ratio is 0.08%.IShares Core High Dividend (HDV) is in buy range after breaking out Tuesday past an 85.94 flat-base entry. The ETF was last featured June 20 as it cleared a prior flat base before starting the just-completed pattern.The $6.5 billion fund, which tracks the Morningstar Dividend Yield Focus Index, launched in March 2011. HDV provides access to 75 dividend-paying stocks that have been screened for financial health.Its top sector weightings as of Sept. 15 were consumer defensive, 23%; energy, 19%; communications services, 14%; and health care, 12%. Exxon Mobil (XOM), AT&T (T) and Pfizer (PFE) were among its top names.HDV has returned 6.2% year to date and its average annual returns trail the S&P 500 over the past three and five years.

285,PEP,"Snack and beverage giant PepsiCo (PEP) reported second-quarter earnings on Tuesday that topped analyst forecasts. So did sales growth.X Estimates: Earnings per share of $1.39, a 3% increase, as revenue advanced a percentage point higher to $15.59 billion, according to analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research.Results: Pepsi earned $1.50 a share, including 6 cents from a one-time Britvic sale. That's an 11% gain. Revenue climbed 2% to $15.71 billion. Organic revenue, which includes currency swings and structural changes, advanced 3.1%. Organic volume rose 2% for snacks and other food but fell 2% for beverages.Outlook: Pepsi sees 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.13 a share. Analysts expect $5.12, according to Zacks.Pepsi sees foreign exchange cutting full-year core profit by 2 percentage points vs. its prior estimate of 3 percentage points. The dollar weakened at the end of Q2. The weakening dollar likely will be a notable factor in multinationals' results and guidance during the current earnings season.Shares fell 0.5% to 113.69 in the stock market today. The stock on Monday pierced through support at its 50-day line in heavy volume.PepsiCo, whose brands include its namesake soft drink as well as Mountain Dew, Tropicana, Doritos and Quaker, has tried to offer more ""guilt free"" products to an increasingly wellness-focused population with a deepening distaste for soda.More than 45% of the company's net revenue comes from those products, the company said during its first-quarter earnings call in April. Meanwhile, U.S. soda sales more broadly have fallen for 12 straight years, according to Beverage Digest, an industry trade publication.PepsiCo has introduced healthier, non-carbonated drinks, tested natural sweeteners in sodas, tried out new frying methods to cut fat in potato chips, and offered up healthier, grain-based snacks, Zacks notes. Emerging markets abroad, where consumption is still low, and a growing middle class in some nations could also drive growth and help demand, Zacks said.But turmoil and currency swings internationally risk cutting into sales figures. Pepsi has tightened up its pricing, which can help protect revenue and make up for weaker volumes. But that tactic's durability could become a bigger issue over time.Volumes in the company's large Frito-Lay North America division fell 1.5% in the first quarter. That marked the first decline in some five years, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy said in a report, according to Bloomberg. Management said in April that the dip was temporary and partly a product of shifts in holidays, and that volume had begun to rebound.But Amazon (AMZN) looms over consumer products too. The Amazon-Whole Foods Market (WFM) deal raises the prospect of more private-label goods vs. branded packaged consumer products from the likes of General Mills (GIS), Mondelez (MDLZ) and Pepsi's Frito-Lay. Packaged goods firms are cutting market spending, Marketwatch reported, citing James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt to support profits. Cakmak wrote in a Monday note that the cuts are in part reflect less of an emphasis of fighting for shelf space in the age of Amazon and other e-commerce options such as Jet.com and Walmart.com from Wal-Mart (WMT). But cutting ads and marketing may only spur the push to commoditize packaged goods, reducing margins further.Coca-Cola (KO) dipped 0.1%. Coca-Cola fell below its 50-day line last week.Monster Beverage (MNST) slid 0.1%. Monster Beverage recently found 50-day support after a failed late June breakout. Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) rose 0.2%.National Beverage (FIZZ) edged down 0.2%. National Beverage, fueled by its Lacroix sparking water, shot up nearly 7% to 103.28 on Monday, now extended from Friday's breakout from a 96.15 buy point of a flat base.RELATED:Is This Unique Soda Maker Set To Pop Its Top, Or Fizzle?Thirsty Investors Drive Coca-Cola Shares Higher As Buy Point FormsNot Your Father's PepsiCo: Company Expands Into Healthy Fare

286,PEP,"By the end of a 175-mile bike marathon in 1990, Gary Erickson was exhausted and disgusted.""The energy bars I was eating tasted like dirt and they weren't working like they were supposed to,"" Erickson told IBD. ""Cyclists never complained about them, we just thought they were the bitter pill we had to swallow to help us perform.""He thought he could concoct something better as co-owner of a bakery in Berkeley, Calif. Erickson, his wife Kit Crawford, and his mom studied nutrition as they experimented. They learned that the highly processed ingredients of the typical bar provided a sugar rush, not sustained energy. They developed alternatives that were healthier and tastier and found an eager audience.In February 1992, they launched the first Clif Bars (named after Erickson's dad). By year's end their company, Kali's SportNaturals (renamed Clif Bar & Co. five years later), had sales of $700,000. Industry sources estimate that the privately-held Emeryville, Calif., company has had a compound annual growth rate of more than 20% in recent years, with 2016 revenues of over $700 million. The Ericksons are now co-chief visionary officers, with Kevin Cleary serving as CEO since 2013.Erickson, 59, grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. He did a wide variety of jobs that allowed him the free time to do a lot of rock climbing and extreme biking. He wrote in his 2004 memoir, ""Raising the Bar: Integrity and Passion in Life and Business,"" that in 1990 he was living in a garage with no bathroom or heat, barely surviving on $10,000 a year. Two years later, he scraped together $1,000 to invest in his energy bar business.The Clif Bars utilized brown rice syrup and barley malt, instead of corn syrup or lots of white sugar. In place of refined white flour, he used good sources of natural energy like nuts, soy and oats. Today, about 77% of the ingredients are organically grown or certified as being grown in a ""sustainable"" way.And the Ericksons delivered on taste, with the line now including White Chocolate Macadamia, Peanut Toffee Buzz, Maple Nut and Chocolate Almond Fudge.All of this has built up a fiercely loyal customer base, which shows that profits and idealism can be compatible in a successful business model.The initial marketing strategy was to pass out samples at sports events that might have as few as 200 attending, but would build buzz. ""Most big corporations won't compete at that level,"" Erickson said. Within a few months of launch, demand led 700 bike shops to carry his products.The company also sponsored up-and-coming athletes. ""We'd rather sponsor someone who came in second place, and is humble, than another who came in first, but is arrogant,"" Erickson said. ""We look for athletes who are hardworking, friendly and who know how to have fun. It's about more than getting to the finish line.""Erickson is proud of his company maintaining its original principles, rather than compromising to reach a larger audience faster. On a bike ride in 1986 he observed that the big roads on a map, marked in red, were the most direct ones, while white roads were small, meandering ones — which gave him an insight fundamental to his future business. ""Companies on the red road listen to a lot of noise: the market, shareholders, the board, economic consultants, advisors and conventional wisdom,"" he said. ""Clif Bar is a white road company.""In 1999, the company launched its Luna line of bars, designed for women's nutritional and energy needs, and they have been marketed creatively at events like breast cancer walks and baby fairs. The company has organized  an annual Lunafest of films by, about and for women, with 180 screenings across North America each year.Also in 1999, sales reached $39 million.Clif Bar's main competitors in the energy bar niche had been bought by deep-pocketed corporations: PowerBar by Nestle (NSRGY) and Balance Bar by what is now Kraft Heinz (KHC). Five companies approached Erickson about acquiring Clif Bar. When Quaker Oats, now part of PepsiCo (PEP) offered $120 million in 2000, he was tempted.But before signing the contract, he took a walk around the block to think about the implications. By the time he returned, he had realized that selling would mean he would have no control over whether the new owners would maintain the integrity of the brand, so he terminated the discussions. His investment bankers told him he was crazy and predicted that he would be out of business within a few months.""I had been relying on the logical side of my brain,"" Erickson said. ""Once I started listening to the emotional side of my brain, I had more clarity and knew keeping the company private was the best decision.""Clif Bar has gone far beyond those basic bars since then. Its ever-expanding product line include bars with a nut butter filling; others with whey protein, an ""energy food"" for endurance athletes; Clif Bloks energy chews and Clif Shot energy gel (both providing a burst of energy while training or racing); and the Clif Hydration electrolyte drink mix (to help athletes retain fluid).At the time of the near-sale, there were 100 employees. There are now 1,100 and they own 20% of the company through an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). Clif Bar is often ranked as one of the best places to work and it's no wonder that it has just a 5% turnover rate. Benefits include subsidized day care for kids, the ability to use the gym and yoga studio, walk dogs, do dry cleaning or volunteer in the community on company time.Clif Bar moved into its Emeryville headquarters in 2010. Built as a valve factory in World War II, it still retains its industrial feel, but is certified platinum in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the measure of impact on the environment in construction and operation. Most of the wood was reclaimed from old gym bleachers, barns and shipping containers. The space is almost silent because of sound-absorption panels made from recycled jeans. It features one of the largest ""smart"" solar arrays in U.S. business. And its trucks run on recycled vegetable oil.All of these ""touchy-feely"" things make hard business sense because they appeal to customers who want to support companies whose values they share.Erickson and Crawford set up a family foundation in 2006, largely to promote organic seed research and to conserve crop genetic diversity. In 2004, their Clif Family Winery and Farm had its first product release. Cleary runs the day-to-day Clif Bar operation, giving Erickson and Crawford the time and space to think about the larger strategy.""Gary has always led with an unwavering commitment to his values and vision,"" said Cleary. ""Clif Bar could have been just a successful energy bar company, but he recognized early on that we had greater purpose, that we could do well by doing good. We make decisions that add up to the long-term health of our company for our five bottom-lines: brands, business, people, community and the planet.""We look forward to continuing to do that, while scaling our impact and continuing to innovate, finding new products that feed and inspire adventure and expanding our distribution domestically and internationally. We're celebrating our 25th birthday this year and truly feel like we are just getting started.""Founded Clif Bar & Co. to provide great-tasting, nutritional energy foods and snacks.Overcame: Temptation to sell the company for a high price when it was up against deep-pocketed competitors.Lesson: Treat employees really well and they'll be very productive.""I think the most important lesson a small business can learn is to be patient for growth, but impatient for profitability.""More About Leaders & Success:Jim Cline Helped Build A Teetering Trex Into A Global LeaderFor Kayak Founder, Team-Building Comes FirstAt Amazon's Zappos, CEO Tony Hsieh Delivers On Being DifferentPhil Knight Cleared Hurdles To Make Nike A Merchandising Champ

Hershey said the preliminary, non-binding indication of interest ""also included other non-monetary considerations.""Mondelez, the parent of snack brands such as Oreo and Nabisco, closed up 5.9% at 45.51 in the stock market today. Hershey shares, which had been halted at a 15% gain, finished 16.8% higher at 113.49, as investors see the company as still in play. Hershey rose to a record 117.79 earlier.PepsiCo (PEP) shot up 2.7% to 105.94, near a 107.04 buy point in a flat base. PepsiCo, which has major snack operations, reports quarterly earnings next week.A merger would have brought Mondelez brands such as Ritz crackers and Philadelphia cream cheese together with Hershey products like Twizzlers and Milk Duds.Mondelez already has some chocolate makers in its portfolio, including Cadbury, Toblerone and Milka. Kraft Foods acquired Cadbury in 2010, then split into two companies two years later and renamed its snack business Mondelez.Hershey already has ties to Cadbury, as it has a license to make and distribute Cadbury's York Peppermint Patties, as well as the Peter Paul Almond Joy and Mounds bars worldwide. It also makes and distributes Cadbury and Caramello candies in the U.S.Supermarket staple brand H.J. Heinz completed the acquisition of Kraft Foods Group to create Kraft Heinz (KHC) last year, spurring speculation over which food brands it might look to merge with next.RELATED:Kraft-Heinz Merger Makes Mouths Water For More M&A.

289,PEP,"Amazon (AMZN) has gotten a lot of publicity for its Amazon Dash Buttons, small Wi-Fi-connected devices (that is, actual buttons) that let Prime members order staples like Tide detergent, Charmin toilet paper and Doritos chips with the push of that product's button. But it doesn't appear that customers are using the thumb-drive-sized buttons very much.A study by Slice Intelligence has found that fewer than half of people who have a Dash Button have actually made an order using it.The top-selling button is for Tide laundry detergent. The Procter & Gamble (PG) product has accounted for 21% of button orders, followed by Bounty paper towels (18%), also from P&G. Cottonelle toilet paper from Kimberly-Clark (KMB) came in third with 17%, followed by Glad plastic bags (12%) from Glad Products, which is majority owned by Clorox (CLX).The top Dash Button for consumer spending is Gatorade, owned by PepsiCo (PEP). The average shopper has spent $120 on Gatorade since they purchased a Gatorade Dash Button.Other top Dash Buttons for average consumer purchases include Smartwater ($82.52), Bounty ($74.37), Cottonelle ($61.95), Tide ($58.13) and Charmin ($52.11)Slice Intelligence, an e-commerce analytics firm, based its study on data generated from its panel of over 4 million online consumers between March 31, 2015, and June 18, 2016.E-commerce leader Amazon now sells over 100 Dash Buttons for everyday household items, from coffee and snacks to condoms and feminine care products.Dash Buttons are available to Prime members for $4.99 each, and they're essentially free because members get a $4.99 credit to their Amazon account with their first order using the button.When customers are running low on an item, they can simply press a Dash Button to automatically reorder the item and have it delivered with free Prime shipping.Amazon stock fell 1.1%, to 691.36, in the stock market today, on another Brexit beatdown day for stocks. Amazon stock is testing its 50-day line for the first time in three months.

290,PEP,"Almost as soon as Pepsi (PEP) released its ""Jump In"" ad celebrating protest marches, protesters angrily complained that the ad was making light of protests — specifically Black Lives Matter protests — forcing Pepsi to pull the ad and apologize.Pundits immediately blamed the lack of racial diversity on Madison Ave., but it's more likely that the fiasco was the result of a lack of ideological diversity.In the 2-plus minute ad, model Kendall Jenner is in the middle of a photo shoot when a perfectly diverse group of marchers comes by carrying signs with peace symbols or messages like ""join the conversation,"" and dancing to a song with lyrics like ""We are the movement, this generation/You better know who we are, who we are.""At one point, Jenner is encouraged to join the march, and does so by dramatically pulling off her blonde wig and wiping off her lipstick, and somehow changing from a slinky dress into a T-shirt and stylish jeans, where she proceeds to hand a can of Pepsi to a cop, which elicits cheers from everyone. (You can see the ad for yourself on YouTube.)Pepsi issued a mea culpa after pulling the ad, saying it was just ""trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding"" — although the ad was clearly meant to pull at liberal heartstrings of those upset about a certain person being president.In a New York Times piece, advertising copywriter Nathaniel Friedman comments that ""One of the most frequent observations about 'Jump In' is that it rang so hollow that it's amazing no one involved in its creation anticipated this blowback. That's less surprising when you realize that minorities are underrepresented in advertising. For example, one report found that only 5.3% of managers and professionals at agencies in 2008 were black.""Of course, Neither Friedman nor anyone else making this observation knows the racial makeup of the people who put together and approved the Pepsi ad. But we'd bet there were more blacks involved than conservatives.Had there been even one nonliberal in the room, the ad probably never would have seen the light of day, because conservatives would have warned Pepsi that trying to overtly appeal to liberals — as this ad so clumsily does — almost always backfires, either infuriating liberals themselves or fueling endless calls for more appeasement.As the National Center for Public Policy Research's Justin Danhof once noted: ""Corporations that cave to the left only place a bigger target on their backs.""Some examples to show that Danhof has it right:In fact, a Fortune survey found that Wal-Mart is the company liberals say is the worst one for American and that they would most like to shut down.Making overt left-wing appeals not only tends to backfire with its target audience, it can easily antagonize those who aren't liberal. When Target (TGT) decided to change its bathroom policy to please the LGBT crowd, its sales tanked.After Kellogg (K) pulled its ads from Breitbart in November because it wasn't in line with the cereal maker's ""values,"" Breitbart mounted a boycott, which Kellogg said had no impact, although its stock price underperformed its main competitors for months after. Plus, weeks after pulling its ads, Amnesty International released a report saying that Kellogg, along with other food companies, had been getting palm oil from plantations ""where there are severe labor rights abuses,"" such as the use of child labor. Values, anyone?Corporate executives would do well to remember that — like tic-tac-toe and global thermonuclear war — the only way to win at the political appeasement game is not to play at all.RELATED:Corporate Execs Play Politics At Their Company's PerilWhy Are 'Progressives' Fighting Against Uber and Airbnb?Liberal Attacks On Restaurant Giants Punish Minority-Owned Franchises
"
291,PEP,"In October 1945, as he prepared to announce the signing of Jackie Robinson to break the color barrier in Major League Baseball, Branch Rickey visited his friend, the well-known broadcaster Lowell Thomas.""Branch, all hell will break loose!"" Thomas told Rickey, as recounted by Lee Lowenfish in ""Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman."" ""No, Lowell,"" Rickey replied. ""All heaven will rejoice.""Rickey, then the Brooklyn Dodgers' president and general manager, is remembered for his courage and foresight in breaking baseball's color line, the unofficial racial barrier which had stood firmly since the late 1800s. Robinson played his first game as a major leaguer 70 years ago this week.Rickey often said that he was drawn to the cause of racial equality when, in 1903, he observed Charles Thomas, the only black member of the Ohio Wesleyan University baseball team, being denied a hotel room in South Bend, Ind. ""I never felt so helpless in my life,"" said Rickey.A 1949 Newsweek profile noted that Rickey spent ""two intensely secretive years"" considering the implications of breaking baseball's color barrier, not even informing the Dodgers' scouting department of his potential move.""When Robinson was signed, it effectively opened up the biggest pool of talent in history,"" said Daniel R. Levitt, co-author with Mark L. Armour of ""In Pursuit of Pennants: Baseball Operations from Deadball to Moneyball.""Rickey's innovations are seen throughout baseball today. He established the first ""farm system"" for developing major league talent and encouraged the use of statistical analysis in evaluating players. He promoted modern training methods and equipment.More broadly, Rickey elevated and exemplified the baseball general manager position, a role that most often had been taken on by an owner or team president. Under Rickey, it would include everything from player development to scouting.Rickey left an ""unmatched resume in the game,"" wrote Armour.  ""As a general manager he dramatically changed how teams find and develop players, and what players are allowed to play the game. His place as the greatest GM in baseball history is secure.""Wesley Branch Rickey (1881-1965) was born in Stockdale, Ohio, to Frank and Emily Rickey. Lowenfish writes that the family had a ""hardscrabble existence,"" trying to subsist on a vegetable farm.Born into a pious family, Rickey's name derived from John Wesley, a founder of Methodism. The name ""Branch"" came from scripture, possibly from a passage in the Old Testament.Rickey studied at Ohio Wesleyan, arriving on campus as ""the picture of the hayseed,"" according to Lowenfish, and experienced a difficult transition. He made his mark on both the football and baseball fields, showing ""plenty of pep and ginger"" as a catcher.In 1903, Rickey witnessed the stellar performance of Charles Follis, who is believed to have been the first black professional football player. Follis' on-field achievements, combined with his poise in the face of racial pressures, impressed Rickey, planting a seed for his determination years later to integrate baseball.After signing a minor league baseball contract in 1903, Rickey debuted in the majors with the St. Louis Browns in 1905. His playing career over four seasons was pedestrian. While catching, he allowed a stunning 13 stolen bases in a single game, setting a dubious record. Following an arm injury and a bout of tuberculosis, Rickey enrolled at the University of Michigan Law School. He also became the baseball coach at Michigan.In 1913, Rickey became an executive for the Browns, signing future Hall of Famer George Sisler and later managing the team for more than two seasons. In 1919, Rickey joined the St. Louis Cardinals as team manager and president. In 1925, he was fired as manager by owner Sam Breadon, a serendipitous move which allowed Rickey to focus exclusively on being an executive.Rickey revamped the Cardinals' roster, laying the groundwork for six pennants and four World Series during his 24 seasons there. He quickly released players who did not meet his standards, turning around a previously mediocre franchise. Rickey acquired eventual stars Joe Medwick and brothers Dizzy and Daffy Dean, who shaped the Cardinals' ""Gashouse Gang"" in the 1930s.Though Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis was dismissive of Rickey's farm system, fearing it would destroy the existing structure, Rickey used it to great success.  The World Series-winning 1942 Cardinals were built with players Rickey's system developed, including Stan Musial, the best player in franchise history.Rickey reshaped the entire organization:""The farm system allowed Rickey to institute the 'Cardinal Way,' "" said Levitt.  ""It was an organizational philosophy extending from the lowest farmhands to the Major League team. It instituted organizationwide training techniques and defined what sort of players the team's scouts would seek.  There became a pride in being a Cardinal. Rickey was the first baseball executive to develop this kind of organizational framework.""Rickey joined the Dodgers before the 1943 season. The core players of Brooklyn's six World Series teams between 1947 and 1956 were acquired and developed under Rickey. With Brooklyn, Rickey hired the first team statistician, opened a team spring training facility in Vero Beach, Fla., and implemented new training techniques, including the use of pitching machines.Rickey was acutely aware that he needed to sign the right player to break baseball's color barrier.""Mr. Rickey knew he needed a superb player or the man wouldn't stand a chance,"" said Carl Erskine, a member of the Dodgers from 1948 through 1959 and a teammate of Jackie Robinson for nine seasons. ""Robinson was a four-letter man at UCLA. His best sport may have been football, not baseball.  And he had to be intelligent.  Jackie certainly was.""Mr. Rickey said to Jackie: 'If a fight starts on the field, I'm picking you. You're quicker, you're faster, and you're stronger. You're going to win the fight. But are you strong enough not to fight? You must tell me that you're willing to commit yourself not to fight.' When Jackie said, 'I think I can do it,' Mr. Rickey read to him a paraphrased version of 'Turn the Other Cheek,' a verse in the Bible, about having the courage to resist.""Rickey, according to Erskine, stressed the Christian faith of both of their mothers in making his plea and offer to Robinson. ""That was a critical moment, often unmentioned in history, when Jackie made the commitment.""Robinson, who debuted 70 years ago this week, was National League Rookie of the Year in 1947 and led Brooklyn to the World Series. Robinson's struggles and triumphs are an integral part of American history, and his importance to baseball and its growth is immense.Rickey encouraged Cleveland to sign Larry Doby, the first African-American to play in the American League, because he did not want to ""corner the market on black players,"" wrote Lowenfish.""Mr. Rickey unselfishly gave up a Hall of Famer for the American League to be integrated,"" said Erskine. ""That was selfless and is too often forgotten.""The African-American players whom Rickey signed, including Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella, were central to Brooklyn's success throughout the 1950s. After losing a power struggle, Rickey left the Dodgers for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1950. While the team struggled during his time as general manager, Rickey acquired many of the top players on Pittsburgh's 1960 World Series-winning team, including Roberto Clemente.""There was no one quite as good at seeing greatness in raw talent,"" Lowenfish told IBD. ""In evaluating players and hiring quality scouts, nobody quite matches Rickey.""But, while his farm system allowed him to acquire players cheaply, ""he was hated because he made the money and the players didn't,"" said Lowenfish. Erskine said that Rickey was often referred to as El Cheapo, connoting a reputation for miserliness which Rickey had difficulty shaking, even though he sometimes spent profusely on players.Some suggested that Rickey's decision to sign Robinson also had underlying financial motivations.  Others criticized Rickey for never coming to the ballpark on Sundays, as he honored the Sabbath to pay homage to his mother.Erskine said that Rickey tested players, trying to learn how they processed information.""He helped many players excel, through his patience and his unique methods. In spring training, he used to talk to players as they worked out. He wanted to see if you had aptitude.""He had a $5 bill which he'd lay on home plate. He'd say: 'Son, I want you to throw the ball with your hand backwards to the plate. If you can hit that $5, you can have it.' He often gave us little tests which helped him make judgments about players. He wanted to know if you could learn unconventionally.""On Dec. 9, 1965, Rickey died at age 83 of heart failure in Columbia, Mo. Nearly a month earlier, he had collapsed while giving a speech during his induction to the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame and never regained consciousness. He was survived by his wife, Jane, and five daughters.""Mr. Rickey was a human dynamo,"" said Erskine. ""He truly kept going until he stopped.""Rickey's most prominent contribution will always be signing Robinson to break baseball's color barrier:""To me, Rickey and Robinson were the right combination,"" said Lowenfish. ""The years when they were together were vital to the country. Rickey was the indispensable man in that move. He also deserves credit for two other revolutions: the farm system and trying to establish the Continental League, a rival league which didn't succeed but which certainly prompted expansion.""What he was able to achieve was remarkable. Given his humble beginnings and extraordinary achievements, Rickey really was the Horatio Alger story writ large.""Innovative baseball executive who helped break baseball's color barrier by signing Jackie Robinson.Overcame: Widespread resistance to baseball's integration and to many of his innovations.Lesson: Importance of thinking strategically and maintaining focus on long-term goals regardless of opposition.""Ethnic prejudice has no place in sports, and baseball must recognize that truth if it is to maintain stature as a national game.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS:Roy Campanella Was A BattlerEwing Kauffman Applied His Winning Formula To Sales, Education, BaseballVin Scully Prepared To Become Baseball's Master Storyteller

292,PEP,"Propelled by the overall market, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds notched a 0.78% gain on average in April. The month's modest gain was far better than the losses of January and February.But it lagged the 1.7% gain by the average U.S. taxable bond fund tracked by Lipper Inc.Going forward, mutual fund managers expect more volatility, and many are looking for stocks with stable earnings growth that can thrive without a tailwind from a robust economy.In the just-completed month, multicap value funds did best among the mutual fund market capitalization and style categories.The key impetus was the Federal Reserve's dovish stance on interest rate hikes.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders In a late March speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank would ""proceed cautiously in adjusting policy"" in 2016. In its April meeting, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee stuck by Yellen's March outlook and declined again to raise rates.""Economic activity appears to have slowed,"" the FOMC said, adding that household spending had ""moderated.""Those statements told investors that the Fed thinks U.S. economic growth is slower than previously believed. Slower growth and slower rate hikes mean a weaker U.S. dollar.""That helps U.S. exporters, which is good news for many U.S. large-cap stocks,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of Charles Schwab Investment Management.And a weaker dollar lowers the cost of paying off debt for most emerging markets, making it easier for them buy goods and services from the U.S. and others.Putting it bluntly, the Fed did not want to break a fragile U.S. economy by raising the price of money. ""The more dovish tone by the Fed brought down market volatility and helped support all of the assets that have been hurt in anticipation of Fed rate hikes,"" said Mark Hamilton, chief investment officer for asset allocation at OppenheimerFunds.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance Jittery investors lifted precious metals funds 28.76% in April, best among sectors. Energy funds and natural resources funds, which had lost 41.45% and 20.54% respectively in the two years that ended March 31, were the next-best-performing April sectors, jumping 11.62% and 10.46% last month.World equity funds gained 1.33% in April, led by Latin American funds' 6.59% leap up.Taxable bond funds were paced by high-yield funds' 2.89% advance. With investors willing to take on risk, safe-haven general U.S. Treasury funds slipped 0.33%.""I expect mediocre returns and a fair amount of volatility going forward,"" Hamilton said. When the Fed finally does get around to its next rate hike, volatility is likely to rise, he said.Broadly, he expects the U.S. economy to outperform for several quarters. That should benefit U.S. large caps.James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds and manager of $158 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX), expects a reversal of the recent months' rotation into value away from growth.""Materials, energy, industrials and other cyclical sectors are likely to reverse,"" Abate said. ""So we've taken the opportunity to amplify our positions in stable-growth-type companies, Nifty 50 type names. Key stocks for us are names like Amazon (AMZN), PepsiCo (PEP), Exelon (EXC) and Carnival Cruise (CCL). We sold the one energy stock that we held.""Amazon is the epitome of what he's looking for. ""It is strong and has a unique business model that can grow regardless of the economic backdrop,"" he said.Exelon is a utility with low cyclicality, he said. Its current return on equity is about 9%. ""This is roughly half its 15 year median return on equity,"" he said. ""We see incremental ROE moving higher with plenty of room to expand. With the Pepco (acquisition) closing, we see an increased focus on cost-cutting and rate relief in the regulated utility units contributing to profit margin expansion, with a strong balance sheet to allow future dividend hikes and buybacks.""Equally good, the stock is virtually unaffected by economic developments in Japan or Europe, he said.He also likes the idea that Carnival has almost nowhere to go but up from its depressed profit margins and returns on capital.And he adds Merck (MRK), which he calls another low-cyclicality, defensive name. ""It's got a strong drug pipeline,"" he said. ""It's seeing improvements in return on assets. It can be another Nifty 50 name.""Abate has stayed underweight in energy, industrials and financials. ""In materials, our exposure is to companies that are capable of growing and are not dependent on an acceleration in the global economy,"" he said. In that area, his names include Vulcan Materials (VMC) and International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF).Abate says value stocks are unlikely to add a lot to gains they've scored already this year. ""So I'm embracing companies that are more stable and less sensitive to the ups and downs of the economic cycle,"" he said.He also does not rule out a correction of 20% to 25% some time during 2016, and his fund has hedged that possibility with put options.""Profits are disappointing,"" he said. ""Profit margins are decelerating. And there's a poor top-line revenue outlook. It's hard to see price-earnings multiples expand further.""Like Aguilar, Abate expects volatility the rest of this year. The best gains should be confined to a narrow band of stocks, he says. ""With bond yields low and other asset classes disappointing, we'll see a new Nifty 50 do well,"" he said. ""Diversification is good, but over-diversification can be bad. We're down to 52, down from the mid-60s in 2013.""Polaris Capital Management's Bernard Horn, lead or co-manager of five funds totaling $3.4 billion in assets, is concerned about the impact of sluggish economic growth. He used volatility in recent months to buy shares in larger U.S. and foreign banks at depressed prices, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM). ""The valuation became compelling,"" he said.He also added to asset manager Franklin Resources (BEN). ""They have great long-term performance, but have slumped in the last three to five years. We saw an opportunity to buy into a good long-term franchise with a lot of cash on its balance sheet. They have a relatively low tax rate because they have managers who sit offshore, like Mark Mobius,"" who's based in Hong Kong as executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group.Horn also added to Web.com Group (WEB), which creates and maintains websites for small businesses. ""They help small businesses get onto social media sites,"" he said. ""A business they just bought does sophisticated marketing and lead-generation for customers.""Another he added to was electronics and technology distributor Avnet (AVT), a company which also assembles products for customers. ""They've got a good management team that squeezes out free cash flow and value-added services for customers,"" Horn said.In Q1, he added to Thailand-based Siam Commercial Bank. The investment may not ripen quickly, he says. ""The Thai economy is a little soft now, so this may take time to play out,"" he said.

293,PEP,"Luke Bannister doesn't have to worry about paying for college anymore -- if he even decides he needs to go. At 16 years old, the U.K. drone racer has won a total of nearly $300,000 in two big events so far this year.Some $30,000 of that came just this past Sunday in Los Angeles, where Bannister smoked 11 other top pilots at the DR1 Invitational at the Sepulveda Dam.The kid, who is known as ""BanniUK"" to the drone racing community, is just one of many looking to make a living with the niche sport as the popularity of drones grows. Tommy ""UmmaGawd"" Tibajia quit his business consulting job at a Fortune 500 company to become a full-time pilot, sponsored by PepsiCo (PEP)-owned Mountain Dew. Tibajia won the 2015 Drone Nationals and the International Drone Racing Association (IDRA) California Cup in 2015.Other companies getting in on the ground floor of the sport are Amazon (AMZN)-owned Twitch, which live streams DR1 races. In addition to the DR1 Invitational's live stream, the event will be aired as a special on Discovery Communications' (DISCA) Discovery Channel.Many pilots use GoPro (GPRO) cameras, and have captured big followings by posting their in-flight videos on Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube.Disney's (DIS) ESPN is also involved. The sports network this spring announced a multiyear distribution deal with the IDRA, and the first big race to be showcased will be in early August in New York. You can bet Bannister will be there.He won the IDRA-sponsored World Drone Prix in Dubai this March, where his team captured a whopping $250,000.

294,PEP,"Despite Brexit-inspired global growth woes that pushed bond yields to record lows, stocks rose, helped by a strong jobs report. Breakouts were more common. Tesla Motors (TSLA) held up amid negative headlines. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) bet big on oil, but crude prices promptly suffered heavy losses. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and other carriers face stiff headwinds.The major averages were up and down for most of the week, but moved higher after Friday's strong jobs report. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% for the week, settling Friday just 1 point below a record close and 5 points from an all-time best. The Nasdaq advanced 1.9%. General Electric (GE), Facebook (FB), Costco Wholesale (COST) and Pepsi (PEP) were among the notable breakouts. Apple (AAPL) retook its 50-day moving average. Health food stocks soared after Danone agreed to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV).The 10-year Treasury yield plunged to a record low but closed above those levels Friday.The U.S. economy added 287,000 jobs in June, far more the 180,000 economists expected. It was a sharp bounceback from May, which saw its meager gain of 38,000 revised down to just 11,000. The jobless rate rose to 4.9%, reflecting a jump in the labor force.Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 144,000. That, along with the upward trend in wage gains, might have been enough for the Federal Reserve to start hiking rates again soon, but Brexit will likely keep policymakers on the cautious side.Minutes from the Fed's June 14-15 meeting, when policymakers kept rates steady, revealed concern over the June 23 Brexit vote and the sharp slowdown in U.S. job gains in May. But there remained divisions over the labor market's general health, inflation trends and the outlook for economic growth.Tesla Motors said car deliveries fell well below its forecast for the second quarter. The 14,370 vehicles delivered fell short of its guidance of 17,000, due to ""the extreme production ramp in Q2 and the high mix of customer-ordered vehicles still on trucks and ships at the end of the quarter."" But production fell short of Tesla's estimates as well.It was the second quarter in a row that Tesla has missed its own delivery targets, and it comes as Tesla has made a much-criticized bid to acquire SolarCity (SCTY). A key objection to a SolarCity deal is that it could distract Tesla from ramping up vehicle production.Meanwhile, Tesla confirmed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a preliminary evaluation into the performance of the Autopilot feature in the Model S, following a recent fatal crash. The NHTSA confirmed it will also investigate the recent nonfatal crash of a Tesla Model X ""to determine whether automated functions were in use at the time of the crash.""Tesla shares rose 0.1% fractionally for the week, just between its 50-day and 200-day lines, which crossed in bearish fashion during the week.Chevron, Exxon Mobil and their partners said they would invest $36.8 billion to expand the Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan. Main operator Chevron and its partners have already spent $37 billion on the project. The report comes after BP (BP) said it would spend $8 billion to build another liquefied natural gas plant in Indonesia. Energy giants had cut spending as crude prices fell but the new investments could be a sign that companies are confident about the price rebound after a rally in 2015 failed.But did oil majors bet at just the wrong time? Crude prices have tumbled this week amid global growth concerns, a stronger dollar and higher-than-expected U.S. inventories. U.S. crude fell 7.1% to $45.41 a barrel, its biggest weekly drop since February. Brent futures sank 7.1% to $46.76 a barrel, its sharpest loss since January.Samsung Electronics posted its biggest Q2 sales gain in more than two years, helped by strong demand for its Galaxy S7 handsets. Samsung is benefiting from weaker-than-expected demand for Apple's iPhone 6S handsets. Apple's next smartphone, the iPhone 7, likely will be released in September, but it isn't expected to be much different than the 6S. Apple moved sideways during the week, but the stock closed above its falling 50-day line on Thursday.Meanwhile, BlackBerry (BBRY) said it's ending production of its iconic BlackBerry Classic mobile phones.Shares of Hain Celestial (HAIN) and Amplify Snack Brands (BETR) were among the health-focused food companies that got a lift after French dairy products maker Danone (DANOY) agreed Thursday to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV) -- the owner of Silk soy milk and brands that include Horizon Organic -- in a $10 billion deal. The proposed merger highlights the trend among consumers toward healthier fare. On Thursday, WhiteWave rose 19%, Hain Celestial climbed 7% and Amplify rose 2%. For the week they rose 20%, 6% and 9%, respectively.Delta Air Lines forecast Q2 operating margin and a unit revenue decline that were worse than it had anticipated in April. The carrier also said fuel costs were far higher than expected. Unit revenue declines for Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) might not level off until the end of 2017, Credit Suisse said, while earnings could also come in below consensus for that year. Among the reasons cited for the darker forecast are higher fuel costs, labor deals, Brexit and an unfavorable foreign exchange environment.Southwest Airlines (LUV) traffic rose 6.8% in June, more than the 5.4% capacity increase.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) said June traffic rose 10.9%, outpaced by an 11.7% capacity increase. Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) said June traffic rose 11%, while load factor edged up to 94%.Delta, American, United, Southwest and Alaska Air rose modestly for the week, while Ryanair fell somewhat, but well off its lows.Comcast (CMCSA) soon will offer direct access to Netflix (NFLX) for subscribers with its broadband-based X1 set-top box. The nation's No. 1 pay-TV operator previously refused to allow third-party, over-the-top internet video services on its set-top boxes, for competitive reasons. The arrangement is seen as a win-win for both firms. The deal bolsters Comcast's broadband service and reduces the risk of cord-cutting, while providing an easy on-ramp to Netflix service for new and existing customers.Costco said June sales increased 3% to $11.33 billion, while sales for the 44 weeks ended July 3 rose 2% to $96.33 billion. Shares climbed 5% Thursday in heavy volume, breaking past a 158.89 buy point from a double-bottom base with a handle.Pepsi also broke out Thursday, rising 1.5% to clear a 107.04 flat-base buy point in heavy trade. The packaged-food and beverage giant said quarterly earnings increased 2% to $1.35 a share, beating estimates by 5 cents. Sales fell 3.3% to $15.4 billion, but were above forecasts.Costco rose 1.1% to 165.44 on Friday while Pepsi climbed 0.7% to 108.27.The drugstore chain topped Q3 profit views by 4 cents with 16% growth to $1.18 per share, but revenue gains of 2% to $29.5 billion missed analyst estimates for $29.7 billion. U.S. retail pharmacy sales rose 3.7%. International retail pharmacy sales fell 2.3% but rose 3.4% ex currency. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) raised the lower end of full-year guidance by a dime to $4.45-$4.55, vs. views for $4.49. But shares lost 1.5% for the week, below their 200-day line but rebounding from their 50-day line.
"
295,PEP,"Shares of Hain Celestial (HAIN) and Amplify Snack Brands (BETR) popped Thursday after France's Danone (DANOY) agreed to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), the owner of Silk soy milk, Horizon Organic and other brands, in a $10 billion deal. The companies valued the deal at $12.5 billion ""including debt and certain other WhiteWave liabilities,"" according to a press statement.Hain, the maker of Earth's Best baby food and shelf stable products, Celestial Seasonings herbal teas and other natural and organic food products, leapt 7.1% to 50.63 on the stock market today.Amplify, which specializes in GMO-free healthier snacks, rose 2% to 15.05. Intraday, the stock rose as high as 15.60, clearing a buy point at 15.14. Amplify came public at 18 last August.WhiteWave Foods stock shot up 18.55 to 56.23, hitting a record high.Like other small natural foods suppliers, Hain was hurt as large grocers such as Kroger (KR) moved into the space in recent years with their own brands of organic and natural foods, such as Kroger's Simple Truth line, making WhiteWave, Hain Celestial and other natural food companies more vulnerable to takeover.In addition, larger food companies like General Mills (GIS) have been buying small natural foods makers. General Mills gobbled up Annie's Homegrown, a maker of natural and organic pastas and other foods, in late 2014 for about $820 million cash. Kroger was down fractionally and General Mills edged up less than 1% early Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Food companies have fared better in recent weeks as investors have clamored for defensive plays. Pepsi (PEP) has hit a buy point after a glowing earnings report. Hain stock plunged 53% from an all-time high 70.65 set on Aug. 5 of last year to a 33.12 low in late January and then it turned up.Among other highly rated food companies, TreeHouse Foods (THS), a maker of healthy snacks, beverages and prepared meals, was up 0.8%. J&J Snack Foods (JJSF), which makes baked goods, frozen snacks and other foods, rose 0.2%.
"
296,PEP,"The $5.1 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) has hit a rough patch. Its year-to-date loss of about 8% going into Thursday lags the average 2.96% setback by its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500's 2.45% gain.But you're highly unlikely to hear sounds of panic from the fund's quarters. That's because this is not the first lobster bake for the Boston-based fund managers. They've encountered market volatility before. And they have a way of rebounding.Right now, the fund's IBD 36-Month Performance Rating through May is A+, the highest available. That means the fund's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Around the start of that period, the fund was also battling rough seas. In the second quarter of 2013, the fund lost ground while both its peer group and the broad market romped ahead.Usually, the fund makes the opposite happen. In the more than 53 quarters since the start of lead manager Thomas Galvin's tenure on Feb. 28, 2003 -- he's the longest tenured of three current managers -- the fund has outperformed both its direct rivals and the big-cap bogey 28 times. It has lagged both two quarters in a row only once.That helps explain why this fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories: U.S. stock funds, growth funds and large-cap funds. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.So how has the fund positioned itself for the future? How will it maneuver through a market that is widely expected not to favor a lot of growth names and to be volatile amid a slow-growth U.S. economy? And don't forget the additional headwind from Brexit.Buys and sells are based on which individual securities appear most promising. But it's clear where the managers expect to find most opportunities. They had 41% of their shareholders' money at work in the technology sector as of May 31. Another 34% was in health care. And 12% was in consumer discretionary.Amazon (AMZN) -- to many investors, both a tech and a consumer discretionary name -- has helped fund performance by trending higher since early February. After declining for four quarters, earnings per share have climbed for four frames at a triple-digit pace. EPS growth has accelerated, rising 118%, 122% and 992% in the past three quarters.Amazon was the fund's third-largest holding as of May 31.Amazon is no longer just an online retailer. It also has become a major cloud computing player. And it recently announced a new video streaming service that will compete with Netflix and Hulu. Amazon's Prime video streaming service will be available for $8.99 per month.Amid severe selling pressure in the general market after the Brexit vote, Amazon has climbed from a 603.34 buy point and from an alternate entry of 638.11, as IBD's market coverage has noted. Shares are trading around 725. A stock will often begin to consolidate after rising 20% to 25% past a buy point.Monster Beverage (MNST) is the thirteenth-largest holding. EPS grew 25% in Q1, rebounding from a 6% decline in the fourth quarter.Trading around 160, shares are getting extended from a 154.06 cup-with-handle entry.The stock's six-month base began forming in December.Monster benefits from distribution by its strategic partner and global beverage powerhouse Coca-Cola (KO). Coke bottlers have also boosted the number of outlets where Monster energy drinks are available.And Monster recently debuted a soda called Mutant to compete with PepsiCo's (PEP) Mountain Dew.The value of Monster to Coke? Coke's sales have declined three straight calendar years. Pepsi's fell last year and were flat in 2014. Monster's sales rose 10% each of the past two years.Sherwin-Williams' (SHW) EPS grew 18%, 39% and 31% in the past three quarters. Trending sideways since late April, shares are forming a flat base with a 309.10 buy point.Annual return on equity has grown six years in a row, gaining 43.3%, 64.8% and 113.1% in the past three years. The company is acquiring rival Valspar.Anna Rathbun, director of research for CBIZ Retirement Plan Services, recently told IBD, ""We have seen delayed spending by consumers since the 2008 crash and recession. But if they can spend on things that build equity like homes, they do. We've seen a lot of home improvement projects.""

Some of the other companies making the grade ranged from tech to food to finance.They are: Google (GOOGL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Wells Fargo (WFC), Priceline Group (PCLN), PepsiCo (PEP), BlackRock (BLK), Oracle (ORCL), Kinder Morgan (KMI) and Dollar Tree (DLTR).On the other hand, companies with a lot of floating-rate debt should be avoided when the Fed hikes rates, because their financing costs will rise, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report last week.Despite its enormous sums of cash and overall balance sheet strength, Apple also has a lot of floating-rate debt, according to Goldman.The companies that made it onto the not-so-great stocks list include: McDonald's (MCD), eBay (EBAY), MetLife (MET), Monsanto (MON), Coca-Cola (KO), General Motors (GM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Allergan (AGN), Chevron (CVX), Time Warner (TWX), Ford Motor (F) and General Mills (GIS).The somewhat schizophrenic listing of Apple in the Goldman Sachs report didn't faze investors. Apple shares rose 1%, finishing at 115.31 on the stock market today, helped by early indications that its latest iPhone models are seeing high demand.Follow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter @IBD_CMcEvoy and on Facebook.

407,PEP,"When you're developing cutting-edge technology, it's easy to get carried away. Just ask John Sculley. Apple's (AAPL) chief executive from 1983 to 1993, Sculley had already gained a reputation as a marketing whiz from his earlier years running Pepsi (PEP). In 1992, he oversaw Apple's launch of the Newton, the first handheld personal digital assistant.
"
408,PEP,"""The product failed,"" Sculley recalled. ""We should have spent more time focusing on customer experience instead of saying: 'This is a cool technology. Let's get it out there.'""
"
409,PEP,"Sculley, now 75, remembers the excitement of unveiling a whole new type of mobile personal digital system. He and his team knew they were creating something that consumers had never seen, but their drive to innovate stymied their ability to alleviate a customer's pain points.
"
410,PEP,"""We were focused on this advanced technology instead of identifying a big customer need,"" he said. ""The tech direction we were going in was right, but we were years ahead of ourselves.""
"
411,PEP,"A few years after the Newton launch, Palm Computing introduced its version of a personal digital assistant. It proved a success.
"
412,PEP,"""Palm used traditional technology that had been around for years,"" Sculley said. ""But they solved a real customer problem: how to keep track of numbers for a mobile phone and email addresses."" Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) bought Palm in 2010 for more than $1 billion.
"
413,PEP,"Newton And The Apple Watch
"
414,PEP,"Reflecting on the Newton rollout, Sculley says that it's important not to get too enamored of technology.
"
415,PEP,"""The lesson I learned is always start with solving a really big customer problem in a way that customers tell you they want,"" he said. ""You want to solve that problem in a way that customers love.""
"
416,PEP,"From that standpoint, what does the former Apple executive think of Apple's newest innovation?
"
417,PEP,"""The Apple Watch is a beautiful product with a stellar design,"" Sculley said. ""But the reality is we don't know what people will do with it yet. From an investor's standpoint, it's a 2016 story, not a 2015 story. It'll take well into next year to see the real implication in terms of shareholder value.""
"
418,PEP,"Sculley has heard that individuals who have tested the watch report that they don't pull out their iPhone as much. They are embarking on what he calls ""a new user experience.
"
419,PEP,"""It'll do new things like notify you of alerts on your calendar or allow you to not stop at the front desk when you check into a hotel,"" he said. ""Maybe it'll be used for digital health, or maybe you'll be talking into your watch like Dick Tracy.""
"
420,PEP,"The Moonshot Man
"
421,PEP,"Author of ""Moonshot!: Game-Changing Strategies to Build Billion-Dollar Businesses,"" Sculley now serves as an investor and entrepreneur.
"
422,PEP,"In 1996, he heeded the lesson from the abortive Newton launch when he joined the founding team that built MetroPCS, a prepaid wireless carrier. ""We solved a really big customer problem at price points lower than anybody else,"" Sculley said. ""People wanted an inexpensive way to have a cell phone without a contract, and we reached out to those people."" MetroPCS merged with T-Mobile (TMUS) in 2013.
"
423,PEP,"If you want to spur innovation, Sculley suggests asking, ""What's a big customer problem we can solve?"" He urges CEOs to stay close to the customer at every phase of product development and constantly assess what users think and how you can enhance their experience.
"
424,PEP,"""When you look at all the new technologies, market power is shifting from large incumbent companies to new companies coming out with better customer experiences,"" he said. ""Small companies can become big without waiting a decade to grow.""
"
425,PEP,"He credits social media with enabling shoppers to tap other customers' positive experiences. They provide a springboard for startups to prosper in just a year or two, as long as they devise a better way to address a common frustration that consumers face.
"
426,PEP,"""Uber doesn't advertise,"" he noted. ""It's all word-of-mouth.""When you're developing cutting-edge technology, it's easy to get carried away. Just ask John Sculley.

In 1992, he oversaw Apple's launch of the Newton, the first handheld personal digital assistant.""The product failed,"" Sculley recalled. ""We should have spent more time focusing on customer experience instead of saying: 'This is a cool technology. Let's get it out there.'""Sculley, now 75, remembers the excitement of unveiling a whole new type of mobile personal digital system. He and his team knew they were creating something that consumers had never seen, but their drive to innovate stymied their ability to alleviate a customer's pain points.""We were focused on this advanced technology instead of identifying a big customer need,"" he said. ""The tech direction we were going in was right, but we were years ahead of ourselves.""A few years after the Newton launch, Palm Computing introduced its version of a personal digital assistant. It proved a success.""Palm used traditional technology that had been around for years,"" Sculley said. ""But they solved a real customer problem: how to keep track of numbers for a mobile phone and email addresses."" Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) bought Palm in 2010 for more than $1 billion.Newton And The Apple WatchReflecting on the Newton rollout, Sculley says that it's important not to get too enamored of technology.""The lesson I learned is always start with solving a really big customer problem in a way that customers tell you they want,"" he said. ""You want to solve that problem in a way that customers love.""From that standpoint, what does the former Apple executive think of Apple's newest innovation?""The Apple Watch is a beautiful product with a stellar design,"" Sculley said. ""But the reality is we don't know what people will do with it yet. From an investor's standpoint, it's a 2016 story, not a 2015 story. It'll take well into next year to see the real implication in terms of shareholder value.""Sculley has heard that individuals who have tested the watch report that they don't pull out their iPhone as much. They are embarking on what he calls ""a new user experience.""It'll do new things like notify you of alerts on your calendar or allow you to not stop at the front desk when you check into a hotel,"" he said. ""Maybe it'll be used for digital health, or maybe you'll be talking into your watch like Dick Tracy.""The Moonshot ManAuthor of ""Moonshot!: Game-Changing Strategies to Build Billion-Dollar Businesses,"" Sculley now serves as an investor and entrepreneur.In 1996, he heeded the lesson from the abortive Newton launch when he joined the founding team that built MetroPCS, a prepaid wireless carrier. ""We solved a really big customer problem at price points lower than anybody else,"" Sculley said. ""People wanted an inexpensive way to have a cell phone without a contract, and we reached out to those people."" MetroPCS merged with T-Mobile (TMUS) in 2013.If you want to spur innovation, Sculley suggests asking, ""What's a big customer problem we can solve?"" He urges CEOs to stay close to the customer at every phase of product development and constantly assess what users think and how you can enhance their experience.""When you look at all the new technologies, market power is shifting from large incumbent companies to new companies coming out with better customer experiences,"" he said. ""Small companies can become big without waiting a decade to grow.""He credits social media with enabling shoppers to tap other customers' positive experiences. They provide a springboard for startups to prosper in just a year or two, as long as they devise a better way to address a common frustration that consumers face.""Uber doesn't advertise,"" he noted. ""It's all word-of-mouth.""

430,PEP,"With interest rates at record lows in the past several years, ETFs that invest in dividend-paying stocks have been a popular income alternative for some investors. But will they remain advantageous now that the Federal Reserve is seriously considering hiking rates?It depends on the specific investment objectives of each fund, according to Michael Rawson, research analyst at Morningstar Inc.""When you look at stocks with a high dividend payout, they typically underperform when the economy is doing well,"" he says. ""Those companies usually invest less in future growth (utilities, REITs, consumer staples), therefore they don't participate as much when the economy is growing very rapidly.""Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF (VYM) has over $10 billion in assets and a 12-month yield (net of fees) of 2.72%. However, it is tilted toward value stocks, notes Rawson, so it is not the most favorable to be in when the economy is growing.So what should an investor look at when considering a dividend ETF?Value Stock Tilt?Rawson says it's important to consider whether an ETF ""is tilting toward higher-yielding dividend-paying stocks, which tend to be value stocks, or does it tilt toward stocks which might grow their dividend in the future?""Companies that are able to increase their dividends consistently are usually companies with very strong brand names or very strong market positions,"" he notes. An example is Apple (AAPL), which yields 1.5%, though its dividend hasn't been steady.Dividend growth is one of the reasons he likes $21 billion Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG). It looks for companies that have raised their dividends for 10 straight years. It has a lower yield at 1.91%, but focuses on quality stocks, thus having a slightly bigger exposure to growth companies.In addition, it has a razor-thin expense ratio of 0.10%. It has returned an average annual 14.15% in the past three years vs. the S&P 500's 16.57% advance. Top holdings are Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), PepsiCo (PEP), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""If the Fed were likely to raise rates, I think Vanguard High Dividend Yield might get hurt more than Vanguard Dividend Appreciation,"" Rawson said.Another element to consider is the fund's tilt toward size: whether it's in large-cap or small-cap stocks.IShares Select Dividend (DVY) is one of the highest-yielding ETFs with a 3.03% yield. But the $15 billion fund is tilted toward midcap deep-value stocks, which can make it more volatile. In addition, its 0.39% expense ratio makes it one of the more expensive dividend ETFs, notes Morningstar analyst Abby Woodham in her report.When the Fed raises rates, investors might consider shifting out of stocks and more toward bonds, said Rawson. The reasons people usually hold bonds is for income, diversification and stability. The reason why dividend ETFs are not always a good substitute for bond ETFs is that they don't have the stability of bonds, he said.Investors also need to be mindful of expenses. If those are high, they tend to eat into the yield of the ETF.Cheapest ETF AvailableSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is the cheapest among all dividend ETFs, with an expense ratio of just 0.07%. With nearly $3 billion in assets, it has a pretty attractive yield of 2.58%, while still maintaining the focus on quality stocks.It looks at companies that have paid dividends in the past 10 years and selects those that do well on fundamental metrics such cash flow/debt, return on equity, dividend yield and dividend growth. It's returned an average annual 15.93% in the past three years. Top holdings are Pfizer (PFE), Verizon Communications (VZ), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).International funds tend to provide higher yields, but investors need to be able to stomach higher volatility due to currency fluctuations. The dollar's recent strength has hit the returns of nonhedged ETFs such as the WisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund (DEM) and iShares International Select Dividend (IDV).
"
431,PEP,"From his first season to his last game 40 years ago this March 31, John Wooden stayed true to his values.Wooden (1910-2010) was truly a living legend when he died at 99.Among his numerous honors, the Sporting News in 2009 named him the Greatest Coach of All Time.Wooden won a record 10 national men's basketball crowns at UCLA in a 12-year span, but he wouldn't let that define him.Even winning at his stunning rate, along with the fame and accolades it brought, didn't change him.They never stood a chance of doing that. He was fond of saying, ""Talent is God-given; be humble. Fame is man-given; be thankful. Conceit is self-given; be careful.""He wrote in ""Wooden: A Lifetime of Observations and Reflections on and Off the Court,"" with Steve Jamison: ""Though I was pleased with the titles and championships, I mainly derived satisfaction from the preparation and knowing that I had done everything I could do to get the team ready. That is what pleased me most.""Ready For ActionGary Cunningham, who played for the Bruins and coached them a couple of years after Wooden retired, said: ""Coach Wooden didn't talk about winning; he felt if you did the work during the week's practices, the games on the weekend would take care of themselves. He was proactive in terms of preparation. He used to use the phrase failing to prepare is preparing to fail. He was a great teacher.""Of his NCAA domination, Wooden said: ""My players will tell you I never said to them, 'Here's our goal: a championship! If you don't do it, you haven't succeeded.' They understood very well what I considered success.""He spent years formulating his Pyramid of Success, pointing out: ""Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did the best to become the best you are capable of becoming."" Wooden's best was stellar: As a college basketball coach for 29 years, first at Indiana State from 1946-48, then at UCLA from 1948-75, he went 664-162 for an .804 winning percentage. He never had a losing season. His UCLA teams won seven straight titles from 1967-73. Won 88 straight games from January 1971 to January 1974. He became the first person elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach.""John Wooden is the greatest basketball coach of all time,"" wrote former UCLA center and Hall of Famer Bill Walton for the book ""Wooden."" ""Wooden taught us how to focus on one primary objective: Be the best you can be in whatever endeavor you undertake.""""Character is the basis of leadership, and Coach Wooden he had it,"" said another former UCLA center, Ralph Drollinger. ""His character was impeccable.""Said Cunningham: ""Coach Wooden demanded excellence and demanded we do things correctly.""Another former UCLA center and Hall of Famer, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, wrote: ""Coach taught us self-discipline, and was always his own best example.""Born in Hall, Ind., Wooden was a product of the moral values and work ethic of his parents, Joshua and Roxie. Joshua instilled in John and his brothers uncompromising honesty, being true to oneself, perseverance, empathy and kindness.As a scholar and a basketball star at Purdue University, Wooden was a three-time All-American and the College Player of the Year in 1932. He led the Boilermakers to the national championship that year, pre-NCAA tournament.Bliss And BasketballWooden had found the love of his life in high school when he met Nellie Riley. The two married in 1932 and raised two children until her 1985 death. He remarked in his later years that he didn't fear death because he'd be reunited with her.Wooden began his coaching career at the high school level in the 1930s and early '40s until World War II service in the Navy called.A year after war's end, he became the head coach at Indiana State.He made his mark there with a 17-8 record his first season, then helped integrate the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics tourney in Kansas City, Mo. He refused its 1947 invitation because it banned black players, and Wooden had one, Clarence Walker. The NAIA relented the next year.In the fall of 1948, Wooden took over at UCLA. He produced winning seasons in the most difficult of conditions, which included no permanent home arena or proper practice facility until Pauley Pavilion opened on campus in June 1965.Wooden's first taste of the Final Four didn't come until 1962, when his Bruins lost in the semifinals.Then came the NCAA titles. The constant throughout was Wooden's preparation. ""He was such a great X's or O's coach because he was prepared,"" Drollinger said. ""He was just a great practice coach. We didn't waste a minute in terms of preparation.""Cunningham, a Wooden assistant for a decade, said his boss ""believed in fundamentals and he was a great teacher. We would plan practices in the morning; every practice was intimately planned.""Wooden wrote in ""My Personal Best,"" also with Jamison: ""Organization, which I define as knowing what must be done and doing it in the allotted time, became a strength of mine."" He planned practices ""down to the exact minute on three-by-five inch cards and in notebooks, so there was never any standing around waiting for something to happen. Planning the practice took longer than the practice itself.""The 1973-74 season saw UCLA's record winning streak come to an end, as did its title streak. And future Hall of Famers Walton and Jamaal Wilkes graduated.The next season, even with Dave Myers, Marques Johnson and Richard Washington starting, pundits dismissed the Bruins' title shot.Wooden responded by producing a 23-3 regular season, then three tournament wins to return to the Final Four. Now Wooden faced his longtime assistant, Denny Crum, who was Louisville's head coach. The Bruins won in overtime. After congratulating Crum on what Wooden called a perfect game, the Wizard of Westwood began his routine of going to the pressroom for a postgame interview. Then it hit him.""I just couldn't bring myself to talk to reporters about the game. I don't know why, but something in my head just said, 'It's over,'"" he wrote. So he headed to the locker room instead of the pressroom.Amid the excitement of his players reaching the title game, Wooden waited for them to quiet down, then spoke: ""You've given me as much pleasure as any team I've ever coached, and never caused a single problem on or off the court. I want to thank you for that. It means so much to me, because you are the last team I will ever coach. I'm bowing out.""He later insisted he didn't share his retirement plans with the team for motivational purposes: ""There should never be a need for me to give a pep talk. ... The motivation must come from the players' belief — deeply entrenched — that the ultimate success lies in giving their personal best. More than anything, I wanted players to love the process of doing that.""Two days later, Wooden won his 10th national title as UCLA beat Kentucky 92-85.Of his decision to retire, he recalled thinking, ""It was time to get on with other things."" And he did for the next 35 years.Wooden went on to write numerous books sharing his wisdom.When Orlando Magic Executive Vice President Pat Williams came calling, Wooden, in his mid-90s, happily assisted in Williams' book ""How To Be Like Coach Wooden.""Meanwhile, Wooden was an in-demand speaker. And his legendary Encino, Calif., condo became a pilgrimage spot for former players, assistants, their families and anyone who made arrangements to meet the coach.""As we say goodbye for now,"" he wrote in ""The Wisdom of Wooden,"" his last with Jamison soon before dying, ""I would like to remind you of my dad's advice. ... 'Make each day your masterpiece.' For the better part of a century I have attempted to do that.""

471,PEP,"O'Reilly generates about 58% of its sales from do-it-yourself customers, who take on their own repairs, and the remaining 42% from professional service providers, including garages, repair shops and paint and body shops.
"
472,PEP,"At the end of last year it had 4,366 stores in 43 states. It has 26 regional distribution centers.
"
473,PEP,"O'Reilly's stock has been enjoying an impressive run. The company's share price shot up 50% in 2014. It's risen 8% so far this year.
"
474,PEP,"Why the investor enthusiasm?
"
475,PEP,"""The industry had very favorable weather last year, which helped create a lot of demand,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Higginbotham. ""Everyone's revenue grew nicely. Just as that tailwind seemed to fade, gas prices fell. So there was a nice handoff from weather to lower gas prices.""
"
476,PEP,"O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers have been ""consolidating"" the industry and taking share from the mom-and-pop players, he adds, which has increased their negotiating power with a very ""fragmented"" vendor base.
"
477,PEP,"""That has driven big gains in margin and working capital efficiency, which has also (helped) the stock performance."" he said. ""With longer and longer payment terms from their vendors — having more days to pay — players like O'Reilly have been able to fund inventory at almost zero cost, which allows them to take even more share from the mom-and-pops. (That) leads to even better negotiating leverage and so on, a dynamic which (I refer) to as the 'auto parts retail virtuous cycle.'""
"
478,PEP,"O'Reilly's stock popped around 8% on Feb. 5, following a strong fourth-quarter report late the day before.
"
479,PEP,"Earnings climbed 26% to $1.76 a share, ahead of the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 9% to $1.76 billion, also beating forecasts.
"
480,PEP,"Same-store sales rose a hefty 6.3% from a year earlier.
"
481,PEP,"O'Reilly management did not respond to a phone call requesting a comment for this story.
"
482,PEP,"The company announced that it approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under its share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, raising the aggregate authorization to $5 billion. The additional $500 million is effective for a three-year period beginning on Feb. 4.
"
483,PEP,"Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Craig Kennison calls O'Reilly a ""wonderful"" company.
"
484,PEP,"""At the end of the day, commercial repair shops are in the business of fixing cars and the best way to serve them is to have the right part at the right time at the right price when they need it,"" he said. ""It's about parts fulfillment. I think O'Reilly has the right distribution infrastructure to get parts to consumers and repair shops when they need it.
"
485,PEP,"""If you look at the financial metrics, (O'Reilly generates) a tremendous return on capital, it has very strong cash flow and a good (stock) buyback strategy to return capital to shareholders,"" he added.
"
486,PEP,"What differentiates O'Reilly from the other auto parts retailers is that it has the ""strongest history and most consistent execution of a mix of retail and commercial businesses,"" adds Higginbotham.
"
487,PEP,"He says that auto parts retailers that historically have had a retail focus are ""moving more"" into the commercial business.
"
488,PEP,"""O'Reilly has the most dense distribution of all the players,"" he added. ""It has the most distribution centers per store. That allows them to fulfill orders more efficiently, more often, which is more crucial in the commercial business than the retail business.""
"
489,PEP,"The commercial business, Higginbotham adds, is a ""different ball game"" in terms of having to be able to say yes to as many requests as possible. He says that having the supply of products to meet the requests means investing a lot in inventory and distribution.
"
490,PEP,"""O'Reilly is best at doing that,"" he said.
"
491,PEP,"Higginbotham says that several years ago, store growth was the big driver of O'Reilly's strong performance.
"
492,PEP,"More recently, it's been a function of the company's ""superiority"" in terms of execution, which has helped it gain a lot of market share, he adds.
"
493,PEP,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O'Reilly to see a 16% rise in full-year 2015 earnings to $8.55 a share. They expect a 13% gain in 2016 and a 14% increase in 2017 — lower growth than in years past but still strong.
"
494,PEP,"Low Gas Prices Drive Business
"
495,PEP,"Lower gas prices should be a nice tailwind for the industry, says Higginbotham.
"
496,PEP,"""Lower gas prices are an important driver because if gas is cheaper, people tend to drive more and it puts more wear and tear on their cars,"" he said.
"
497,PEP,"They tend to benefit the low-income consumer — the do-it-yourself customer — the most, he adds.
"
498,PEP,"Lower gas prices can have a ""meaningful"" impact on spending on car repairs, adds Kennison.
"
499,PEP,"""In a tough economy people will defer spending on car repairs,"" he said. ""At some point the deferment catches up.
"
500,PEP,"""Lower gas prices give consumers the resources to fix some deferred maintenance items.""

502,PEP,"Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne famously roused his team to beat Army with his 1928 ""Win one for the Gipper"" speech. With the college football national title game on tap Monday night between Ohio State and Oregon, here's a look at how gridiron leaders have inspired players:
"
503,PEP," Pull them together. ""The team. The team. The team."" That was coach Bo Schembechler's message in a 1983 speech to his Michigan Wolverines.
"
504,PEP,"""We're going to believe in each other. We're not going to criticize each other. We're not going to talk about each other. We're going to encourage each other. And when we play as a team, when the old season is over, you and I know it's going be Michigan again.""
"
505,PEP,"In 21 years as coach at Michigan, Schembechler lifted the Wolverines to 16 finishes in the Associated Press' top 20 poll.
"
506,PEP," Smooth frayed nerves. The Southern California Trojans were down 24-6 to Notre Dame at halftime in 1974.
"
507,PEP,"Instead of firing them up, USC coach John McKay soothed.
"
508,PEP,"Offensive coordinator John Robinson recalled McKay telling players that they just had the jitters and he was prouder of that team than any he'd coached.
"
509,PEP,"""During this whole halftime, we did not talk any football at all,"" Robinson said during a 2012 speech.
"
510,PEP,"The Trojans promptly took the field and scored 49 more unanswered points for a 55-24 triumph.
"
511,PEP," Appeal to egos. Bobby Bowden, who coached the Florida State Seminoles from 1976 to 2009, believes in raw emotion. ""Enthusiasm can accomplish what every other effort has failed to do,"" he wrote in ""The Bowden Way.""

We're going to wait until that ball is snapped, we're going to put a Riddell (helmet) on somebody, and we're going to be the most physical football team in the country until the whistle blows,"" he said.
"
515,PEP,"For an additional nudge, Holtz mentioned taunts from a rival coach that the Irish weren't tough.

521,PEP,"As an NBA rookie in 1989, David Robinson took a businesslike approach to basketball. He showed up, gave full effort and kept quiet.""I figured that I'll do my job and that's fine,"" said Robinson, who went on to win two NBA championships, an MVP award and 10 trips to the All-Star game during his 14-year career with the San Antonio Spurs. ""I thought, 'He gets a paycheck. He gets a paycheck.' They get paid just like I do.""The Spurs were coming off a terrible season in which they won only 21 games. Robinson's arrival excited fans, but few expected an instant turnaround in the team's fortunes.Sensing that his star rookie possessed leadership skills, Spurs head coach Larry Brown urged Robinson to assert himself more forcefully among his teammates.""Coach told me, 'They need to hear more from you,'"" Robinson recalled. ""I didn't realize how guys feed off each other and how connected they are, so at first I didn't play the role of leader as well as I should have.""Taking Brown's advice, Robinson gradually grew more vocal with his teammates. He showed interest in their lives as well as their on-court attitude and performance.Finding His VoiceBy season's end, Robinson not only won Rookie of the Year honors but also led the Spurs to the second round of the playoffs. And he became increasingly comfortable acting as a team leader.For Robinson, now 49, the key to collaborative success is finding a way to maximize everyone's role. Many teams underperform because they dwell on self-perceived defects.""The No. 1 thing is: Don't complain about who you have in the room and who you don't have,"" said Robinson, co-founder of Admiral Capital Group, a real estate investment firm with offices in New York City and San Antonio. ""Especially in sports, you're always complaining about who you want because you don't have enough firepower. But you can't always choose your teammates, so you need to have confidence in the people you have around.""Pep TalksRobinson supported teammates who lacked certain skills but brought offsetting strengths to the squad. He'd praise their contribution.""Say you have a point guard or a No. 2 guard who's not a great shooter,"" he said. ""Maybe they're better at leadership or defense or other things. So for me, it was my staunch defending of that person in the locker room. Their performance definitely got better as a result.""A U.S. Naval Academy graduate who earned the nickname ""The Admiral"" as a basketball star, Robinson led by rallying the troops. He'd take teammates aside for pep talks.""I let them know I believe in them,"" he said. ""I'd say, 'I'm watching you, man. I see you getting better every day. You make us better. I need that from you every day.'""

"
563,PEP,"How do you follow a legend?
"
564,PEP,"That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.
"
565,PEP,"Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.
"
566,PEP,"Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.
"
567,PEP,"Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.
"
568,PEP,"The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.
"
569,PEP,"Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.
"
570,PEP,"IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?
"
571,PEP,"Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.
"
572,PEP,"IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.
"
573,PEP,"Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.
"
574,PEP,"IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?
"
575,PEP,"Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.
"
576,PEP,"IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?
"
577,PEP,"Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.
"
578,PEP,"We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.
"
579,PEP,"IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?
"
580,PEP,"Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.
"
581,PEP,"IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?
"
582,PEP,"Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside. I'll add four or five nice valuation bets and diversify the fund more.
"
583,PEP,"IBD: Is the purpose of added diversification to cut volatility?
"
584,PEP,"Peters: It's not necessarily to make the fund less volatile. But the result is that it is less volatile over time.
"
585,PEP,"IBD: What's your biggest bet?
"
586,PEP,"Peters: I'll answer that this way. My biggest overweight is a bet on higher interest rates. That's moved against me year-to-date, but I'm still ahead of the market.
"
587,PEP,"IBD: Do you still pick Miller's brain?
"
588,PEP,"Peters: He's been my biggest mentor. Always will be. We are very close friends. I have the utmost respect for him.
"
589,PEP,"He was relieved when I charted my own course. That contrarian streak in buying negative price momentum and being differentiated, that got reinforced by and I learned a lot from Bill. I learned about being intellectually diverse, reading widely, talking with people, not being dogmatic, all from Bill. Yet it allowed me to be different from Bill.
"
590,PEP,"We talk investing, but we rarely talk individual names.
"
591,PEP,"Bill is a huge contrarian (too). We share that common DNA, and he pushed me to really think for myself and look at the facts, which is essential if you are going to have a contrarian approach. Be contrary to opinions and not facts.
"
592,PEP,"IBD: How much skin do you have in the game?
"
593,PEP,"Peters: I'm one of the larger shareholders in the fund, which is how it should be. It's the largest chunk of my net worth. My SEC disclosure has me over the $1 million mark. When I get bonuses, I add to the fund. I am the largest individual shareholder in the fund, though some institutional shareholders have more.
"
594,PEP,"IBD: Your June disclosure shows your stake in Apple (AAPL) jumped to 1.3 million shares from 205,000 as of April 30. Apple had a 7-for-1 split, so did you also trim?
"
595,PEP,"Peters: Yes, Apple had a split, and I've actually been trimming.
"
596,PEP,"I typically buy when a negative narrative goes too far. I get excited if the hurdle goes from 4 feet high to an inch high. That was the case with Apple at 400. At 650 it's a tougher case. (Post-split Apple is trading around 95.)
"
597,PEP,"People are excited about a 6-inch screen (on the iPhone) and a watch that are supposedly coming.
"
598,PEP,"But Apple is discounting flattish margins. It is discounting some growth. And it's a higher hurdle to jump over. It's not massively overvalued. But it's less interesting than it was.
"
599,PEP,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is another recent split, right?
"
600,PEP,"Peters: It is. This is a classic for us. We got involved before the big biotech run, when it was a value stock. When I joined the fund, health care was in the dumps.
"
601,PEP,"I love positive price momentum. I just don't want to pay for it. We trimmed before biotech got hit in March. Then when Celgene got sold (by the market) in Q2 we added back when expectations got reset. I think Celgene will be a long-term winner. And we think Celgene will prevail on its Revlimid patents (in its court fight against Natco, which is developing a generic rival for Revlimid).
"
602,PEP,"IBD: Is fracking the bedrock of your Halliburton (HAL) play?
"
603,PEP,"Peters: They put straws a mile down into the ground, go out 5,000 feet horizontally, then blow up rock underground to drive more oil up. The more complex those wells are, the better the economics for Halliburton.
"
604,PEP,"What we noticed about the shale revolution is that rig productivity is doubling every three years, which is amazing. Halliburton is capturing a lot of those efficiencies.
"
605,PEP,"IBD: Why did you trim Broadcom (BRCM) between April and June?
"
606,PEP,"Peters: This was classic for us. Broadcom was doing some bad things, throwing huge amounts of money into chasing Qualcomm's (QCOM) monopoly in baseband chips. They made no headway. They diluted their own fundamentals on an uneconomical bet.
"
607,PEP,"They ended up with the lowest valuation of all large-cap semiconductor stocks. We bought when everyone told us we shouldn't. It was in the high 20s. (Now it's trading in the high 30s.) It was so bad, it was good. We thought they would get pressure from employees, shareholders, their own board to fix things. We felt if they made changes for the better, the stock would go up a lot.
"
608,PEP,"And last quarter, lo and behold they said 'Uncle.' They stopped chasing Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband. They said they'd give back more to shareholders. Profit margins would go up. So you'll see positive earnings revisions.
"
609,PEP,"We still think the business value is higher, somewhere in the 40s. Now it has positive momentum. We have a big position. So you'll see us trim a little.
"
610,PEP,"IBD: Calpine (CPN) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your thesis?
"
611,PEP,"Peters: We began buying early this year around 19. Late first quarter, early second quarter. They're taking a 12% free cash flow yield, which is extremely high, and buying back a lot of stock. So we got in effect a high tax-efficient yield. In a 2.5% 10-year Treasury world, that's a good way to win.
"
612,PEP,"We (the U.S.) reward underbuilding utility power supply in the U.S. Especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility. Which is great for Calpine.
"
613,PEP,"IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is uptrending despite modest EPS results. What's your view?
"
614,PEP,"Peters: They got hit with negative earnings revisions due to ObamaCare. But the stock was cheap enough to withstand it. Now estimates have stabilized. They have growth in services, growth in their core managed care side. Mixed with low valuation and better earnings as we look into 2015, it will result in a nice stock. A low valuation lets you be timing agnostic.
"
615,PEP,"IBD: When did Expedia (EXPE) look like a value play to you?
"
616,PEP,"Peters: We bought it last fall when it stumbled on earnings last summer. It became very cheap.
"
617,PEP,"I met management in the fall and became comfortable that they had gotten their technology platform in good enough shape to manage pressure from Priceline (PCLN). I felt we should see positive earnings surprises against a lower bar.
"
618,PEP,"And we think the online travel space is a good cash generator.
"
619,PEP,"IBD: What do you like about truck and parts maker Paccar (PCAR)?
"
620,PEP,"Peters: Trucking capacity is getting tight. You can't get drivers. And the (national) fleet is getting old, so it's set for a replacement cycle in a big way. That's building a big fundamental tailwind for Paccar. And they're good about capital allocation.
"
621,PEP,"IBD: Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) is uptrending, so why do you still like it?
"
622,PEP,"Peters: They've done a good job turning no top-line growth into bottom-line growth by smart capital allocations. And they're buying back a lot of stock well below its business value.
"
623,PEP,"They've driven profit margins higher and rationalized their business. Also — and this bothers me a little — people have been looking for domestic plays. Dr Pepper is a North American beverage play unlike Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP). Its valuation is getting less attractive. But we're still holding it.
"
624,PEP,"IBD: What bothers you about investors liking U.S. stocks?
"
625,PEP,"Peters: We try and find uncrowded games, and the U.S. is seen as the safe zone right now. That may be true, but high investor expectations and crowding make it a risk.
"
626,PEP,"IBD: Wells Fargo (WFC) has met or topped consensus expectations in recent quarters. What else do you like?
"
627,PEP,"Peters: They're incredibly well managed. After their last stress test regulators said basically that they can return about 100% of their earnings to shareholders if they want to, which is unprecedented, with Citigroup (C) hanging out at zero. And they're dominant in the mortgage market. Return on equity is well into the double digits. They're selling below business value. And if we get higher interest rates, that's going to be good for large banks and life insurers.How do you follow a legend?That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012.

640,PEP,"Maybe the race wasn't to the swift during biblical times, but in the 21st century you'll get left behind in a hurry if you're slow out of the gate with new technologies.Rivals of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) are finding that out.Ultimate makes workforce management software designed to help clients better manage employee-related services such as payroll, benefits, recruiting, performance management and time management.The core product is UltiPro, software that manages the employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement. Ultimate delivers it via the Internet cloud.That last part — the cloud — is what separates Ultimate from others in its industry, analysts say. Ultimate was an early mover in designing an integrated, cloud-based human resources/payroll system, giving it a leg up on rivals who have taken longer to leverage the cloud.""As the move to the cloud has accelerated, Ultimate has been one of the biggest beneficiaries,"" said Samad Samana, analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""They are taking a lot of customers away from ADP (ADP), Ceridian and Paychex (PAYX).""Clout Of The CloudCloud-based systems have several advantages over hardware-based systems, Samana told IBD.""There is a lower overall cost of ownership because you don't have to purchase hardware,"" he said. ""There's less staff cost in terms of management. And there are more frequent updates to the software, which helps you keep up with the pace of innovation.""Ultimate's ability to trot out new products and innovations has been one of the keys to its consistent financial growth through the years. The company posts double-digit sales and earnings gains with regularity and is expected to keep doing so well into the future.""The market for Ultimate's solutions is large and growing rapidly. The company has strong, highly regarded products, increasing scale, and a business model that better balances revenue growth and profitability than many SaaS (software as a service) peers,"" MKM Partners analyst Kevin Buttigieg noted in a report last month initiating coverage on Ultimate with a ""buy"" rating.Ultimate boasts 2,700 customers with employees in 150 countries. Its client list features a diverse range of firms, including software maker Adobe Systems (ADBE), restaurant operators Bloomin' Brands (BLMN) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), auto parts retailer Pep Boys (PBY) and Major League Baseball.Ultimate mainly focuses on two types of customers: enterprise companies, defined as those with more than 1,500 employees, and mid-market companies, or those with around 500 to 1,500 employees.Ultimate's enterprise sales team, which consists of 75 sales reps, has ""an unusually low turnover"" rate with an average tenure of 10 years, Barrington Research analyst Jeff Houston noted following Ultimate's third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 28.He cites several reasons for the low turnover, including ""not penalizing successful salespeople by narrowing their territories as well as world-class benefits.""Winning BusinessDuring a conference call with analysts, Ultimate CEO Scott Scherr noted a number of enterprise wins during the company's third quarter, though he didn't divulge the names of the customers. These included a ""high-profile"" restaurant chain with 18,000 employees, a security company with 6,500 employees and an education services company with 3,600 employees.While most of Ultimate's business comes from large and mid-sized clients, the company has lately increased its efforts to land more smaller companies of 500 or fewer employees, analyst Houston says.""Management was clear that it has been selling to companies with fewer than 500 employees for a long time, and that it is just adding more salespeople to target the low end of the market,"" he noted.FBR's Samana reckons it will be some time before the move to land more smaller clients begins to have much impact on Ultimate's financial results.""The move downstream is a newer initiative for them, so it's something where we will see a bigger contribution a couple of years from now,"" he said. ""It's not as big a driver in the near term.""What About Job Gains?Although analyst Houston says Ultimate stands to benefit as the economy adds jobs, CEO Scherr mentioned on the third-quarter conference call that with new customers being Ultimate Software's biggest growth driver, changes in employment ""are not that material"" to the overall growth goal.During the third quarter the company logged revenue of $127.4 million, up 24% from the prior year and just ahead of consensus analyst views. Earnings gained 25% to 50 cents a share, topping estimates by a penny.Recurring revenue, or revenue that is likely to continue in the future, increased 26% during the quarter.""The increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our cloud offering,"" Scherr said in a statement.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Ultimate to post full-year 2014 earnings of $2.02 a share, up 26% from a year earlier. EPS is seen rising another 22% to $2.46 in 2015.The company's stock price touched a nearly eight-month high of 156.20 on Tuesday. Shares are up 20% since Oct. 10.Ultimate is part of IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group, which ranks No. 7 out of 197 industries tracked. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 97, which ranks fifth in the group. Three stocks in the group have Composite Ratings of 99: Manhattan Associates (MANH), Paycom Software (PAYC) and Synchronoss Technologies (SNCR).

The report also said ""several private-equity funds"" have been eyeing the company for a leveraged buyoutEarlier in the year Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly was considering buying a stake in SodaStream.The company continues to attract interest amid growing demand for healthier, custom-made drinks. Cash-strapped consumers still open their wallets for small splurges like beverages.SodaStream may need a partner as it faces increased competition from Coca-Cola (KO) and Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR), which have teamed up to design an in-home soda maker.PepsiCo (PEP) also joined the in-home soda wars, investing in European-based Bevyz with Keurig. The company launched an at-home beverage maker in the U.S. in March.SodaStream went public in November 2010 for $20 per share and peaked at $78 in 2011 before competition increased.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

766,PEP,"But ObamaCare is just the latest failure. Remember that awful Benghazi night of 9/11/12 when the president was somewhere unknown while four poor Americans died at the hands of a terrorist mob with zero rescue effort attempted? The Accountability Review Board that investigated that scandal without talking to the woman in charge that night, Hillary Clinton, found systemic failures of management, planning and oversight by the Obama administration crew. But no one was held accountable.Remember the IRS scandal where high-handed agents illegally targeted Obama's political opponents and even religious groups for audits and long-term hassles? If these were rogue agents, as Democrats claim, they were rogues who reported regularly to higher-up politicos in Washington during the 2012 campaign. But, wouldn't you know, all of their computers coincidentally crashed, swallowing many incriminating emails.Obama runs the White House as such a tight ship that his own lawyer just down the hall neglected to inform her boss of the unfolding political scandal, he claims.Remember the Veterans Administration scandal? That's where an unknown number of vets died for lack of timely medical care, workers forged false schedules and accounts to protect their performance bonuses and Obama's pick, a combat veteran who ran the entire Army, could not figure it out.VA problems are long-standing. In fact, Obama ran on a promise to fix them seven years ago. But last spring he professed ignorance until CNN's exposes gained media traction. Now, Obama's turned to a veteran of corporate wars to attempt reforms.Obama was off in Kansas City yesterday at another pep rally, mocking House Republicans as his go-to excuse for government paralysis. That doesn't explain Obama's first two years when Republicans controlled zip and Democrats couldn't spend a trillion in stimulus money so it created millions of promised jobs.At the more than 400 fundraisers that Obama does run efficiently, he dismisses these systemic administration failures as phony scandals. But a growing number of investigative agencies within the federal government seem to disagree.Obama's serial scandals and his tardy, begrudging responses inevitably blaming others are fast creating the image of Democrats as the folks who can win the White House but can't run anything once they're in. Obama can only have Osama bin Laden killed once.More importantly, the Obama administration's chronic pratfalls raise serious questions about the viability of his vaunted welfare state where big government takes on more concerns and responsibilities with more regulations, taxes and spending.Maybe all this will teach American voters not to elect as the nation's leader an inexperienced, unvetted rookie legislator who hadn't managed a lemonade stand.But then, looking at the choice they could have made for president in 2012, maybe not.RELATED:Record high job approval for the president -- of Russia

782,PEP,"Middle East: Announcing ""up to 300"" advisers for crumbling Iraq, President Obama says U.S. troops won't ""be fighting in Iraq again,"" but maybe Iran can save the country. Is he engineering American decline?The president on Thursday announced ""a small number"" of military advisers for Iraq. Meanwhile, we will ""assess how we can best train, advise and support Iraqi security forces going forward.""The Iraqis know this is Groucho Marx's pep talk during the war scene in ""Duck Soup"":""Remember, while you're out there risking your life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in here thinking what a sucker you are.""Obama's papier-mache assistance also sends a message to the world of American undependability, paralysis and global decline.The president touts ""targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it."" Uh, ""the situation on the ground"" is that a Sunni terrorist caliphate is conquering northern Iraq and Syria.A few shots won't undo that, so what exactly is the point, except to confirm to our enemies that U.S. actions are ineffective and further the myth that ""George W. Bush's war failed""?""I want to emphasize,"" Obama says, ""that the best and most effective response"" is ""partnerships"" — this from the man who wouldn't partner with Iraq on a simple diplomatic task like a status-of-forces agreement that would have precluded the present mayhem there.""Shia, Sunni, Kurds"" must all ""have confidence that they can advance their interests and aspirations through the political process rather than through violence,"" Obama declares — with U.S. force nowhere in the equation. Yes, and as the joke goes, the Jews and the Arabs should settle their differences in a Christian manner.Again and again, Obama promised no real help. ""There's no military solution inside of Iraq, certainly not one that is led by the United States,"" he said, adding that a mutated al-Qaida taking over Iraqi cities ""reminded us of the deep scars left by America's war in Iraq"" — i.e., this is all Bush's fault.And he promised that sending in a small group of advisers ""does not foreshadow a larger commitment of troops to actually fight in Iraq.""He did suggest, it should be noted, that the U.S. power vacuum in Iraq and Syria might by filled by soon-to-be-nuclear Iran, for whom Obama had some friendly advice.""Iran obviously should consider the fact that if its view of the region is solely through sectarian frames, they could find themselves fighting in a whole lot of places,"" he observed. ""And that's probably not good for the Iranian economy ... an Iraq in chaos on their borders is probably not in their interests.""Actually, the U.S. is the country with chaos on its border. And how long will it take Obama to realize that fanatics don't care about what's good for their economy?Is American decline this president's objective? Or is it just that his ego blocks his view of any reality?

816,PEP,"PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) reported its second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 10 before market open and shares jumped about 4.8% in the key trading session. Earnings topped estimates thanks to solid Frito-Lay snacks growth, which made up for the struggling North America Beverages segment.Core earnings per share (EPS) of $1.61 beat the consensus mark of $1.51 per share by 6.6% and increased 8% year over year. Notably, this marked the ninth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise. Investors should note that the earnings outperformance came despite rising trucking and commodity costs (read: Will Consumer ETFs Lose Momentum on Trump Tariffs?).Net revenues of $16,090 million increased 2.4% from the year-ago level. Foreign exchange (Fx) had one percentage point positive impact on revenue growth. However, reported revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,125 million.There were also bright points in the report. First, North American beverage organic revenues fell less (down 1% in Q2) than in Q1 (when it was down 2%). Second, Frito-Lay organic revenue growth was 4% in Q2, up from 3% in Q1. Management plans to return $7 billion to its shareholders through dividends worth $5 billion and share repurchases worth $2 billion.ETF ImpactThe consumer staples ETFs having notable exposure to PepsiCo also seemed to have benefited on Jul 10 (see all Consumer Staples ETFs here).Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)The most-popular consumer ETF on the market, XLP, follows the S&P Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. Of its 32 holdings, the in-focus PepsiCo takes the third spot, making up roughly 9.60% of the fund.In terms of sector exposure, the fund is skewed toward beverages (26.19%) which makes up for one-fourth share, closely followed by Household Products (20.73%) and Food & Staples Retailing (19.99%). The fund was up about 1.2% but has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to a basket of 98 consumer stocks. PepsiCo takes the third position holding 8.0%. The product is widely spread across various sectors, of which soft drinks take 20.7% allocation. The fund has a Zacks Rank Zacks Rank #5 but advanced about 1% on Jul 10 (read: FIFA Frenzy Puts Spotlight on These Stocks and ETFs).iShares U.S. Consumer Goods ETF (IYK  -  Free Report)This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Goods Index, giving investors exposure to the broad consumer staples space. The fund holds about 108 stocks in its basket. Here too, PepsiCo occupies the third position in the basket with 7.10% of assets.

817,PEP,"For investors seeking momentum, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report) is probably on radar now. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up roughly 8% from its 52-week low price of $48.76/share.But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:XLP in FocusXLP focuses on the consumer staples segment of the U.S. market. The fund has a large-cap focus with key holdings in the beverages, household products, food & staples retailing and food products segments. XLP charges investors 13 basis points a year in fees and has top holdings in Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) (see: all the Consumer Staples ETFs here).Why the Move?The consumer staples sector has been an area to watch lately given the risk-off sentiments. The bitter exchange of tit-for-tat tariff threats has sparked fears of global recession, thereby raising the appeal for consumer staples stocks. This is because the sector generally acts as a safe haven amid political and economic turmoil. Stocks in these sectors generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty.More Gains Ahead?Currently, XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a Medium risk outlook, suggesting that outperformance could stall in the months ahead. However, many of the segments that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank, so there is definitely some promise for those who want to ride this surging ETF a little further.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

821,PEP,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 numbers on May 8, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed analysts’ expectation. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the last four quarters, the average being a negative 1.2%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to drive the company’s first-quarter 2018 results.Product InnovationProduct innovation plays a major role in boosting revenues. The company’s net sales grew 10.5% in 2017 on the back of a wide portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in domestic and international markets. The company also introduced a number of products in the quarter under review, which is expected to contribute to the upcoming quarterly results.In the quarter to be reported, Monster Beverage launched Caffé Monster in three flavors, Monster Energy Ultraviolet, Monster Hydro in three flavors and relaunched Muscle Monster in two flavors.It launched Monster Hydro in Sweden and Germany, Monster Energy Ultraviolet in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom along with Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the first quarter of 2018.Strong Energy Drinks MomentumSales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment, accounting for 90% of total sales, improved 10.4% in 2017. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are particularly cautious about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content products. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks will drive the company’s top line.Notably, strategic deals with notable brands bolstered the company’s portfolio and strengthened presence in the international energy drinks market. The Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, improved more than 10% in 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Increased Costs to Hurt MarginHigher raw material costs (mainly aluminum and sweeteners), unfavorable product mix that included more Java products coming online (lower-margin product) as well as inventory destocking in China dented gross margin by 390 basis points (bps) in the preceding quarter. The company expects gross margin to be similar to the fourth-quarter level going forward, as the headwinds are expected to persist at least through the first half of 2018, barring inventory reserves in China. Along with this, higher distribution costs from higher freight expenses are expected to create pressure on operating margin in 2018.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 revenues is pegged at $859.8 million, reflecting an increase of 15.9% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for earnings is 39 cents, implying 18.2% year-over-year growth.Quantitative Model PredictionMonster Beverage does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Monster Beverage has an Earnings ESP of +0.64%.

822,PEP,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research where Associate Stock Strategist Ben Rains dives into the potential future of Gatorade rival BodyArmor, before he discusses why fast-fashion giant Uniqlo decided to spend $300 million to lure Roger Federer away from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report). The episode then ends with a fun and quick dive into the world of publicly traded soccer teams amid all the Cristiano Ronaldo transfer speculation.Sports drink upstart BodyArmor was launched in 2011 by Mike Repole, who sold Vitaminwater to Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) for $4.1 billion back in 2007. Today the company has gathered a slew of young stars, including James Harden, to pitch BodyArmor’s “healthier” sports drink in an attempt to try to shake up a market dominated by Pepsico’s (PEP  -  Free Report) Gatorade and Coca-Cola’s Powerade.There is speculation that BodyArmor, which expects to see its sales hit $400 million next year, could get purchased. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group  currently holds a roughly 15% equity stake in the company and has carried BodyArmor as an allied brand since 2013. However, with Keurig's $18.7 billion deal to buy DPS set to close on Monday, July 9—the merged company is expected to trade under the ticker KDP starting on Tuesday, July 10—BodyArmor’s future is more uncertain.One Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) analyst suggested that there is a good chance that Keurig Dr. Pepper will move on from its current minority stakes. The thought is that the relatively stagnant Coca-Cola might jump in and scoop up BodyArmor amid the quickly changing beverage market.The episode then shifts to why Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo—which is owned by Tokyo conglomerate Fast Retailing —signed Swiss tennis star Roger Federer to a 10-year, $300 million deal. Uniqlo wants to try to capitalize on the current sportswear and athleisure push, popularized by Nike, Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report), and others. And although he might not be very famous in the U.S., ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) recently named Federer the 5th most famous athlete on the planet.Full-Court Finance closes with a look at the world of publicly traded soccer teams, after shares of Juventus JVTSF—a massively popular team based in Turin, Italy—skyrocketed in recent days on the back of speculation that Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo might be headed to the club almost a decade after he left another publicly traded soccer powerhouse, Manchester United plc (MANU  -  Free Report).As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

823,PEP,"Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated  is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 financial numbers on May 8, after the closing bell.This large independent bottler of The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an encouraging strategy to grow both organically and through the acquisition of additional manufacturing and distribution territory.A Look at Its Sales PerformanceThe company’s fourth quarter was one of the busiest quarters, in which System Transformation acquisition transactions with the Coca-Cola Company came to an end. With the company’s expanded footprint, net sales increased 33.8% in the last reported quarter. The upside can be attributed to acquisitions and higher comparable net sales.Comparable net sales improved 6.7%, driven by 1.5% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes. Sparkling product comparable volumes were down 0.7%, while that of still products increased 8.3%.In 2017, Coca-Cola Bottling reported net sales growth of 37% year over year, primarily on acquisitions and a 3.1% hike in comparable net sales owing to 1.6% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes. The trend is expected to continue in the first quarter as well.The sparkling product portfolio and higher margin still product range drove comparable net sales of the company. Sparkling product comparable volumes grew 0.2% year over year and that of still products increased 4.9% in 2017. This trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Higher Expenses a WoeHigher expenses (such as expansion transaction and amortization expenses) might dent the company’s bottom line. Notably, the stock witnessed dismal trading in the past six months, with the stock plunging 20.1% compared with the industry’s 7% decline.In the fourth quarter, the company’s income from operations declined 104.2% year over year and in 2017, the same decreased 24.8%.

824,PEP,"The first-quarter earnings season is past the halfway mark, with more than 900 companies including 142 S&P 500 members due to report results this week.According to the latest Earnings Preview, results of 267 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 27, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members were up 25.1% year over year on more than 10% higher revenues. Of these, 76.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 73.8% beat revenue expectations.Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are likely to increase 22.6% from the same period last year on 8.4% higher revenues. Total earnings for consumer staples companies are expected to grow 6.8% while revenues are likely to increase 3.1% in the first quarter of 2018.Some of the key players in the sector — Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) — have already released their quarterly numbers. Procter & Gamble, popularly known as P&G, reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products. The company has also lifted its core earnings per share guidance.PepsiCo reported first-quarter 2018 results, with earnings and revenues both beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise for the company. The improvement was mainly attributable to strong performances in its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.Coca-Cola started 2018 on a strong note, beating the consensus mark on both counts in the first quarter. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following stocks within the consumer staples sector that are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1.Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79% last quarter. The Oreo-maker surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 4.43%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of +0.34% and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The food industry within the consumer staples sector has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the past few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (for example, a shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat) and consumer dynamics (such as increased need for portable and on-the-go products), demographic shifts and also a shift in demand for low-priced products.Mondelez, like other legacy brands including General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014.Nonetheless, in order to counter the tepid sales trend, Mondelez has been focusing on innovation and brand building. The company has also undertaken some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. Mondelez’s to-be-reported quarter’s results are likely to gain from its Power Brands, favorable trends in emerging markets, higher pricing, productivity and cost saving initiatives, partly offset by higher input costs.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, indicating a 15.1% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.66 billion, implying 3.8% growth.(Read More: Will Cost Saving Plans Aid Mondelez's Q1 Earnings?) Mondelez International, Inc.

QuoteArcher-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is a leading food processing company. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.14%. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.7%.Our proven model does not show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to-be-reported quarter. Archer Daniels sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Archer Daniels has a dismal surprise history. In fact, the company has been lagging sales estimates for more than three years now. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $14.52 billion, down 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprise in eight of the preceding 10 quarters. This drab performance can be attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.However, Archer Daniels’ focus on cost savings to strengthen its business has been offsetting the sales headwind to some extent. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 50 cents for the quarter under review reflects a decline of 16.7% year over year.

826,PEP,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 10, before market open. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.4%. It also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 4.3%.Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for Q2PepsiCo has been head on heels trying to improve its performance through product launches, fortifying developing/emerging market presence, aggressive marketing, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives. The success of the company’s initiatives was well reflected in first-quarter 2018 earnings, which were driven by strong international performance on revenue growth in the developing and emerging markets.Moreover, the company’s fundamental strength is evident from its solid brand portfolio, product innovation and strong snacks business. Notably, PepsiCo has delivered positive earnings surprise for eight consecutive quarters.Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteAs a result, PepsiCo stock has been gaining over the past month, reflecting a positive sentiment ahead of earnings. The company’s shares have increased 7.9%, outperforming the industry’s 4.4% rise.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is $1.51 per share, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 0.7%. However, we note that the consensus mark for the to-be-reported quarter has moved south in the last seven days. The downward estimate movement can be attributed to the fact that the beverage industry is witnessing sluggish CSD (carbonated soft drinks) volumes, which is a pressing concern. CSD volumes for PepsiCo’s North America Beverages (NAB) business decreased 4% in the first quarter of 2018. Looking back, PepsiCo’s CSD volumes declined 2% each in 2014 and 2015, 1% in 2016 and 5% in 2017 in the NAB business.Furthermore, consumer taste is rapidly shifting from CSDs to non-carbonated beverages. To this end, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier alternatives. Currently, a major portion of PepsiCo’s total net revenues comes from “Guilt-Free” products, more than half of which comes from the “Everyday Nutrition” category. This percentage is likely to increase, given the company’s stepped-up innovation and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences.PepsiCo has also broadened its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to decrease the dependence on colas, keeping in mind the slowdown in CSD volumes. The company’s non-carbonated beverage volume mix increased 7 percentage points since 2010.Nonetheless, results of the NAB segment — comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada — remained soft in the first quarter. This is because it was negatively impacted by higher input costs and operating cost inflation that substantially offset productivity gains. The results were also affected by a bonus, extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act.Segment DiscussionPepsiCo’s North America Beverages or NAB business accounts for about 33% of the company’s total revenues. Revenues at the segment declined 1% in first-quarter 2018, preceded by declines of 6% and 3% in the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2017. However, the metric remained unchanged in the first two quarters of 2017. The trend is unlikely to reverse in the to-be-reported quarter as well. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NAB segment revenues is pegged at $5.18 billion. This reflects an increase from $4.4 billion reported in the first quarter and a decline from $5.24 billion in the year-ago quarter.For the Frito-Lay North America or FLNA business (accounting for 25% of revenues), PepsiCo had a good balance of volume growth and net price realization. The segment’s revenues improved 3% last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.8 billion, mirroring an increase from $3.6 billion in the prior quarter and $3.7 billion in the year-ago period.The Quaker Foods North America segment revenues improved marginally in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $551 million compared with $601 million in the first quarter and $553 million in the second quarter of 2017.The Europe Sub-Saharan Africa segment revenues grew 15% in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.04 billion, implying an increase from $2.8 billion in the prior-year quarter and $1.7 billion last quarter.The Latin America segment revenues were up 14% in the last reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $1.9 billion compared with $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2017 and $1.2 billion in first-quarter 2018.Revenues at the Asia, Middle East and North Africa segment improved 7% year over year in the first quarter. The metric is likely to increase to $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2018 from $1.6 billion registered in the year-ago period and $1.04 billion in the prior quarter, per the consensus estimate.Overall, for the second quarter, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to come in at $16.1 billion, reflecting 2.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:PepsiCo does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of +0.18%.

827,PEP,"Craft beer, which till some time back was a favorite with Americans, seems to be losing its appeal. According to market research firm IRI Worldwide, craft beer growth slowed in the first half of 2018 and the rest of the year doesn’t look good either. Moreover beer shipments from U.S. breweries too are down so far this year. An increasing number of Americans is opting for non-alcoholic beverages that have resulted in demand for energy drinks to shoot over the last few years.Understandably, this has made soft beverage manufacturing companies focus more on healthier drinks, especially non carbonated, low sugary and energy drinks. So much so, that even alcoholic drink manufacturers are focusing on non-alcoholic beverages.Craft Beer Losing AppealTill a few years back, craft beer was a favorite with Americans. However, with changing tastes and preferences of the new generation, the appeal for craft beer is fading. And the change seems to be more evident this year. According to the Beer Institute, beer shipments from U.S. breweries are already down 3.5% this year.Per IRI, worldwide sales of craft beer across large-scale retail stores grew only 1.7% in the first half of 2018. Interestingly, in 2002, beer comprised 54% of overall alcohol sales but in 2017 beer contributed only 46% of total alcohol sales. This is certainly taking a toll on prominent beer manufacturers like Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), which are struggling to cope with declining demand for beer.The reason for this sudden beer-apathy is the growing preference for healthier drinks. An increasing number of Americans is becoming health conscious, which has seen a decline in demand for carbonated beverages. The carbonated soft drink market has shrunk for 13 consecutive years now. Carbonated soft drinks volume fell 1.6% in 2017 and is projected to decline between 0.8% and 1.3% this year.Industry Swings Toward Non-Alcoholic and Energy DrinksThe global non-alcoholic beverage market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 5.5% between 2018 and 2023, according to Market Research Future. Analysts believe that growing consumer awareness and increasing interest in a healthier lifestyle is making people shun alcoholic and carbonated drinks.This has resulted in the energy drink market to grow at a rapid pace over the last few years. Energy drinks continue to outperform the overall soft drink market in terms of value. The global value of energy drinks reached more than $51 billion in 2017.Understandably, millennials are opting for healthier and non-alcoholic drinks, which has made not only soft beverages companies shift focus toward healthier drinks, but also beer manufacturers reorient their product line with low-alcohol content.Beer manufacturers like Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) and Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (BREW  -  Free Report) are trying to come up with innovative products and adding new flavors that have less alcohol content. The Boston Beer Company recently launched Fuzzy Traveler Peach Shandy that is low on alcohol content. Craft Brew Alliance has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.On the other hand, almost all beverage companies like The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V (FMX  -  Free Report) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) are redesigning their portfolio along these lines.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The improvement was mainly attributable to strong performances in its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.PepsiCo’s shares have inched up 0.8% in the pre-trading session following the earnings release.EarningsPepsiCo’s first-quarter core earnings per share (EPS) of 96 cents beat the consensus mark of 92 cents by 4.3% and increased 3% year over year. In constant currency terms, adjusted earnings remained unchanged from the year-ago period.Core earnings exclude restructuring and impairment charges, and commodity mark-to-market net impact.

Foreign exchange translation had a positive impact of 2% on reported EPS.SalesNet revenues of $12.56 billion increased 4.3% from the year-ago level. Foreign exchange (Fx) had a 2% negative impact on revenue growth and pricing had a positive impact of 2%. Reported revenues also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.41 billion.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 2.3% on an organic basis, primarily driven by higher demand for food/snacks in the Latin America, Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA) and Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) segments. Notably, overall organic sales growth was the same as recorded in the last reported quarter.Total volume grew 1% in the quarter, whereas volumes remained unchanged in the previous quarter.

That said, the company’s revenues improved 15% in ESSA, 14% in Latin America, 7% in AMENA and 3% in FLNA segments. Meanwhile, revenues at QFNA remained unchanged in the quarter from the year-ago level.Notably, the company’s NAB segment was negatively impacted by higher input costs and operating cost inflation that substantially offset productivity gains. The results were also adversely affected by a bonus, extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act. Meanwhile, each headwind decreased the operating profit performance by 8%.Operating profits (on a reported basis) decreased 23% in NAB and 5% in QFNA segments. However, the same grew 42% in Latin America, 23% in ESSA and 10% in AMENA segments.

Before fees and expenses, SIZE seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Risk Weighted Index.The MSCI USA Risk Weighted Index comprises of U.S. large and mid-capitalization stocks with relatively smaller average market capitalization.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for SIZE are 0.15%, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.65%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.For SIZE, it has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector --about 17.70% of the portfolio --while Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Republic Services Inc (RSG  -  Free Report) accounts for about 0.46% of the fund's total assets, followed by Pepsico Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 4.07% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has lost about -1.36%, and is up about 9.43% in the last one year (as of 04/26/2018). SIZE has traded between $75.33 and $88.18 in the past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.90 and standard deviation of 12.41% for the trailing three-year period, which makes SIZE a high choice in this particular space.

831,PEP,"Business Insider reported on Tuesday about a group of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) investors who collectively hold $3 billion in company stock, and are seeking to remove Mark Zuckerberg from his position as chairman of the company. As per the article, the investors cited dissatisfaction about the firm’s recent scandals as well as what they feel is an unfair distribution of voting rights as motivation for seeking a leadership change.Facebook stock is divided into two categories: Class A and Class B shares, each with their own voting rights. Class A shares are worth one vote each, while Class B shares are worth ten votes each. Zuckerberg owns more than 75% of Class B stock, meaning that he has more than half of the voting power in the entire firm.Investors are unhappy with this arrangement because they feel that it insulates him from any challenges to his authority. This concern was illustrated at last year’s investor meeting, during which a proposal to remove him as chairman was both quickly and entirely shut down. Considering the troubles that have recently plagued Facebook, would it be be a good idea for Zuckerberg to step down? Let’s take a walk down memory lane before we consider the question.A Story You May Be Familiar With  In 1985 a thirty-year old Steve Jobs found himself pitted against John Sculley, the then-CEO of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), whom he had originally recruited from Pepsi (PEP  -  Free Report). At the time Jobs was leading the Macintosh team, which was the company’s single most lucrative product line up until that point. Jobs wanted to price the computer at a point that would make it accessible to the average consumer, but Sculley argued that a low price would lead to inadequate profit margins.This disagreement, along with ideological differences on the future of the company would continue to escalate. The firm’s board of directors sided with Scully, and Jobs proceeded to leave the firm later that year. It was not until 12 years later, after years of overall underperformance and the possibility of bankruptcy, that Jobs would be brought back on as CEO.As the story goes, Jobs, through various restructuring efforts and a previously unthinkable partnership with Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), turned the firm around and led the way for Apple to become what it is today. To many, the outing of Jobs by his own company was a necessary growing pain. Regardless of one’s feelings on the matter, the numbers show that it was his return that saved the firm. Perhaps it was the time Jobs spent on other ventures that set him up to succeed, or maybe investors just needed to reach a desperate enough point to listen to his ideas. Either way, Apple was better off with its founder.While the Apple story is by no means a perfect parallel to that of Facebook’s, from it we can draw the conclusion that perhaps it is the person who has built their firm from the ground up that truly understands what is best for its future. However, it would be irresponsible to just make such a claim and stop there. Let’s see how this thesis holds up in another more recent situation.In More Recent Memory Up until quite recently, Uber’s Travis Kalanick was as untouchable as Zuckerberg appears to be now. The founder and now former-CEO had control of both the firm’s voting rights as well as its board of directors. Kalanick purposely left four of the board’s eleven seats empty, and of the remaining seven (one of which is him), only two seats belong to outside investors. But, what is interesting about the Uber situation is that investors were still able to succeed in taking back some of this power.By the time Kalanick would step down, he too was no stranger to controversy. Media headlines have included outcry on Kalanick’s crude humor, user privacy violations, a Google lawsuit over Waymo technology, illicit competition strategies, and an online #DeleteUber protest, just to name a few. By June of 2017, a group of investors who own more than a quarter of the company’s stock had seen enough and demanded his resignation through letter. They threatened to release the letter online and add to the firm’s PR woes in the event that Kalanick refused to do so. He would step down later that day.Uber has become unrecognizable to those who have seen the firm’s transition from the management of Kalanick to current CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who before Uber sat at the reigns of Expedia Group (EXPE  -  Free Report). Whereas Kalanick encouraged growth at all costs, Khosrowshahi constantly reminds his team to operate in baby steps, focusing on first optimizing the application’s current features before thinking to release new ones. However, so far things appear to be going rather well.When Khosrowshahi came into Uber, he inherited a slew of unresolved issues. This included the Waymo lawsuit, the hacking and theft of the data of 57 million customers and drivers, which was purposely hidden from the public for a year, as well as a ban on all operations in London. Thus far, the lawsuit has been settled, new security measures taken, and on Tuesday, the firm was granted a 15-month license to resume operations in London. In January of this year, the firm sold an additional $8 billion in stock to a group of investors led by Softbank, a deal which also brought an end to the lopsided distribution of voting rights held by Kalanick and his allies.While Uber still has many challenges ahead, including stringent competition from rival services and controversy over its self-driving initiative, the changes created through the resignation of its founder Travis Kalanick are clear to see. Unlike Apple, it may be better for the firm’s long-term health to move on from Kalanick for good.Back to the Present In the case of Apple and Uber, leadership change was necessitated by underperformance and significant controversy at the behest of its founders. Facebook, however, has been one of the strongest performing companies in recent memory, having seen whopping 705% growth in stock value over the last five years (compared to a still respectable 91.3% industry average return).Still, investors are unhappy and have stated that they feel he is running the company like a “corporate dictatorship.” These concerns were amplified in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal that saw Facebook used as a tool to illicitly collect data on millions of its users and utilized for such purposes as building voter profiles during the 2016 presidential election. This was not the sole controversy, serving as only one on a list that includes retaining users’ deleted videos, Russian interference and the propagation of “fake news,” to name a few. Many feel that these challenges, coupled with what they see as an overly inexperienced leader in Zuckerberg is a potentially dangerous combination.While there is certainly credence to concerns about Zuckerberg’s consolidated power, some of these arguments are flawed. Yes, Facebook should be doing more to respect its users’ privacy and to diligently monitor the possibility that their information be exploited. Facebook itself has made a lot of its money by effectively turning its user base into a product and collecting browser usage and other data to sell to advertisers.The issue however is that there is very little precedent to just about everything that the firm has accomplished. Never before has there been an entity with as large and as detailed a collection of information as Facebook. The question of how this information should be utilized and regulated is one that firms such as Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), and many others are grappling with as well. These firms also collect data about its users and target them through partnerships with advertisers. In this sense, Zuckerberg is being used as a scapegoat to mask a broader question, that being how society will approach the nuanced questions of this information golden age.If Zuckerberg can commit to more transparency and to more evenly distributing decision making privileges across his firm’s governance structure, it is hard to see what other legitimate reason there would be to replace him. The controversies and challenges that he has struggled with are one that any other executive would struggle with as well, because there is no point of reference under which to operate. In this sense, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which Facebook will be notably better off without its hoodie-loving founder.Time will tell if Facebook can continue its massive growth, and many eyes will be watching to see how it handles its data and potential future controversies. But for now, let’s take a deep breath and give Mark some more time.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

832,PEP,"The Coca-Cola Company’s (KO  -  Free Report) North America segment’s revenues, comprising about 30% of its top line, are expected to witness growth in the first quarter of 2018, when it reports on Tuesday, Apr 24.A Look at Coca-Cola’s North America Performance in Q4The North America segmental revenues totaled $2.62 billion last quarter, up 6% year over year on 2% growth in price/mix. Organically, revenues rose 3% in the quarter while unit case volume grew 1%. Price/mix increased on the company’s disciplined approach to occasion, brand, price and package strategy, as well as positive business and category mix.Notably, sparkling beverage volumes have shown no growth during the quarter with 1% decline in juice, dairy and plant-based beverages, as mid-single digit growth in Minute Maid and Simply was offset by a decline in Hi-C. The company registered an 8% rise in tea and coffee, while water, enhanced water and sports drinks accelerated to 3% growth.Precisely, the company’s sparkling beverage unit case volume remained flat in the respective fourth, third and second quarters with a 1% decline witnessed in the first quarter of 2017. Notably, the sparkling beverage accounted for 69% of the company’s 2017 worldwide unit case volume. Hence, such vast exposure puts Coca-Cola in a weak spot.Coca-Cola’s North American sparkling beverage business has been delivering sluggish results due to headwinds in the carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category. Cross-category competition, and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting demand for CSDs. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The challenges in the CSD category have been affecting all major soft drink makers namely Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group , leading to lower volumes and soft sales.Q1 ExpectationThough Coca-Cola has increased marketing investments, and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts are yet to show meaningful results with the trend unlikely to change in the first quarter as well.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate called for Coca-Cola’s North American segmental revenues of $2.49 billion, reflecting an increase from $2.39 billion a year ago but a decline from $2.62 billion in the prior quarter.Apart from the North American segment, Coca-Cola’s Latin American segment is likely to register revenues of $1.01 billion versus $1.12 billion in the prior quarter and $926 million in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment’s revenues of $1.73 billion indicates a marginal decrease from $1.75 billion sequentially but an increase from $1.63 billion in the prior-year quarter. Bottling Investments revenues are anticipated to decrease to $1.1 billion from $1.27 billion in the third quarter and $3.87 billion a year ago. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase to $1.2 billion from $1 billion in the prior quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues are likely to remain almost flat.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsOverall, the beverage behemoth’s first-quarter revenues are likely to decline on structural changes. Meanwhile, the company had earlier stated that the first quarter will have one less day than the same period last year. Coca-Cola expects the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to impart a 26-point headwind and 6-point headwind on net revenues and profit before tax, respectively, in the first quarter.That said, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to some extent. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Again, currencies are likely to have a one point tailwind on its first-quarter operating income.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents for first-quarter earnings reflects 7% growth from the prior-year period’s profit of 43 cents per share. Also, the consensus mark for revenues of $7.43 billion represents a 18.6% decrease on a year-over-year basis.(Read More: Will Cost Cut, Innovations Drive Coca-Cola Q1 Earnings?)Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM)  Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM) | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

833,PEP,"Markets finished lower on Friday, as technology stocks took a hit owing to concerns of weak demand for iPhones. Also, the broader consumer staples sector took a hit led by Pepsi and Procter& Gamble. Moreover, a rise in bond yields, reflecting fears of rising inflation, kept investors worried. The 10-year Treasury note touched a four-year high leading to huge selloffs. Following these events, all the major indexes closing lower on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.8%, to close at 24,462.94. The S&P 500 fell 0.9% to close at 2,670.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7146.13, shedding 1.3%. A total of 6.45 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.92 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.40-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow declined 201.95 points as shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) tumbled on concerns of weak demand for iPhones, leading to a decline in all tech stocks. Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) declined 1.1%, while Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) fell 1.9% and 1%, respectively. Apple has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The S&P 500 declined 22.99 points to close in the red, with consumer staples and technology taking a major hit, with all but one index closing lower. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) declined 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 7146.13 points.Tech Stocks, Consumer Staples Take a HitTech stocks declined on Friday, with Apple at the helm of the carnage, as concerns over weak demand of iPhones saw the company’s shares plummeting. Shares of Apple declined 4.1% after Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) predicted that sales of iPhone in the June quarter will be low.This saw other tech stocks taking a hit for the fourth consecutive day ahead of the earnings week for the sector. Tech stocks have been reeling under pressure for quite some time now and the low sales projection of iPhones is a further blow to the sector.Moreover, consumer staples stocks declined led by PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), which fell 2.9%. Also, shares of Procter & Gamble and Phillip Morris International (PM  -  Free Report) declined 2.9% and 1.6%, respectively. Procter and Gamble’s shares declined after the company said on Thursday that higher costs and shrinking retailer inventories were weighing on its margins. Shares of Philip Morris declined after the company reported weak shipment volumes in its quarterly results.10-Year Treasury Note Hits 4-Year HighFriday’s decline in stocks were also driven by investors’ fears over concerns of expectations of rising inflation., The 10-year Treasury yield reached 2.96%, its highest level since January 2014. This saw huge selloffs in bonds. Investors panicked as they felt that the government’s protectionist policy will boost inflation higher. However, banks stocks gained on the back of higher rates. This saw the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) gain 0.1%.Weekly RoundupIt was a mixed week for all the three major indexes as the earnings season got into full swing. U.S. stock markets surged on the first two day of the week driven by robust first-quarter 2018 earnings results, strong economic data and easing geopolitical tensions. The middle of the week was a mixed bag for the markets with the Dow declining marginally.However, the last two days of the week saw all major indexes ending in red. This was primarily because of concerns over rising inflation, which saw the 10-year Treasury yield touching a four year high. Moreover, consumer staples stocks too suffered, as earnings failed to produce any blowout results that the market was looking for. The tech sector was once again hit after Morgan Stanley said that iPhones would witness sales in the June quarter.However, despite this, both Dow and S&P 500 rose 0.4% each over the week, while Nasdaq gained 1.3%.Stocks That Made HeadlinesKansas City Southern Q1 Earnings Miss, Improve Y/YKansas City Southern’s (KSU  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

834,PEP,"The Fearless Girl facing the Manhattan financial district's famous Charging Bull near Wall Street will get a new permanent home by the end of this year in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Despite several criticism, the statue has become a tourist destination and a global symbol of female business prowess since its installation more than a year ago.About The Fearless GirlShe is a ponytailed, young, four-foot-tall bronze monument with fists on hips and chin held high as a symbol of empowerment. State Street Global Advisors at Bowling Green Park on Broadway Street originally installed the sculpture on the eve of International Women’s Day 2017. The Fearless Girl is a growing symbol for gender equality and the power of women in leadership. It spreads a message to encourage companies to recruit women to their board. The plaque at the statue’s feet reads “Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.”The ‘Fearless Girl’ is part of a campaign by State Street to encourage companies to add more women to their boards and to advertise SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE  -  Free Report), which comprises gender-diverse companies that have a relatively high percentage of women among their senior leadership.Inside SHEThis ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that demonstrate greater gender diversity within senior leadership than other firms in their sector by tracking the SSGA Gender Diversity Index. Holding 168 stocks, it is moderately concentrated on the top firms as each account for less than 5.8% of assets. Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) are top three holdings. From a sector look, information technology takes the largest share at 22.2%, followed by healthcare (16.4%), consumer staples (13.1%) and consumer discretionary (12.0%). SHE has returned 10.2% over the past year versus the gain of 15.45% for the broad market fund (SPY  -  Free Report).Impact On Women-LeadershipOut of 700 companies in the United States, Britain and Australia that had no women serving on their boards, more than 150 companies have added a female director to their boards since the placement of the bronze girl statue, with another 34 pledging to do so. Currently, women make up 5% of CEOs in the Fortune 500 companies and 17% of the corporate board members among Fortune 500 companies.Today, a record number of women are in power this year. In the United States, 32 Fortune 500 CEOs are women, three women are in the Supreme Court, and three of the last eight U.S. Secretaries of State were women. Last year, 15 of 146 world leaders were women, eight of whom served as their country’s first female leaders. Some of the famous women leaders include Angela Merkel and Dilma Rousseff.In the corporate world, Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report); Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report); Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors (GM  -  Free Report); Angela Ahrendts, Senior Vice-President of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report); Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report); and Michele Buck, CEO of Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report) are leaders in their own right. Per several researches, companies led by women have a long history of outperformance.Bottom LinePlacing the Fearless Girl right next to the NYSE is the perfect metaphor to promote more companies to hire women to their boards, according to the State Street Global Advisors. With the move, the Fearless Girl will be more powerful standing alone outside NYSE than the her current home turf, which she shares with the Charging Bull. Hopefully, she will continue to stimulate the power of having women in leadership.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

835,PEP,"Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 28. This leading branded food company in North America delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.7% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for Conagra this time around.Conagra Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Conagra Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Conagra Brands Inc. Quote Value-Over-Volume Strategy to Drive SalesConagra is likely to continue gaining from its value-over-volume strategy, which is aimed at driving the top line. Under this regime, Conagra ensures that its robust volume performance is not driven by price discounts but by stronger innovation, as well as new merchandising, distribution and consumer trail-related investments.For instance, new investments to strengthen frozen business will likely boost sales of Refrigerated & Frozen segment, going forward. On the other hand, brand renovation initiatives, executed to reinforce snacks business, would likely aid in improving Grocery & Snacks segment’s near-term sales. Moreover, the company believes favorable foreign currency translation impact will bolster its revenues in the quarters ahead. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments are pegged at $789 million and $671 million, compared to the year-ago period tally of $749 million and $640 million, respectively.We also expect acquisitions to keep benefiting Conagra’s sales. Incidentally, buyouts of brands like Angie’s, Sandwich Bros, and Duke’s and Bigs fueled third-quarter fiscal 2018 sales growth by 240 basis points. We expect these factors to augment Conagra’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 top line, thereby continuing the year-over-year growth trend.Cost Inflation Remains a WorryHowever, Conagra’s gross margin remained under pressure in the fiscal third quarter, due to increased cost of sales (mainly above the line marketing investments) and input cost inflation (of 3.7%). Input cost inflation mainly stemmed from higher packaging and transportation expenses.Though SG&A expenses and A&P costs reduced year over year, gross margin contraction more than offset these factors and led to lower adjusted operating margin. Unfortunately, input cost inflation is likely to remain a hurdle in the quarter to be reported. Nevertheless, focus on innovations and efforts to boost top line should help offset these hurdles and cushion the bottom line, which is also likely to gain from lower tax rates.Q4 Estimates in NumbersAnalysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of $1,939 million, up more than 4% from the year-ago period. The current consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 43 cents, which shows a 16.2% jump from the year-ago period. The estimate remained unchanged in the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsHowever, our proven model doesn’t show that Conagra is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, the stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Though Conagra has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against sell-rated stocks going into earnings announcement.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Fastenal Company (FAST  -  Free Report), a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +1.32%.Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), a Zacks #3 Ranked company, has an Earnings ESP of +0.15%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

836,PEP,"General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 27. This global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods has a mixed earnings surprise record in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for General Mills this time around.General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | General Mills, Inc. QuoteFactors Driving General MillsGeneral Mills is likely to benefit from its four key global strategies for fiscal 2018, which are aimed at enhancing the company’s top line. Well, General Mills’ North American Retail segment has been facing sales declines at its U.S. Cereal and U.S. Yogurt businesses, which lingered in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. General Mills, like many other U.S. food producers, has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food. Nonetheless, as part of its key strategies, General Mills is increasing focus on its cereal business and is also restructuring its U.S. Yogurt portfolio through innovations.Analysts polled by Zacks expect sales at the North American Retail segment to increase 1.6% to $2,430 million in the third quarter. Apart from these, the company should also gain from its solid focus on strengthening e-commerce network. Notably, the company expects global e-commerce business to grow in double-digits in near future, the United States. These factors along with General Mills’ consumer-focused innovations and marketing strategies should fuel sales in the quarter to be reported.Cost Savings Versus Cost InflationGeneral Mills’ margins remained soft in the third quarter, as the company is encountering escalated supply-chain expenses, owing to a rise in freight, commodities and operational costs. These headwinds are expected to linger, which is clear from management’s raised input cost inflation outlook for fiscal 2018. The company now expects input cost inflation of 4%, a point greater than the prior guidance. This also led to a lowered operating profit outlook for fiscal 2018, which gives out unfavorable signals for the fourth quarter.Nevertheless, the company remains on track with its cost-savings initiatives like increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply-chain optimization and expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business. General Mills earlier announced plans to deliver approximately $390 million in supply-chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018, through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. These along with incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives should help offset the aforementioned hurdles in the quarter under review.Q4 Estimates in NumbersAnalysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of $3,918 million, up 2.9% from the year-ago period. The current consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 75 cents, which shows a 2.7% jump from the year-ago period. The estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsHowever, our proven model doesn’t show that General Mills is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, the stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.General Mills fails to meet both, as it has an Earnings ESP of -3.23% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Hence, we caution against sell-rated stocks going into earnings announcement.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report), a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%.Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), a Zacks #3 Ranked company, has an Earnings ESP of +0.15%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

837,PEP,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, Ben Rains discusses the business of basketball as the NBA Finals, featuring LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers and Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors, heats up. From strong TV ratings during the 2017-18 season to continued social media growth throughout the world, the NBA looks like a league poised to dominate for decades to come.The NBA saw its national television ratings climb during the regular season across the league’s television-network partners, which includes Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN, and Turner’s  TNT. Meanwhile, local TV ratings jumped as well on outlets such as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Fox Sports FOXA. This all comes in contrast to the NFL’s ratings declines over the last two years.Viewers and investors should also note that the NBA secured its first-ever presenting sponsor for the NBA Finals, with Google’s (GOOGL) YouTube TV featured throughout the broadcast in an array of ways. Going forward, the NBA’s close relationships with the likes of Google and other streaming services could play a huge role in its future success.But it’s not just the NBA’s TV partners benefiting from the league’s growth, the likes of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Western Union WU, Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Goodyear GT, and many more have joined in on the fun. And this comes on top of the major investments American Express AXP, Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) continue to make.Furthermore, Nike NKE looks poised to benefit from its new NBA partnership that might see it remain in business with the league for a long, long time—especially as the likes of Adidas ADDYY and Under Armour UAA become less relevant in the world of basketball.The NBA is already much bigger than nearly every sports league in the world on Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). It has also established a strong relationship with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) through multiple Twitch streaming deals, which includes the rights to the league’s brand new esports league it developed with Take-Two Interactive TTWO.Looking ahead, the NBA’s growth in China—through partnerships with Tencent (TCEHY  -  Free Report) and Weibo (WB  -  Free Report)—will be intriguing to follow.As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

838,PEP,"Consumers’ tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are a concern for beverage giants like The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report). Despite these challenges, the two cola behemoths are major players of the food and beverage industry.In this context, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which are scheduled to report earnings on Apr 24 and Apr 26, respectively, assume greater significance. Both soft drink giants carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major stocks reporting earnings from Apr 23 to Apr 27 include Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report).Price PerformancePepsiCo has lost 6.9% in the past year, in contrast to the broader industry’s gain of 2.4% during the same period.In comparison, Coca-Cola has outperformed the broader industry as well as its rival, gaining 2.9% over the same time frame.ValuationThe price to sales (P/S) ratio is particularly relevant in a consumer focused industry whose fortunes are dictated by the ebb and flow of sales. This ratio indicates that market value of each of the company’s sales dollars in the industry. The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/S ratio of 4.79.While coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/S ratio of 2.22 PepsiCo is undervalued than the broader industry. Meanwhile, Coca-Colawith a P/S ratio of 5.73 is obviously pricier.Net MarginProfitability ratios acquire greater importance in an industry characterized by high margins. Net margin is a good metric to compare the profitability of companies within the same industry, since they are bound by the same business constraints.With a net margin value of 11.84%, PepsiCois well behind the industry average of 18.47%. With respect to profitability, Coca-Cola, with net margin of 23.37%, is clearly better placed than both PepsiCo and the industry.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt servicing capacity. In the context of the soft drinks industry, it is an indicator of the company’s long-term sustainability.PepsiCo’s debt-to-equity ratio of 307.77 is alarmingly high, compared to the industry’s D/E ratio of 187.73.  With a D/E ratio of 181.69, Coca-Cola evidently has a better leverage position.Dividend YieldCoca-Cola’s and PepsiCo’s dividend yields over the last year is 3.52% and 3.05%, respectively. Although, both cola giants offer better dividend than the broader industry’s figure of 2.77%, it is clear that Coca-Cola holds a clear edge over its immediate competitor.Earnings History and ESPConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Coca-Cola has delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 1.5%. On the other hand, PepsiCo has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 4.1%.However, a more detailed analysis of the both the soft drinks companies’ performance in the last four quarters shows a different story. In 2017, after missing the earnings estimate in the first quarter, Coca-Cola continued to beat the earnings estimate in the remaining three quarters significantly. While, PepsiCo after posting steady earnings beat in the first three quarters of 2017, managed to surpass the earnings estimate marginally after the company’s CSD volumes fell 5% last year.When considering Earnings ESP, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have ESP values of -0.34% and -0.97%, respectively. Moreover, Coca-Cola’s earnings estimates for the current year have increased by 2% over the last 60 days, while the same metric for PepsiCo has advanced by only 0.4%. ConclusionOur comparative analysis showed that Coca-Cola is overvalued compared with PepsiCo. However, Coca-Cola undoubtedly holds an edge over PepsiCo, when considering price performance and dividend yield. Additionally, when we take a more comprehensive look at the companies’ previous earnings performance and estimate revisions, Coca-Cola is the better stock.Moreover, despite the fact that both the soft drinks giants have a negative ESP, Coca-Cola is better off given that it is expected to incur a lower level of loss. Additionally, when considering net margin and debt-to-equity ratio, Coca-Cola holds an edge over PepsiCo. This is why it may be a good idea to bet on Coca-Cola over PepsiCo as both prepare to report earnings next week.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

839,PEP,"Cost-saving initiatives and productivity improvement have been favoring PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) amid subdued sales in the recent quarters, courtesy of growing health consciousness. PepsiCo’s shares have sunk approximately 3.8% in the past year, against the industry’s rise of 2%. Nonetheless, the company is striving to retain investors’ optimism and regain its footing.The company stepped up productivity and cost-saving initiatives to boost profitability by reducing overall costs. In February 2014, the company announced a new five-year restructuring plan to generate annual productivity savings of $1 billion each from 2015 to 2019, through productivity measures. The savings come from improved efficiency through increased manufacturing automation, closure of manufacturing facilities and increasing capacity utilization, re-structuring go-to-market systems in developed markets, expanding shared services as well as simplifying organization structures.In the past two years, the company has been using automated high-speed packaging lines across the globe, which increased packaging line speed by up to 50%. Savings from these investments and technology and operational changes are being re-invested in the business to drive the top line.Apart from cost savings, PepsiCo’s product innovation and aggressive marketing techniques are boosting growth.The company regularly introduces new flavors of existing products and maintains a robust pipeline of new products. Most of the company’s latest line-up of products offer health benefits like reduced calorie beverages, non-carbonated beverages and healthier snacks. It is working to offer products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat to reap benefits from shifting consumers’ preference toward healthier products.Moreover, the company has significantly stepped up its advertising & marketing (A&M) and R&D investments to strengthen its brands and accelerate product innovation. It has significantly increased investments in social and digital marketing campaigns. Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $4.1 billion in 2017, up from $3.9 billion in 2015.HurdlesConsumers’ tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are a concern for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. .Though PepsiCo has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost the carbonated beverage business, no significant improvement has yet been witnessed. The company’s CSD volumes fell 5% in 2017.Pepsico, Inc. Price  Pepsico, Inc. Price | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteZacks RankPepsi carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

840,PEP,"Leading pharmaceutical and healthcare company GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has started a strategic review of Horlicks — a famous malted milk hot drink in India — along with other smaller nutrition products like Boost. The company is also planning to offload its 72.5% stake in India-listed GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Although it is still unclear which company GlaxoSmithKline would prefer selling Horlicks to, market speculations point at Nestle, Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) and Unilever.Other potential bidders include Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report), Indian company ITC Ltd., PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and JAB holdings.Why is Horlicks Up for Sale?Glaxo recently inked a deal with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) to take over the latter’s 36.5% stake in its Consumer Healthcare joint venture for $13 billion (£9.2 billion). In order to fund the deal, Glaxo is looking to vend Horlicks and other nutrition products. Moreover, Glaxo wants to shift focus toward over-the-counter and oral health categories.But why sell GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare? The Indian arm of the pharmaceutical giant has been grappling with sluggish sales for quite some time now. Revenues decreased 3.1% in 2017 and 0.5% in the first nine months of 2017. This clearly indicates that Horlicks, which accounts for about 90% GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare sales, has also not been performing well.Moreover, malt-based drinks are losing sheen in India of late. Major players in the health food drinks category have been facing the brunt of increased popularity of breakfast cereals and intense competition. Nevertheless, focusing on providing actual nutritional benefits and not just on enhancing taste can change the scenario. According to a study by Research and Markets, India's malted drink market is expected to see a CAGR of 17.4% during 2017–2021.Who All Will Show Interest?It goes without saying that adding Horlicks will drive market share for the buyer as it currently dominates the malt-based drink market in India. According to GlaxoSmithKline, its nutrition products portfolio, including Horlicks, had raked in total sales of $550 million in 2017.According to market sources, the stake is worth $3.1 billion as per current market prices but Glaxo wanted a premium in any sale. They also estimate valuation of the consumer health nutrition business at around $4 billion.Apart from the companies mentioned earlier, other potential bidders include Mondelez International, India’s ITC Ltd., PepsiCo, Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola and JAB holdings.Nestle had previously expressed interest in Horlicks. The company already has a minor presence in the health nutrition space in India with Milo.  Beverage giants PepsiCo and Coca-Cola could also consider buying Horlicks as recently they have been keen on diversifying product offerings given the slump in carbonated beverage drink sales.Mondelez, which operates thorough Cadbury Ltd., has a commanding presence in India. The company generates about 40% revenues from emerging markets, which include India and is keen on expanding in developing countries to gain scale in its categories or distribution capabilities.Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz acquired malt-based health food drink brand Complan from Glaxo in 1994. The company is currently facing a decline in sales primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. Thus, expanding business in emerging markets can prove beneficial.European investment firm, JAB Holdings, backed by Austria’s billionaire Reimann family is also a key contender. The company has been actively taking over companies in the consumer and food sectors over the past few years.Associated British Foods might also show interest in order to expand in India although the size of Glaxo’s business could be a drag, according to a market source.GlaxoSmithKline expects the outcome of the strategic review to be out by the end of 2018. So for now, it’s a wait-and-see story.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

841,PEP,"Monster Beverage Corporation’s (MNST  -  Free Report) shares have lost 18.6% in the past year, faring miserably against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s rally of 10.5%. Also, the company has underperformed the industry in the 4-week and 12-week time frames, which indicates the current Momentum Score of F.Moreover, Monster Beverage’s earnings estimates revisions are pretty discouraging. Estimates for 2018 and 2019 have declined 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, over the last 30 days, which reflect analysts’ bearish outlook over the stock.Let’s delve into the factors that are taking this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company downhill.Gross Margin Woes LingerHigher raw material costs (mainly aluminum and sweeteners) and unfavorable product have been primarily hurting margins. Gross margin declined 20 basis points (bps) in 2017. Meanwhile, Monster Beverage’s ramped up marketing spend, to boost the top line and attract customers, is likely to exert pressure on margins.Increase in promotional allowances, $9.9-million commissions as a reduction of net sales due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, lower margin foreign operations, change in domestic product sales mix, rise in certain import costs principally freight-in aluminum cans as well as sucralose and Hydro production issues in the United States and EMEA region hurt gross margins by 420 bps in the first quarter.The company apprehends gross margin headwinds to persist at least through the first half of 2018. Along with this, higher distribution costs from increased freight expenses are expected to put pressure on 2018 operating margin.Softness in Beverage IndustryHealth-conscious consumers are opting for better beverage alternatives like ready-to-drink tea and bottled water. This shift in consumer preferences is impacting the volumes of soda beverages and energy drinks. U.S. sales have struggled for months as Monster Beverage faces tough competition from other energy drink companies and shifting consumer preferences. This change in consumer preference is also impacting sales of food and beverage giants like PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc .Overvalued to PeersMonster Beverage has a Value Style Score of F, signifying that there is no upside potential left for the stock at the moment.The company currently has a trailing 12-months Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.7, while the industry’s average is at 20.6. Looking at sales, the company currently trades at a Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.5, significantly higher than the industry average of 4.6. Some prefer this metric more than other value-focused ones because sales are harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.These ratios show that the company is overvalued compared with its industry peers and investors should steer clear from this stock now.Industry Outlook NegativeThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry has underperformed the broader market in the past year. Currently, the industry ranks among the bottom 5% (242 out of 255 industries). Along with the weak past performance of the industry, a sluggish rank signals that companies in this space are likely to get affected due to unfavorable broader factors in the immediate future.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

842,PEP,"In a bid to enhance shareholders' value, Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) announced a new $500-million share buyback plan. Also, the new program does not have any expiry date and is expected to be made in the open market or via privately negotiated transactions. Following the news, the company’s shares moved up 5.4% on Wednesday’s trading session.Share repurchase is an important tool, which enables a company to boost the value of shares. Since the repurchase reduces the number of shares outstanding, it thereby increases earnings per share and boosts the market value of the remaining shares.Monster Beverage has been very active on the share repurchase front. In February 2017, the company’s board authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $500 million of the company’s outstanding common stock.During the three months ended Mar 31, 2018, Monster Beverage purchased 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share, for a total amount of $249.9 million (excluding broker commissions), which exhausted the availability under the February 2017 Repurchase Plan.Again in February 2018, the company’s board authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $250.0 million of the company’s outstanding common stock. Notably, there is no availability remaining under this program.Will Share Repurchase Revive the Stock?This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have declined 17.9% so far this year, which indicates investors’ low confidence in the company. Earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 also fell 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ concern.Of late, Monster Beverage has been grappling with multiple headwinds. Health-conscious consumers are opting for healthier alternatives. This shift in consumer preference is impacting sales of companies like Monster Beverage and other food as well as beverage giants like PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc .Again, a decline in gross margin raises concern. Higher raw material costs (mainly aluminum and sweeteners) and unfavorable product mix hurt margin. First-quarter 2018 gross margin contracted 420 basis points (bps) to 60.6% due to higher promotional allowances, geographical and domestic product sales mix. Operating expenses increased 8.6% from the prior-year quarter to $235.3 million.The new share repurchase is expected to boost Monster Beverage’s earnings and raise shareholders’ value.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

843,PEP,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has plans to boost its investment in Argentina. The beverage giant intends to invest $1.2 billion in the country within the time period of 2019-2021, as stated by the company in a statement on May 29. Earlier, Coca-Cola had plans to invest $1 billion in the 2016-2018 time frame.Coca-Cola was one of the companies to initiate a major investment in Argentina after Macri took charge in late 2015, promising business-friendly reforms.Notably, the company’s performance in Latin America clearly improved in the last reported quarter, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, where modest volume growth was witnessed. In fact, improvement in the key markets like India, Argentina and Brazil was noticed in the second half of 2017 and in first-quarter 2018.The Latin America segment registered revenues of $998 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 8% from the prior-year quarter. Price/mix growth was 6% in the quarter, primarily driven by strong price/mix in Mexico and the South Latin business unit. Organic revenues grew 6%.Unit case volume increased 1%, as low to mid-single-digit growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico was offset by a decline in both Peru and Chile.Coca-Cola has a commanding presence in the developing and emerging markets of Latin America, India, Russia and China, courtesy of the growth opportunities that these countries provide. More than half of the company’s revenues are generated outside the United States.First-Quarter 2018 At a GlanceCoca-Cola started 2018 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts in the first quarter. In addition to a notable increase in soda volumes, it also gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Organic sales grew 5%, led by price/mix improvement of 1% and concentrate sales growth of 4%. Currency also had a 2% positive impact on revenues. Again, lower SG&A expenses (down 24.2%), along with higher gross margin (up 270 basis points or bps) and operating margin (up 600 bps) helped it come up with better earnings (up 8%).However, total sales decreased 16% year over year, marking the 12th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues. Although the top line is yet to show sustained improvement, we are encouraged by its strategic efforts to transform its portfolio into a total beverage company, with improved marketing and innovation, focus on driving revenues by improved price/mix, digital focus, and productivity initiatives toward driving margins.Share Price PerformanceCoca-Cola’s shares have lost 7% year to date, comparing favorably with the industry’s 11.3% decline. Earnings estimates for 2018 have moved 0.5% north in the past 60 days, while the same remained stable for 2019. This reflects analysts’ optimism on the stock’s earnings potential.Making the most of the growth opportunities in the emerging countries, along with improved marketing and innovation will drive its revenues.Changing demographics and purchasing behavior make it essential for Coca-Cola, and other food as well as beverage giants like PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  to understand and capitalize on the primary consumer insights that identify growing trends.The company currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

844,PEP,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has been aggressively diversifying its business to shift from traditional added-sugar fizzy drinks. It is well known that cola giants like Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) are seeing declining volumes in established markets such as the United States amid growing health consciousness. This is denting demand for carbonated soft drinks (CSDs), hurting other soft drink makers like Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group  as well.Among CSDs, the cola segment has been facing the brunt of consumer shift toward alternative beverage offerings. The diet drinks are also under pressure, thanks to increasing consumer awareness regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Though Coca-Cola has bumped up marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts have not brought about any meaningful improvement yet. Sparkling beverage unit case volume was down 1% in 2017, which compares with flat volume in 2016. Sparkling beverage accounted for 69% of the company’s 2017 worldwide unit case volumes.Resultantly, the company’s total sales fell 20% in the last reported quarter, marking the 11th consecutive quarterly decline. Coca-Cola’s shares have also lost 4.3% in the past six months, comparing unfavorably with its industry’s decline of 2.3%. Efforts to Focus Solely on BeverageThe company has been firing on all cylinders to rejuvenate its portfolio. It has ramped up its effort to transform into a total beverage company with a broad, consumer-centric brand portfolio and an asset-light business model.Coca-Cola is pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.  In 2017, the beverage giant made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the acquisition of Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States. Also, it entered the fast-growing U.S. ready-to-drink coffee category last year and closed the proposed acquisition of AdeS soy-based beverage business.Importantly, the beverage giant has launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in 20 markets, with a reformulated product, evolved marketing, new packaging and upgraded execution. This product has been contributing to revenues in the United States since its launch in the third quarter of 2017.Recently, Coca-Cola ventured into the liquor space with the plan to introduce an alcoholic drink in Japan. The company launched its first-ever alcoholic drink — Chu-Hi — made with a distilled Japanese beverage (shocho), sparkling water and flavoring.Massive Refranchising for Higher ReturnsCoca-Cola is in transition, moving away from being a capital-intensive organization. In 2017, the company achieved major milestones by fully refranchising bottling system in the United States. Its refranchising plans will help it focus on building its core brands and reduce its exposure to the low-margin, capital-intensive bottling operations.Though this effort has been impacting sales/profits adversely, it will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Cost Saving to Boost Bottom LineThe company has initiated a productivity and reinvestment program to boost profits. These initiatives include restructuring the global supply chain including optimization of the manufacturing footprint in North America, investing in technology to streamline operations, implementing a zero-based budgeting program, headcount reduction and driving increased efficiency in direct marketing investments. Currently, the company plans to save $3.8 billion by 2019.These initiatives are helping the company to come up with better numbers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, despite reporting flat soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and re-structuring efforts. Organic revenues grew 6% on growth across the board, driven by price/mix growth of 4% and concentrate sales growth of 1%. Again, lower SG&A expenses (down 21%), higher gross margin (up 480 basis points or bps) and higher operating margin (up 540 bps) helped it come up with better numbers.Constant endeavors to foray into the other alternative beverage space, restructuring and productivity efforts are expected to lift revenues as well as profits for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 have moved up 3.5% and 4.1%, respectively, over the last 30 days, indicating analysts’ optimism on the stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

845,PEP,"President Donald Trump’s biggest tax overhaul in decades has raised the appeal of buyback ETFs. This is especially true as a massive $1.4-trillion tax cut and the repatriation policy have prompted companies from almost every sector to boost their multi-billion dollar share buyback program this year.Notably, approximately $2.6 trillion in American corporate profits are sitting in overseas bank accounts, about half of that being in cash. The new tax law encourages these companies to bring this cash back home at much reduced rates (read: How Will Tax Reform Affect Buyback and Dividend ETFs?).U.S. companies have announced $209 billion worth of share buyback since the beginning of this year, according to the latest report from Senate Democrats. A California-based research firm TrimTabs stated that the pace of buybacks had exploded in February to a record $153.7 billion from $59.9 billion in January. Among the largest share repurchases so far, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) has been on the forefront, with its additional $25 billion buyback plan. This was followed by $22.6 billion for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), $15 billion for Pepsico (PEP  -  Free Report), $10 billion for Abbvie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and $10 billion for Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).Given this optimism, 2018 is expected to be the second-busiest year for buybacks since the bull market began in 2009 as U.S. companies are on track to return a record $1 trillion to their shareholders. An analyst at J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) expects companies on the S&P 500 index to buy back as much as $800 billion in shares of their own stock this year, representing a whopping jump of 51% (i.e. $300 billion) from $530 billion repurchased last year.About $100 billion of additional buybacks is the result of the tax savings and stronger earnings while $200 billion will be generated from the repatriation bonanza. Another analyst at Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) projects that buybacks will rise 23% this year to $650 billion (read: Top-Ranked Sector ETFs & Stocks From Top Industries).As a result, investors should take advantage of the ongoing boom in share buybacks through the following three ETFs:SPDR S&P 500 Buyback ETF (SPYB  -  Free Report)This fund focuses on the 101 top companies in the S&P 500 with the highest buyback ratio in the last 12 months. It follows the S&P 500 Buyback Index, charging investors 35 bps in annual fees. From a sector look, financials and consumer discretionary take the largest share with 28.8% and 23.9% allocation, respectively, while information technology and healthcare round off the next spots. The product has a lower AUM of $15.7 million and trades in a paltry volume of around 3,000 shares a day on average (read: Buyback ETF Hits New 52-Week High). PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio (PKW  -  Free Report)    This ETF tracks the NASDAQ US Buyback Achievers Index, which comprises companies that have repurchased 5% or more of their common stock in the trailing 12 months. It holds 131 stocks in its basket and charges a higher annual fee of 63 bps. Here also, financials and consumer discretionary are the top two sectors, with at least 29% share each, closely followed by consumer staples (15.3%). PKW is the popular fund in the buyback space, managing an asset base of nearly $1.4 billion and trading in an average daily volume of 67,000 shares.AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF (TTFS  -  Free Report)This is an actively managed fund that seeks to generate long-term capital appreciation by investing in stocks with liquidity and fundamental characteristics that are historically associated with superior long-term performance. This approach results in a basket of 101 securities with financials and consumer discretionary as the top two sectors accounting for 19% of assets each. This was followed by industrials (18%), information technology (13%) and healthcare (13%). The product has amassed $113.7 million in its asset base while sees low volume of nearly 6,000 shares a day. The fund charges 90 bps in annual fees.iShares U.S. Dividend and Buyback ETF (DIVB  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to a broad basket of 379 U.S. companies that return capital to shareholders by paying dividends or buying back their stock. Information technology, financials, consumer discretionary, health care and industrials are the top five sectors with double-digit exposure each. The ETF has newly debuted in the space and accumulated $6.5 million within three months. It trades in a paltry volume of under 7,000 shares a day on average and charges 25 bps in annual fees (read: What Makes iShares' Dividend and Buyback ETF Launch Timely?).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

846,PEP,"The NBA Finals begin Thursday night, with two of the league’s biggest stars, LeBron James and Steph Curry, set to face off for the NBA title. But while many will look at how the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors played up to this point, it’s also a great time to check out how some of the NBA’s biggest sponsors performed during the season.Sports Apparel The common thought among many investors is that Curry’s star power hasn’t helped Under Armour UAA stock much over the last year, as it tries to adjust to life as a much bigger company. Curry’s direct impact is debatable, but the company’s stock price has performed rather well since the start of the 2017-18 NBA season in mid-October.Let’s take a look at how it has stacked up against the NBA’s official jersey sponsor and basketball shoe juggernaut, Nike NKE, as well as Adidas ADDYY. Investors will see that despite some of the recent love thrown Adidas’ way, both Nike and Under Armour stock have greatly outperformed the German sports apparel powerhouse since the start of the NBA season. Clearly, there are many other factors impacting these stocks aside from the exposure that the NBA provides, but it is a fun exercise nonetheless.Jersey Sponsors  Nike, which became the official jersey sponsor of the NBA this season, greatly outpaced its two closest rivals. With that said, this season also marked the first time the NBA allowed jersey sponsorship patches. In total, 21 out of the 30 teams played with a patch during the first season, with companies paying an average of $6.5 million per year to place their logo on a team’s jersey—worn by both the players and fans.The inaugural jersey patch season saw some major publicly traded companies join in on the NBA’s growing business. This list includes General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), Western Union WU, Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Lending Tree (TREE  -  Free Report), Sun Life (SLF  -  Free Report), Ultimate Software (ULTI  -  Free Report), and Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report).Clearly, some of the bigger names on the list have all gone through a massively disappointing stretch during their first year as official team jersey sponsors. It’s also worth noting that three out of the four conference finals teams that had a sponsor this year—the Warriors and Japanese electronics firm Rakuten RKUNY; the Cavaliers and Goodyear; and the Boston Celtics and GE—all saw their stocks prices fall over 25% since the start of the season.But don’t be surprised if underperforming companies continue their sponsorships as these investments offer a ton of exposure for a relatively small amount of marketing dollars. This becomes even more likely when looking at the NBA’s television ratings, which saw an 8% surge across the league’s four TV-network partners, Disney’s ABC and ESPN, Turner’s  TNT, and NBA TV.TV Partners Investors might remember that the NBA is currently benefiting hugely from its nine-year, $24 billion rights deal with ESPN and Turner that runs through the '24-25 season. This is significant money even for these entertainment giants, which means it’s worth taking a look at how ESPN parent Disney and Turner owner Time Warner have performed throughout this season.Biggest Corporate Sponsors Lastly, it is worth taking a look at some of the NBA’s overall corporate partners, which not only advertise heavily but also sponsor the league. Three of the league’s biggest corporate partners are American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report), Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) via Frito-Lay, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade.Obviously, all of the companies touched on throughout this article have much larger priorities beyond their affiliation with the NBA. Therefore, none of this stock price movement is a direct reflection on the NBA’s growing business, which saw its overall sponsor revenue surge 31% to $1.12 billion—placing it not too far behind the NFL.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

847,PEP,"In line with its strategy to shift toward healthier options, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) will acquire Bare Foods, a U.S.-based maker of baked fruit and vegetable snacks.  No terms of the deal were disclosed.Buyout BenefitsThe addition of Bare Foods’ fruit and vegetable chips will expand Frito-Lay’s better-for-you snack offerings. Also, Bare Foods’ baked crunchy fruit and vegetable assortments resonate well with current consumer preference. Bare Foods products are Non-GMO Project verified and come with clean labels.Performance with PurposeThe decision to add this organic food maker is well in line with PepsiCo’s Performance with Purpose initiative, which aims to increase healthier food options in PepsiCo’s portfolio.""For nearly a dozen years, PepsiCo has been committed to Performance with Purpose, our vision of making more nutritious products, while also reducing added sugars, salt and saturated fat. Bare Snacks fits perfectly within that vision,"" states Indra Nooyi, chairman and chief executive officer of PepsiCo.Notably, PepsiCo’s recent efforts toward innovation in snacks focus on higher-margin healthy and premium offerings, since there is a definitive market for such products now. Nutritional products have increased the percentage of the company’s total portfolio from 38% in 2006 to 50% in 2017. This percentage is likely to increase considering the company’s rapid innovation and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences.Moreover, PepsiCo has augmented its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to reduce dependence on colas. As of Mar 24, 2018, PepsiCo increased the volume mix of non-carbonated beverages by 7 percentage points since 2010. The company has been growing its value share in a number of its fastest-growing categories including tea, enhanced water and sparkling water. Meanwhile, tea portfolio under Lipton and Pure Leaf has driven retail sales in the range of mid-single digits to as high as 21% over the past 17 quarters.Changing demographics and purchasing behaviors make it essential for PepsiCo and other food as well as beverage giants like Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  to understand and capitalize on main consumer insights that identify growing trends. Health awareness has been a prime concern for consumers in recent times. Capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any food and beverage company.Price PerformancePepsiCo’s shares have lost around 16% year to date, compared with the Zacks Soft Beverages industry's decline of 11.2%. Also, earnings estimates have moved downward by 1 cent for 2018 and 2 cents for 2019 in the last 30 days.Nevertheless, we believe that the company’s new product lineup consisting of healthier options, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives should boost profits and the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters. Zacks RankPepsiCo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

848,PEP,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PEP due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsPepsiCo reported first-quarter 2018 (ending Mar 24) results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise for the company. The improvement was mainly attributable to strong performances in its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in the developing and emerging markets.EarningsPepsiCo’s first-quarter core earnings per share (EPS) of 96 cents beat the consensus mark of 92 cents by 4.3% and increased 3% year over year. In constant currency terms, adjusted earnings remained unchanged from the year-ago period.Core earnings exclude restructuring and impairment charges, and commodity mark-to-market net impact. The company reported earnings of 94 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 3% year over year. Foreign exchange translation had a positive impact of 2% on the reported EPS.SalesNet revenues of $12.56 billion increased 4.3% from the year-ago level. Foreign exchange (Fx) had a 2% negative impact on revenue growth and pricing had a positive impact of 2%. Reported revenues also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.41 billion.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 2.3% on an organic basis, primarily driven by higher demand for food/snacks in the Latin America, Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA) and Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) segments. Notably, overall organic sales growth was the same as recorded in the fourth quarter.Total volume grew 1% in the quarter, whereas volumes remained unchanged in the previous quarter. While organic snacks/food volumes increased 3% (better than 2% growth witnessed in the fourth quarter), beverage volumes dropped 1% (versus down 2%).Quarterly Segment DetailsRevenues decreased 1% at the North America Beverages (NAB) segment. That said, the company’s revenues improved 15% in ESSA, 14% in Latin America, 7% in AMENA and 3% in FLNA segments. Meanwhile, revenues at QFNA remained unchanged in the quarter from the year-ago level.Notably, the company’s NAB segment was negatively impacted by higher input costs and operating cost inflation that substantially offset productivity gains. The results were also affected by a bonus, extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act. Meanwhile, each headwind decreased the operating profit performance by 8%.Operating profits (on a reported basis) decreased 23% in NAB and 5% in QFNA segments. However, the same grew 42% in Latin America, 23% in ESSA and 10% in AMENA segments. Meanwhile, operating profit remained unchanged at FLNA division.Segment DetailsFrito-Lay North America (FLNA): Revenues improved 3% year over year (up 6% organically) to $3.62 billion, driven by improved pricing and volume growth.Volumes in trademark Doritos increased mid-single digits, Sabra joint venture products in double digit and mid-single digit in variety packs. These were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in trademark Lay’s.Core constant currency operating profit remained unchanged from the year-ago level. Operating profit was impacted by operating cost increases, as well as a bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act. Additionally, higher commodity costs, primarily of potatoes and cooking oil, negatively impacted the results.Quaker Foods North America (QFNA): Revenues improved marginally (unchanged organically) to $601 million from $598 million a year ago. The result reflects favorable foreign exchange as well as volume growth that were partly offset by unfavorable pricing. The volume growth was driven by mid-single-digit growth in oatmeal, partially offset by a double-digit decline in trademark Gamesa.Core constant currency operating profit decreased 5% due to higher operating cost, and unfavorable pricing and mix. These were partly offset by planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories, and lower advertising and marketing expenses.North America Beverages (NAB): Net revenues in this segment declined 1% year over year (down 2% organically) to $4.42 billion. The downside was mainly due to a decline in volume, partially offset by effective pricing. Acquisitions had a marginal positive contribution to the net revenues.Volumes were down 2.5% due to a 4% decline in CSD volume and 1% decline in non-carbonated beverage volume. The non-carbonated beverage volume decreased mainly due to low-single-digit declines in Gatorade sports drinks, and juice and juice drinks portfolio, partially offset by a low-single-digit increase in the overall water portfolio. Acquisitions had a nominal positive contribution to the volume performance.Core operating profit declined 22% in constant currency. Segment operating profit was affected by operating cost inflation as well as higher raw material costs, and a bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act.Latin America: Revenues increased 14% to $1.22 billion. Organically, revenues grew 9%. The upside was mainly due to higher pricing and volume growth. Favorable currency translation also had a positive impact on revenues.Snacks volume increased 3% that includes mid-single-digit growth in Brazil and low-single-digit growth in Mexico. Beverage volume declined 4%, reflecting a double-digit decline in Brazil, and mid-single-digit declines in Mexico and Chile. These were partly offset by low-single-digit growth in Argentina and Guatemala.Core operating profit improved 17% year over year in constant currency, courtesy of productivity gains, lower restructuring charges and favorable foreign exchange, as well as insurance settlement recoveries related to the earthquake in Mexico in 2017Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA): Net revenues grew 15% to $1.67 billion. Organically, revenues grew 6%. This is owing to favorable foreign exchange as well as volume growth. Snacks volume grew 6%, while Beverage volume increased 6% in the quarter.Core operating profit grew 9% year over year in constant currency, as productivity gains were partially offset by higher commodity, operating and marketing costs.Asia, Middle East & North Africa (AMENA): Net revenues improved 7% to $1.04 billion due to higher volumes. Organically, revenues grew 6% on improved volumes, partially offset by the impact of refranchising beverage business in Jordan, and sales and certain other taxes.Snacks volume grew 7% while beverage volume improved marginally.Core operating profit jumped 10% year over year, reflecting higher revenues and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories.MarginsCore gross margin and operating margin contracted 75 basis points (bps) and 110 bps, respectively.FinancialsCash and cash equivalents were $13.4 billion as of Mar 24, 2018, up from $10.6 billion as of Dec 30, 2017. Long-term debt was $31.9 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $33.8 billion as of Dec 30, 2017.Net cash used for operating activities was $1.3 billion in the quarter compared with $193 million in the year-ago period.2018 Guidance ReaffirmedPepsiCo expects full-year organic revenue growth (excluding headwinds from currency and structural changes) to be approximately in line with the 2017 growth rate of 2.3%. Currency is projected to have a neutral effect on the top and bottom lines of the company.PepsiCo expects core EPS of $5.70, showing an expected growth rate of 9%. Also, management plans to return $7 billion to its shareholders, through dividends ($5 billion) and share repurchases ($2 billion). Free cash flow is estimated at around $6 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been seven revisions lower for the current quarter.Pepsico, Inc. Price and Consensus  Pepsico, Inc. Price and Consensus | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, PEP has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. The stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate investors will probably be better served looking elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, PEP has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

850,PEP,"Market indexes are blossoming over the past week or so, even as global uncertainties begin to pile up regarding trade tensions with China and other important commerce partners, leadership issues in the U.K. ahead of tomorrow’s NATO meeting in Brussels, and elsewhere. But there is a bright, shining beacon markets appear to be attracted to currently: Q2 earnings season.Q2 may be among the strongest we’ve seen in our entire multi-year economic recovery (though Q1’s +24.6% year over year earnings growth will be tough to surmount), with a possible 4-handle on GDP for the quarter expected by a plurality of analysts later this month. Results from companies on the S&P 500 have already begun to start off this earnings season with a bang — companies like Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) outperformed estimates in past weeks — and expectations are big coming into the heart of Q2 reporting.We see at the end of this week some of the biggest banks in the country reporting, including JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). And, while year over year growth is expected to be substantial for these and companies like them, the Finance sector overall is underperforming the overall market. This has more to do with interest rate level questions and concerns about the yield spread between the 2-year and 10-year bond than the machinations of the companies themselves.For a comprehensive view of banks’ performance and what to look for in Q2, check out Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview: What’s Keeping Bank Stocks Down?Ahead of today’s opening bell, Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) put out a mixed earnings report, beating on the bottom line by a dime to $1.61 per share — up 7% in constant currency terms year over year. Revenues came in a smidge beneath expectations at $16.1 billion for the quarter, but shares are currently up about 2 1/2% in today’s pre-market.

Results from companies on the S&P 500 have already begun to start off this earnings season with a bang — companies like Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) outperformed estimates in past weeks — and expectations are big coming into the heart of Q2 reporting.We see at the end of this week some of the biggest banks in the country reporting, including JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). And, while year over year growth is expected to be substantial for these and companies like them, the Finance sector overall is underperforming the overall market. This has more to do with interest rate level questions and concerns about the yield spread between the 2-year and 10-year bond than the machinations of the companies themselves.For a comprehensive view of banks’ performance and what to look for in Q2, check out Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview: What’s Keeping Bank Stocks Down?Ahead of today’s opening bell, Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) put out a mixed earnings report, beating on the bottom line by a dime to $1.61 per share — up 7% in constant currency terms year over year. Revenues came in a smidge beneath expectations at $16.1 billion for the quarter, but shares are currently up about 2 1/2% in today’s pre-market.

This company, over the past two quarters has averaged a positive earnings surprise over 450%. Tomorrow, we look for results on Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Fastenal (FAST  -  Free Report) and AngioDynamics (ANGO  -  Free Report).Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

854,PEP,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 28, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings met analysts’ expectation. The company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.33%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to drive Monster Beverage’s fourth-quarter 2017 results.Factors at PlayProduct innovation plays a major role in driving revenues. The company’s net sales grew 11.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2017. The upside can be attributed to a wide portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in domestic and international markets. The trend is expected to continue in the upcoming quarter.Sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment improved 11.6% in the first nine months of 2017. The segment accounts for 90% of total sales. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are particularly cautious about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content products. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks will drive the company’s top line.Notably, the company's strategic deal with notable brands bolstered its portfolio and strengthened presence in the international energy drinks market. The Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), improved more than 10% in the first nine months 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage’s sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected net sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment by approximately $13.4 million in the first nine months of 2017.Distributor termination expenses are likely to dampen the company’s profits to some extent. It has been transitioning from third-party distributors to Coca-Cola’s distribution network following a strategic deal.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $841.5 million, reflecting an increase of 11.6% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for earnings is 37 cents, implying 5.7% year-over-year growth.Quantitative Model PredictionMonster Beverage has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Monster Beverage has an Earnings ESP of +3.40%.

855,PEP,"The performance of buyback ETFs has been moderate in the last one year as PowerShares Buyback Achievers ETF (PKW  -  Free Report) has gained about 13.5% in the last one year (as of Feb 23, 2018) versus the 15.9% rise in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report). S&P 500 buybacks fell down 5.3% for the 12-month period ending September 2017.Will Tax Reform Boost Buyback?President Trump’s administration passed a tax plan in December that mainly revolved around cutting corporate taxes and adjusting personal tax rates. The final tax version cuts the corporate rate from 35% to 21% (read: Tax Bill: What ETF Investors Need to Know).The Trump administration also proposed a move from the current worldwide tax system to a territorial system, allowing companies to send their offshore profits back to the United States without extra taxes. Investors are expecting tax savings to result in fatter and faster dividend hikes and more stock buybacks (read: What Makes iShares' Dividend and Buyback ETF Launch Timely?).Are Hopes Too High? As per an article published on Financial Times, 400 earnings calls revealed that 28% of companies intend to return cash to shareholders, while 44% plan to enhance capex and wages.  A great deal of tax savings can also be used as debt repayments. Instead of higher payouts, if debt retirement becomes corporations’ priority, especially in a rising rate environment, companies can produce a healthy leverage ratio.Still, “Morgan Stanley analysts expect a greater overall amount of cash from tax savings to be dedicated to dividends and buybacks than capex,” as quoted on Financial Times. Morgan Stanley’s analysts are forecasting that 43% of the total tax savings will go to dividends and buybacks, 30% will be shelled out on capex and employee compensation and just 8% will go to “balance sheet repair.”In any case, increase in returns to shareholders has already been an established trend. Tech behemoths “have been raising buybacks and dividends by issuing bonds against savings held offshore.”But then, if the global economy gains momentum, and central banks tighten policies faster, interest rates are expected to rise faster. So, accessing the debt market to finance buybacks would not be an easy task going forward.Plus, investors should also note that the S&P 500 is hovering around multi-year highs and a loose fiscal policy (if at all it materializes) may spur stock rally even further. Amid such inflated prices, buying back their own shares may not be a great idea for the corporations.ETFs in FocusWhatever the case, investors can keep a tab on the following buyback ETFs.PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio (PKW  -  Free Report) looks to track companies that have implemented a net reduction of 5% or more in shares outstanding in the last 12 months (see Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here). Another buyback ETF SPDR S&P 500 Buyback ETF (SPYB  -  Free Report) measures the performance of the top 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratios in the S&P 500 in the last 12 months.Yet another fund iShares U.S. Dividend and Buyback ETF (DIVB  -  Free Report) invests in U.S. companies that return capital to their shareholders through dividends or stock buyback.AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF (TTFS  -  Free Report) looks to generate long-term capital appreciation.Bottom Line  Call transcripts of tech biggies did not evoke any enthusiastic on dividends and buybacks. But not every company has been stingy, as per Financial Times. The article revealed that Pepsi (PEP  -  Free Report) plans to hike its dividend by 15%, make a one-time pension payment and speed up capital spending while Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) raised its plans for share repurchases to $6-$8 billion from $4-$7 billion.Overall, the outlook for buyback and dividend activity is neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic. It remains to be seen what decides the path of buyback ETFs — whether Trump’s tax plan benefits the activity or if the Trump rally and an all-time high corporate leverage come in the way of shareholder’s value maximization.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

856,PEP,"PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) just came out with quarterly earnings of $1.61 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.50 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.62%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this food and beverage company would post earnings of $0.92 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.96, delivering a surprise of 4.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.PepsiCo, which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, posted revenues of $16.09 billion for the quarter ended June 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.21%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $15.71 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.It remains to be seen how the recently released numbers will impact the stock price, and the immediate price movement will reflect how these results and management's commentary on the earnings call help shape expectations for the coming quarter(s).PepsiCo shares have lost about 10.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 4.1%.What's Next for PepsiCo?While PepsiCo has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PepsiCo was unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.63 on $16.55 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.64 on $65.09 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Beverages - Soft drinks is currently in the bottom 3% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

857,PEP,"Monster Beverage Corporation’s (MNST  -  Free Report) strong product portfolio, deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and innovation raise hopes. However, higher costs pertaining to product innovation are hurting margins.Recently, this marketer and distributor of energy drinks and alternative beverages announced third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.The company reported adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net sales of $909.5 million beat the consensus mark of $901.1 million by 0.9%.Meanwhile, shares of Monster Beverage have gained 42.9% year to date, outpacing the industry’s gain of 14.8%. Estimates for the current quarter and year have also inched up 2.8% and 0.7%, respectively, over the past two months, reflecting analysts’ optimism over the stock’s prospects. Key Growth DriversMonster Beverage has a wide range of brands such as Monster Energy, Java Monster, X- Presso Monster, Worx Energy and Vidration. Further, the addition of Coca-Cola’s energy drink brands has strengthened Monster Beverage’s position.The Coca-Cola deal, also denoted as TCCC deal, provides Monster Beverage full access to Coca-Cola’s world-class global distribution network. Under the agreement, Coca-Cola and its bottling partners act as Monster Beverage’s preferred distribution partner globally, thereby ensuring greater exposure for the company’s products. TCCC subsidiaries accounted for approximately 21% of the company’s net sales in the first nine months of 2017. Notably, Monster Beverage’s cash position received a major boost from the deal, which has encouraged it to consider a return of capital to its shareholders through share repurchases. Moreover, the brands acquired from TCCC, which produce concentrates or beverage bases, are high-margin products that make significant contribution to sales and gross margins.In addition to the deal, product innovation acts as a major growth driver. The company regularly introduces new flavors to existing products.Moreover, due to growing health awareness, consumers are now particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content and are moving toward alternatives such as energy drinks. This has been denting sales for most beverage companies like PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. . Monster Beverage in addition to carbonated soft drinks has a portfolio based on energy drinks, which should drive the company’s top line in the near term. In fact, net sales at the segment, comprising Monster Energy drinks as well as Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 11.4% in the first nine months of 2017.ConcernsDespite the company introducing the new Mutant along with increased distribution, total Mutant sales have not been promising so far. Again, delays in Hydro, production capacity shortages related to Java Monster and Muscle Monster raise concerns. Moreover, although the company is trying to recover from operational limitations, Java Monster production issues have negatively impacted sales so far in 2017.Meanwhile, Monster Beverage’s increased marketing spend to boost top-line growth and attract customers is likely to build pressure on margins. Operating expenses increased 15.1% year over year in the first nine months of 2017. Monster Beverage’s operating margin fell 10 basis points (bps) in the same time frame owing to higher general and administrative as well as marketing expenses on international expansion.Nevertheless, various innovative sales-boosting efforts are expected to drive the top line for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

858,PEP,"Despite huge volatility, bitcoin is the hottest trade this year. After wild swings last week, the digital currency hit another record high of above $11,800, representing more than 30% surge from a low of $9,021.85 hit on Nov 30.The cryptocurrency topped the five-figure mark of 10,000 on Nov 28 and climbed another $1,000 in 24 hours. Then it dropped more than $1,000 in just a few hours.Bitcoin Futures Coming UpThe latest surge came as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the listing of bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report). CME will begin initial listings of bitcoin futures contracts on Dec 18, while CBOE will be the first to begin bitcoin futures trading on Dec 10.The introduction of bitcoin derivatives will bring a great deal of liquidity and legitimacy to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It would give investors a way to buy and trade in the digital currency market, which is otherwise not readily available. The derivatives would upgrade the bitcoin status to a more-established asset class. A better and mature regulatory environment will be a huge boon to the digital currency, leading to increased investment in the booming cryptocurrency, with a growing number of retail investors.Further, Nasdaq plans to launch bitcoin futures as early as in the second quarter of 2018. In the race to bitcoin trading, the Tokyo Financial Exchange is also preparing to launch its own bitcoin derivatives futures product. All these will pave the way for further rally.Venezuela Cryptocurrency On the wayThe digital currency also got a boost from Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro’s announcement of starting the country’s own cryptocurrency called the “petro” to shore up its economy. The currency was backed by commodity reserves, including oil, gold, gas and diamonds.Bullish ViewsMany market watchers are optimistic about the future of the digital currency. Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz predicts bitcoin to hit $40,000 at the end of 2018. According to him, investors are pouring into cryptocurrencies due to lack of trust in financial institutions following the 2008 crash. Standpoint Research’s Ronnie Moas projects the cryptocurrency to hit $14,000 in 2018.A combination of other factors such as soaring demand and rising institutional investor interest are pushing up the cryptocurrency.Bitcoin Turning Bigger and BetterWith the latest surge, the digital currency is just a few percentages away from $12,000 and has become the world’s sixth most valuable circulating currency in the world, within eight years of its launch. Total value of all bitcoins in circulation has reached $190 billion.  The astronomical surge of more than 1000% this year has made bitcoin more valuable than some of the largest companies, namely PespsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Boeing Co.’s (BA  -  Free Report) and Mc Donald (MCD  -  Free Report), with a market cap of $166.1 billion, $161.6 billion and $137.8 billion, respectively. The cryptocurrency is even more valuable than the combined world’s most influential banks Goldman (GS  -  Free Report) and UBS Group (UBS  -  Free Report). Goldman has a market cap of $94.4 billion while UBS has $66.2 billion.If these weren’t enough, the cryptocurrency surpassed the estimated worth of some of the world’s top billionaires like $90 billion for Gates and $83 billion for Warren Buffet. Further, bitcoin is worth more than seven times an ounce of gold, which is traditionally seen as a safe haven amid turmoil.Moreover, bitcoin has been firing all cylinders, as Google searches for bitcoin have surpassed searches for President Donald Trump as well as stocks in the last few weeks. Google searches are indicative of mainstream investor interest in bitcoin.Bitcoin ETFs NextThe bitcoin futures would pave the way for bitcoin ETFs, some of which were already rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing lack of regulation of the bitcoin spot market and unavailability of bitcoin futures contracts.Earlier this year, the SEC denied various requests for the first proposed bitcoin ETF — Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (COIN). The bitcoin ETF, proposed by SolidX Management, was also rejected in March. VanEck filed for an ETF that invests in bitcoin derivatives in mid-August but withdrew its application. REX also filed for two ETFs, namely REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which will also invest in bitcoin-based derivatives.In late September, ProShares filed for two ETFs, ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. These funds also intend to purchase derivative contracts for exposure, rather than actual bitcoins.As such, with the launch of bitcoin futures this month, bitcoin ETFs is not far from entering the market. Many analysts believe that the SEC will approve ETFs that trade bitcoin futures contracts in the near future.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

859,PEP,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies offering high dividends.JPMorgan U.S. Dividend ETF JDIV tracks the JP Morgan US Dividend Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility and yield. It has AUM of $25.2 million and seeks to provide exposure to higher-yielding equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in Dowdupont Inc DWDP, Hollyfrontier Corp (HFC  -  Free Report) and Digital Realty Trust Inc DLR, with 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all just a little over 7.5% is allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Utilities, Financials and Consumer Goods, with 15.9%, 15.0% and 14.2% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017).Market ImpactMoreover, markets anticipate an interest rate hike in the December meeting of the Fed. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 91.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike and 8.5% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike in December. This fund is expected to be significantly impacted because higher interest rates reduce the appeal of dividend-focused funds. However, Janet Yellen has warned that faster rate hikes might cause inflation to go below the Fed’s 2% target. Moreover, newly elected Fed chair, Jerome Powell, is seen as a dovish lead, who will not steer much from the current policy.There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s tax reform and deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to dividend-focused funds.CompetitionThe fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to this corner (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here).Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies providing high dividends.It has AUM of $26.1 billion and charges a fee of 8 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Industrials, Health Care and Consumer Services with 33.1%, 13.7% and 13.5% allocation, respectively (as of Oct 31, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) with 4.8%, 4.2% and 3.7% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 16.8% in a year and 15.6% year to date (as of Nov 21, 2017). It has a dividend yield of 2.0%. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies with a track record of paying dividends for 5 consecutive years.It has AUM of $17.2 billion and charges a fee of 39 basis points a year.

860,PEP,"The Consumer Staples sector has been garnering a lot of investor attention lately. The recent increase in volatility and uncertainty in the markets has increased the appeal of defensive sector investments like Consumer Staples.Cause for AppealOn Oct 19, the Senate passed a budget of $4 trillion in a 51-49 vote, which will allow the Republicans to move ahead with the tax cuts with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote supermajority that is generally required. However, uncertainty is mounting on the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform. Per Washington Post reports, Senate Republican leaders are weighing the impact of a one-year delay in reforms.The primary concern weighing on the timely passing of the tax reform is that the House and Senate’s respective versions vary significantly. This might then pose some challenges in the passing of the reform without a few key changes.Moreover, the Republicans have a slim majority in the Senate. If Roy Moore is defeated in the Dec 12 elections, the majority will be further reduced. This increased uncertainty has led to the relative appeal of staples.Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and tracks the Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $7.9 billion and charges a low fee of 14 basis points a year. It has 34 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 68.5% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Beverages, Household Products and Food & Staples Retailing, with 24.6%, 20.9% and 20.0% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 12.7%, 10.0% and 9.1% allocation, respectively (as of Nov 13, 2017).  The fund has returned 8.0% in a year and 5.6% year to date (as of Nov 13, 2017). XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index. It has AUM of $3.7 billion and charges a fee of 10 basis points a year. It has 102 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as almost 62% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Household Products, Soft Drinks and Fertilizers & Packaged Foods & Meats, with 19.6%, 19.1% and 17.1% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola Co and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) with 11.6%, 9.0% and 8.5% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund has returned 7.1% in a year and 4.2% year to date (as of Nov 13, 2017). VDC has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a High risk outlook (read: ETFs in Focus After Phillip Morris's Downbeat Results).Bottom LineXLP is more popular than VDC, as is evident from its higher AUM. However, VDC may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  Moreover, VDC also has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings.At the same time, both the funds have had relatively similar year-to-date performance. XLP returned 1.4% more than VDC so far this year, whereas in a year, XLP outperformed VDC by 0.9%. With growing uncertainty in the markets, these ETFs are poised to offer better growth potential. However, the sector has had relatively poor performance so far this year, owing to investors’ risk appetite. Moreover, if the tax reforms are enacted, the appeal of such defensive investments will be lost as investors will seek riskier investments.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

868,PEP,"Revenues of The Coca-Cola Company’s (KO  -  Free Report) North America segment, comprising about 30% of its topline, are expected to decline in the fourth quarter of 2017, when it reports on Friday, Feb 16.A Look at Coca-Cola’s North America Performance in Q3The North America segmental revenues totaled $2.75 billion last quarter, increasing 3% year over year on 2% growth in price/mix. Organically, revenues rose 2% in the period while volumes remained unchanged during the same. Price/mix increased on the company’s disciplined approach to occasion, brand, price and package strategy as well as positive business and category mix.Notably, sparkling beverage volumes have shown no growth during the quarter that includes mid-single digit growth in Sprite, offset by a mid-single digit decline in Diet Coke. The company registered low single-digit rise in tea and coffee, offset by a low single-digit fall in water, enhanced water and sports drinks.Precisely, the company’s sparkling beverage unit case volume was flat in the third and second quarters with a 1% decline witnessed in the first quarter of 2017. Notably, the sparkling beverage accounted for 72% of the company’s 2016 worldwide unit case volume. Hence, such vast exposure puts Coca-Cola in a weak spot.Coca-Cola’s North American sparkling beverage business has been delivering sluggish results due to carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category headwinds. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting demand for CSDs. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The challenges in the CSD category have been affecting all major soft drink makers namely Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group , leading to lower volumes and soft sales.Q4 ProjectionThough Coca-Cola has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts are yet to show meaningful results with the trend unlikely to change in the fourth quarter as well.Overall, Coca-Cola’s North American segmental revenues are expected to witness a 1.7% decline year over year and an 11.6%, sequentially, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Apart from the North American segment, Coca-Cola’s Latin America revenues are likely to witness 9.9% growth. While the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment’s revenues of $1.7 billion indicates an increase from $1.6 billion a year ago. Bottling Investments revenues are anticipated to decrease to $1.3 billion from $4.1 billion a year ago. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 3.2% on a year-over-year basis.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsOverall, the beverage behemoth’s fourth-quarter revenues are likely to decline on structural changes. However, the company had earlier stated that its fourth quarter might benefit from an extra day compared with the prior-year period, which equates with roughly one additional point of top-line growth for the soon-to-be-quarter.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola expects the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 27-point headwind on net revenues and an 11-12 point headwind on profit before tax in the fourth quarter.The company had earlier stated that the hurricane strikes in North America during the third quarter caused disruption to its supply chain, registering an estimated $50 million rise in costs, majority of which is forecast to affect the fourth quarter.Nonetheless, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to some extent. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for fourth-quarter earnings reflects 2.7% growth from the prior-year period’s profit of 37 cents per share. Also, the consensus mark for revenues of $7.4 billion represents a 21.7% decrease on a year-over-year basis.(Read More: Will Cost Saving Plans Support Coca-Cola's Q4 Earnings?)Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM)  Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM) | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

869,PEP,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Nov 8, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.50%. However, the company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 1.42%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Monster Beverage Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayMonster Beverage has been doing well on the back of product innovation that plays a major role in the company’s success. The company’s net sales grew 9.4% year over year in the first half of 2017, banking on wide-ranging portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in both the domestic and international markets.The company’s sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment, accounting for almost 90% of total net sales, increased 8.7%. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are now particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and obesity-related concerns. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks should drive the company’s top line in the near term.Again, the Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), grew more than 13% in the period. The company's strategic deal expanded its portfolio with notable brands, with increased presence in the international energy drinks market. This addition has been boosting the company’s sales and the trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company is experiencing solid growth in margins. The company’s first as well as second quarters’ gross margin benefitted from the raw material cost savings related to the American Fruits & Flavors acquisition. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage’s sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Although the U.S. dollar has softened against other currencies, the impact is still significant.Distributor termination expenses too might affect the company’s bottom line. The company has been transitioning from third-party distributors to Coca-Cola’s distribution network following the strategic deal with Coca-Cola.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 40 cents a share, reflecting an increase of 20.8% year over year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $901.1 million, implying 14.4% year-over-year growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Monster Beverage does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: Monster Beverage has an Earnings ESP of -1.32%.Zacks Rank: Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

Lower SG&A expense (down 20%), higher gross margin (up 170 basis points or bps), and higher operating margin (up 404 bps) helped it come up with better numbers. However, Coca-Cola's total sales decreased 15%, marking the 10th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues.PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) reported mixed third-quarter 2017 (ending Sep 9) results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Nonetheless, this is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise.Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.’s  third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.10 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.3%. Earnings decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis owing to the recent hurricanes in United States, earthquakes in Mexico and a previously disclosed write-off of prepaid resin inventory. Net sales of $1.74 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7% but rose 4% year over year.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

870,PEP,"Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Nov 7.This large independent bottler of The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an encouraging strategy to grow both organically and through the acquisition of additional manufacturing and distribution territory.In the first half of 2017, Coca-Cola Bottling reported net sales of $2.03 billion, up 38.8% year over year primarily on acquisitions and a 2.3% hike in comparable net sales on 1.9% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes. The trend is expected to continue in the third quarter as the company usually experiences higher sales in the second and third quarters of the year.The sparkling product portfolio and the higher margin still product range drove comparable net sales. Sparkling product comparable volumes grew 1% year over year while that of still products increased 4.1% in the first six months of 2017. This is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, higher expenses (such as expansion transaction and amortization expenses) might dent the company’s bottom line. Notably, the stock saw dismal trading in the third quarter, with the stock losing 5.8%, compared to the industry’s 0.6% decline.Peer ReleasesCoca-Cola reported better-than-expected results in third-quarter 2017.

871,PEP,"Coca-Cola European Partners Plc or CCEP (CCE  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Nov 7.Last quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.63%. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.22%. The chart below depicts the price and earnings surprise history:Coca-Cola European Partners PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola European Partners PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola European Partners PLC QuoteCCEP is gaining significant synergies from the merger and is expected to continue driving growth in the foreseeable future. The company’s continuous focus on brand and packaging innovation, strengthening execution and customer service, and further improving operating effectiveness will help in driving growth.It is quite evident in the last reported quarter when sales and marketing plans as well as favorable weather drove results. Its revenues increased 40.5% year over year driven by the inclusion of Germany, Iberia, and Iceland. Comparable FX-neutral sales were up 7.5%, including better price/case (up 3%) and volumes (up 4.5%). Strong results were driven by 9% growth in Northern European territories (Belgium/Luxembourg/Netherlands) and 7% growth in Germany. However, Norway and Great Britain weighed on its results. We expect the growth momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Importantly, CCEP remains on track to achieve pre-tax synergy savings of €315 million to €340 million by mid- 2019. Again, it expects to achieve half of its total target by end of 2017 that is likely to help CCEP boost its bottom line considerably.Given the solid performance, CCEP even raised its 2017 guidance, though FX is expected to hurt earnings by 2%..Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 80 cents, reflecting a 7.4% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for revenues is $3.5 billion, implying a 5.9% increase.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.CCEP does not have the right combination of ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CCEP is +1.89%.

872,PEP,"The Q3 earnings season is approaching its end, with over 327 S&P 500 companies releasing results till Nov 1, 2017. Although earnings growth is trending lower than in comparable periods, the dollar amount of total earnings is on track to reach an all-time quarterly high.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for Screening StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screen:Monsanto Company : Missouri-based Monsanto is a leading global provider of agricultural products. The company has a stellar trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise of 244.8% and long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.1%.

873,PEP,"U.S. economy has been on a rally since Donald Trump’s election victory. Trump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, increasing optimism among investors around a faster pace in economic growth and on the prospective passing of other policies of the President.However, with better-than-expected job growth, investors are betting on faster rate rises and inflation, causing havoc in the markets. In such a situation, investors generally flock to traditional defensive investments. However, these investments failed to protect investors in the most recent downturn.Market CorrectionPer data released by the Labor Department, wages grew 2.9% year over year in January compared with 2.6% in the prior month, the highest pace since April 2009. This introduced fears among investors of rising rates and inflation making a comeback.Moving on to interest rates, the Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation. Given this, markets are betting on the Fed to hike rates more than three times suggested earlier. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 71.9% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in March (read: 6 Ways to Build a Rate-Proof Portfolio With ETFs). As a result, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. This spooked investors and weighed on their risk appetite, which in turn made investors reallocate their portfolios.Defensive Funds in DetailLow-volatility ETFs are the go-to investment vehicles during times of high market uncertainty. These investments fared well in 2017, as high political uncertainty and geopolitical risks brought low volatility plays in favor.Low-volatility ETFs generally include utilities and staples stocks, and try to expose investors to high dividend yields. These funds invest in stocks that are viewed as “bond like” by investors for their steady business. Although this strategy is known to protect investors during uncertain times, the reason it did not work out in the recent selloff is that rising rate expectations were behind it. For instance, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report) has lost 5.8% so far in February.High dividend funds are known to be negatively correlated to rising rates. It is a good play to combat market uncertainty. However, with bond yields at record highs and the 10-year yield touching 2.81%, the appeal of bond-like equities declined. For instance, WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report) has lost 6.3% so far in February.As a result, it is no surprise that defensive funds failed to be in positive territory during the sell-off caused by fears over rising rates. As the Fed keeps on raising rates, these so called defensive investments might not be able to protect investors from the wrath of the correction. For instance, Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report) has lost 4.7% so far in February while Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has lost 5.6% in the period.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF targeting large-cap U.S. companies with low volatility.It has AUM of $7.1 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Financials, Utilities and Industrials with 20.9%, 19.7% and 19.2% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Honeywell International Inc (HON  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway BRKB and Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) with 1.3% allocation each. The fund has returned 11.2% in a year but has lost 3.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a Medium risk outlook.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends by applying quality screens. It has AUM of $2.0 billion and charges a fee of 28 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Information Technology, Industrials and Health Care with 20.2%, 18.7% and 17.5% allocation, respectively.The fund’s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil XOM, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) with 5.0%, 4.6% and 4.1% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 22.0% in a year but has lost 1.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3, with a Medium risk outlook.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and has AUM of $8.0 billion and charges a low fee of 13 basis points a year.The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble PG, Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 11.6%, 9.5% and 8.9% allocation, respectively.  The fund has returned 3.9% in a year but has lost 4.6% year to date. XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell), with a Medium risk outlook.Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report)XLU is one of the most popular funds in the utility space. The fund has AUM of $7.3 billion and is a relatively cheaper bet as it charges a fee of 13 basis points a year. It has an 11.4% allocation to NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), 8.0% to Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) and 7.8% to Dominion Energy (D  -  Free Report).

874,PEP,"Shares of Shopify (SHOP  -  Free Report) plummeted on Tuesday morning, even though the e-commerce platform posted third-quarter earnings and revenues beats. This leaves many investors focused on the bold claims made by notable short-seller Citron Research.Shopify BeatsThe Ottawa, Ontario-based e-commerce platform that is geared towards small and mid-size businesses has seen its shares surge more than 155% over the last 52-weeks. On Tuesday, Shopify posted earnings and revenues that topped Wall Street estimates. Shopify’s revenues jumped 72% in the third quarter to $171.5 million. The company reported earnings adjusted for stock option expenses of $0.05 per share.For the fourth quarter, the company now expects to post revenues between $206 million and $208 million. Shopify also projects it will pull in full-year revenues in the range of $656 million to $658 million, which would mark roughly a 70% year-over-year jump.Despite these solid revenues gains and its adjusted earnings beat, Shopify posted a third-quarter net loss of $9.4 million. For the full-year, the company now expects to post a GAAP operating loss between $12.5 million and $14.5 million.Shopify’s recent top-line growth has clearly helped the cloud-based business platform company soar in 2017. Still, the company is losing money overall, and now there are also questions about the legality of at least a portion of its business.Short-Seller Shares of Shopify began to dip recently, due in part to a push from Citron Research founder Andrew Left.Citron, and Left specifically, have called Shopify a “get-rich-quick” scheme. In a seven-minute video, Left highlights all of Shopify’s practices that he feels support his case against the company, which he refers to in the same breath as Herbalife (HLF  -  Free Report)—long considered a pyramid scheme and recently entangled with its own Federal Trade Commission suit.The noted short-seller points out that Shopify’s website boasts that over 2,500 merchants use Shopify Plus. These are businesses that use the company’s platforms to run their e-commerce and even some of their internet-connected brick-and-mortar needs. He then concedes that the company could also have about 20,000 Shopify advanced customers.Left then points out that the company claims to power over 500,000 online stores worldwide. This sets up his simple question: who are the rest of these 475,000 users and how does Shopify really make its money?The Citron boss then plants seeds of doubts and suggests that Shopify is profiting from users who sell Shopify services to people saying “you can become a millionaire” by working from home. He goes on to state that Shopify’s website used to have a resignation letter outline and a post about how to make money by promotionally blogging about Shopify’s services.This is where the pyramid scheme tag might start to carry some water with some investors.Shopify works with the likes of BuzzFeed, Visa (V  -  Free Report), Frito-Lay (PEP  -  Free Report), Canadian Tire , theNew York Times, and celebrities such as Drake and Kanye West.Now, however, investors seem worried that Shopify and its CEO Tobias Lütke have not done enough to address Citron’s pyramid scheme concerns since the video was released on Oct. 4. Lütke did take to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) on Tuesday morning to post about how many entrepreneurs benefit from the platform.Every 90 sec an entrepreneur makes their first sale on Shopify. Entrepreneurs and small companies are leading a quiet revolution in commerce— Tobi Lütke (@tobi) October 31, 2017Yet, some of the first comments are Twitter users asking how many customers quickly stop using Shopify’s platform after joining.It seems that only time will tell if Citron gets its wish and the FTC takes a look into what it believes are unsavory business practices at Shopify. For now, investors look as if they might shy away from the up and coming e-commerce company until some of these concerns—valid or not—are addressed more completely.Shares of Shopify tanked over 10% on Tuesday morning after the company posted its relatively solid quarterly earnings.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

875,PEP,"The U.S. stock market seems to have defied the eerie All Hallows’ Eve by maintaining its bull run, and the ‘Halloween Strategy’, a technique in which investors start placing big bets on All Hallows' Eve after restraining in the preceding six months, gives us even more optimism right now.Demand for candies and costumes in the Halloween season drives sales at U.S. retailers, including discount stores. Sales of such items are poised to beat the previous year numbers, courtesy of upbeat consumer sentiment. The finances of consumers have, largely, benefitted from an improving economy with lower unemployment and better wages.Spooky Stock Market Ghosts, Goblins and GhoulsThe fears and apprehensions concerning the broader market are unsubstantiated.For instance, has the war of words between North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un and Trump scared investors? Apparently not, as the market continues to gain unhindered.Another fear is that the Fed will hike rates, killing a bull market fueled by cheap borrowing. But, policymakers haven’t hiked rates yet. They fear that a rate hike will strengthen the dollar, eventually denting U.S. exports and hampering economic growth.Finally, should a lofty valuation give you goosebumps? Nope and nope. Bull markets often scale to a string of record highs. So, if you succumb to the fear of highs, you eventually lose money.Halloween Drives Record Sales of CandyWith more money expected to pour in, candy sales are expected to rise. In fact, Halloween accounts for about 10% of the industry’s total annual sales, which in turn leads to fierce competition among confectioners.According to IHS Markit data, candy sales are set to rise 4.1% from last year, reaching a seasonally adjusted $4.1 billion. This is particularly impressive given that candy prices have declined 0.9% from last year, marking the second successive drop in Halloween candy prices.Halloween is like Super Bowl Sunday for North America’s largest chocolate maker — Hershey Co (HSY  -  Free Report). Banking on this upbeat sales forecast, the maker of Kisses, Reese’s, Krackel, Symphony and Mr. Goodbar expects sales to go up 8% from last year. The company has seen its earnings grow over the last five years, driving its share price from $70 to nearly $105.Another major player, Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ  -  Free Report), is expected to gain immensely from this year’s rise in candy sales. It is a successor to Kraft Foods Inc, which owns household names in the candy industry like Nabisco, Cadbury and Toblerone. It has seen its share price climb from around $27 the year it was introduced to almost $40 today.Halloween to Boost Costume and Discount Store SalesA large chunk of Halloween spending will go to costumes as well. According to a survey by the National Retail Federation (NRF), Americans are expected to spend $3.4 billion on costumes. The survey also shows that majority of consumers will shop online for costumes, while about 30% will do so at retail stores.In fact, as per the NRF, spending on All Hallows' Eve this year will be more than $9 billion. This marks a rise from around $8.5 billion last year.Consumer Confidence Rides HighThe upbeat reading on Halloween sales says a lot about consumer sentiments, which have been improving on a strengthening economy.

878,PEP,"The NFL Draft begins Thursday night, kicking off a three-day event that has transformed from a humble ballroom production into a big budget spectacle and the NFL’s most important offseason offering. But instead of more speculation about the top picks, let’s tackle the big business that fuels the 2018 NFL Draft.New York City played host to the NFL Draft for the first 50 years, moving from hotels to its long-time home, Radio City Music Hall. Then, in 2015, the NFL moved on from the 6,000 seat theater to Chicago, where it was held for two years.Last year, Philadelphia won the rights to host the event, building upon Chicago’s impressive outdoor fan festivities. Roughly 250,000 visitors spent an estimated $56 million on everything from hotels to food in Philadelphia.‘Everything's Bigger In Texas’ This year, the Dallas Cowboys play host to the 2018 NFL Draft at AT&T (T  -  Free Report) Stadium in Arlington, Texas, where roughly 400,000 people have registered to attend. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's Event Trust Funds even donated $2.2 million to help Jerry Jones’ team play host.Outside of the 20,000 fans a day that will gain entry into AT&T Stadium to watch the actual draft, 27 NFL corporate sponsors will host and market to fans during the three-day NFL circus. Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report) and Frito-Lay (PEP  -  Free Report) are set to host fans at different pop-up venues. Meanwhile, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) will run a clinic with Dallas Cowboys’ star Ezekiel Elliott.Fresh off grabbing official NFL sponsorship rights from Papa John’s (PZZA  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) Pizza Hut will try to capitalize on the fanfare. Another big NFL partner, Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), is the presenting sponsor of the red carpet, as well as the NFL Network’s TV coverage.Television Extravaganza Last year’s NFL Draft grabbed an average of 4.6 million combined TV viewers across ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) and NFL Network. And this year could be even bigger, as it marks the first time that the entire NFL Draft will be broadcast live on television.The first three rounds of the draft, on Thursday and Friday, will be broadcast live across the NFL Network, Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPN Deportes. Saturday’s coverage will also be available on NFL Network and ESPN, with ABC simulcasting ESPN’s coverage of rounds four through seven for the first time ever.Draft coverage can also be live streamed through the NFL app or NFL.com, as well as on the Fox Sports and ESPN apps. Notably left out of the coverage are CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and NBC (CMCSA  -  Free Report), which both pay billions to broadcast NFL games.Player Money Clearly, the NFL Draft is a big business. But the people that stand to benefit the most during the three-day event are the players taken in the first-round, particularly those drafted in the top 10.Myles Garrett, last year’s top pick, signed a fully guaranteed four-year, $30.4 million contract with the Cleveland Browns. This included a $20.3 million signing bonus. The last pick in the first-round, Ryan Ramczyk, signed a four-year, $8.9 million contract with $6.7 million guaranteed.The average second-round contract was worth about $5 million over four years, according to Spotrac.com. These numbers slowly shrink as the rounds go on, with pick 256 in the 2018 draft excepted to land a signing bonus of $69,784.Meanwhile, the top pick in the 2018 NFL Draft is expected to make $32.9 million over his first four years, including a $22.1 million signing bonus.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

879,PEP,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the opening bell.A Look at Coca-Cola’s Revenue PerformanceCoca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets, and shift in consumer preference. The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last 10 quarters, primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category, and structural changes.Coca-Cola’s third-quarter revenues declined 15% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 18% impact on revenues. The company’s soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 27% in net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items. However, the company expects currency to have a positive impact on quarterly net revenues by 0-1%.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coca-Cola’s total revenues stands at $7.36 billion, implying a 21.7% year-over-year decrease.Efforts to Boost MarginsThe cola giant has been focusing on increasing their efficiency and improving their margins amid tough business conditions. For that, Coca-Cola’s strategy to refranchise its bottling operations facilitated improved margins by reducing its exposure to the capital-intensive bottling business. The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Coca-Cola’s adjusted EPS increased 2% from the year-ago level (after falling for nine consecutive quarters) in the prior quarter despite weak revenues. The company’s earnings have topped the consensus mark in 12 of the past 13 quarters.The improvement was attributable to its ongoing productivity initiatives. Its adjusted gross margin expanded 170 basis points or bps in Q3. Comparable operating margin also grew 404 bps. The company’s plan to refranchise its low-margin bottling operations and transform into a capital-light business are helping to improve its margins. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Again, the company is on track to deliver annualized savings of about $3 billion by 2019 through its productivity programs. These include restructuring of its global supply chain, zero-based budgeting and streamlining its operating model.Segment DiscussionNorth America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to see tepid growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $2.4 billion reflect growth of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.Latin America revenues are likely to witness 9.9% growth. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment revenues of $1.7 billion indicates a decrease from $1.6 billion a year ago. Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease to $1.3 billion from $4.1 billion a year ago. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 3.2% on a year-over-year basis.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s fourth-quarter revenues are likely to decline owing to structural changes and currency headwind. We feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coca-Cola’s earnings is pegged at 38 cents, reflecting a 2.7% year-over-year increase.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Coca-Cola does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Coca-Cola is -1.16%.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

880,PEP,"Coca-Cola European Partners Plc or CCEP (CCE  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Feb 15.Last quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.19%. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.52%.A Few Other Factors That Might Affect Q4 Results:CCEP is gaining significant synergies from the merger and is expected to continue driving growth in the foreseeable future. The company’s continuous focus on brand and packaging innovation, strengthening execution and customer service, and further improving operating effectiveness will help in driving growth.Last quarter, although the company registered weak revenues, its cost saving plans are helping to boost its bottom line. In the third quarter, operating expenses decreased 3% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. This reflects the synergy benefits, volume-related costs, expense timing and a continued focus on managing operating expenses. These factors contributed to operating profit growth of 3.5%, on a comparable and currency neutral basis.In the first nine months of 2017, revenues were up 3% and operating profit was up 11.5%, both on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Excluding synergies, operating profit grew about 3%, broadly in line with revenues growth in the said period. We expect the growth momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Importantly, CCEP remains on track to achieve pre-tax synergy savings of €315-€340 million by mid-2019.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents, reflecting a 19.6% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for revenues is $3.1 billion, implying a 10.1% increase.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:CCEP has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CCEP is 2.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CCEP carries a Zacks Rank #3, which further increases the odds of an earnings beat.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Coca-Cola European Partners PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola European Partners PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola European Partners PLC QuotePeer ReleasePepsiCo, Inc.

882,PEP,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results. Despite reporting flat soda volumes, the coal giant gained from higher demand for Sprite, tea and coffee.

883,PEP,"Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings! Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul.This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history.)% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (Companies that witnessed year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal.)% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,818 stocks to only 36.Here are the top five stocks:PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) is a global food and beverage company. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company’s estimated growth rate for this year is 7.7%, higher than the industry’s gain of 3.7%.Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) is a provider an Internet television network.

884,PEP,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 (ending Dec 30) results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this is the seventh consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise. Improvement in the snack business helped offset continued weakness at the company’s beverage business amid “rapidly shifting consumer landscape”.EarningsPepsiCo’s fourth-quarter core earnings per share (EPS) of $1.31 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 and increased 9% year over year, mainly driven by better operating efficiency. In constant currency terms, adjusted earnings grew 8%.Core earnings exclude restructuring and impairment charges and commodity mark-to-market net impact. The company reported a loss of 50 cents per share due to a $2.5 billion one-time charge related to new U.S. tax laws. The reported loss reflects a decrease of 152% year over year. Foreign exchange translation had a positive impact of 1% on reported EPS.RevenuesNet revenues of $19.53 billion remain unchanged with the year-ago level. Foreign exchange (Fx) had a positive impact on revenues growth of 1% and pricing had a positive impact of 2%. Reported revenues also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.44 billion.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 2.3% on an organic basis, primarily driven by higher demand for food/snacks in the Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA), Latin America and Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) segments. Notably, overall organic sales growth was better than the 1.7% rise recorded in the previous quarter.Total volumes remained unchanged during the quarter against 1% growth in the previous quarter. While organic snacks/food increased 2% (better than 1% growth witnessed in the third quarter), beverage volumes dropped 2% (versus down 1%).Quarterly Segment DetailsRevenues decreased 1% at the Frito-Lay segment, 5% at Quaker Foods (QFNA) and 6% at North America Beverages (NAB). However, revenues improved 6% in Latin America and 11% in ESSA segments. Meanwhile, revenues at AMENA remained unchanged.Notably, the company’s NAB segment was negatively impacted by higher input costs, operating cost inflation and restructuring charges that substantially offset productivity gains. Moreover, the 53rd reporting week in the prior year and hurricane-related costs also added to the woes. Organic sales and beverage volumes were down 3% and 2%, respectively, in the quarter.Operating profits (on a reported basis) increased 20% in Latin America and 173% in AMENA. However, operating profits plunged 29% in the NAB, 6% in the QFNA and 1% in the Frito-Lay   segments.Pepsico, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pepsico, Inc.

887,PEP,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.23%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.72%.Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for Q4Health awareness has been the prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company. Keeping this in mind, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier Everyday Nutrition Products. The company believes that such products will play an important role in the long-term growth.PepsiCo has delivered revenue growth in the past three quarters, banking on significant innovation, higher pricing continued momentum in Frito-Lay business, revenue management strategies, along with better market execution.Consumer taste is rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are the pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as other non-alcoholic beverage companies.If we look back at PepsiCo’s Q3 revenue performance, it grew 1.3% to $16.2 billion in the quarter, driven by higher pricing. The company’s organic revenue grew 1.7%. Notably, organic sales growth was softer than the 3.1% rise recorded in the previous quarter. Although foreign exchange (Fx) hurt revenue growth by 1%, pricing had a positive impact of 3%. Total volume declined 1% during the quarter against flat growth in the previous quarter.The company’s total revenues increased 1.7% for the first nine months of 2017. This reflects improvement from the 2.7% decline in the year-ago period, banking on innovations and better market execution. However, organically, revenues grew 2.3% in the first three quarters of 2017, against 3.7% growth in the year-ago period.Segment DiscussionNorth America Beverages or NAB business (includes beverage businesses in the United States and Canada) accounts for about 32.8% of PepsiCo’s total revenues. Revenues at the segment declined 3% in the third quarter and remained unchanged in the first three quarters of 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NAB segment revenues is pegged at $5.96 billion, implying a 5.2% decline.For Frito-Lay North America or FLNA business (accounting for 23.3% of revenues), the company had a good balance of volume growth, net price realization and operating margin expansion. The segment revenues increased 3% in both the third quarter and the nine-month period. The trend is expected to persist in the to-be-reported quarter, with revenues likely to improve 26.7%, sequentially per the consensus estimate. However, revenues at FLNA are expected to decrease 1.7% on a year-over-year basis.Quaker Foods North America segment revenues increased 1% in the third quarter but decreased 1% in the first nine months of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $775 million, implying a 4.9% decline.Europe Sub-Saharan Africa segment revenues grew 8% in the third quarter and 7% in the first nine months of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.6 billion, implying an 8.1% increase. Latin America segment revenues grew 6% in the prior quarter as well as in the first nine months of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $2.4 billion, implying a 6.2% increase.Asia, Middle East and North Africa segment revenues decreased 4% in the third quarter and 7% in the first nine months of 2017. However, the segment revenues are likely to improve by just 0.4% in the to-be-reported quarter, per the consensus estimate.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PepsiCo’s total revenues stands at $19.4 billion, implying a 0.4% year-over-year decrease.Let us delve deeper into other factors likely to impact PepsiCo’s fourth-quarter performance:Coming to the company’s margins, PepsiCo had earlier indicated that as the commodity inflation is expected to continue in 2017, the company’s gross margin might face some pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.Notwithstanding the above-mentioned concerns, the company beat expectation in the last seven quarters. The company’s productivity programs will likely support its core operating margin expansion. PepsiCo’s productivity programs are on track to achieve annual $1 billion target.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $1.30, reflecting an 8.3% year-over-year increase.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:PepsiCo does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of -0.09%.Zacks Rank: PepsiCo carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

888,PEP,"Welcome to a Super Bowl LII edition of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into the business behind the big game, looking specifically at which companies took advantage of the Super Bowl’s massive television reach.Last night, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 in an epic game that wasn’t decided until the final whistle. But while the teams battled it out on the field, some of the biggest companies in the world spent millions of dollars on advertisements designed to become the talk of offices, bars, and living rooms around the country over the next few weeks.NBC’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) coverage of Super Bowl 52 was officially brought to us by Pizza Hut YUM, Kraft KHC, U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report), Sprint (S  -  Free Report), Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) new Solo: A Star Wars Story movie, and a few others.On top of ads from these companies, Toyota (TM  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) showed off multiple campaigns and sponsored halftime, where Justin Timberlake helped Nike NKE subtly sell exclusive new Jordan Brand sneakers.Some of the biggest Super Bowl ad spenders over the last 20 years, such as Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), all poured money into ads once again.Familiar names also presented some unfamiliar messages. Peyton and Eli Manning stole a little Super Bowl spotlight, while Procter and Gamble’s PG Tide ads, featuring Stranger Things star David Harbour, might just have stolen the show.Tech giants were also some of last night’s big winners. Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) star-packed Alexa spot—which featured CEO Jeff Bezos—is sure to be seen all over the internet, social media, and television for months to come. Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV sponsored NBC’s pre-game show—and might have just inspired some to cut their cords following the game.Another linear-television competitor, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), spent millions on a Super Bowl LII commercial for its Cloverfield Paradox movie, which users could watch on-demand right after the game.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

889,PEP,"Coca-Cola European Partners plc (CCE  -  Free Report) or CCEP is set to report first-quarter 2018 results, before the opening bell on Apr 26.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.45%. The company surpassed/met the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 6.88%.Factors at PlayIn 2017, CCEP modestly exceeded its initial guidance for revenue, operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. The company’s continuous focus on brand and packaging innovation, solid revenue per unit case growth (up 200% year over year) in sugar-free portfolio, stronger execution and customer service, and improving operating efficiency helped drive growth.This has encouraged CCEP to step up investments in brand portfolio, field sales teams, route to market and most importantly, digital capabilities.In the last reported quarter, the company’s net sales increased 12.7% year over year in dollar terms. Comparable revenues in the quarter grew 3.5%. From a brand and volume perspective, CCEP’s sparkling portfolio increased 1%, with a 0.5% drop in Coca-Cola trademark brands. Notably, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continued to perform well, growing more than 15%. Again, energy drinks performed well and were up 15% as the company continued to execute its multi-brand strategy.Apart from solid revenues, the company’s cost-saving plans are helping boost the bottom line. In the fourth quarter, operating expenses contracted 11.5% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. This reflects synergy benefits, volume-related costs, expense timing and continued focus on managing operating expenses. These factors contributed to operating profit growth of 50% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Comparable earnings jumped 26.1% year over year in the quarter.We expect the growth momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Importantly, CCEP is on track to achieve pre-tax synergy savings of €315-€340 million by mid-2019.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 39 cents, reflecting a 18.2% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for revenues is $3 billion, implying a 19.1% increase.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:CCEP does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CCEP is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CCEP carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of 0.00% makes earnings prediction difficult. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Coca-Cola European Partners PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola European Partners PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola European Partners PLC QuotePeer ReleaseThe Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) started off 2018 on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts in first-quarter 2018.Upcoming Peer ReleasesPepsiCo, Inc.

890,PEP,"The Q1 reporting cycle is gathering steam, with more than 35% S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week. According to the latest Earnings Preview, results of 87 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 20, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members were up 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. Of these, 82.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 67.8% beat revenue expectations.Now, soft drinks stocks, which are broadly grouped in the Consumer Staples sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), are expected to see modest growth in the quarter. The sector is expected to report 6.2% earnings and 2.8% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018.The Beverages-Soft Drinks industry within the consumer staples sector has been coming up with sluggish results due to carbonated soft drinks or CSD category headwinds. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting demand for CSDs. Among CSDs, the cola segment particularly has come under fire as consumers are opting for alternative beverage offerings.Nonetheless, the companies remained focused on reviving their tepid sales growth. They are pursuing investments in product innovations as well as newer revenue platforms while taking care of health benefits (like reduced calorie beverages, non-carbonated beverages and healthier snacks) to boost long-term sales and profits.One of the key players in the beverage industry, Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), has already released its first-quarter numbers. Coca-Cola kicked off 2018 on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following soft drink stocks within the consumer staples sector, which are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results around Apr 26.PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 numbers before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.77%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 4.05%.The company’s CSD volumes declined 5% in 2017 in the North America Beverages (NAB) business. Notably, results of the NAB segment — comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada — remained soft in the last reported quarter. Results were negatively impacted by higher input costs, operating cost inflation and restructuring charges that substantially offset productivity gains. Moreover, the 53rd reporting week in the prior year and hurricane-related costs also added to the woes. Organic sales and beverage volumes were down 3% and 2%, respectively, in the quarter.That said, the company is speeding up its innovation and investments in e-commerce, R&D and social/digital marketing/design to enhance its top line. PepsiCo has delivered organic revenue growth in the past four quarters, banking on significant innovation and revenue management strategies, along with better market execution. The company’s total organic revenue growth was modest at 2.3% last quarter, driven by 2% pricing on 2% volume growth in food/snacks, offset by a 2% volume decline in beverages. However, its total revenues remained unchanged from the year-ago level.Apart from revenues, commodity inflation is expected to create pressure on PepsiCo’s gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. That said, its productivity programs will likely support its core operating margin expansion to some extent.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings of 92 cents implies a year-over-year decline of 2.1%. The same for revenues is pegged at $12.41 billion, 3% higher than the prior-year quarter figure.Meanwhile, our proven model does not hint at an earnings beat for the company this quarter, as PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read More: Will Cost-Saving Plans Boost PepsiCo's Q1 Earnings?)Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteCoca-Cola European Partners plc (CCE  -  Free Report), also known as CCEP, is a consumer packaged goods company, engaged in producing, distributing and marketing nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. It is slated to report quarterly numbers before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the consensus mark. It beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.88%.In 2017, CCEP has modestly exceeded its initial guidance for revenues, operating profit, earnings per share and most notably free cash flow. The company’s continued focus on brand and packaging innovation, solid revenue per unit case growth (up 200% year over year) in the sugar-free portfolio, strengthening execution and customer service, and further improving operating effectiveness will help in driving growth. We expect the growth momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Meanwhile, for CCEP, our proven model does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients, which increases the odds of an earnings beat. Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 39 cents, reflecting an 18.2% year-over-year increase.

891,PEP,"New Age Beverage Corporation (NBEV  -  Free Report) was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise nearly 6% on the day. The move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This reverses the recent trend for the company—as the stock is now down 9.3% in the past one-month time frame.The move came after the company announced the expansion of Aspen PureProbiotic, world's first probiotic water with more than 10 billion live colony forming units developed by New Age, throughout the more than 2,000 Ahold Delhaize banner stores across 23 states, with particular strength along the East Coast in the United States.The company has seen a mixed track record when it comes to estimate revisions of no increase and decrease over the past few weeks, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter hasn’t been in a trend either. The recent price action is encouraging though, so make sure to keep a close watch on this firm in the near future.New Age currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while its Earnings ESP is 0.00%.New Age Beverage Corporation Price New Age Beverage Corporation Price | New Age Beverage Corporation QuoteA better-ranked stock in the Consumer Staples sector is Pepsico, Inc.

892,PEP,"Tuesday, October 10, 2017It’s being called the biggest proxy fight in history: activist investor an co-founder of Trian Fund Management, Nelson Peltz, has been trying for months to attain a seat on Procter & Gamble’s (PG  -  Free Report) board of directors. The company has thus far disallowed the move, fearing disruption from high-profile Peltz. This morning — right now, in fact, P&G is putting it to a vote.No company remotely this large — P&G has a $235 billion market cap — has ever gone through this. Yet Trian routinely invests in big brand names, of which P&G has many — Charmin, Tide, Head & Shoulders and Downy, just to name a few. Trian itself owns interest in Pepsico (PEP  -  Free Report), Mondelez (MDLZ  -  Free Report), among others, and just yesterday gained a seat on General Electric’s (GE  -  Free Report) board. From Peltz’s perspective, this bid should be a slam-dunk. But the consumer discretionary giant has reportedly stated Peltz shouldn’t be granted a seat on the board “just because he can.”As an activist investor, Peltz has freely shared his opinion that P&G relies too heavily on its established products at the expense of innovation. P&G board members supporting CEO David Taylor, who took the reins not quite two years ago, are not taking kindly to Peltz’s forceful assertion that he should be given the seat. Thus we find ourselves in this current situation.Wall Streeters voting at P&G would tend to support Peltz’s entry to the board today. But 40% of P&G shareholders are retail, not insiders, and they would more likely be supporting the corporation’s status quo. At 1 P&G Plaza in Cincinnati, OH, the x-factor may be the index funds which swing the balance. Representatives from Vanguard, BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report), and the like are considering whether to push P&G in a more aggressive direction under Peltz’s influence, or safeguard this staple corporation of Southern Ohio.P&G currently employs roughly 95K people worldwide. Should Peltz win himself a seat, many feel he would push to further consolidate its workforce, which has already been trimmed more than 25% since the company put its internal reforms into play five years ago. Pre-market trading for PG shares are up slightly, though the stock has traded down over the past month. That said, PG still trades up near all-time highs.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

894,PEP,"U.S. equities have had a stellar run on strong growth and rising optimism around President Donald Trump’s tax reform. However, latest developments in the political landscape in the United States spell trouble for the Republicans.Positives for TrumpGDP growth for the United States was revised up to 3.3% in the third quarter compared with 3.1% in the previous quarter. The third quarter reading was revised from an initial reading of 3%. This was the strongest quarterly growth reading in three years. Non-farm payrolls increased 228,000 in November, per the Labor Department.Moreover, unemployment rate came in at 4.1%, a 17-year low. This comes as a positive for Trump, who seeks to brand himself as a leader of the masses.Risks InvolvedHowever, all’s not well for the Trump administration. Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy S. Moore in the Senate election in Alabama, a deep red state which voted overwhelmingly for Trump in the November 2016 Presidential election. Moore had been accused of sexual abuse and child molestation, which might have been a factor for the relatively low support he received.“We have shown the country the way that we can be unified,” Jones said. “This entire race has been about dignity and respect. This campaign has been about the rule of law,” he added.The GOP Senate majority has slimmed to 51-49 after Moore’s defeat. This might create difficulties for the Trump administration to pass its key legislations.Although the Senate passed the Republican tax reform, there are increased concerns around the differences in the versions of the House and Senate. Moreover, geopolitical risks weigh on the markets. Last month, North Korea launched a Hwasong-15 missile with improved technology that flew over Japan in a latest show of force.Owing to the high uncertainty in the markets, we believe it is best to opt for low volatility. Hence, we will now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the low volatility space of the U.S. equity markets.iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF that provides exposure to U.S. companies with low risk.It has AUM of $15.1 billion and charges a fee of 15 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Information Technology, Health Care and Consumer Staples with 19.8%, 16.7% and 13.0% allocation, respectively (as of Dec 12, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Visa Inc Class A (V  -  Free Report) and Mcdonalds Corp (MCD  -  Free Report) with 1.5% allocation each (as of Dec 12, 2017). The fund has returned 17.0% in a year and 17.3% year to date (as of Dec 13, 2017). It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF targeting large-cap U.S. companies with low volatility.It has AUM of $7.4 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Utilities, Financials and Industrials with 21.2%, 20.8% and 17.3% allocation, respectively (as of Dec 12, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Honeywell International Inc (HON  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 1.3% allocation each (as of Dec 12, 2017). The fund has returned 15.8% in a year and 15.4% year to date (as of Dec 13, 2017). It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility Portfolio (XMLV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF targeting mid-cap U.S. companies with minimum volatility.It has AUM of $1.2 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year.

895,PEP,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies with low volatility. JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility ETF JMIN tracks the JP Morgan US Minimum Volatility Index.  Fund Characteristics The fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility. It has AUM of $25.7 million and seeks to provide exposure to low risk equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in NVR Inc, Walmart Stores Inc and Brownforman Corp, with 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all, just a little over 7.0%, is allocated to the top 10 holdings. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Health Care, Consumer Goods and Utilities, with 20.4%, 19.4% and 17.0% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017).  Market Impact The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of the tax reform. Although there are multiple hurdles for the tax reform to become a law, Trump called the Senate vote a major victory and the Republican Party unbeatable. “Unless they have somebody that we don’t know about, right now we’re unbeatable,” said Trump. The House and Senate differ radically on what they want to establish from the tax reform. Multiple compromises might be needed to come to a conclusion. For instance, the House wants to abolish the estate tax, whereas the Senate wants to raise it. If there are significant negotiations made in reconciling the two plans, appeal for low volatility funds might increase. There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to low volatility funds. Competition The fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to this corner (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here). iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.  It has AUM of $15.0 billion and charges a fee of 15 basis points a year.

896,PEP,"Stocks closed lower on Tuesday on the back of fresh worries about rising government bond yields, along with a potentially troublesome message from economic bellwether Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report). Therefore, investors need to be even more cautious about stocks that look poised to fall short of quarterly earnings estimates as Q1 earnings season heats up.The S&P 500 fell 1.34%, which brought its five-day decline to 2.65%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank by 424.56 points, after tumbling by as much as 600 points, to close down 1.74% on Tuesday.With that said, let’s take a look at a few well-known companies that could disappoint investors this week, by posting lower-than-expected earnings results. To do this, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one investors typically want to avoid during earnings season.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these weak stocks in order to help them identify a few high-risk companies ahead of their upcoming reports.Check them out now: 1.      Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report)Shares of Baidu are down roughly 8.8% over the last 12 weeks. This might signal that investors are worried that the Chinese internet search engine giant could be headed for a down quarter. With that said, our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Baidu’s revenues to climb by 32.7% to reach $3.26 billion. Baidu is also expected to see its earnings skyrocket by 73% to hit $1.73 per share.However, BIDU is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of -1.30%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $1.71 per share, which falls 2 cents below our current consensus estimates. Therefore, Baidu is a stock that investors might want to avoid for now as it could fall short of earnings estimates. 2.       PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report)PepsiCo is expected to see its quarterly sales climb just 3% to $12.41 billion, as drinking and eating habits continue to lean toward healthier options. Investors should also note that the company’s quarterly earnings are projected to dip 2% from the year-ago period to reach $0.92 per share. Worst still, the company has earned three downward earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days.PEP is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and holds an Earnings ESP of -0.97%. PepsiCo’s negative ESP figure comes from the fact that its Most Accurate Estimate falls 1 cent below our current consensus estimate. This means investors might want to avoid PepsiCo ahead of its Q1 earnings results on Thursday, April 26.3.       Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report)Shares of Exxon fell over 1.5% on Tuesday just a few days before the company is set to report its Q1 results on Friday, April 27. This decline bucked a positive trend that had seen Exxon’s stock price climb 7.5% over the last four weeks. Still, Exxon is expected to see its Q1 revenues hit $67.33 billion, which would mark a 6.4% jump. Meanwhile, the company’s earnings are projected to surge roughly 26%.With that said, investors should note that the company has experienced mixed earnings estimate revision activity in the last 30 days. Furthermore, Exxon’s Most Accurate Estimate falls 5 cents below our current consensus estimate. XOM is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and rocks an Earnings ESP of -4.50%, which means that Exxon’s could be poised to miss earnings estimates.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

897,PEP,"Shares of Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  soared more than 22% on Jan 29 after news came out that the beverage company will be acquired by coffee-maker Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.Terms of the DealPer the terms of the transaction, which has been approved by Dr Pepper Snapple’s board of directors, the company’s shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $130.75 per share, making the deal worth $18.7 billion. Dr Pepper Snapple’s shareholders will retain 13% ownership of the combined entity, while Keurig shareholders will own the remaining 87%.European investment fund JAB Holding, which helped take Keurig private for $13.9 billion in 2016, will make a $9 billion equity investment as a part of the transaction financing, and will be the controlling shareholder when the transaction closes in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, snack giant Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) — JAB Holding's partner in Keurig — is slated to have about 13-14% stake in the merged entity.Both Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple will continue to operate from their respective headquarters, and their leadership will run their businesses.Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price  Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price | Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Quote Keurig Dr Pepper’s Impact on the IndustryThe new company, known as Keurig Dr Pepper, will have $11 billion in combined pro forma revenues and will realize $600 million in synergies on an annualized basis by 2021, per the companies. The merger creates a portfolio that contains a number of iconic beverage companies that includes Dr Pepper, 7UP, Snapple, A&W root beer, Mott’s apple juice, Sunkist and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which includes the Keurig single-serve coffee business.The combined company's new CEO, Keurig's Bob Gamgort, says that Dr Pepper Snapple's distribution network will help market drinks such as Peet's Coffee and Forto coffee shops, while Keurig's online presence will boost sales of Dr Pepper Snapple’s products through digital platforms like Amazon.com Inc. As such, the Keurig-Dr Pepper deal would mark the largest soft-drink deal in history.Overall, the deal is likely to push JAB Holdings into escalating competition with beverage giants like of Coca-Cola Co. (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report).The deal primarily validates the ongoing trouble in the food and beverage industry. Changing demographics and purchasing behaviors make it important for beverage industry giants to understand and capitalize on main consumer insights that identify growing trends. Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company.Continuing decline in carbonated soft drinks or CSDs and impressive growth in noncarbonated beverages are creating headaches for many established players like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Dr Pepper Snapple, leading to lower volumes and weak sales. Among CSDs, the cola segment particularly has been facing challenges, as consumers are opting for alternatives. Also, potential new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales. This shift in consumer preferences resulted in Dr Pepper Snapple’s soda sales declining for the12th consecutive year in 2016.In order to combat this weakness, the company added Bai Brands in January 2017 to its priority portfolio, one of the fastest growing beverage brands that offer a family of premium better-for-you beverages. However, despite its efforts, Dr Pepper Snapple has about 8.5% of the U.S. non-alcoholic beverage market and has been the slowest to diversify its offerings alongside market leaders Coca Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc., according to the consultancy Euromonitor International.In the words of Keurig CEO Bob Gamgort, “Our view of the industry through the lens of consumer needs, versus traditional manufacturer-defined segments, unlocks the opportunity to combine hot and cold beverages and create a platform to increase exposure to high-growth formats.”Dr Pepper Snapple holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

898,PEP,"Shares of Dr Pepper Snapple Group  skyrocketed to a new all-time high on Monday after it was announced that coffee giant Keurig Green Mountain is set to purchase the beverage maker.The deal will see Dr Pepper shareholders receive $103.75 per share in a special cash dividend and retain 13% of the combined company. Dr Pepper Snapple shares closed Friday at $95.65 and surged over 30% on Monday to hit $126.63 following the announcement.The new company, Keurig Dr Pepper, hopes to better compete against the likes of PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Dunkin' Brands (DNKN  -  Free Report), and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report). This merger also comes at a time when soda companies are trying to diversify their portfolios as consumers shift away from sugary drinks.European investment fund JAB Holding helped take Keurig private for $13.9 billion in 2016. This merger will see JAB become the controlling shareholder of Keurig Dr Pepper, while snack giant Mondelez International (MDLZ) will hold a roughly 13% to 14% stake in the new company.The companies posted $11 billion in combined sales during 2017. Management from both firms hope that Keurig Dr Pepper, with its portfolio of brands including 7UP, A&W root beer, and the widely-popular single-serve coffee systems, will be able to offer “unrivaled distribution capability to reach virtually every point-of-sale in North America.”“Our view of the industry through the lens of consumer needs, versus traditional manufacturer-defined segments, unlocks the opportunity to combine hot and cold beverages and create a platform to increase exposure to high-growth formats,” Keurig CEO Bob Gamgort said in a statement.The companies noted that they expect to create $600 million of annual savings by 2021. This merger comes as soda companies face more pressure to offer healthier options. Before this deal, Dr Pepper had been one of the slowest soda companies to begin to diversify its offerings. Soft drinks still accounted for about 80% of its annual revenue in 2016.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

899,PEP,"Sluggish sales of carbonated soft drinks or CSD has prompted innovations and re-branding in the beverage industry to regain sales momentum. Keeping that in mind, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will re-launch Diet Coke in North America with a ""full brand restage"" featuring new slim bottles and flavors. The four new flavors, which will hit the stores in mid-January, are Ginger Lime, Feisty Cherry, Twisted Mango, and Zesty Blood Orange.The company is “re-energizing and modernizing Diet Coke for a new generation of drinkers – and offering its millions of current fans a new look and more flavors.”Coca-Cola’s Endeavor to Diversify PortfolioCoca-Cola’s North American sparkling beverage business has been delivering sluggish results due to CSD category headwinds. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness — consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concern — are hurting demand for CSDs. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The company’s sparkling beverage unit case volume was flat in the third quarter and second quarter, and declined 1% in the first quarter of 2017. Sparkling beverage accounted for 72% of the company’s 2016 worldwide unit case volume. Hence, such vast exposure puts Coca-Cola in a weak spot.The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers — Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group  — leading to lower volumes and weak sales.Accordingly, Coca-Cola is trying to reinvigorate the category with significant innovations and re-branding. The cola giant is investing in newer revenue-generating platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.The latest move in this regard by Coca-Cola is the launch of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, replacing Coke Zero, in the United States in August 2017. Based on its success in Europe and Latin America, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar offering will address two key issues: help in giving a boost to the zero calorie portion of its portfolio, addressing potential sugar taxes; and the “diet downturn” that continues to weigh on traditional Diet CSDs. Coca-Cola also has plans of using Zero Sugar as an alternative to diet sodas.The company remains on track with its plans of broadening its portfolio to meet evolving consumer preferences by introducing more than 500 new products and also ""lifting and shifting"" existing brands into new markets.Shares of the company have gained 12.6% in the past one year, compared with the industry’s growth of 16.4%. Nonetheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's efforts toward offering more products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives to help fight revenue woes. The earnings estimates for 2018 have moved 2% north over the last 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

900,PEP,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) has been trying out product variations to drive carbonated soft drink sales as the product has been seeing declining demand owing to high calorie content. Recently, Mountain Dew, a product of PepsiCo, introduced MTN DEW ICE — a carbonated soft drink or CSD with a splash of real juice.The latest lemon-lime flavored carbonated soda with caffeine, with 100 calories per 12 ounces, is a marquee addition to the PepsiCo portfolio.PepsiCo’s Endeavor to Diversify PortfolioSales of PepsiCo’s carbonated beverages continue to be weak due to increasing health consciousness among consumers. Among CSDs, the cola segment has been particularly facing challenges, as consumers are opting for alternatives. The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers — Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  — leading to lower volumes and weak sales.PepsiCo’s carbonated beverage drink volumes declined 4% in the first nine months of 2017 in North America. Nonetheless, the company is leaving no stone unturned to reinvigorate investors’ confidence and regain its footing through innovation and diversification.The company regularly creates new flavors of existing products alongside maintaining a robust pipeline of products. The company has generated $5 billion in annual sales from new products since 2013. PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier products which contain nutrients such as grains, fruits, vegetables, or protein.  The company now generates a significant portion of its revenues from such products and also from beverages with less sugar and sodium content.In 2016, PepsiCo acquired a sparkling probiotic U.S. drinks company KeVita, diversify its soft drinks portfolio amid slowing soda sales. The addition of KeVita will expand PepsiCo’s health and wellness offerings in the premium chilled beverage space. The latest juice-based soft drink is expected to boost PepsiCo’s portfolio, enabling it to increase the number of nutritious and delicious products it offers.Stock Price MovementPepsiCo’s shares have gained 5.9% in the last three months, as compared with a 3.1% gain of its industry. Also, earnings estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company rose 0.5% for 2018 over the last 30 days. This signifies analyst optimism on the stock’s near-term performance. We expect the company's efforts toward offering more products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives to help fight revenue woes. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

901,PEP,"Shares of Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) gained 0.2% after reporting third quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.48, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43Mattel, Inc.’s (MAT  -  Free Report) shares surged 0.3% after the company announced Joseph Euteneuer as its new Chief Financial OfficerShares of Mylan N.V.

"
902,PEP,"We expect food/beverage giant PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 4, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.91%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.18%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that PepsiCo is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components. Zacks ESP: PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of +0.27%. The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.43 per share for PEP compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 per share. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: PepsiCo currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.The combination of PepsiCo’s favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?PepsiCo has delivered revenue growth in the past three quarters banking on significant innovation, continued momentum in Frito-Lay business, revenue management strategies, along with better market execution. Moreover, it has been witnessing higher volumes and profits in the North American segments due to an improving economy, better industry pricing dynamics and a consistency in positive innovation.Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company in 2017. Keeping this in mind, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier Everyday Nutrition Products and the company believes that such products will play an important role in the long-term growth.That said, consumer tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies.Again, adverse currency movements continued to negatively impact the company’s revenues. In fiscal second quarter, foreign currency headwinds had a 1.5% impact on the company’s revenue growth. PepsiCo expects currency headwinds to adversely impact revenues by approximately 2%. The company expects the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 to negatively impact reported net revenues in fiscal 2017 by 1%.Coming to the company’s margins, PepsiCo had indicated that as the commodity inflation is expected to continue in 2017, the company’s gross margin might face some pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.Notwithstanding the above-mentioned concerns, the company beat expectation in the last six quarters. PepsiCo delivered revenue growth in the last three quarters after successive declines in revenues in the previous nine quarters. We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $1.42, reflecting a 1.5% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.42 billion, implying a 2.4% growth. Stocks to ConsiderHere are some consumer staples stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.68% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Oct 25.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to report earnings results on Oct 24.Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.50% and a Zacks Rank #3.

903,PEP,"The U.S. equity market maintained a steady momentum, rebuffing geopolitical threats related to North Korean missile tests and deadly terrorist attacks in the home soil in Las Vegas. As investors reposed their faith in riskier bets like equities, courtesy of strengthening dollar and sell-off in global bond markets, ‘cash cow’ stocks that offer higher returns have been sought after.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Dallas, TX, Texas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 8.4% and long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.6%. Texas Instruments carries a Zacks Rank #2.Applied Materials, Inc.

905,PEP,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), with 32 nations set to compete in a 64-match tournament over the next month. Billions of people from over 200 countries are expected to watch, which means, for many, the stars are likely the main attraction. And there are few more well-known and revered athletes—or people—in the world than Lionel Messi. This means the Argentinian superstar makes a lot of money off the field, so let’s take a look at how to invest in one of soccer’s biggest stars.The World Cup is a big-budget marketing dream, attracting the likes of Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), and many more to spend millions of dollars to promote and attach their brands to FIFA. Meanwhile, Messi himself is linked to one of the World Cup’s biggest partners and other powerhouse companies.Sponsors Messi made his debut for FC Barcelona—one of the richest and most famous clubs in the world—in 2004. The 5-foot-7 inch soccer giant made his first appearance for Argentina in 2005 and played in his first World Cup the following year in Germany. Since then, he has transformed into one of the best soccer players ever and a major brand ambassador. The German sportswear powerhouse Adidas signed Messi to a contract in 2006. Today, he is one of the faces of the brand and signed a “lifetime” deal with Adidas last year—similar to Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) deal with LeBron James. Messi’s Adidas deal helps contribute to the $27 million in sponsorship money he made over the last year. These off-the-field earnings lifted Messi’s overall earnings to $111 million—boosted by his massive new Barcelona contract—landing him second on Forbes’ list of the world’s highest-paid athletes.Messi is an Adidas man, but he also generates millions of dollars for rival Nike because Barcelona is sponsored by the Oregon-based company. In fact, Messi reportedly generated $111 million in value for Nike over the past 12 months through social media—with rival and Nike star Cristiano Ronaldo doing the same thing for Adidas since his club side, Real Madrid, is sponsored by Adidas. A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) on May 30, 2018 at 12:02pm PDTCleary, investors will note just how impactful one of Messi’s sponsored Adidas posts can be on Instagram, where he boasts 93 million followers—among the most on the platform. He also has over 88 million Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) followers, and his own dedicated YouTube (GOOGL  -  Free Report) page—he notably does not have a Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) account.His social media reach helped him land the number three spot on ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) World Fame 100 list, behind only Ronaldo and James. This is also part of the reason why he is a valuable partner to a slew of other companies aside from Adidas.The 30-year-old is also a pitchman for Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), through Gatorade, Lays, and Pepsi, as well as wireless company Ooredoo, and many more. So now let’s take a look to see how the companies Messi is directly involved with have performed since the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, where Messi and Argentina lost in the final to Germany. Clearly, Adidas stock has surged over the last four years. Meanwhile, Mastercard stock is up big since the last World Cup, while Pepsi has trailed the S&P 500, as consumers’ eating and drinking habits rapidly shift.Messi is one of a few players who is able to have an outsized impact on his team and his brand partners.In Russia, Argentina is once again one of the favorites to win the World Cup. So make sure to come back to Zacks for more World Cup business updates and to see what impact Messi might have on Fox’s and Telemundo’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) coverage.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

906,PEP,"In line with its strategy to invest in newer revenue generating platforms, The Coca-Cola Co.’s (KO  -  Free Report) affiliate in Chile and local bottlers of the brand entered into an agreement to buy Comercializadora Novaverde SA. The company specializes in juices, canned fruits and vegetables, mainly under the brand Guallarauco.Details of the DealEmbotelladora Andina, Embonor, Coca-Cola del Valle New Ventures, and Coca-Cola de Chile entered into a stock purchase agreement under which 100% ownership of Comercializadora Novaverde shares will be transferred.On completion of the deal, while Coca-Cola del Valle New Ventures will own 2,999,994 shares, Coca-Cola de Chile and Embotelladora Andina will own three and two shares, respectively. Embonor will gain the ownership of one share. Embotelladora Andina’s direct and indirect ownership in Novaverde will be approximately 35%, as it is already a shareholder of Coca-Cola del Valle New Ventures.The deal is valued at $80 million, according to a Reuters report.Can Diversification Counter Weak Sales?Sales of Coca-Cola’s carbonated beverages continue to remain weak due to increasing health consciousness among consumers. The cola segment has been particularly facing challenges, as consumers are opting for alternatives. Also, fresh taxes levied on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting carbonated soft drinks or CSD sales.The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers — Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  — leading to lower volumes and weak sales.Although Coca-Cola has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost carbonated beverage business, the efforts are yet to result in any meaningful improvement. Sparkling beverage unit case volume declined 1% in the first quarter of 2017. The same remained flat both in the second and the third quarter.Coca-Cola therefore is investing in newer revenue generating platforms to boost long-term sales and profits. The beverage giant made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the acquisition of Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States in the third quarter of 2017. Also, in March 2017, Coca-Cola and its largest Latin American bottler Coca-Cola Femsa SAB closed the proposed acquisition of AdeS soy-based beverage business from consumer products giant Unilever Plc (UL  -  Free Report).The Novaverde takeover is expected to boost Coca-Cola’s portfolio in Chile enabling it to increase the number of nutritious and delicious products it offers.We believe the company’s efforts to offer diversified products to cash in on the shifting consumer preference toward healthier products will bode well in the years to come.Shares of the company have gained 11.5% over a year, compared with the industry’s growth of 16.4%. However, the earnings estimates for 2018 have moved north over the last 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism. Earnings estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock inched up 0.5% for 2018.

907,PEP,"This year has been a big year for the stock market, with many notable indexes soaring to new highs. But 2017 was important for more than just share price performance—it also marked another year where the number of women leading Fortune 500 companies jumped as well.The percentage of women heading Fortune 500 companies hit an all-time high in 2017. As of this summer, when Fortune released its 2017 Fortune 500 list, 32 of the CEOs were women, up from just 21 last year.That number still only accounts for 6.4% of the total, but it proved to be the highest in the history of the list. The number of female-led companies on the Standard & Poor's 500 index is smaller by comparison, with only 26 women—or 5.2%—holding their company’s top position. This figure is based on a list compiled by the nonprofit group Catalyst. The firm also noted that women hold 21% of S&P 500 board seats.Those numbers indicate that there is still plenty of progress to be made, but female CEOs did lead some of the biggest and most well-known companies, in a range of industries, in 2017.This list includes the likes of aerospace and defense power General Dynamics’ (GD  -  Free Report) Phebe Novakovic, as well as industry competitor Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).In the retail sector, Barbara Rentler has helped the discount department store firm Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) stock hit a new all-time high this year, making her one of several women leading their companies to new heights.Let’s take a closer look at more of those leaders:Mary Barra,General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) General Motors’ Chairman and CEO Mary Barra has served as the auto giant’s chief executive since January 2014. Since taking over the role as CEO, Barra has helped push GM towards the future with a focus on connected vehicles and electric car technology. On top of that, Barra began to focus some of GM’s energy on autonomous vehicle technology.Shares of GM are up 21.96% in 2017, and the company rests close to its five-year high, which it reached earlier this year. GM has beat or matched earnings expectations in the trailing 10 quarters and nearly every quarter since Barra became CEO.Tricia Griffith, The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) Tricia Griffith took over as president and chief executive officer of the insurance giant in July 2016. Since taking on the leading role at Progressive, Griffith began to bolster the company’s offerings. Previously, the company only really offered automotive coverage, but now Progressive has entered the $300 billion home insurance market—where they offer customers the chance to bundle home and auto.Griffith helped roll out the company’s HomeQuote Explorer tool. “Normally, homeowner quotes are a nightmare,” Griffith told Fortune. “They take a long time. This is something that we will buy, any publicly available data. You fill in a couple of fields and you get a home quote from four companies. Really easy.”Shares of Progressive are up over 57% on the year, and just hit a new 52-week and all-time high of $56.28 per share on Wednesday.Indra Nooyi,Pepsico, Inc.

908,PEP,"The soft drinks industry has been facing the brunt of changing consumer preferences for quite some time now. Consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concerns. Also, possible new taxes levied on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressure are affecting Carbonated Soft Drink (CSD) sales. The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers, leading to lower volumes and weak sales.Changing demographics and purchasing behavior make it imperative for the beverage industry giants to reshape their product portfolio. Also, capitalizing on the growing health awareness among consumers can prove beneficial for beverage companies.In line with this, PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) has been broadening its beverage portfolio to include non-carbonated beverages to reduce the dependence on colas. Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) are also trying to reinvigorate its CSD category by coming up with healthier yet tastier alternatives.Recently, PepsiCo reported third-quarter core earnings per share of $1.48, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2%. Core earnings grew 6% year over year, mainly on improved operating efficiency. In constant currency terms, adjusted earnings grew 7%. Total sales improved 1.3% year over year to $16.24 billion. Although foreign exchange hurt revenue growth by 1%, pricing had a positive impact of 3%.Currently, the Zacks Soft Drinks Industry (part of the broader Consumer Staples sector) ranks among the top 41% signifying that stocks in this space is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Notably, total earnings for the broader Consumer Staples sector( are expected to increase 1.8% in Q3 compared with 5.2% in the preceding quarter. Revenues are also expected to improve 1.8% (1.2% growth in Q2).Let us take a look at how the following soft drinks companies are placed ahead of their third-quarter release on Oct 25.Coca-Cola’s third-quarter revenues/profits will likely decrease owing to structural changes and currency headwinds. We feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to drive the bottom line. The refranchising efforts, which are hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and improved return on invested capital over the long term by reducing exposure to the low-margin bottling operations.The company expects third-quarter revenues to decline 19-20% owing to acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items. The company also expects currency headwinds to hurt quarterly net revenues by 1-2%.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 49 cents, reflecting a 0.7% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $8.84 billion, implying a 16.9% decline.Nevertheless, our proven model hints at an earnings beat for this company this quarter, as Coca-Cola has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP (+0.17) and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read more: Weak Sales Likely to Dampen Coca-Cola's (KO  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings).Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteDr Pepper expects the default by a resin supplier to its operations in Mexico to affect its 2017 operating income by approximately $7-$9 million or 3 cents per share, the impact of which will be felt more in the third quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.15, reflecting a decline of 1.8% year over year.Apart from the default, the hurricanes in the United States and the earthquake in Mexico impacted Dr Pepper’s operations.Also, sluggish carbonated beverages (comprise around 82% of its business) volume trends are hurting carbonated beverages (CSD) category growth for quite some time now. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSD volume growth is projected at a meager 0.02% for the third quarter, less than 3% growth reported last quarter and 2% in the prior-year quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively hint at an earnings beat for this company this quarter, as Dr Pepper does not have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 or higher. The Earnings ESP for Dr Pepper is -0.10% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 which further lowers the possibility of an earnings surprise.(Read more: Will Resin Supply Default Hurt Dr Pepper’s  Q3 Earnings?).Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc QuoteToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

909,PEP,"The Q3 earnings season is off to a slow start and is likely to pick up pace with more releases flowing in. Although earnings growth is trending lower than in comparable periods, expectations are high that the current quarter will likely continue with the healthy growth momentum of the past few quarters.     As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screen:Monsanto Company : Missouri-based Monsanto is a leading global provider of agricultural products. The company has a stellar trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 244.8% and long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.1%. Monsanto carries a Zacks Rank #2.CBRE Group, Inc. : Headquartered in Los Angeles, CBRE Group is a commercial real estate services and investment firm, offering a wide range of services to tenants, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multi-family and other types of commercial real estates in all major metropolitan areas across the globe.

910,PEP,"As is typical for the first Wednesday in each month, a National Employment Report from national paycheck cutter Automated Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) revealed a negative impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in September hiring trends. A total of 135K new private-sector jobs is the lowest since the glaringly low 62K in October 2016, and well under the trailing-12-month average of 218K per.Small businesses, especially those with under 20 employees, were the hardest hit in September — think Mom & Pop gas stations, for instance — losing 7000 jobs last month, 11K for just those smallest companies. For the second month in a row, the U.S.’s largest firms have tallied the highest number of new jobs: 79K. Medium-sized companies (50-499 employees) brought in 63K last month.The Goods/Services mix was a little closer than usual: Goods-producing firms saw gains of 48K new private-sector employment, and Services grew by 88K. Typically, Services job growth is at an even greater than 2-to-1 ratio month by month. This would suggest small-company services employment has been most affected by the dual hurricane onslaught in Southeastern Texas and the Florida Gulf Coast in September.To tie this up with a nice, tidy bow, Moody’s Chief Economist Mark Zandi added credibility to the labor market having been hit by two of the biggest natural disasters in U.S. history. “Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hurt the job market in September,” Zandi is quoted as saying this morning. “Looking through the storms the job market remains sturdy and strong."" So that’s the good news — though the loss of humanity is devastating for many as a result of Harvey and Irma, we may chalk them up to a one-time event affecting September (and, by extension, Q3 overall) but nothing necessarily beyond this.We will focus our attention on the all-encompassing non-farm payroll report due out Friday morning, ahead of the opening bell. Prior to ADP’s 135K total this morning, analysts had been predicting roughly 156K new jobs gains for non-farm payrolls in the month of September, or about the same as was reported for the month of August. Again, these represent a dip below a trailing-12-month average, but most economists aren’t sweating this, as hurricane-related issues look to have been the culprit.Pepsi Beats on Earnings, Revenues MissQ3 earnings season continues its slow trickle this week, with snacks and refreshment giant PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) posting mixed results in its quarterly earnings report. Earnings of $1.48 per share beat the Sacks consensus by 6 cents, up 4.2% year over year. Quarterly sales, however, posted $16.24 billion, a 1.3% increase year over year but beneath the $16.42 billion expected.Guidance from Pepsi was also mixed: where EPS guidance was raised 10 cents to $5.23 per share, but full-year organic revenue growth is only expected to rise 2.3% — lower than the 3% previously predicted. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s stock is trading down more than 1% in today’s pre-market; PEP is up year to date, but down over the past month and trailing 6 months.

912,PEP,"The Q2 earnings season has picked up pace, with 97 companies in the S&P 500 cohort having released their quarterly numbers. According to the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating earnings estimates and 72.2% surpassing revenue estimates.Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +8.6% from the same period last year on a 4.7% revenue improvement. Coming to the Consumer Staples sector, earnings are expected to increase 3.1% in Q2 compared with 4.7% in the previous quarter. Revenues are expected to rise 1.2%, lower than 3% recorded in the last quarter.The Food industry, within the Consumer Staples sector, has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience food items are gradually losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness is hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) to boost sales. Nonetheless, effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives might prove beneficial for the food industry at large.Coming to the Beverage (soft drinks) industry within the Consumer Staples sector, persistent decline in carbonated soft drinks or CSDs and impressive growth in noncarbonated beverages are raising concerns for established players like PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report).  Cola companies are gradually reshuffling their portfolio toward healthier options to counter the tepid sales and volumes environment.Given this backdrop, let’s try to determine how these players – The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) – are placed ahead of their second-quarter earnings releases before the opening bell on Jul 26.Hershey, the largest North American manufacturer of quality chocolate and confectionery products, reported a positive 3.97% earnings surprise in the last quarter. Also, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.65%.Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of -3.30% as the Most Accurate estimate is 88 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 91 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Hershey Company (The) QuoteAlso, Hershey carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Our proven model does not show an earnings beat for this company this quarter as a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Notably, Hershey has been delivering weak performance in international markets since 2015, primarily due to soft results in China. In fact, China chocolate category sales in the first quarter was flat and also below the market level. The company had earlier expressed that considering the timing of Easter and the projected decline in China sales, second-quarter net sales growth is expected to lag the full-year growth rate (read more: Hershey Q2 Earnings: Disappointment in the Cards?)For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 91 cents, reflecting an increase of 6.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $1.65 billion, implying 0.9% year-over-year growth.Soft drink giant, Coca-Cola posted a negative earnings surprise of 2.27% in the last quarter. However, the company managed to surpass earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 1.51%. Per our model, the company is likely to disappoint this earnings season as it has an Earnings ESP of -1.72% and a Zacks #3.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteThe company’s net revenue is also expected to face a 17–18% negative impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items.

913,PEP,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) kicked off 2018 on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts in the first quarter. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Coca-Cola’s shares have rallied 1.6% in the pre-trading session following the earnings release.Earnings BeatFirst-quarter 2018 comparable earnings of the company were 47 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents.Earnings also improved 8% from the year-ago profit level of 43 cents, helped by ongoing productivity efforts.Sales BeatRevenues of $7.63 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.43 billion. However, net revenues declined 16% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items, marking the 12th consecutive quarterly fall. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had 26% negative impact on revenues. The structural changes primarily include the impact of bottler refranchising efforts.Organic revenues grew 5% in the quarter, aided by concentrate sales improvement of 4% and price/mix growth of 1%. Currency also impacted revenues positively by 2%.Volume and PricingCoca-Cola’s total unit case volume grew 3% in the quarter versus flat growth in the preceding quarter.Category Cluster Performance: Sparkling beverage unit case volume increased 4% (versus no growth in the prior quarter). Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages witnessed 3% decline (versus 2% growth in the preceding quarter). Water, enhanced water and sports drinks were up 1% (versus 2% in Q4), and Tea and Coffee were up 5% (compared with 2% growth in Q4).Notably, Diet Coke’s North America volume grew in the quarter following a full brand revamp. The introduction of four bold, new flavors, along with contemporary, sleek packaging and innovative marketing, helped in the upside.Quarterly Segment DetailsRevenues grew 11% at North America, 13% at Europe, the Middle East & Africa, and 8% at Latin America segment. However, revenues at Asia Pacific segment increased modestly by 1%.Organic revenues grew across the board, increasing 1% in North America, 8% in Europe, Middle East & Africa, 6% in Latin America, 3% in Asia Pacific and 13% in Bottling Investments.MarginsComparable gross margin expanded 270 basis points (bps) year over year to 64%. The company’s comparable operating margin grew 600 bps to 30.7% in the quarter, given the divestitures of lower-margin bottling businesses and ongoing productivity efforts. The upside was partly offset by the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.2018 Guidance ReaffirmedOrganic revenues are expected to rise 4%. Acquisitions/divestitures (mainly the bottler re-franchising efforts) are expected to hurt revenues by 17%, while Fx is likely to have a positive impact of 1% on revenues. Again, revenues will be positively impacted by 1-2% from Accounting Standards Update 2014-09.Comparable currency income before income taxes (structurally adjusted) is expected to increase 8-9%. Foreign exchange is expected to hurt comparable income before taxes by 0-1%. Structural changes are likely to have a 2% negative impact on it.The company expects adjusted EPS to grow 8-10% from the prior -year’s comparable EPS of $1.91.The company expects to buy back shares worth $1 billion in 2018. The adjusted effective tax rate is likely to be 21%. Cash from operations is likely to be at least $8.5 billion.Zacks RankCoca-Cola has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

914,PEP,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into BodyArmor as the sports drink newcomer looks to take on Gatorade. Next, we discuss the NBA’s latest deal with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch, before we close with a look at a deal that could impact Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) brand new ESPN+ streaming service.BodyArmor—which has no relation to Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report)—is ready to take on PepsiCo’s (PEP  -  Free Report) Gatorade and Coca-Cola’s (KO  -  Free Report) Powerade in the multibillion-dollar sports drink market. Those unfamiliar with BodyArmor might soon see the company a lot more after it launched its latest national television campaign, which features some big stars, including James Harden.The company could also get a real boost from one of its largest investors, Kobe Bryant, who also happens to play a big role in BodyArmor’s creative vision. BodyArmor has a long way to go to try to catch up to Powerade and Gatorade, but the drink market is going through a massive shake-up recently. And with Dr Pepper Snapple Group  as another major investor, BodyArmor could be poised to become a legitimate long-term player in the sports drink market.Full-Court Finance then transitions into the NBA’s latest streaming rights deal with Twitch for its brand new esports league, which the NBA created in partnership with Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report). The NBA has been on the cutting edge of a lot of media trends, and its growing relationship with Amazon could end up playing a much bigger role as streaming TV providers, from Hulu to YouTube TV (GOOGL  -  Free Report), slowly look to enter the live sports business.We then close with a look at a possible partnership between ESPN and Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). The two companies reportedly proposed to split a UFC TV package last week that, if completed, would see some UFC fights move to Disney’s brand new ESPN+ streaming service (also read: Should Disney Investors Worry As ESPN Plus Underwhelms?).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

915,PEP,"We are in the thick of the Q1 earnings season, with results seemingly on solid ground given impressive top and bottom-line growth rates. Notably, the above-average proportion of positive earnings surprises is quite palpable.According to our latest Earnings Preview, results of 87 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 20, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members are up 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. Of these, 82.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 67.8% beat revenue expectations.A Look at the Soft Drink IndustrySluggish CSD (carbonated soft drinks) volumes are the pressing concerns for the soft drinks giants, PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) as well as other non-alcoholic beverage companies. Sales for both the beverage giants have remained subdued in the recent quarters.PepsiCo’s shares have dipped approximately 10.5% in the past year while that of Coca-Cola’s gained 0.9%, against the industry’s 1% decline.However, the two behemoths have vowed to find ways of diversifying their portfolio beyond carbonated soft drinks and revamping existing product lines.Let’s have a sneak peek at the two major soft drink stocks scheduled to report earnings this week, to find out how things are shaping up before the announcement.Coca-Cola is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, 2018 before the opening bell.The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last 11 quarters, primarily due to structural changes and weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category.Last quarter, Coca-Cola’s revenues declined 20% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items. Organically, revenues increased 6%. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 26% impact on revenues. This time again, the company expects the same degree of adverse impact on net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items. Moreover, the first quarter will have one less day than the same period last year. However, the company expects currency to have a positive impact on quarterly net revenues by 2%. Again, revenues will be positively impacted by 1% from Accounting Standards Update 2014-09.Precisely, revenues of the company’s North America segment, comprising about 30% of its top line, are expected to witness growth in the first quarter. Last quarter, the North America segmental revenues totaled $2.62 billion last quarter, increasing 6% year over year on 2% growth in price/mix. Organically, revenues rose 3% in the quarter while unit case volume grew 1%. Price/mix increased on the company’s disciplined approach to occasion, brand, price and package strategy, as well as positive business and category mix.Though Coca-Cola has increased its marketing investments, and is driving package and product innovations to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts are yet to show meaningful results with the trend unlikely to change in the first quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate called for Coca-Cola’s North American segmental revenues of $2.49 billion, reflecting an increase from $2.39 billion a year ago but a decline from $2.62 billion in the prior quarter.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s first-quarter revenues are likely to decline on structural changes. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $7.43 billion, implying an 18.6% year-over-year decline.That said, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line of the company to some extent. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 46 cents a share, reflecting an increase of 7% year over year.Meanwhile, our proven model hints at an earnings beat for the company this quarter, as Coca-Cola has an Earnings ESP of +0.24% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company’s CSD volumes declined 5% in 2017 in the North America Beverages (NAB) business.Notably, results of NAB segment — comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada — remained soft in the last reported quarter. Results were negatively impacted by higher input costs, operating cost inflation and restructuring charges that substantially offset productivity gains. Moreover, the 53rd reporting week in the prior year and hurricane-related costs also added to the woes. Organic sales and beverage volumes were down 3% and 2%, respectively, in the quarter.That said, the company is speeding up its innovation and investments toward e-commerce, R&D and social/digital marketing/design to enhance its top line. PepsiCo has delivered organic revenue growth in the past four quarters, banking on significant innovation, revenue management strategies, along with better market execution. The company’s total organic revenue growth was modest at 2.3% last quarter, driven by 2% pricing on 2% volume growth in food/snacks, offset by a 2% volume decline in beverages. However, its total revenues remained unchanged from the year-ago level.Apart from revenues, commodity inflation is expected to create pressure on PepsiCo’s gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. That said, its productivity programs will likely support its core operating margin expansion to some extent.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings of 92 cents implies a year-over-year decline of 2.1%. The same for revenues is pegged at $12.41 billion, 3% higher than the prior-year quarter figure.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show that PepsiCo is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

Reported revenues came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.42 billion by 1.1%.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 1.7% on an organic basis, primarily driven by higher demand for beverages/food/snacks in the Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA) and Latin America segments. Notably, organic sales growth was softer than the 3.1% rise recorded in the previous quarter.Total volumes declined 1% during the quarter against flat growth in the previous quarter.

918,PEP,"Q3 earnings season won't really heat up for another few weeks, but we've already begun to see the first trickle of reports—and several key companies will release reports in the upcoming week.According to the most recent available data, total Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to gain about 3.2% year-over-year, with revenues gaining about 5%. Overall estimates have gone down throughout the quarter, but the number of negative revisions compares favorably to other recent quarters.For more on what investors should expect from Q3 earnings, check out our exclusive Earnings Trends report. This full report includes a plethora of key historical results, as well as estimates for the current and upcoming periods.As earnings season gets underway, investors should also remember that they can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of October 2.1. PepsiCo ((PEP  -  Free Report))Food and beverage behemoth PepsiCo is scheduled to announce its third-quarter financial results before the market opens on October 4. PepsiCo basically always surpasses earnings estimates, but the stock has slumped recently and is now up just above 7% year-to-date. Growing health awareness has hurt sales in the CSD category, so it will be interesting to see the company's segment results this quarter.Currently, PEP has a positive Earnings ESP of 2.03%, which implies that analyst sentiment has improved recently. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $1.42 per share and revenues of $16.42 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 1.5% and 2.4%, respectively. 2. Yum China Holdings ((YUMC  -  Free Report))Yum China Holdings, a licensee of Yum! Brands (YUM) restaurants in mainland China, will report its third-quarter earnings results after the market closes on October 5. Shares of Yum China have skyrocketed more than 50% this year, and the stock's “A” grade in the Growth category of our Style Scores system underscores its expansion story.Nevertheless, things are looking a little more challenging heading into the Q3 report. YUMC is currently sporting a negative Earnings ESP of 1.82%, which indicates that analyst sentiment has softened as we approach the report date. Based on current consensus estimates, we expect to see the company post earnings of 55 cents per share and revenues of $1.98 billion. 3. Costco (COST)Merchandise wholesaler and grocery giant Costco is set to announce its fiscal fourth quarter earnings results after the closing bell on October 5. Costco releases monthly sales results during the quarter, so we already know that August marked 10% revenue growth, so investors will hope that the company was able to continue that trend in September. Shares of COST have popped more than 7% over the past month.Heading into the report, Costco is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). However, its slightly negative Earnings ESP reduces the predictive power of this formula. Still, our current consensus estimates are calling for earnings growth of 13.8% and sales growth of 14.2%. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

919,PEP,"An increasing number of Americans are becoming health conscious. This has resulted in steady growth in sales volume of bottled water, making it the number one preferred beverage in the United States in 2017, according to a recent release from International Bottled Water Association (""IBWA"") and Beverage Market Corporation (""BMC"").Understandably, Americans are refraining from carbonated and sugary drinks. According to analysts, the bottled water market is expected to grow further in the days to come. This has made carbonated soft drink (CSD) manufacturers shift focus toward bottled water and other healthier options.Bottled Water Becomes the Number One BeverageBottled water has become the highest selling beverage in the United States for two years in a row. According to IBWA and BMC, bottled water volumes escalated to 13.7 billion in 2017, reflecting a 7% year-over-year increase. Bottled water sales came in at $18.5 billion, increasing 8.8% year over year.Per capita consumption of bottled water exceeded 42 gallons, increasing 6.2% over the same time period. It goes without saying that the gap between carbonated drinks and bottled water is fast widening.Bottled Water Market to GrowThe sparkling water category grew 70% between 2011 and 2016 and is expected to touch $3.1 billion by 2022, according to Euromonitor. Per BMC, per capita consumption of bottled water will cross 50 gallons in the next few years. Interestingly, all segments under the bottled water category witnessed robust growth in 2017. Domestic sparkling water surged 27.5%, while domestic non-sparkling and imported water jumped 5.5% and 9.2%, respectively.Moreover, according to IBWA, three out of five Americans prefer bottled water to any other beverage. Also, according to a recent Nielsen data, sales of bottled water, flavored water and energy drinks have jumped in the four weeks to May 19. During this period, PepsiCo’s share of sparkling water category grew 4.7%, up from 0.6% growth in January. Also, Dr Pepper Snapple’s shelf-stable juices and drinks witnessed sales growth of 13.1%.Industry Shifts Focus Toward Bottled Water, Healthier OptionsAccording to Nielsen’s latest data, sales growth of energy drinks, still flavored water, sparkling flavored water and bottled water grew 7%, 10.9% and 17.7% and 7.1%, respectively, in the four weeks to May 19, on a year-over-year basis.Given that more Americans prefer bottled water to other soft carbonated beverages, CSD manufacturers like the Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), Nestle S.A. (NSRGY  -  Free Report), Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V (FMX  -  Free Report) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) too are redesigning their portfolio along these lines. Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Coca-Cola recently introduced a range of flavors in smaller packages to its diet coke brand to attract new-generation drinkers. Moreover, the company has promised to reduce the sugar-level in most of its products. It has also introduced Coke Zero Sugar, revamping its Coke Zero. The company also acquired the U.S. rights of Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water brand in October 2017. In February, Pepsico launched its new sparkling water line Bubly. A few months ago, Nestle announced that it will be rebranding its Nestle Waters’ Regional Spring Water Sparkling portfolio. The new portfolio will comprise 10 new flavors, design changes in bottles and a new can format.Bottom LineUndoubtedly, Americans’ growing health-consciousness has led to a surge in sales volume of bottled water and other healthier beverages. Moreover, the bottled water market is poised to grow further in over the next few years. This has made beverage companies reorient their business strategy and redesign their portfolio with increased focus on bottled water.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

920,PEP,"Consumer staple companies came under pressure on Jun 5, after Mexico announced retaliatory tariffs on goods imported from the United States. The heat was primarily felt by packaged foods companies, as fears of a trade war fail to subside. Consumer staples have been suffering for a long time now with changing tastes and preferences of consumers and increased competition from online retail giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).In fact, the consumer staples sector fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, registering its worst performance since 1990. Trade war fears have added to the sector’s woes, as consumer staples continue to take a beating with retaliatory tariffs being imposed by the United States’ trade allies. That said, it needs to be seen how consumer staple companies fight back in the days to come.Mexico Tariffs Hit Consumer Staple Stocks The United States’ decision to impose 25% and 10% tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum followed by tariffs of another $60 billion saw China come up with retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of U.S. products that primarily hit the consumer staples sector.Moreover, the United States last week imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the European Union (EU), Mexico and Canada. On Jun 5, Mexico announced that it will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products including pork, bourbon and some types of cheeses.This saw consumer staples stocks, in particular packaged food companies, taking a hit. Shares of Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) slid 2% and 1.8%, respectively. Also, shares of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  declined 0.1% each.Understandably, packaged food companies have reasons to worry with Mexico, one of United States’ biggest trade allies, now imposing retaliatory tariffs.Consumer Staples Suffer Longest DeclineConsumer staples stocks have been suffering for quite some time now, with the sector entering the longest monthly losing streak since November 2016. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples index declined 1.7% in May, registering its straight monthly fall. On a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 Consumer Staples index has declined 13.3%.Moreover, of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) was the second-worst performer in first-quarter 2018. The consumer staples sector didn’t have a good start to 2018, after having registered gains of more than 130% over a period of nine years. The sector has been under pressure owing to rising competition from online retailers and at the same time has been affected by rising commodity prices and transportation costs, and declining brand value.Packaged Food, Beverage, Tobacco Companies SufferChanging customer preference and inclination toward healthier options have seen a number of beverage, packaged foods and tobacco companies suffer. Year to date, shares of PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) have declined 15.1% and 5.3%, respectively. Similarly, shares of B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) have declined 20.3% and 18.4%, respectively, over the same time period.Tobacco companies too have been suffering with slower-than-expected adoption of alternate tobacco products in some markets and at the same time health-conscious people looking for healthier options. Shares of tobacco giants like Turning Point Brands, Inc. (TPB  -  Free Report) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) have declined 0.6% and 25.8%, respectively. Turning Point Brands carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bottom LineConsumer staples stocks have been considered a defensive bet, mainly because of its predictable growth rate and high dividends. However, a number of factors including changing consumer preference, declining brand value and stiff competition from online retailers are acting as tailwinds. Moreover, trade war fears have added to the woes, with countries like Mexico and China imposing tariffs on imported goods from the United States.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

921,PEP,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.77%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 4.05%.Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for Q1Sluggish CSD (carbonated soft drinks) volumes are the pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as other non-alcoholic beverage companies. PepsiCo’s CSD volumes declined 5% in 2017 in the North America Beverages business.Consumer taste is rapidly shifting from CSDs to non-carbonated beverages. Keeping this in mind, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier alternatives. To this end, the company has stepped up its innovation efforts and investments toward e-commerce, R&D and social/digital marketing/design for enhancing its top line.PepsiCo has delivered organic revenue growth in the past four quarters, banking on significant innovation, revenue management strategies, along with better market execution.If we look back at PepsiCo’s Q4 performance, the company’s total organic revenue growth was modest at 2.3%, driven by 2% pricing on 2% volume growth in food/snacks, offset by a 2% volume decline in beverages. However, its total revenues remained unchanged from the year-ago level.Notably, results of North America Beverages (NAB) segment — comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada — remained soft in Q4. The company’s NAB segment was negatively impacted by higher input costs, operating cost inflation and restructuring charges that substantially offset productivity gains. Moreover, the 53rd reporting week in the prior year and hurricane-related costs also added to the woes. Organic sales and beverage volumes were down 3% and 2%, respectively, in the quarter.Segment DiscussionNorth America Beverages or NAB business (which includes beverage businesses in the United States and Canada) accounts for about 33% of PepsiCo’s total revenues. Revenues at the segment declined 6% in the fourth quarter, 3% in the third quarter and remained unchanged in the first two quarters of 2017. The trend is unlikely to reverse in the to-be-reported quarter as well. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NAB segment revenues is pegged at $4.39 billion, implying a decline from $$5.9 billion in Q4 and $4.46 billion in the year-ago quarter.For Frito-Lay North America or FLNA business (accounting for 25% of revenues), the company had a good balance of volume growth, net price realization and operating margin expansion. However, the segment’s revenues decreased 1% last quarter but increased 2% in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.64 billion, implying a decline from $4.83 billion in the prior quarter but an increase from $3.5 billion in the year-ago period.Quaker Foods North America segment revenues decreased 5% in the fourth quarter and 2% in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $605 million versus $774 million in the fourth quarter and $598 million in the first quarter of 2017.Europe Sub-Saharan Africa segment revenues grew 11% in the fourth quarter and 8% in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $1.6 billion, implying an increase from $1.4 billion in the prior-year period but a decrease from $3.7 billion last quarter.Latin America segment revenues grew 6% in the prior quarter as well as 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $1.1 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2017 and $$2.4 billion in the fourth quarter.Asia, Middle East and North Africa segment revenues remained unchanged year over year in the fourth quarter but decreased 5% in 2017. The segment’s revenues are likely to improve to $1 billion in the first quarter of 2018 from $970 million registered in the year-ago period, per the consensus estimate. However, it is likely to decline from $1.9 billion in the prior quarter.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PepsiCo’s total revenues stands at $12.4 billion, implying a 3% year-over-year increase.Other Factors to Influence PepsiCo’s First-Quarter Performance:Coming to the company’s margins, PepsiCo had earlier indicated that as commodity inflation is expected to continue in 2018, the company’s gross margin might face some pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.Notwithstanding the above-mentioned concerns, the company beat expectations in the last eight quarters. The company’s productivity programs will likely support its core operating margin expansion. PepsiCo’s productivity programs are on track to achieve annual $1 billion target.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 92 cents, reflecting a 2.1% year-over-year decrease.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:PepsiCo does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of -0.97%.Zacks Rank: PepsiCo carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

922,PEP,"Shares of Shopify (SHOP  -  Free Report) surged to a new all-time on Monday. But with no breaking news to speak of, it might be time to take a look at what exactly the young Canadian company does that has investors hopping on board.Shopify has been able to fly under the radar as a growing e-commerce power, with a market cap of over $11.6 billion, because its presence and growing ubiquity is not easily known to online shoppers. In early August, Shopify announced that its cloud-based platform now helps run e-commerce sites for over 500,000 merchants.The Ottawa, Ontario-headquartered firm, which began as a company that sold snowboard equipment online, now helps small and medium-size businesses start and run a sales-based website without any coding or technical computer skills.The company’s 2016 revenues jumped over 100% year-over-year to $390 million, and Shopify reported $151.7 million in second-quarter sales in 2017, which marked a 75% increase.The e-commerce company now projects full-year 2017 revenues in the range of $642 million to $648 million. Shopify also narrowed its GAAP operating loss guidance to between $62 million and $66 million.So What Is Shopify Doing?Shopify recently partnered with online entertainment and news outlet giant BuzzFeed. The new channel allows Shopify companies and merchants to gain easy exposure on BuzzFeed.The idea is to give BuzzFeed editors the ability to easily search for companies or products that they then can produce content about, in order to help the e-commerce merchants boost sales. Shopify’s clients simply pay a commission to BuzzFeed if it is determined that a sale was made based on a post.Furthermore, Visa (V  -  Free Report), Frito-Lay (PEP  -  Free Report), Canadian Tire , and theNew York Times all launched stores on Shopify last quarter. Big-time celebrities who are extremely popular among Millennials—including Drake, Kanye West, and Kylie Jenner—all use Shopify to sell products.The company also recently introduced its first in-house designed hardware. Shopify merchants that have a brick-and-mortar store, or sell products at physical locations, can purchase the company’s new credit card processor called the “Chip & Swipe Reader.” The hope is to give merchants the ability to adapt in the ever-changing retail environment by offering this essential piece of fintech.On top of that, Shopify now offers clients more robust data about everything from users to financials. Merchants are able to view a plethora of sales and customer data, for both online and in-person sales, in one online dashboard.The platform can help small businesses answer big questions, such as where their website traffic is coming from, top performing sales days and products, and more. Shopify’s hope is to give its customers the ability to take action based on a variety of metrics.Bottom Line Shopify makes e-commerce easier for small and medium size businesses, at a time when online shopping and searching has become almost paramount to success. Similar to WordPress, which reportedly helps power almost 25% of websites on the internet, Shopify allows users to pick from an array of design templates and 1,800 apps to set up a relatively easy to use e-commerce site.Shopify now boasts that its merchants have sold more than $40 billion worth of products using its platforms. And barring an unforeseen pivot, e-commerce sales will only continue to grow.Shares of Shopify skyrocketed from $41.63 a share a year ago to hit a new all-time high of $118.60 a share on Monday.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

923,PEP,"U.S. equity markets are going through turbulent times. There is a lot of volatility and uncertainty owing to rising geopolitical risks and political uncertainty. This has increased the appeal for dividend investing.Geopolitical RisksNorth Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test, that of a hydrogen bomb, which can be mounted on an Inter Continental Ballistic Missile, on Sep 3, 2017. Kim Jong-Un’s actions have created huge unrest in a number of Asian economies and the United States.U.S. President Donald Trump has been suggesting that Kim Jong-Un’s threats will be met with military actions if he threatens to harm U.S. territories or any of its allies. US ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, said that North Korea is “begging for war” and has urged the U.N. to impose strictest sanctions on the rogue nation (read: Safe Haven Currency ETFs Gain, Dollar Loses Amid Geopolitical Uncertainty).Political RisksThere is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s ability to pass the promised legislations relating to tax reform and deregulation. Although economic fundamentals have been strong, there are renewed doubts over the capabilities of the Trump administration.Economic growth in the United States was better than initially expected by the markets. Per the Commerce Department, economic growth was 3% in second-quarter 2017 compared with its earlier estimate of 2.6% (read: ETFs to Watch on Oil Price Rise and Debt Limit Deal).However, in a latest show of bipartisanship, Trump sided with the Democrats, to increase the debt ceiling and fund the government till mid-December. This came as a disappointment for fellow Republicans, who were pushing for a longer extension. Hours before the deal was passed Paul Ryan stated that a shorter debt limit extension would give the Democrats immense leverage over the Republicans, once the debate starts all over again in mid-December.In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increase when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit less volatility as they are stable and mature companies.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report)This fund is a low-cost ETF that seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends.It has AUM of $30.8 billion and charges a fee of 8 basis points a year.

The fund has returned 9.16% in a year and 8.56% year to date (as of Sep 7, 2017).

924,PEP,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the cola giant delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.27%.However, Coca-Cola surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 1.51%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCoca-Cola’s first-quarter revenues declined 11% year over year due to currency headwinds and negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 10% impact on revenues, while currency headwinds hurt sales by 1%. The company’s soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 17–18% in net revenue from acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items. The company also expects currency headwinds to hurt the quarterly net revenues by 1–2%.The company’s revenues declined for the last eight consecutive quarters primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category. Coca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets and shift in consumer preference.That said, Coca-Cola is taking aggressive cost-cutting and strategic measures to mitigate the impact of lower sales and weak volumes. Adjusted consolidated gross margins expanded 120 basis points (bps) year over year to 61.3% in the first quarter of 2017, as currency headwinds were offset by positive pricing and productivity gains. We expect to witness similar trends in the to-be reported quarter as well.Coming to the company’s bottom line, i.e. EPS, Coca-Cola’s earnings decreased 4.4% in the first quarter 2017. The downside was primarily due to higher interest expenses, resulting from additional long-term debt issued in the quarter as well as in the second and third quarters of 2016. Coca-Cola’s first quarter of 2017 interest expenses were also higher due to interest rate swaps on the company’s fixed-rate debt.As revealed earlier, Coca-Cola expects net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items to have a headwind of 3–4% on profits before taxes in the to-be-reported quarter. Currency fluctuations are anticipated to have an adverse impact of 3% on quarterly profits before taxes. However, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 58 cents, reflecting a 4.1% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the projected sales growth for the current year is pegged at $9.75 billion, implying a 15.5% decrease.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Coca-Cola is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 57 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 58 cents.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuotePeer ReleasePepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in second-quarter 2017 (ending Jun 17), with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

925,PEP,"With more consumers inclining toward healthy offerings, companies in the Consumer Staples sector are gradually widening their organic product assortments. Sources revealed that Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report) is on track to acquire Hiball – manufacturer of healthy, clean and premium energy drinks as well as a provider of organic sparkling water and juices under its Alta Palla brand.Terms of the transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017, remained under covers. Notably, the organic food space has witnessed compound annual growth rate of 15.3% in the last four years, and currently boasts a market worth over $11 billion in the country.  How will Hiball’s Buyout Impact BUD?Based in San Francisco, Hiball was founded a little over a decade back. With a perfect mix of guarana, ginseng, caffeine and certain important vitamins, the company’s energy drinks and sparkling water fall in line with today’s changing trends. As consumers’ demand for healthy, natural and energy-boosting products is growing considerably, Hiball has generated sales worth roughly $40 million over the past one year, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.The introduction of Hiball’s brands is likely to enhance AB InBev’s products portfolio and solidify its network by offering innovative products. Thus, we believe that Hiball’s addition to AB InBev’s will augment the latter’s top line. On the other hand, the move will benefit Hiball by solidifying its customer base, while maintaining its brand culture and focus on organic ingredients.AB InBev’s Portfolio Diversification On TrackHiball’s acquisition marks another milestone in AB InBev’s commitment toward portfolio diversification. Given the accelerated shift toward low and no alcohol products, the company remains focused on undertaking new ventures to meet changing consumer demand. Incidentally, this world’s largest brewer teamed up with Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) last year to provide Teavana, a ready-to-drink tea. Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.’s  deal with Bai Brands (low-calorie, coffee-fruit drinks maker) and Pepsico, Inc. ’s (PEP  -  Free Report) buyout of KeVita Inc. (producer of fermented probiotic and kombucha beverages) are evidence of other beverage players expanding into the fast-growing healthy and wellness categories.Coming back to AB InBev, this Belgian brewer keeps coming up with near beer alternatives along with no- and low-alcohol beers to provide greater choices to consumers. In fact, management expects the low and no-alcohol beer category to account for about 20% of its global beer volumes by 2025. Also, AB InBev is expanding its presence in the craft beer space, which further underscores its practice of exploiting all possible growth opportunities.These endeavors have helped this Budweiser owner to carve an impressive niche, thus emerging as the strongest player in the beer space. Also, these factors have led this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock to rise 9.6% so far this year, falling in line with the sector it belongs to. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

926,PEP,"A small handful of multinational conglomerates seemingly own almost every major consumer packaged goods brand, food company, or restaurant chain—yet some big-name brands and firms have managed to survive, sometimes for decades, all on their own.Nestle (NSRGY  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Unilever (UN  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), and an array other firms dominate consumer-facing industries, snatching up brands left and right. The reach of these multibillion-dollar companies is greater than ever, especially as some of the largest companies begin to join forces in order to compete long-term on a grand scale.But there will always be companies that avoid being swallowed up by brands for various reasons, especially if their stocks are performing well and their bottom lines continue to grow.Now let’s look at four companies that are almost certainly household names throughout the U.S. that many people might find hard to believe are still their own publicly traded firms.Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. Little tiny Tootsie Rolls have been staples in Halloween baskets for decades. But the candy company’s success might make investors think it got scooped up by a candy giant, such as Mars, years ago. On the contrary, Tootsie Roll has turned into a bit of a powerhouse itself.The company now boasts an array of different candy brands—from Blow Pop and Caramel Apple Pops to Dots and even Junior Mints. With a market cap of $2.38 billion, shares of Tootsie Roll have climbed steadily in recent years. The candy power’s stock now sits just a few dollars below its all-time high of $40.44 per share and has popped from under $20 a share just over five years ago.The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report)Like Tootsie Roll, Clorox has turned itself into a bit of a conglomerate. The cleaning company’s brands include Green Works, Pine-Sol, Glad, 409, and others. With a market cap of nearly $17 billion, the company is certainly not small and wouldn’t be easily acquired, but with giants such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) out there lurking, it is a testament to the company’s strength that it still stands on its own.The company, which has been around for more than 100 years, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but earned an “A” for Growth in our Style Scores system. Shares of Clorox have soared over the last decade and have gained 9.40% since the start of the year.Nathan's Famous, Inc. The host of the famous 4th of July hot dog eating contest has been churning out cased-meats since 1916. Nathan’s Famous is a small cap company with a market cap of around $310 million, and it has seen its stock price do a 360-degree turn in just the last two years. Nathan’s stock sat at an all-time high of over $81 per share in 2015 before it sank to $30 a share. Shares then climbed back slowly and now rest at around $74.The company owns a line of grocery store dogs, burgers, fries, and pickles, as well as a chain of restaurants, yet it has not been scarfed up by big chains such as Yum! Brands.Hostess Brands, Inc. (TWNK  -  Free Report)This iconic maker of Twinkies, Ho Hos, and others screams Americana. It is hard to believe that Hostess Brands has not been bought by a big CPG company, but, it in fact, just recently went public.Hostess Brands was almost bankrupt less than a decade ago, then two investment firms bought the company out of liquidation in 2013. The company then went public in 2016. With a market cap of $1.78 billion, the newly public snack maker’s stock price has fared well. Shares of the company that has been around since before the Great Depression gained a modest 6.15% since the start of the year, but Hostess Brands is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

927,PEP,"Sales for beverage giant PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) have remained subdued in recent quarters due to growing health and wellness consciousness as well as currency headwinds. PepsiCo’s shares have evidently sunk approximately 4% in the last three months. Nonetheless, the company is leaving no stone unturned to reinvigorate investors’ confidence and regain its footing by innovations and diversifications.Key Growth DriversPepsiCo’s distinctiveness in the soft drinks space lies in the fact that it holds a balanced portfolio of both snacks and beverages, which are complementary food categories. Salty snacks and liquid refreshment beverages have extremely high co-purchase incidence more than any other commonly purchased items. The complementary portfolio results in cost leverage, capability sharing, cross-category promotions and other commercial benefits.Changing demographics and purchasing behaviors make it important for any beverage giant to understand and capitalize on main consumer insights that identify growing trends. Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company in 2017.For this, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier “Everyday Nutrition Products.” These products contain nutrients such as grains, fruits, vegetables, or protein, and the portfolio falls under a broader category of “Guilt Free Products."" The company now generates 45% of its revenues from this category, which also comprises beverages with less sugar and sodium content.Now, good-for-you products and bottled water are gradually gaining traction amid the shift in consumers’ preferences. Coconut water has become a prime alternative to coolers across North America and Europe. Consequently, in North America, the company launched LIFEWTR in Jan 2017, a premium bottled water, PH balanced, with electrolytes for added taste. Again, in 2016, PepsiCo acquired a sparkling probiotic U.S. drinks company, KeVita, thereby diversifying its soft drinks portfolio amid slowing soda sales. The addition of KeVita will expand PepsiCo’s health and wellness offerings in the premium chilled beverage space.Furthermore, the company has stepped up productivity and cost-saving initiatives to boost profitability by reducing overall costs.Importantly, to preserve investors’ confidence in the stock, PepsiCo has increased dividend for 45 consecutive years that includes a dividend hike of 7% in 2017.ChallengesIt goes without saying that consumer tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. .Though PepsiCo has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost the carbonated beverage business, no meaningful improvement has been seen yet. The company’s CSD volumes were down 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017.Meanwhile, foreign exchange (Fx) is a major headwind for PepsiCo with around 39% of its revenues coming from outside the United States. Though the company now anticipates Fx to have less negative impact on core earnings than previously expected, it is expected to hurt 2017 revenues and earnings per share by 2%.Bottom LineGoing forward, we expect the company's efforts toward offering more products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat, along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives will help fight revenue woes.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

928,PEP,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has a possibility to take over the renowned energy drink maker Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST  -  Free Report), according to founder of The Street, Jim Cramer. Meanwhile, Monster Beverage’s shares scaled a new 52-week high of $56.44 on Aug 31, finally ending the day’s trading a tad lower at $55.82.Coca-Cola had already acquired a 16.7% stake in Monster Beverage on Jun 12, 2015. Hence, according to Cramer, Monster Beverage is a possible buyout choice for Coca-Cola as the company has also been focusing on portfolio expansion in order to gain a competitive edge in the U.S. beverage space.Furthermore, Coca-Cola’s new CEO, James Quincey is known for his motivation in expanding the company’s brand through acquisitions.In the U.S. beverage space, Coca-Cola along with other major soft drink makers like Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  have been facing carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category headwinds for some time now.Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness have resulted in a drastic shift in consumer demand toward healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters. Consumer’s watchfulness over the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content has dented sales for companies belonging to the beverage industry.In fact, Coca-Cola’s second-quarter 2017 revenues declined 16% year over year to $9.7 billion, marking the ninth consecutive quarterly decline in revenues.Year to date, shares of Coca-Cola have underperformed the industry. The company’s shares have rallied 9.8% as compared with the industry’s 14.1% gain.Notably, new taxes levied on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressure are affecting CSD sales for Coca-Cola. In order to navigate such challenges, it is necessary for the company to diversify its portfolio by tacking on other healthier energy drink makers like Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage drinks are healthier options and keeps up with changing consumer preferences. New innovative mutant soft drink, known as “super soda,” has considerably drove revenues and profits in the last quarter from the year-ago quarter for Monster Beverage.However, Coca-Cola’s strategic efforts in enhancing its portfolio as a total beverage company are encouraging. Takeover of Monster Beverage can therefore prove beneficial in terms of revenue growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

929,PEP,"Soft drinks giants PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) are no strangers to the vagaries of the war on sugar. Sales for both beverage giants have remained subdued in recent quarters and the two have vowed to find ways of diversifying their portfolio beyond carbonated soft drinks or CSDs and revamping existing product lines.Changing demographics and purchasing behaviors make it important for beverage giants to understand and capitalize on main consumer insights that identify growing trends. Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company in 2017.Continuing decline in CSDs and impressive growth in noncarbonated beverages are creating headaches for many established players like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. , leading to lower volumes and weak sales. Among CSDs, the cola segment particularly has been facing challenges as consumers are opting for alternatives. Also, potential new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales.Despite these challenges, the two cola behemoths are at the top of the food and beverage industry. The bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 34 carried by the Zacks Soft Drinks industry testifies that the industry is in fine fettle. An impressive rank places the industry in the top 13% of the 250+ groups enlisted.Now, within the industry, despite both companies boasting strong business lines and solid growth prospects, PepsiCo with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) looks comparatively better as an investment option than the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Coca-Cola. Below we will substantiate our reasoning. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Head-to-HeadAs we jump into our head-to-head comparison of PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, let’s check out a few key stats from both the companies.Price PerformancePepsiCo has gained 11.1% so far this year, while Coca-Cola’s shares have increased 9.6%. While both stocks have outperformed the broader market (S&P 500) over the same period, PepsiCo clearly scores over Coca-Cola.Valuation MetricsGoing by the trailing 12-month Price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, both stocks are a tad overvalued, as is evident from their P/E ratios compared with the industry. P/E ratios for PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are 23.06 and 24.15, respectively, while the industry’s is 24.78. PepsiCo’s shares look a shade cheaper compared with Coca-Cola.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12 months for PepsiCo and Coca-Cola is 59.7% and 34.5%, respectively. While both stocks have scored above the industry’s level of 2.7%, PepsiCo has an edge here.Estimate Revisions & Growth ExpectationsOver the past 60 days, PepsiCo’s estimates for the current year has edged up 0.4% to $5.15 per share. On the other hand, Coca-Cola’s estimates for the current year have increased 1.1% over the same period to $1.90.The expected earnings per share growth rate for PepsiCo for the current year stands at 6.3% compared with 0.7% expected decline for Coca-Cola. Also, PepsiCo has an expected long-term earnings growth of 7.4%, higher than Coca-Cola’s 6.2%.Propelling the earnings forward is the companies’ revenue growth story. Clearly, PepsiCo’s projected sales growth for the current year is 1.4% better than Coca-Cola’s average of 16.2% decline. As such, PepsiCo is a clear winner in terms of earnings as well as revenue growth expectations.Dividend YieldCoca-Cola has a slight advantage over PepsiCo in terms of dividend payouts. Dividends are usually, but not always, an indication of solid financial health. Coca-Cola has a current dividend yield of 3.23%, better than PepsiCo's 2.72%.Final ThoughtsGoing by the statistics, PepsiCo certainly has an edge over Coca-Cola in terms of ROE, earnings and revenue growth expectations, price performance and valuation.PepsiCo surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates by a higher percentage compared with Coca-Cola in the trailing four quarters. Again, both the companies boast strong brand recognition, focus on product innovation and a huge international presence, which is likely to drive growth, going forward.Other Key PickApart from PepsiCo, investors interested in the beverage industry may also consider Coca-Cola European Partners Plc (CCE  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1.Coca-Cola European Partners has an expected earnings growth of 17.9% for the current year.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

930,PEP,"The recent health campaign to prevent diabetes in Singapore gained strength when seven major beverage companies including The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Nestle pledged to bring down the amount of sugar in their products to 12% or lower by 2020.To mitigate health risks such as diabetes, obesity and so on, many western nations have taken measures like raising taxes on sugar-rich products. Singapore, one of the first such countries in Asia, has adopted similar measures to target sweetened drinks and raise health awareness.Increasing awareness promoted by the governments of different Asian countries along with a global shift in preference toward healthier consumption has been proving to be a challenge for the beverage industry of late. Moreover, the trend in the global beverage business has been sluggish due to lower demand for carbonated soft drinks or CSDs and artificial sweeteners. To counter these challenges, beverage firms have been reworking on their recipes with the aim of coming up with healthier products with lower sugar content.Singapore-based Yeo Hiap Seng and F&N Foods, Malaysia Dairy Industries and Japan’s Pokka have also decided on pledging to the same. According to the health ministry of Singapore, these seven companies manufacture 70% of pre-packaged sweetened drinks in the country and can bring about a reduction in sugar consumption of approximately 330 US tons (or 300,000 kilograms) a year.In an attempt to meet the changing needs of consumers, 80% of PepsiCo’s drinks in Singapore already contain 12%or lesser of added sugar. The company last year planned to cut sugar in its products globally so that two-thirds of its products would have less than 100 calories per 12 ounce by 2025.Coca-Cola also pledged to cut sugar in more than 500 of its drinks this year. According to the company, 30%of its 3,900 beverages contain negligible amount of sugar and 97% of its products sold in Singapore, including the eponymous soda, have less than 12% sugar.However, the impact of the pledge is yet to be seen as most beverage companies have argued that their products already have low sugar levels. Nevertheless, the active measures being taken by the beverage industry might help address sugar-related health issues.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCoca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Pepsico carries Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other stocks to consider in the same industry are Coca-Cola European Partners PLC (CCE  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy),and New Age Beverage Corporation (NBEV  -  Free Report) carryingwith a Zacks Rank #2.You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Coca-Cola European Partners’ current year earnings are expected to increase 17.9%.The current year earnings of New Age Beverage are expected to increase 205.0%.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

932,PEP,"Monster Beverage Corporation’s (MNST  -  Free Report) strong product portfolio, strategic deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and focus on innovation are encouraging.Monster Beverage offers a wide range of products under the energy drinks category. Energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Net sales at the segment, comprising Monster Energy drinks as well as Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 9.6% in 2016 and 8.7% in the first half of 2017. Thus, a portfolio based on energy drinks should continue to drive the company’s top line.Product innovation plays a huge role in the company’s success. There is consistent demand for new products that are appetizing as well as healthy. The company regularly introduces new flavors of existing products, while removing non-performing ones.Monster Beverage launched a number of products in the first half of 2017 and has several new products lined up for launch in the remaining of 2017. In April, the company launched a Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, followed by launches in 21 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and South Africa in July 2017. Notably, these new products will benefit from the broader distribution network from the deal.Also, Monster Beverage’s products enjoy greater exposure, courtesy of the strategic deal with Coca-Cola.

(PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc .Moreover, though the U.S. dollar has recently softened against other currencies, the impact is still significant.

933,PEP,"McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to revitalize its McCafe brand. In this regard, the company is focusing on new cafe-quality espresso beverages, extended retail offerings and a branding overhaul to gain ground in the battle for the nation's coffee drinkers.Inside the HeadlinesIn addition to recrafted lattes and mochas, the company has added a new set of espresso-based beverages to the McCafe lineup that are made with freshly-ground espresso and US-sourced whole or nonfat milk. The three new beverages include caramel macchiato, cappuccino and americano.Notably, these new offerings along with all McCafe specialty beverages will be available for $2 for a limited time at the participating restaurants.  Also, the company recently inked a deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) to bring a line of ready-to-drink McCafe Frappe beverges to groceries across the United States in early 2018. The bottled drinks will come in three flavors that include caramel, vanilla and mocha.Currently, the fast food chain maintains a line of whole bean, ground and single-serve coffee in retail stores. Therefore, this will be McDonalds’ first foray into the nearly $2 billion ready-to-drink coffee category.Apart from the coffee upgrades, McDonald's also announced a McCafe brand revamp with the introduction of a new brand logo and packaging that will change with the seasons. In fact, as part of its evolving Experience of the Future initiative, the company also plans to transform its in-restaurant McCafe presence with a sleek and contemporary look in 2018.Furthermore, the company has brought in new coffee makers into its stores so that the new espresso-based beverages are handcrafted with a steady, appetizing flavor. The rollout to nearly all of McDonald's 14,000 restaurants is accompanied by new training for crew members.Rationale BehindWith its refined new beverages and updated branding, the company aims to capitalize on the growing coffee culture among customers and meet their demand in terms of taste, convenience and value. In October 2016, the company had stated that it would be buying all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. Elevating its coffee business has thus become an essential part of its growth strategy amid escalating demand for the same and continual pressure on the food sales.Markedly, McDonald's launched the coffee brand McCafe in the United States in 2009. Though McCafe generates nearly $4 billion in sales annually in the country, it has the scope to fare much better. In fact, this is just the start to its McCafe commitment with more transformations in store.Moreover, by bringing bottled McCafe drinks to store shelves, the company aims to keep up with rival Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.’s (DNKN  -  Free Report) Dunkin’ Donuts that signed similar deal with Coca Cola last year, and coffee giant Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), which sells its bottled Frappuccinos in partnership with Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and has for long dominated the ready-to-drink coffee space.Bottom LineMcDonald’s shares have gained 23.5% over the past six months, outpacing 9% growth of the industry it belongs to.In fact, growing guest count remains McDonald’s top priority and it is undertaking various sales and digital initiatives to this end. The company has thus been simplifying menus, offering value meals, rolling out all-day breakfast in the United States, focusing on delivery to provide increased convenience and taking steps to meet consumer preference for quality food.By elevating and leveraging the McCafe coffee brand, the company aims to further raise the bar for guests and convert casual diners to loyal customers.Additionally, we note that ever since jumping into the coffee fray, McDonald's has gained from pricing its beverages far lower than its direct coffee competitors. Thus, the new drinks and expansion into retail is likely to add to McDonald’s top line and may perhaps prove to be challenging for its close competitors.McDonald's currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

937,PEP,"On Tuesday, markets celebrated one of the best sessions in months. Gains came on the back of reports that Trump’s core team had taken crucial steps toward framing a tax reforms package. Skepticism over  chances of such proposals gaining legislative passage continues to exist. But investors seem to be clued in on the idea, since its one they haven’t priced in yet.If such tax reforms are indeed implemented, one of the key beneficiaries would be companies with substantial overseas cash reserves. Trump has promised to offer such companies a lower one-time rate on their offshore earnings. Investing in leading companies which are part of the S&P 500 and set to gain from this proposal surely makes for a smart move at this point.Focus Shifts to Tax ReformA Politico magazine article on Tuesday claimed that President Trump, his close associates and his legislative leadership have made substantial progress toward framing tax reform proposals. Several options related to both individual and business taxation are being discussed at this point. These include proposals to impose restrictions on deductions for mortgage interest payments and abolish interest deductions for businesses.New proposals are also likely to propose deductions for investments made by small businesses on new facilities and equipment. Of course, a great degree of skepticism exists about the Trump administration’s ability to push through such a plan. The White House continues to deal with a raft of controversies, the most recent of which is Trump’s heavily criticized response to the events at Charlottesville.Corporate Tax Proposals at an AdvantageStrategas Research Partners’ head of policy Daniel Clifton believes that more progress has been made on proposals related to corporates. Clifton hinted that rules for individuals may not see much tinkering at this stage, with a mortgage deduction proposal likely to be excluded. Instead a lower rate of corporate tax is likely to be put forward.  This would apply to both domestic and overseas earnings.Additionally, deductions for foreign companies with U.S. operations on items such as rent and interest are likely to be abolished. The idea behind new corporate proposals is to cut existing rates and counterbalance such a move by doing away with deductions. Clifton added that there have been discussions around abolishing interest deductions on corporate debt as well. But he believed that ultimately only a small cut in the amount that may be deducted may come about.Companies with Overseas Reserves to BenefitAt this stage, reports and discussions around tax reforms on overseas profits center on a cut in rates. But what had caught investor imagination at a point earlier in the year, and is likely to do so again, is Trump’s proposal of “deemed repatriation” rates. Such a proposal envisioned a one-time rate of 10% on overseas earnings, far lower than the 35% rate which would normally apply.Cash repatriated in such a manner could be utilized for the purposes of dividends, buybacks, capital expenditure and acquisitions. The most prominent beneficiaries of such a proposal would be tech behemoths from the U.S. According to Bloomberg, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) alone hold a combined $427 billion of cash overseas.Our ChoicesThe proposal to offer an attractive one time rate or even a lower rate of tax on overseas cash reserves is likely to benefit a number of companies. Those with the largest cash piles stand to gain the most of course. The likely impact of such a proposal can be gleaned from the fact that the top 50 overseas cash hoarders from the S&P 500 together hold $925 billion overseas, according to Bloomberg.This is nearly $118 billion more than the amount held a year ago. Picking stocks from the S&P 500 likely to gain from such a proposal makes for a profitable option at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) posted impressive second-quarter fiscal 2018 results and provided encouraging third-quarter revenue guidance.

943,PEP,"Rising health consciousness has been a drag on cola giants. The low-carb diet may be in the best interest of people, but it is terrifying for the many in the beverage industry. Still, two cola and food behemoths – Coca Cola Co. (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) – have made decent progress this year on the back of healthy variations in their offerings and a subdued greenback. KO and PEP are up over 10% and 12%, respectively, so far this year (as of July 26, 2017).Let’s delve a little deeper into their Q2 earnings results and see if the stocks could add more gains ahead (read: 4 ETFs to Ride on 16-Year High Consumer Confidence). Results in Detail On July 26, Coca-Cola reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results.

944,PEP,"The Q2 earnings season is off to a flying start, courtesy of broad-based performance across most sectors. Although earnings growth is trending lower than in comparable periods, total earnings are likely to be on par or even better than the all-time high achieved in fourth-quarter 2016. It appears that the equity markets have dispelled the recent skepticism about President Trump’s ability to deliver on his pro-growth promises.     As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screen:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report): Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products.
